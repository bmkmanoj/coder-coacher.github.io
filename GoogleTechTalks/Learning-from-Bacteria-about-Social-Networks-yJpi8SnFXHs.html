pleasure to host professor Eshel Ben
Jakob and Zhang Gil who helped us
arrange this I mean zan is our friend
for a long time she runs the microbes in
mind forum which I do recommend that you
look it up using your favorite search
engine and you will find a lot of
interesting information on her website
University where he is
he holds the Maggie Goss chair of
physics and as past president of the
Israel Physical Society the significance
of his work is that he has uncovered
basic principles and physics that have a
broad range of applications so he's not
only co-developed the first hybrid
neural memory chip which was named by
Scientific American as one in 2007 as
one of the 50 most important
achievements in all fields of science
and technology for that year he his
principles have been applied in such
diverse areas as neural networks in the
brain the immune system search
next-generation search via social
networks and stock market volatility and
collapse so we're really looking forward
to what he has to say and to your
questions and please put your comments
also on the sign up okay thank you
morning to everybody it's not going to
be a formal talk so please ask questions
during the lecture so let's go
okay so just introduction and people
like to think about themselves so the
first thing is to show you something
that we can define as clashes of other
mental intelligence what you're going to
see here happens in this very moment in
the body of each and every one of you
these are red blood cells this is a
white blood cell this is a bacterium the
white blood cell wants soup eat the
bacterium the bacterium would like to
survive so now you see what happens and
try to see that it runs away but try to
figure out if it really runs away knows
what it's doing or just making a random
walk okay to help you there will be
another bacterium that will be here on
the side which is not changed and then
look what it does okay
so let's play the movie
the music is not going inside your body
now
sorry about that I forgot that there are
some words that not supposed to be
mentioned on the nutriyum but since this
move is from YouTube I guess it's okay
now what you saw here that it's running
away the bacterium it's funny but it's
very serious because it means that the
bacterium is able to sense chemicals or
sometimes even rippers form by the white
blood cell keep memory of what happens
before pauses the information and react
accordingly if you notice from time to
time it makes 90 degrees angle
run away at the same time the white
blood cell has to be able to sense
chemicals secreted by the bacterium have
memory processing information and react
accordingly and you can play games like
this when I say game it requires some
work to model the motion of the white
blood cells I don't have time to get
into it but some movies like this that
the chasing and you see this is the case
that eventually it will win some of you
might hear that one of the leading has
problem in the world is the fact that we
have multiple drug resistance bacteria
and this is one of the highest-risk
on our house this is on one hand on the
other hand bacteria are also our best
friends some of you don't know although
here you have some nice food healthy
food but bacteria in our guts pauses
eventually the food we would not be able
to live without the bacteria in our guts
they also communicate with our brain
they decompose all of our waste products
and so on and so forth but let's talk
about the risk of bacteria and what we
realize in last year's is that bacteria
strike back after the era that we saw
that with antibiotics we can get rid of
all the bacteria cause diseases all of a
sudden will these diseases reappear and
the death rate in hospitals in the West
from bacteria is number three in the
West ok so how come we just saw how the
white blood cell one how can it be
apparently we overlooked something when
we treated bacteria and what we did is a
basic mistake that people do when they
have clashes
we undermined the capabilities of our
opponent and what I try to convince you
is that bacteria form social networks
not only one colony form a big social
network but different colonies of
different species from social networks
and they form social network long before
Google appeared they form social
networks all over the globe when we
develop antibiotic it takes us about
five seven years hundred millions of
dollars the bacteria develop the
resistance within a year or two and they
share the resistance in cassettes
genetic cassettes called plasmids to
other bacteria all over the globe we see
in a year or two okay so let's just
introduce you to bacteria and the wisdom
of the colony what you see here as I
mentioned before it's supposed to be a
circle okay this is real life the
pattern is the real pattern
the colors are artistic colors that I
change or translated the colors from
blue to dark blue to light blue to red
and white these are high concentration
and the red is no concentration
inoculate the bacteria here this is a
stain that I discovered and then they
expand outward this strain is
specialized in moving on very hard
surfaces what you see here are many
things that discussed here but to give
you an idea or to shock you is that this
is about 14 centimeter
or six inches the size of a bacterium is
about one micron the number of bacterial
cells here is about hundred times the
number of people on earth and each one
is both an actor and a spectator in this
big global village which is many fold
larger than the number of people on
earth and they all know what they're
doing you see how symmetric it is they
send this pioneering parties that I show
you in a second this pioneering party
are also the production organ of the
bacteria there are bacteria that turn
around like Mary goes around and this
way they pave the way for the rest of
the colony to expand and let's look some
in at the beginning when they just start
you see each bar here is an unboxing on
the rate is real rate and the
magnifications is Han is 500 time
magnification this is from a movie I
have to mention that I made for the BBC
so I can take extract from it and some
affair the sound that you learn here
it's not my sound but English
go up their ability to organize and
attempt to change explains why bacteria
threaten our health even when we use
antibiotics against them it also
explains why they've made such a good
job of colonizing the rest of the world
from deep in the Earth's crust to the
edge of space maybe even beyond bacteria
as small bugs all right
the last part that you saw here is not
real time but is accelerated one times
sixty one to sixty
okay this is how they go the same
bacteria on a very hot surface so they
have to work as a group and pave the way
if you go them on a surface which is not
so hard this bacteria I forgot to
mention they are also lubricating
bacteria in order to move on the surface
they have to secrete lubricant that
enables them to swim together and that's
yeah good question this or not they form
the rotation is innate rotation they
it's not due to the magnetic field on
earth there are some magnetotactic
bacteria that are sensitive to the
magnetic field and they behave
differently in the north and the south
and a sphere okay okay when you go them
on a surface which is not so hard what
they do instead of having these groups
pioneering group that paved the way they
send swans okay I'm sure that many here
because we are in California our motto
manners so I'll give you an idea of this
one that you see what happens okay so
this is a swarm to get the perspective
to human being each dot is one bacterium
so think about it that this is a swarm
of the group of thousands or hundreds of
thousand to form a marathon runners
because they move quite fast they move
at the speed of about ten second
400-meter in order to move they have to
pave the way so all this much
I'll take buckets of oil maybe scatter I
should say that they put down and they
move that's what keeps them together
this is just a free motion that I show
you and then I show you what happens
when they find food in the vicinity okay
so look at the motion the motion is
quite complex you see some come here go
back come from here and go back and this
huge swarm is moving on okay now let's
see if they're really smart what does it
mean really smart let's go to the next
thing now they move along and what I do
I add here a food source think about it
that each one of the Mazon 1s is also
blind you cannot see that there is a
pizza stand about let's say five miles
away okay what they can do is smell the
pizza in its local location and
calculate the changes in the smell and
communicate with the other guy now so
this is the slow moving and you see what
happened now for you to be able to think
freely as they say I tell you that in
order to do what they do
you must have collective or distributed
information processing and social
networking by chemically treating okay
so now let's see what they do so you add
this in okay so the food diffuses then
located they move takes them some time
they don't carry laptops with them
so text them some time to do the
processing okay and they go and go and
slow
whereas something is going on and then
collectively hope they go to the food
now think about it I don't know here in
the US but in Israel if we will have a
book like this of Martin on us there
will be pizza and they smell the pizza
they all rush over and there will be a
big mess here they have to coordinate
because in order to make this turn
the bacteria over here have to
communicate with the bacteria over here
and all of them there are ones which a
further way have to run faster
so the entire swarm will turn yeah okay
that's an excellent question one of the
special things about the bacteria and
that's maybe why it is so important for
social networking that we see right now
in the world human being now tried to
imitate the bacteria there is no leader
they all change but which see later
there is a distribution of tasks so each
one can play every wall but one day play
a wall there is a distribution of tasks
cell differentiation and the maintain it
over some time but there is no play born
leader or elected leader although there
are some bacteria and some condition
that are differentiate between
adventures and socha does that like to
take risk and those that try to stay
back yeah there are communication hubs
that in the picture that I showed before
that you have these centers some of the
center is communication hub they are
less active in looking for food eating
and reproducing so they invest less in
reproduction and more in communication
now the older one that stay there in the
colony at the beginning and then
messages to the kids how to behave
themselves and if they get messages over
there there is antibiotic what they do
they tell the colony move over there but
we'll come to it okay thanks for the
question very important yeah I don't
remember who was yeah
in some cases we know in many cases we
do not I will mention it along the
lecture further on the boundary because
this what define the boundary is there's
a crate lubricant and this is again I
show they are smart enough to secrete
the lubricant that will not be that will
be sufficiently viscous so it will form
a boundary okay so let's move on now
that we decided when I was young I was
interested in philosophy so I knew about
this dilemma of choice it is very
popular that you give a donkey two
pieces of wood not spinach but and then
it cannot decide which one to eat any
died from hunger we try to imitate the
same thing for bacteria now it sounds
like a simple experiment relative to the
high-tech experiments that people do
nowadays but it is not when you have a
swim like this moving under the
microscope you want to put two pieces of
food and the right aid this stands the
right amount it's hard sometimes the
kitchen look a bit messy and luckily so
because what we discover is something
that we didn't expect
so you have two pieces of food here and
then we dropped something here and the
little pieces here and what we expected
to see that the swarm will go over here
and then go over here instead the
bacteria turn out to be smarter so first
they behave like we expected but then
there was a change they even noticed
this little piece here and the notice
this little piece far away and look what
they do good yeah this is something the
most one of the most exciting thing I
ever saw and we spent and looked at it
and looked at it and looked at it we now
feel that we have some ideas how I
cannot say the hell how the hell they do
it just to show you again in full glory
and then you see that they slow and they
just the food slow down after they have
the food like an animal that's swallow
missing okay these are the messages
bacteria are smart and communicating
based unlike people thought before
advanced communication their
communication is very advanced I show
you those of you that we live later on
I'll show that for one type of decision
they use twelve different messages and
they form messages combination of them
that are far more complex than the tweet
tail messages ahead coffee the coffee
was good or other type of Twitter
messages of 140 characters if you think
about each of the chemical is has a
quite complex structure you have all the
combination of the chemicals of the
messages I say tweeting but it's far
more advanced the usual Twitter messages
and it is important that they
communication that was very hard to
convey that has to do with social
networking that their communication
convey semantic messages meaning not
only information and they carried
dialogue using the communication and
eventually they can make collective make
decisions in a collective way and this
is essentially the communication for the
social intelligence and we see
distribution of tasks distributed the
information processing learning from
experience planning for the future what
a surprise unlike human being societies
they do plan for the future
if you give them a lot of food some
people say they are stupid
some people say they are smart they
don't use all the resources and exhaust
all the resources because they know that
things can change so they keep things
and save for the future in a population
they always keep different type of
different expertise different sectors if
you compare
to society so that if conditions will
change they will have some bacteria that
already expert in facing the new
conditions okay so they always skip this
and they can make collective decision
and they have collective rapid
collective adaptability okay TECO
message to is implication is the power
of social network I show you the power
of cooperation self-organization and I
show example of really what we see now
in society that the session social
networking of the bacteria can lead to
collective identity switch the bacteria
can really the entire colony can change
its identity by changing the identity
those of you with background in biology
epigenetic changes individual bacteria
okay so they really change themselves in
a meaningful way and again the question
that asks before without a leader okay
just read the condition they communicate
and they do it and there are also many
applications there are new strategies to
fight bacteria that we showed once you
understand that they are smart you
understand that in order to fight
bacteria you have to outsmart them
and you find new strategies also to make
the use of bacteria in our guts you can
start understand why eating some subsets
is good for you and some is not as good
for you okay this is something which is
very important our application but new
strategies to fight cancer is something
aggression that we do right now what
happened in society Western society and
other societies in terms of cancer the
situation is very lim innocent what
which was with bacteria people saying
that cancer cells are defective normal
cells with limited capabilities because
they are mutation del defectives so we
did not succeed to fight cancer because
undermined their abilities we now see
many parallelism between tumor and
bacteria we understand the deform meta
communities they have very sophisticated
communication cooperation
decision-making and so on and I'll
reflect on it a little in future later
on new game theory I'll show you that
when they do decision they have smarter
game to it and the game theory that
usually used in mathematics and new
orbits show you how we can do some
people in NASA other places are
interested in robots now to explore new
terrain and I'll show you how we can use
some idea of distributed new robots that
will show some swarming intelligence and
eventually new generation of search
networks so this will be the topics just
the structure now that we know what are
we heading let's talk about simple
example this is a bit different sign of
bacteria so this is a very simple
example because what I do here I give
them a problem the problem is that this
bacteria also it's another sign that I
developed in order to move they need
high density to secrete the fluid they
Doughboy can't but I don't give them
enough food so what they do they make
this branching pattern okay-y by chain
because we've seen a branch the density
is high enough so they can move together
but if you average over the density of
bacteria fits the amount of food that we
have that's the simple thing if you look
at the a here inside you see that they
swimming the swimming itself is quite
fantastic this is real time 500
magnification and you see how this swing
now all these things are you look at it
and say okay they swimming what a big
deal they're swimming well let's look a
bit closer just on this element to share
with you the many things that we can
learn they swim by flagella look at this
this is one micron and this is about can
be certain icons so think about it if I
translate it to human being that you are
one meter between one meter and 2 meter
okay you have a tail of about 50 meters
okay and you move with such a tail by
turning it around you move like this
okay now think about it that each of you
has a tail of about 40 50 meters and now
you have to go like this somewhere what
will happen in one second all these
stairs will be big entangled and you
will not move anyway okay but somehow
you see this is a low density so that
you can see the touch but they can swim
in a high density and still manage to do
it we don't know how to solve this
hydrodynamic problem but we know and
this is important that they move the
tail so for your seconds and then they
unwind the tail the turn around and pick
a new direction random this is how they
do and do more ok so this is the thing
okay so this is in low density how they
do it but they do it in high density as
we saw before okay mathematical
ingenuity one why mathematical ingenuity
because if you would secrete lubricant
in order to move on a hard surface you
would think that you need to secrete low
viscosity lubricant so you can swim
better no but if you secrete low
viscosity you will be the branches will
not be well-defined and they have to set
the level of the viscosity of the
lubricant to be exactly solve this
optimization problem that they
we seen a branch the density would just
be right and then distance between the
branches would just be right yes the
other bacteria and this one it's more
like 1 micron per 1 second
we're such
yeah that was a mention disks this is
running marathon extremely fast
extremely fast okay we'll come back to
it later okay because it will check me
on a different direction but remember
the question and oh okay so but that's
not all they can do I skip this one this
is just to share with you that we also
do equations but we don't want to do you
believe me now
if you lower the level of nutrient a
tiny trend they have something dense
Lonnie do you have something factor like
this and then there is a surprise when
you go to very low nutrient again it's
dense and very thin branches so this is
another challenge that we tried to
understand for a long time and then we
figure out that they have a trick to do
it and the trick is very important to
share with you and this is called
chemotaxis chemotaxis is very important
because it is it was invented by the
bacteria but it used throughout the
kingdom of all animals and that's why it
is nice to learn about it in the case of
swimming bacteria what happens let's say
that they have food over there and we
saw that they do own them work and they
want to bias the walk over there so how
do they do it
what they do remember they go like this
with this tumble so they make a step and
measure the level of smell if you want
the bacteria measure the concentration
of some chemical and then they make
another step and measure it and then
they calculate the difference if they
see that the change in concentration
goes up they makes longer steps in this
direction before the tumble around pick
a new direction measure if it goes down
they tremble before so on average they
have a drift towards the direction of
high concentration this is called
attractive the repulsive which is the
opposite if they see that it goes up
they make shorter steps okay what we
discovered in the early 90s is the
the bacteria use this to do chemotactic
signaling namely they secrete chemicals
that cause the peers to either move
towards them or to move away from them
I'll show you example what I mean they
have good times they have plenty of food
they send chemicals that tell the pill
come over okay help me is the feast and
clean the dishes afterwards if they
don't have enough food or under I
encounter some stress they send
chemicals that tell the peers move away
so there are two elements the additional
type of chemotaxis there is a comet axis
which acts like a Swiss or French cheese
that if you are from a distance it
smells good to you you get closer you
smell it and you repelled okay so there
are all kind of combination of the two
things but this is like remote acess why
it's so important this is the way that
our brain the neurons wired together how
they neurons and processes to connect to
other neuron the u.s. chemotaxis not
only did they use Kimmel Texas the youth
chemotaxis the agents are very similar
to those that been invented by the
bacteria the way that we reproduce the
sperm our swim and navigates toward the
egg it's the same thing they use
chemotaxis in order to do the navigation
a most butterflied moves towards the
female male most butterfly it also used
by chemotaxis the female secrete some
pheromones and they move like this
towards the female so this is something
which is used all over the chemotaxis
the bacteria use it in order to generate
the patterns and if you include it in
the model indeed what you get is
agreement with the result okay now let's
look about at some implications so I
show you this bacteria and I told you
that we have some implication to social
network
so I showed you that they can change the
pattern of the colony fit it adjust it
and so on and so forth
but there are sometimes the despite of
all these things the condition change so
dramatically okay for example the
surface is not that not as hard as it
was before it is a time to a more major
change in the pattern of the behavior
instead of acting individually like
random walk that I showed you before now
because the condition changed they
decide to act in a more organized
fashion and make identity change and
look how bacteria do it so this is the
colony that I showed you branching
simple branching when we go the same
colony start to go it on condition that
the surface is not as hard or that you
put obstacles some mechanical obstacles
or other obstacles you can use
imagination to think how it is
translated to human being situation that
we see around or have been observed
right now in society what you see boom
change in identity
all of a sudden you have something which
is completely different if you look
close there you see that the bacterial
bacterium become longer and they act in
a swimming a much more coordinated
fashion this is how they can go around
obstacle and so on show you another
example different condition it looks a
different way sometimes it's one side
sometimes you can see many bears of all
over with this identity change right
like Tunisia Egypt okay and it's the
same type of identity switch you see
today I'm because in this case it is
imprinted the capability of being
different character is imprinted in the
genome but you have to go through the
genetic change
they become longer the bacteria they
have multiple copies of the home Azam
and many other things if you take this
bacteria now from here and inoculate you
see that under this condition you see
how they look like you see how different
they are the bunch of sinner they have
this handedness Viking symmetry and in
order to have this handedness this end
earnest by the way had them to go around
obstacle and they act in a more
coordinated way ah you can see this is a
little different condition the same
strain and this is transition back from
this type if you take this type and put
it on a very high surface they can make
the transition back to the other pattern
so this is one thing social revolutions
by chemical tweeting I just passing by I
could not resist
to share with you the patterns are so
beautiful if you didn't notice that
there is another angle to the research
second that you can turn it into art but
now the aspect I should change on me so
but it's still beautiful yeah
yeah yeah it's not only original you
have its does not go back the identity
on the same condition there are some set
of condition where you change from one
type to the other and another set of
condition that you change from here to
there right epigenetic and that's very
important also for cancer cells because
now we give chemotherapy for example or
other things they change identity and
then I appear in a different form and
many others so it goes all over many
application this idea and we discover it
in bacteria I'd say was not known the
whole about art it's those of you that
are interested in art and walking here
around with a God I noticed that people
are interested in design so I'll show
you something let me just show this and
I'll take the question you see this is a
black and white color if you color it
change the colors you both have a
district sing into it but it also helped
us in the science because we bring to
our intuition or tension some motifs
that become upon us and then we gives us
a hint how to look for other things so
the art or coloring the colony can be
also very useful in terms of the science
and look how different it is when you
change the colors both it's a very
different perception you can see these
things which are you can see it yourself
and decide yes these are the same
bacteria the ones that their question
was if they are the same bacteria yeah
and that brings back what is the same
you know what does it mean the same
bacteria it's the same genome but the
genome goes through rearrangement and
some changes the fact that the question
before was that you can bring it back to
the previous version means that they are
the same and it's not a mutation okay
it's like cell differentiation in the
body for some sense that you in
principle
can take our skin cell or skin stem cell
and make it into an aural cell okay yeah
it dies because it was so ok so this is
we get into the details and you are
right I'll try to get back to it later
on then before they make the switch they
probably explore these things and I show
example another example of making a
decision making between different things
but they do make a switch sometimes and
die and the ones that make the switch
will not survive okay they also I didn't
reflect on the fact that once you have
cooperation you have also ones that are
the factors that make a switch in order
to take advantage of the other ones and
our successful unless the condition
change and then they are less successful
than the original one so it's not of
going on yeah sure
okay it's epigenetic yeah this
epigenetic the change is not just gene
expression because it's not reversible
like gene expression it's epigenetic
it's mom much more than expression okay
now let's go to social intelligent of
the first sign that I showed you this is
a modular organization and I use this
thing in order to show some of the
notions that we talked about just to
show you each dot here it's a group of
bacteria like this you see that they
turn around this is a red speed and
unification 502 understand how they do
it if you look at this movie and you see
these pictures they both hold hands they
have the flagella and they have polymers
that extend around their hold hands
somewhat like the swim skaters that make
this sound but it's more complicated
because unlike the hands of human being
this hands can be pulled like in the
heart this science fiction movies the
hands can become wrong and short they
are more elastic so they can manipulate
very nicely they have additional
mathematical ingenuity that bacteria
close to the center goes through what is
called presto I hope I'll get time to
talk about it
what is press for later on and it makes
the colony more stable this is some
thing about the bacteria linguistic
communication and social intelligence
the different patterns why they form the
shape we now understand the complex
shape with like the fact that you have
different variety and this high
complexity it's - in general network
another system if you have a complex
system which not the elements are not
all the same and they can change the
character the network as a whole is much
more adaptable if you have changes in
the environment you have stress they can
easily change the overall organization
if you have a society that everybody is
the same the society is very rigid and
is prone to some systemic collapses so
if you have economy everything is the
same and all the investor behaves the
same way the system is spawned to
systemic collapses very important to
maintain viability and in order to
maintain viability you need a
communication so here is an example you
take this colony go on antibiotic you
see that they change the organization
immediately they form higher a larger
vortices like this pioneering group and
they run away from the antibiotics see
how they changed organization if you
then they have learned from experience
after you got them in the presence of
antibiotic they already can go better in
the presence of antibiotic and make
other colonies so this is another
direction to explain how bacteria
develop resistance to antibiotic if you
maintain them expose them all the time
to antibiotic they collectively develop
resistance which been ignored by human
being for about 50 60 years people ask
before this is to show that this is a
epigenetic that you ask or there is
really distribution of tasks and cell
differentiation if you take cells from
here from the center of the colony
inoculate on a plate you get a goes like
this you see two experiments it looks
the same if you take bacteria from here
and inoculate they develop different
pattern we chose you that there is
really a differentiation and they
remember what was the task but still if
you go them under neutral condition they
can go back from here to the same and
from here to be the same yes yes yeah
they can measure signals that are sent
from all over over 30 centimeters they
can sense the signal okay let's run
faster ok so the question that you want
in the decision-making
is to be or not to be under very strong
are stressed starvation the bacteria
have two options one option is to become
sport to generate spoke what does it
mean they replicate the DNA wrap it in a
very special membrane and break open
until better times will arrive this is
one of the risk of bacteria and one of
the great invention of bacteria because
this pore are very resistant there in
ninety six thousand they took sport
bacteria to outer space on a mission
expose them to outer space with no
special closes bottom back to earth and
they germinated but some bacteria do not
form small these are the more
adventurous one what do they do they do
the opposite they become longer make the
membrane permit will so they can absorb
food which is released by the bacteria
that generates poor because those the
generates pole make the spa and the rest
of the bacteria break open
we saw the pieces of DNA and the food
and everything so you have here a game
theory you have to decide what should I
do
be safe becomes poor wait for the future
can be the future ten thousand tears so
whatever Oh
take advantage of the fact that the
other ones chickened out and became
spore now clearly you don't want to
become competence if you don't have
enough that becomes poor so there is a
game to you and it's a collective game
to you it's not between two it's between
a number which is very large now those
that become SPO want to be collectively
they want to form the sport together and
the reason is that when they germinate
the immediately start with a large
society so they are more or less
vulnerable to some hazards in the
environment so this is a game theory and
how do you figure it out and this was a
big great challenge this is closer
picture
oh very nice so you had the challenge of
collective decision-making how do the
game theory that we have right now tell
us about the ceilin making when you have
two individuals should I cooperate or
not cooperate and I get two years in
jail - yes big deal here we're talking
about game theory that either I died or
I don't die okay I die now oh I have to
wait who ever know how long time in the
future for condition to be better and
you have to do it collectively how do
you do it and we found that this was or
many people found that this is a very
essential people try to understand
decision-making on human being but it's
very hard to study decision-making of
human being because it's all subjective
and it's very hard to know what you do
here it's supposed to be simpler in the
bacteria because we know all the genes
so let's talk about decision making at
the time that we have and then I'd show
you some application so first of all if
you think about it what does it mean to
make decision first of all you need to
decide between two options at least or
more okay the other thing is that you
need a switch stochastic switch because
if there is something detached from the
outside that you are in this state or
this state if you are a transistor and
some signal tells you that you are late
one volt or zero volt it's not a
decision although if you look out there
you see some articles talking about
decision making of a transistor so you
have a some stochasticity some
stochastic switch and they have it the
bacteria now if you want it to be
collective this thoracics which means
that you have when it's a specific gene
that itself activator when the level
goes above some level the bacterium
changing to another state now you want
the probability to switch will depend on
the cell density right because you want
that if you have higher density of cells
more likely that some other will go so
spallation so it makes sense to
competence if not not so that's
something which is very well now in
order for this be decision or not just
to Hassocks which you also have to get
the switch so you open the switch it's
all that you make it go to one state or
another but you open the probability to
go from one state to the other at
specific times okay so you have to get
it all the time inhibit it this is a
sign in the network of Fae inhibiting
gated by something so what do you get it
by and we figure out what the bacteria
it's very nice you get it by adjustable
timer
it's another gene that accumulate report
some protein and the way it accumulates
the protein is according to the stress
that and higher the stress this timer
goes fast and only at some levels of
this timer it relieves the gating of the
switch so these are the true basic
elements and the rest of it you want the
stress to be affected this thing you
want higher stress higher rate so what
you want is a competition between two
regulator just about timer is the hostak
switch if you have high stress you know
that you don't want to take risk and do
competence because you might be dead and
you don't care if other people go or
other bacteria go to come spallation so
on you want to make a decision go to
spallation so that's the picture the
main picture now because it's a
collective you also have cell-cell
communication and the social
communication is relatively simple
you send message to the other one how
much you are what is your intention to
go to spallation what are your intention
to go to competence you get messages for
the other one and then you they you
regulate the cell density only according
to the
of those that want to go to spallation
so it's not important only how many sets
there are but how much they incline to
go to spallation so that's the picture
of how you do it I don't get into the
detail but this is what we figure out
and one more thing is the inhibition of
inhibition principle I'll go through
first the decision circuit you have
combination between the gating and the
way that you do the gating is such a way
that you give yourself a window of four
stations think about yourself when you
make a decision to go out of the lecture
right now or not okay so it's Boeing so
it's you incline mode to go out but
maybe something will be interesting so
maybe I should stay there are people out
there reminds you that there is lunch
time okay so all these things have to do
with I get a circuit which is very very
simple it will look for you because you
are not used to G network something
complicated but all that it does is you
gate you inhibit a switch and then this
one inhibit another inhibit the
inhibitor think about it if you want to
take do something crazy to take the risk
to go to competence
what do you have you have in addition to
take the risk what do you need in order
to do this to make a decision to take a
risk you have something that will
inhibit your inhibition that's the idea
but you want this thing to inhibit your
inhibition according to the context of
what the others are doing
ok that's the idea so now we will go
fast I'll save you all the details see
and you have some oscillations open the
window few times to be able to make the
transition or not that's it we have
implication for this as I mentioned at
the beginning that we were the first to
impute memories in petri dish neurons in
a dish many people try to do it many
people that are much more experienced on
us in neuroscience they try to do it
teaching by reward and I have to tell
you one thing
about neurons there are excitatory
neurons and inhibitory neurons they
tried to do reward to boost up the
excitation or to do it by punishment to
boost up the inhibition what we did we
call it imprinting teaching by
liberation we inhibit the inhibition by
inhibit the inhibition we let the
network show some new pattern of
activity and you have to do it carefully
at a local place and do some first a
real-time analysis of the activity and
so on and so forth it sounds always
simpler when you say it in words
okay now that was a very nice
implication of the idea on this newer
chip okay how decision sometimes you
have in a biofilm you can have more than
one type of species of bacteria some of
them master in keeping information like
resistance to antibiotics and when the
biofilm is exposed to antibiotics some
bacteria need this information so what
happens here is something very
interesting today bacterium that has the
information about the resistance to
antibiotics when there is antibiotics
and signals whoa I have the information
so the bacterium that wants the
information sends pheromones and that it
or she or he wants the information and
then what this happens is that they
start to conduct a very long 15 minutes
or so for play because they have to
trust each other she has to trust that
he has the information and he has to
trust that if he will give her the
information she will give him our food
back or vice versa replace the shin-hee
and there will be no transfer of viruses
because what they do after this foreplay
they really form a physical contact
between them see they really form a
physical contact between them
in doing so which there is a transfer of
the genetic element that has the
information and transfer food in the
opposite direction so that's the most
dangerous sex that you can think about
okay because it's directly to the brain
and the brain of human being does not
have immune system bacteria do have
immune system of version of immune
system and here is an artist's concept
of the same thing it's a long time 15
minutes oh we don't have time to work
this escape we were able to quantify the
social IQ score of bacteria we found the
tower bacteria is here about systems of
the variation above the average
okay Scientific American liked it that's
a joke here she talked with me the
reporter asked me what is interesting
here and I said well the bacterial
colony that we have are not just
beautiful but also smart today also they
are not like bundled in Hollywood and I
said yes and said okay so study here
with this statement I thought oh no
don't start with this statement but she
did anyway
okay applications new strategies to
fight bacteria when you have two sibling
colonies that go side by side what
happen if they are far away you ask over
there how far they can communicate you
see this is ten centimeter you see there
is some attraction so they do sense the
other one very very far away
sundered kilometer you put them very
close to each other there is a repellent
if you go them and look closer what you
see is that in this here there is
complete inhibition of the ghost because
it's smarter they don't want to
inhibition one into the other
because
then they will be confused with identity
so we isolate the material from here
show that it really inhibits the colony
you take the material again it's a
painful process of about two years and
then you see the sequence compare it to
the genome information make this protein
and identify it and so on and use it and
we discover a new type of toxin that
bacteria produce in order to kill
themselves now you have a new strategy
you don't use something from the outside
to control the bacteria use something
that date themself use and that's very
efficient because they're unlikely to
develop resistance so this is one
application there is application to
fight cancer cancer sir one of the main
problem is that after you have the tumor
for some time they start to invade the
body and they have made the decision
when to start to invade and if to invade
if to do what they call Pathfinder that
they go in the matrix start to look for
new and new location which is usually in
the area of the tumor which is less than
just all to make path generator that can
really eat the environment the matrix
and go to the bloodstream and this is
just to show you some simulations that
you can understand that from bacteria
again we did a salmon bacteria you see
that here it would stuck this may
represent the bodymetrix which is
complex you see that here there is a
gradient chemotactic gradient to this
direction in this pool guy stuck here
what they do they have a surface system
mechanism which they secrete all the
time but they do it and do it another
animal do it and which repel it so if it
stuck at a place this material
accumulates entirely he tells himself to
go out and you can do then simulations
of wine
do pass finding of past generating you
see they eat the and so on once you
realize that cancer has communication
and really act as a meta community then
you realize that the entire porch to a
cancer should be different from what we
did so much so far
okay that at certain question because we
don't understand how can it be this
cancer on one hand is a mutation and on
the other hand it has all this wonderful
wonderful rotation sophisticated
abilities okay so apparently it might be
that in some cases the cancer is really
and the mutation that eventually enables
to do this thing but in order to be
really cancer cell it has to have all
the other changes in the genome and
usually they have certain faulty
different mutation and they are used and
also normal cells recruit them or
enslave them to do jobs that they cannot
do anymore they make decisions and so on
so the entire picture of cancer has to
be revised so we'll stop to do the
approach that we do right now which is
stupid because we are not willing to
admit the dells node which is logically
it's a catch if they are not smart how
come all the smart people that fight
cancer didn't succeed to fight it okay
so okay so you can fight cancer with
cancer you can fight cancer with
bacteria you can temper the
communication you can do many other
things once you just realize or learn
from the bacteria new robots I do it
very fast you can show that you use some
of the idea and the minute that you take
some agents and add some interaction
between them that if they are very close
by they repair okay if they are far away
they attract if there are some distance
they align you can see they how you have
emergent phenomena in a very simple way
this is agent C there is a gradient and
they going to a target that you don't
see there is a slope here and you don't
see that they go the minute that you add
this simple interaction yeah you could
see this you see how they move no leader
the question that was before they turn
you'll see in a minute that they all
turn around but there is no leader they
just saw the interaction that's a very
simple interaction and that's very
important to many thing
understand navigation of other cells
making new robots so on did you see how
they turn around
all of them as if at the same moment and
this is the target they still wander
around you can do more than that you
realize that if you have the navigation
again you realize from bacteria what the
bacteria do they coordinate and adapt
the interaction each bacterium adapt the
interaction to the other according to
the conditions then you can make them
even more efficient to move in a complex
environment this group will split and
this group will continue together ok so
can have many more because they go
together and have this thing sometime
they push themselves out on the hills
but eventually they will do much better
we don't have time so I'll skip it this
main work of a dish ouch that she
received the Google Award so Google
recognized this before that ok so this
is if you have adaptable interaction you
see the optimal paths much shorter that
if you have fixed interaction and the
distribution is much narrower I skip
this part new game theory human
decisions emotional or arsenal we like
to think that they are rational and now
convinced more and more that they are
emotional and a comment about gut
feeling gut feeling is real because you
have many bacteria the number of
bacteria now your guts is about 10 times
the number of cells in your body the
genetic material in the bacteria in your
guts far more exceeds the thing in your
body and what you eat and what the
bacteria do in your guts affect your
brain and you feel each one type of food
you might make one type of decision if
you eat different type of food you might
make a different decision ok because it
really affects there is a stone very
complicated communication maybe next
time about the brain and our gut
bacteria so let's me end with this
additional movie
Oh make it high
the decision-making of bacteria tell us
that under pressure or under stress we
are likely to make mistake no matter how
intelligent we are and everything all I
said is a mistake and let me end here
