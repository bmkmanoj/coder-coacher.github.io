packed house even at the last session of
the conference I hope you all have had a
good dose of caffeine and all right
you've used toothpicks to keep your eyes
wide open so that at least I keep I get
motivated with those open eyes to start
I would like to thank Google for to come
and present the paper on continuous
integration here and definitely this
marks earlier for me because I know I'm
getting filled so maybe Hollywood is not
very far away I've already reached the
u.s. maybe Hollywood next time it's just
a start so here we are going to talk
about simple tools to fight the bigger
quality battle and that is how we use
the simple tools like task schedulers
and patch files and the simple text
files to get the continuous integration
up and running and to use for our
quality control system so here's the
agenda but you know during this entire
course of the conference we've heard
different stories from the people who
are right now struggling with the burden
of manual testing and they did they
think that there is no way to come out
of it and they don't find any end to it
in this presentation we are going to
tell you our story and we are going to
try and convince you that how can this
be possible with the simple tools like
the batch files the task sugars which
are at your disposal are very easy and
how you can get the return on investment
and the investment is just peanuts
itself and this is how it's going to be
implemented in how we have used it for
our benefit and how it could be used for
your benefit without much of investment
so here's the just reduce you to see I
only if you are already aware of what
continues
Oh quite a lot oh that's surprising and
how well then I guess how it works would
not be of much interest peoples of the
people because you're already aware of
it and then we just specify about the
challenges being faced and then how our
solution was implemented using the
simple tools and then we'll have QA and
let me mention you it's not the Quality
Assurance its q4 question a for answers
so to start off but we'll just say hello
to say I because but as most of you are
already aware of continuous integration
let me mention that all these
definitions I have not created even
single one of them I've just used it
from different resources a Wikipedia is
one of them so just to put it in simple
words continuous integration is
methodology in which the team integrates
there will work frequently and the
builds take place and there is a country
they continually integrate with the
different codes that have been checked
in into the subversion and there is a
mechanism by which something run to
check the integrity of the bill and the
important part of continuous integration
is that you get the response quickly and
you get the feedback quickly whether the
build was correct or not whether it it
is done mostly by the automated tests
which run through the which run through
the build for every check in and then
you get the response back um and here is
the entire continuous integration
mechanism how it works and we have used
to virtual people here one is Tim and
one is Lisa and now the important
question is why we have used Tim and
lisas because we didn't have a Robin and
Batman I search for it in google images
but I just got this image and that's why
I've used it but the important thing
that's missing over here is that the
feedback mechanism that we get is
through the automated tests which is
very important when you're having the
continuous integration that is how the
entire
a feedback system works that is whenever
a code is being checked in the oil and a
built has taken place then there should
be some automated tests to verify the
sanity of that build and the important
part is that you should get the response
back within less than one hour because
that's what what was being mentioned
yesterday I guess and I think Thomas and
Mark mentioned that if you're getting a
response if you know after more than one
are then it's a symptom that your
regression tests are taking too long
because you should get an immediate
response immediate or within one hour is
acceptable so now I'll just hand it over
to my Patrick who is going to take you
to take it to the next level hello can
you hear me terrific okay why CI well
take you back to the situation that
we're talking about the very start of
the story we were dealing with a company
that had a large number of software bugs
relatively speaking in fact had more
products that worked on these there were
even fewer testers and the build process
was effectively ad hoc bills when people
felt the software was ready so we're
talking Wiggly man your bills and these
will be part of the development from
development to testing and given a kick
around there were no regular market
bills there's no contesta Grayson and
the system
lesson on deck Alan school which I don't
know how many of you have encountered
such a system but it's really much fun
if you have multiple browsers so this
was leading to an awful lot of late
cycle heroics and consequently late
applications and poor quality challenges
is a nice job the disa these
applications good point all pretty much
using the same technology it was a then
ball and delfina Coco Delphie going for
the third come back the comeback king
it's the rocky for this is a for those
we don't know this is a native code
development tool for windows producing
30 of executables I'm guessing from the
way that every other word is selenium or
Java and is conference that not
everybody has experienced the joy of
debugging and testing native code
applications they can go wrong in many
many more ways you will probably have
heard the phrase DLL hell you'll have
seen message boxes saying access
violation and all the rest these are all
the things that just go away when you go
to a manager execution environment point
is is that this is healthy applications
were we need to eliminate those faults
we need to control the configuration
management to make this problem just go
away and we need to know really what
we're shipping so that's Delphie there
were desktop applications this is
probably what delphi's useful it can do
other things you can compile DLLs and
that kind of thing in comm service but
primarily the use of desktop
applications as I've mentioned the
resources of a few not highly technical
not trying to do people down but I think
we're trying to say here is that the
opportunities to suddenly down tools and
say let's all retrain in python-based
continuous build tools and use easy
being that kind of stuff that was not an
option okay simple as that we had to a
bit of a schedule to work too so
what we needed was a solution that was
straightforward I didn't want to impact
testing and development too much by
introducing too much stuff into the mix
it needs to be easy replicated I think
that's possibly a corollary of first
straightforward and everybody likes a
one click solution the batch files had
no parameters since pretty much how it
works and easily configurable this is
something that Kumar goes on out a lot
and it's well for the person is doing
the configuring it matters for everybody
else the idea was is that didn't care so
solution involved well no heavyweight
class of applications no xml that put
for me perhaps on the edge of the
spectrum we just stuck with simple text
files so old technology works fine not
even anything as complicated as a game
or previously the situation being that
there were documents and scripting tools
that would configure certain
environments and set them up but they
were complicated they were decaying
somewhat in complexity and the whole
process could take you know days and
perhaps fees slightly manual there was
no need for this actually koga delphi's
perfectly grown up tool there are
command line utilities for everything
including their own pocket Bernadette
which was really useful so one of the
jobs was to just create what just about
every other good software projects would
have which is the the classics of make
install make configure make clean that
kind of stuff and just create them and
make them work their things laws put
them all together so that was the
platform you do this on nothing is quite
important house the talks at this
conference of about the platform
suggestion activity as a platform or
nine center the ecosystem we were
working in was Windows desktop
developments with plenty of
people had already so we stuck to the
things you'll find on the Windows
desktop batch files are perfectly fit
the purpose for certain purposes on top
of that you have the good old window
scripting posts which you'll just find a
good way there are some utilities you
could find in the platform SDK I kind of
thing and so we're walking up to the
complexity guitar things I think hard
and harder and occasionally you will
need to do things like say export the
proprietary binary format into a more
human or source control readable tools
so we had people producing that kind of
stuff and i'll mention Colin Taos here
hello Colin he was actually consultant
company but it is helpful enough to
write such a tool which was bundled into
the test process and used to transform
the income principle binary files into
something that was CSV format and just
could be eaten up by him sort of
analysis tool so why do we do all this
configuration stuff well because
configuration management had been a
problem there was a certain amount of
DLL hell I didn't want to fix one
problem by affixing congressional
management and then introduced another
by bundling a whole bunch of
dependencies and other tools on to the
developer machines of test machines and
your jointed test machines so we came to
the policy of having a simple platform
and basically defended that as much as
possible so we created the continuous
builds off the standard build process
that's fine so you can now make an
application the next step is as had
identify it as there's little point in
identifying applications via a fairly
meaningless ID we previously had as I
mentioned this little known source
control system the other branch of the
company is already in this version
actually can ask a quick question here
is anybody not using subversion in the
room okay for those out there in the
audience that's actually some hands so
maybe ten twenty percent now I know we
chose you subversion it's it works fine
for an application that is primarily man
edited source code though no code
reaction step something like that so you
can just check out start working off you
go and there's a consequence of using
subversion I don't know if people badly
had the experience of going from a
check-in check-out model where you check
out the file you lock it your colleagues
quite a bit anymore then you find you
need a reference modified so you check
that one out pretty soon you've got the
whole application checked out your
colleagues can't do anything this was
leading to people implementing
workarounds to get their coat checked in
that's not good subversion has
alternative model which is just check
out what if I commit if you commit any
wins then you're there if not there
might be a merge process or maybe a
conflict resolution process and you
Karen working this made a big difference
to performance of the team with little
impact on their own process it in fact
improved it because they didn't need to
implement workarounds so Joseph
subversion pretty much followed the
recommendations from the subversion
manual branches and tags and trunk the
build process it was a requirement that
it should just work with branches and
tags and trunks there's no special
locations there's no reason to do that
we can do it this was quite a bit of
effort to support that but it's
worthwhile and finally kind of a policy
that there should be a no-excuses
approach to configuration management
what it should just work and I don't
know people have experienced and other
organizations but you might found that a
developer can do something and when you
install it doesn't work or vice versa
we've had situations where it was an
accident of fate as to which version of
a dll was being used by the application
this can have a big impact he said at
least three or four bug reports filed on
that one the solution was make the build
script that build application for source
control just fix that problem by putting
it in my place that's the UM the upside
of DLL hell is you can always put the
dll in the application private directory
you're back in business so having done
that we have continued skills we also
had opportunity to do nightly bills the
next opportunity was that I don't even
know this but delfy build very
very quickly none of the products took
more than 45 seconds to build so we
could build every revision if we felt
like it so we chose to benefit of that
is is that you can track down the
provenance of a bug like that a minute
after a compile error is committed the
relevant person is notified by email and
their team and you wouldn't believe the
difference that makes to the quality of
people's check-ins so we had these
containers builds we've done some good
to the quality of check in as far as
compilation goes the next step is to do
something with these bills its nose
having barneys just sitting around i
mean disk space is cheap so we were
keeping them for I think one project
kept from bro 9 months until they went
out disk space fitzy you've got the
opportunity to do a binary search on
that bug you feel like it and I did that
a couple of times actually something
subtle crept in and we found it
eventually and that saves a lot of time
investigation but ultimately you want to
do something and ship these but these
builds on to test machines and that was
the the next step so here's a diagram
testers and developers we already kind
of had the testers contributing to the
source code there were some unit tests
written the same language that
maintained by the development team so
the testing and this after NAFTA both
his intestines so we thought we'd carry
on with that approach and and well
expand on it just take it to the logical
extreme which is that basically
developers and testers were checking out
the same source base I know Pete Snyder
seemed to mention that the same
approaches up didn't some of their teams
with the way they store their source
control for their tests so that you when
you tag it you know what you tagged you
know you tested you know you built that
was but essentially the approach there
and there's nothing clever about that
decision is just to make it as simple as
possible because again it was a small
team not everything you everything and
the idea was to capture as much as
possible make it a non-problem so people
can get on with their job and their
lives so
developers and testers are some tennis
Lee working on application features and
leggy test scripts that kind of stuff
testers have access to a build at any
time they want they feel like it they
can also do experimental stuff by
rewinding the subversion revision
backwards or forwards to maybe find a
thing and developers in principle of
course have the ability to confirm that
the user accepts and tests work before
they commit so you don't have that
breakage the tests in the middle of your
projects which makes a big difference so
that's step 01 to repository at the post
commit hook and that's where you can
make all the magic happen so do was
effectively submitting something to a
queue for build machine and we are the
free server after time 1 105 a single
building there was no contract to build
process to actually put these machines
together and that was beyond our skills
to be honest instead what we had was a
simple build machine the instructions
for creating it which is a one-page
document because it wasn't complicated
and then you run it up and you plug it
into the repository post comic book when
the build appliance build something
which is not all the time then I'll
submit that build if configured to the
test appliances which again tied Street
appearance so what happened is everybody
shared sort of all the Basel II because
there was a shared framework somebody
commits to check in this goes to all the
build appliances because there's a show
kedron but some of these will update to
the latest support repository ID and
some of them may find that their code
has been changed that was a trigger for
running a bill to see whether
something's happened so this is actually
one of the problems that we had which
was that term we had one developers
working on the same framework however it
is affected three or four applications
and it happens that
Grayson reasons now the trivial stuff he
would check in a change you know it
works in this machine however two
applications fail to build rather than
finding out six months down the line go
we found out half an hour later you go
and they fix it so that discriminatory
power to find out what the impact awards
with changes just the process steps
nothing magical about that and I'm gonna
have handed Kemal come on was a
developer sorry I'm tester I'm the
developer and she'll go through what she
understands about this and what i am
princess what I understand about this is
this blank page actually when I started
off but then slowly and slowly I got
into the groove and I got mu groovier
and then I'll started understanding it
and I can see a very active wide open a
wide eyes audience here do we have the
sprinkler system here so that you know
it could be used to just in case you see
well if not the sprinkler system it
doesn't work then as a tester I have a
backup I have some special effects that
could be used in case well let's get
back to the presentation so we're
talking about the main pillars of our
solution else it has already been
mentioned by that right so you can see
the main philosopher the solution work
first the subversion because as a test i
would like to divide all things in
different sections and different pillars
so that it's easier for my little brain
the staff so first was the subversion
repository yes I did understand that
then what build machines which were
really really important because if you
don't have any build machines remember
we don't get any bells so those are
important and those machines are also
this is the latest discovery everyone
virtualization and near we use it we use
the test use the vampire and then we
have world's greatest invention the vb
sendmail utility i would say it is one
of the work mentioned because i don't
know if this email wasn't there I
couldn't imagine our life right now
might be people who are going
tippy-tappy on the laptops just checking
the emails you know it's just a human
habit even after every five minutes
we'll just go and check our email just
in case anybody has sent an email just
sitting idle so yes these are the
different pillars of our entire
continuous integration process and how
how we use the task sheet dealers to
find all these different pieces together
all these different pillars together and
in the following slides I'm going to
talk about how it was being done on
different machines and it was just done
through Tascha dealers and batch files
so you know just like you have in order
to teach a child ABCD or 123 you know
you have to keep on telling him he goes
to the school the teacher tells him a
super cat when he comes home the mama
tells him a for Apple B for Boise forget
you know and the main idea about is that
in order to make anyone understand the
value of some good thing you have to
reiterate it you have to tell it four
times five times so that the person
understands it that's why we are eating
bad thing again and again so as we have
already talked about subversion which is
our pillar number one so you just out of
curiosity is there anybody in the
audience who
to think about how we would have
implemented our continuous integration
using the batch files you know just just
give it a thought that if you were a
person who are trying to implement it
how would you do it what would you like
to have it on the subversion repository
because I've just pitching that there
four pillars now their picture people
paper means connecting would you do it
suppose you know making someone stand on
the machine and ask him to you know also
everyone sport then putting it on
building on subversion that's a very
valid ID sorry on on the windows we talk
right now how would you do what was the
thought that was going in our mind that
we needed the post commit hooks because
that was very important you know how is
it triggered you know when you committed
the entire continuous integration is
kicked off by your single commit when
you commit it there should be some
opposed to omit hooks which are able to
take those are you know the revision
numbers and they're able to copy it
somewhere because that is the first
point that that that is the first point
where you need to stop yes what a very
valid point and you have composite roof
and the triple swing balls because
markets and then 50 because it was
ordered to the because now it's separate
it's a single machine that is a
subversion repository now we need to
have something which copies the the
religion or the code from the subversion
repository to the belt machine has its
too
so for that what we did was we we were
having the scheduled tasks that were
running after every 10 minutes and they
were what they were doing well they were
just pulling the checkbook markers and
these markers were numbers and that were
being generated by post comic books you
can revision number by example are one
two three or are whatever is kept is
copied in one of the folders and then
there is a task scheduler switch is
continuously polling that folder and
checking whether that or any any file is
there or not and once it finds a file
then it just kicks off the script to
pass the machine names from the txt
files and then again because it's now
just on the subversion repository that
marker has to be moved on with the build
machine so the task that needs to take
place is copy the markers from the
repository to the best machines and then
just fight a few tasks remotely now once
it has been copied to the build machines
you need to fire up the task there to
build it it's very fast okay as we have
now stepped from the subversion which is
here too now we need to go to the best
machine now what what would you do on
your build machines because now we have
that one part we have just placed
everything from the subversion the
subversion repository at post commit
hooks which had generated the markers
and it had four people to build machine
now what would you like to have on your
build machines any ideas yeah you go
very important if you don't have in your
not going to have it
yes that's that's really important
because you need to have a mechanism to
build build the revisions that are in
there and those belt marks sorry right
yes good anything about the tasks you do
this because now we have implemented it
everything through the tough schedule is
then you would definitely have to have
some sort but you know should you start
running check for the markers there
because the whole thing is working
through polling on polygons and then it
would check if condition number is there
and it's going to build it so this is so
these are the three things that you
would like to have a widget which work
there on the build machines they were
the build scripts yes they they had to
be kicked off because if you don't have
any build scripts you're not going to
have any so they've different scripts
and then they were the she do tasks
which had to be as I mentioned it was
pulling the folders for the revision
markers because it needs to know which
revision to bed right so the revision
markets that remember it were being
copied from the subversion repository by
the pool and then kick off the test
scripts and then the important part over
here is now the the revision has been
compiled it's build and it's there now
the important part is you know you need
to test it because it's continuous
integration if you're not testing the
validity or the sanity of the belt bow
or run the automated tests against it
piano continuous integration isn't very
helpful so they you need to copy the
markers now once the revision is built
now you need to notify the best machines
that hey are built with this revision so
you need to mention that and they were
you can see that they were copying the
markers to the test machines and once
their visions were built they were
copied from
they were mean archives to the divisions
just a matter of popping that simple
file with the revision number from the
gun revs to the build revs and then the
config files which were the text files
because remember we don't want any XML
files because as it was mentioned
yesterday XML apple pointed things
remember and testers don't like pointed
things we hurt ourselves so we were
using the text files for that and the
text file was containing the information
about what test machine are on which the
markers to be copied and what tests it
to be run and the type of release which
is mostly forgotten by most of the
organization's is the type of release on
which you want to run the test because
all be aware of is just one type of
release that's you know the release type
but we could have highly instrumented
versions of a product also because we
would like to know the code coverage
also has it was mentioned in the earlier
talk so this the configuration file that
we had you could just change the type of
release then it would just copy that
particular release and then the entire
test would be executed on the highly
instrumented bill it was as easy as that
so you can see the you can see the type
of the configuration file here and you
can see this is the type of the release
you could have a debug over here which
means that it is going to copy the build
which was built the installs at all the
bill from the debugger folder which was
separately created and then this the
second path is the test machine on which
you need and endpoints time if you want
it you're destined suppose Japanese OS
or Japanese vista or Japanese XP sp3
then it was just a matter of impact 15
named over here and
it was the type of test that we did you
run because definitely all your tests to
run on all the operating system only
subset of tests might be needed for
certain operating systems so this was
also taken into account and you were
specifying the three the three parts to
it that's not the special effect I was
talking about so now we have got
everything set up uh
posite ray copy the markers to the build
machines and the build machine has copy
the markers to the test machines now
what do we want on our test machines now
what's important any ideas good and the
tests to be run so both of them should
be present here you go so the test
machines are had all these parts the
automated test scripts which are really
very important trust me if there are no
automated test scripts nothing is going
to run and in order to write your
automated test scripts you need to have
some tool and they should be scheduled
tasks really important because after
every 10 minutes because a built marker
was being copied from the build machine
to the test machine so the scheduled
task was continuously polling that
folder to check if there is any build
available for testing and once it was
available then yes the and any
automation tool this is really important
and this automation tool would generally
be kicked off through the command line
and I guess almost all the automation
tools have the facility to be kicked off
through the command line no no these are
the functional tests no no on the test
machines so these are the functional
tests that we are talking about and the
the configuration file that I had
mentioned in the previous slide they
were containing the name of the
functional test so unit s well you could
have your unit tests run during the
build time if you have your unit s but
we were not having unit tests at that
time we were just having the function
hmm one of the products had so we've
talked about how there's also manual
testing and the build process was was
quite ad hoc that was consistent picture
birth
and the important aspect was now after
the tests are being run the people have
to be notified about the results because
if everything has been done and you have
got no notification then what's the
purpose because as I said the feedback
is very important and how do you provide
the feedback by the world's greatest
invention and trust me this is the
world's highly complex not easily
implementable sendmail utility well any
resemblance to any person living off for
dead is highly coincident it was no
intention of putting any real person
living or dead here and if somebody
wants to sue me it's all google's fault
when I search for confused this was the
first picture I got so anybody wants to
sue me sue google please so with that I
would like to hand it over to my friend
Patrick who are going to reduce this
confusion and would just take you to
them otherwise the mind would explode as
you saw the special effects sound fun
still hear me great so I have to recover
from maligning your current present
right so it's Kamal's brilliant idea in
the dying minutes of this talk that we
should have a live demo the demo gods
have been roughly with this in this
conference have they not and I'll just
go through what it's going to do this is
a very very cut down version of the kind
of thing we were doing before the car
has been through the whole fact that we
were using you have spotted we were
basically using a folder as a glorified
queue to store data we did need to get a
new queuing software for that Bell whole
point it's also easily maintainable by
people you don't need to have the queue
maintenance client just works that's one
element the other thing that's I think
was worth mentioning is that because
that thing was a synchronous the thing
was quite elastic if there's a flurry of
activity okay you got your bills new
test notification
is a bit later so what it wasn't that
critical but it was important to know
what was going on because when you're in
a process of improving the codebase you
will be breaking it it was already quite
broken in the past so you'll be finding
things out so that's that was the aim of
having something that was going to be
definitive as to when problems occur but
the exact timing and we're not so
worried about the hour 15 minutes it was
quite timely in most cases so I won't
read that for you but something that
illustrates the basic principles and
will create you you're you're packing to
pilot your York and continuous
integration environment with minimal
requirements will output something into
a root folder with all the things that
you would need you can eat all those
good scripts you can need a repository
and you can eat a pretend to build
appliance and test appliance later you
could pick them up and put them on your
virtual machine and off you go now
here's where we get to the fun stuff
cancel this
try to
okay who always struggling and there's a
reason for actually we've all been
talking about vmware so much so it's
time to see one right that was me here
as I Creek my neck
where's my mouse here it is okay bit of
flashing on the laptop still to the
testament to the tool and the power of
machines nowadays so first I'm going to
go to hear bear with me on my lack of
experience of American keyboards okay
and I just need one of these
that they're good right everything
should be testable should it not so this
itself has a test that was actually
requirement was asked by somebody who
was a kind of a product manager at the
company how do we debunk this Patrick
and had we set it up so because the
whole thing was very simple I mean there
wasn't much to it it was quite straight
forward to abstract it and have the the
bootstrapper for the bootstrap which
would check out your template and then
the a meal always been because I as I
mentioned we have more products and
developers the aim was that you would
have a little menu of products here that
you can have a look at today and so he
wanted to some visibility on that so
let's have our tent biggest rap those
are errors no they're not I just I'll
run it again yeah it's because I started
from a clean slate and I don't know how
to remove that so that warning message
sorry it's got two options again for
debug ability because remember we small
team we don't have a dedicated building
whatever you might have somebody's more
knowledgeable but ultimately he's
product team kind of nice to know how
the stuff is built so I passed out the
parameter I'll just prove it doesn't
work here ok so now
there we go so it verifies a few simple
things there's nothing to clear about
that and the checks are really dummies
just to prove that you could do this
kind of thing this is really sitting on
top of some of the good features of
subversion what are the good features of
subversion is there's another product
called tortoise svn which is really
great and again back to what we're doing
which is windows development it fits in
so nicely into what you need to do so
that was a location where this thing
will set up tortoise svn can just simply
plug into the file protocol so I don't
need create service I can just get
started by looking at this straightaway
so I'll show what we've done using 6k of
batch file we've got this we've got the
starting of a project with a standard
layout there's a text file that's I
guess that'd be our to do list or
something and we store it in Frank later
or branch and reg up the automated tasks
already started so i'm just going to
simulate some development activity at
this point so i'll go name
and I will decide that was a mistake
I'll revert it
and to illustrate another feature which
is that we had a shared repository for
everything I'll simulate the inception
of a new product and there we go that
makes sense I love this tool actually
are then if you've used it but there's a
syntax highlighted file which has a sin
taxes for things like Pascal's without
the box a lot of the autocomplete
suggestions for the function you've
changed would be correctly spelt just by
typing 30 characters it's it's a godsend
really and as nothing stopped extending
that to other text files okay so not to
say it refreshes correctly but nothing
perfect so done that I've quite a few
revisions and in the background using a
bit flashing which is our own our
scheduled tasks doing their stuff so
what are they doing let's have a look
here we go
the additional flashing the observer
will notice would have been the post
commit hook because I'm running it by
the file system access API it just runs
the post comic book in my context of my
user login which is not great so
ultimately for a puffer system he would
to use a service but hey it's a demo
okay so let's get the build appliance
fingers crossed or has it run yet
oh we go so did you see that what
happened was they told us is updating to
revision four five and six and it
decided to build four four and five
because it was monitoring the file
updates when you're just continuously
updating your check out you can just do
that now works perfectly fine for an
indicator that Cinco check-ins you could
argue that you know if you allow the
revisions to slip in now in a problem
and maybe people are generating files
then there's a conflicting update as
that would be an issue but the way to
solve that I think is to have a simple
policy on wedging of regenerative files
go and don't have people conflicting on
the same fire area that's just that's
the fundamental problem you to attack a
social issue not not a technical one I
would say so we've done that and now
I've completed those what's really
interesting of course is that because it
knows what was important what wasn't we
have bills for four and five that's
great and then the next step which I
don't think we've seen you I'll just
hurry this along because that time is
pressing on it's tested four and five
and we can go and have a look at that
some head and close the window and we'll
find it as a pretend marker now all one
has to do all one has to do is just
implement the bits in the middle which
are compiling a product in testing it
it's as simple as that of course in the
case where you've got six different
products actually you have to do it
anyway yeah we're not talking about
single product family we're talking
about products that are constantly being
created I believe there's another one
now they're all being folded into the
mesh and when you have quite a strongly
shared sore space but necessity of
having not some end developers you are
obviously updating each product in a
serial manner and then moving on to the
next application and then moving on so
this shared source base and the shared
concerts and share tests and some of
them produced file output that was used
by the other application you do actually
have this linkage between everything so
um it's important to bear that in mind
and try and support the ability to with
your limited resources get the job done
and keep everything working yeah we went
for a situation I believe we're a lot of
things weren't working you know the
source can be found when it could be
found in quite work properly because
they've been confusions about source
control by being strict on configuration
management and then finding a way I
think to easily deliver it to various
people including consultants including
testers and developers you can just make
the whole process more visible and
identify problems and get there now
further work further work would be
probably almost every other talk have
been presented to this conference but
this is what was done in the first
instance and it's the start and you can
replace all these parts of something
better for instance we haven't talked
about this but there was a track
instance that was producing RSS feels
sorry RSS feeds and a browsable view
onto this version folder and we plugged
in a full-text search on every farm
source control system using Microsoft
index server which means it can serve
search the excel files and the Word
documents yeah so you now recovering
some information never had before
because good luck doing that and share
drive this stuff is quick and efficient
we went to the web-based bought in web
bug tracking tool which had to
integration with the check-in so when
you checked in a bug you mentioned it in
the committee comment it would put that
into the the check-ins for this bug
entry in the bug tracker so you could go
backwards and forward and see what's
happened again increasing visibility
continuous equation is fine I think if
you don't actually have a lot of
visibility it's not so good come all
talked about the the pointy bits we've
been maligning XML very much here but
there is a serious point here I did some
experiments with branches and merging
and tagging and the problem is is that
so branches are fantastic for having a
good sign release process but if you
have issues where people are quite
validly saying merging is hard I I have
to do lots of manual editing of
conflicts to resolve stuff and get it
back in to try and called in responses
they will not do it so much you won't
get the benefit or they might make
mistakes so I specifically went looking
for file formats that you know it's it's
per line the subversion automatic diff
just loves lines insert and deleted I
also specifically tried to make sure
that they were start and end lies
because I have done if you've tried this
but adding lines on the end so first
really can't decide who did it so make
sure there's something already on the
end and then everything will just
automatically pad and put it in the
middle that kind of wins XML I found
that term it would struggle i think the
users would really struggle identifying
the conflicts when they did happen it
seemed also that the conflicts would
would happen more often I'm not quite
sure why and finally we had some XML
configuration files that one commercial
products used which which would
constantly be rewritten in a different
order depending on trivial changes of a
project configuration which meant you
were looking for conflict city when
these things emerged in so we had to
actually put some special steps into
massage these files and try and keep
them unmodified as much as possible and
maybe train people to like you know
don't change that let's just get it
right once and save that and the idea of
this list just to make the merging in
the branching process in the
differencing process as seamless as
possible again so you can release
ourselves from worrying about source
control and consideration in the rest of
it and just get into the work so those
are our motivations that's what we did
and I think
ends my sexual talk so I hope you had
quickly understood the little big system
that Patrick had created just for the
demo on how we had how these are three
tasks you doodles represented the
schedulers that we had on different
machines and how these batch files are
saying here represent the batch files
that we had on different machines and
that we had mentioned earlier in our
presentation so let's get back to our
talk again and how do we do that okay so
it this machine is very fast time is
still young here's yes so we'll just
quickly skim through our presentation
again you know just in case you forgot
anything or we missed out anything just
scan through it that was the special
effect yet worked finally yeah so uh yes
so it's all been demo'd I just kept in
handy you know because the sprinkler
system doesn't work and last talk of the
presentation and people are just feeling
the burden of so many talk so much of
information to absorb than all going
down so here's any any questions and
I've actually crossed that out that I
will not take I'll use google before
asking them questions because none of
the questions are done yes so many
questions i'm delighted yes
well Hudson teams yeah no you're
absolutely right why did it do because
we did it in extremely small steps each
one requiring a certain amount of
proselytizing and massaging and
explaining of the features we didn't
have a big bang say you know we're just
going to stop for a month and we're
going to take a look software we have
this folder where there's an factors
archived object files that are linked
into the application I'm going to throw
that away and we're going to find what
the source is then we're going to have a
cruise control in a web server rubber
that didn't happen that way the sequence
of events was start using subversion
will stop then as a consequence that
thing was find the source shall we and
then there was let's have some
continuous bills so we need to make use
of the build process and then it built
up and it built up and then there was
that there was let's use them let's put
together some kind of web-based
subversion browser because you know it's
not fishing using just all so that kind
of stuff so at no point i think really
was there an opportunity to just put
something new in also um well i don't
think we actually spent that much fo on
it to be honest it's not over blow but
then there were three or four batch
files i did the whole job and the hard
work was actually implementing the steps
and that's probably the message you want
to get across it's not that you know
continuous equation requires a superb
tool with lots of witty graphics it
doesn't what really choirs is superb
configuration management so that your
scripts are correct if they're not
you're dead in the water doesn't matter
how often you build it so we had to kind
of put that together and then the
wrappers around it were trivial and
they're convenient for us and like I
said I didn't want to put this stuff on
developers and testing machines if they
had to debug it I didn't want to create
the bill
going as it were so that was a ration
armor be it right or wrong but
ultimately if we actually looking at the
amount of effort expended is trivial
yeah and always we had them in mind is
that let's create all these parts
relatively loosely coupled so if you
change your mind go for it yeah for
instance now there's a commercial
product which is very good integrating
subversion browsing with bug tracking
yeah that's now you know shining a light
on the separate subversion browser and
the separate bug tracker wasn't
available even believe 18 months ago so
we kept it lightweight and flexible in
case we changed our mind and we haven't
spent that much time so I don't think is
a big deal I hope that answers your
question just some extent any more
questions
we we actually did have that there was a
we didn't have pre-commit hooks per se
or yeah oh absolutely that's the thing
the yes we were not checking in the
broken code we were having we were
testing before we were checking the
build is compiling at our end because
you know again these compilation of
these bills were just one click batch
files because it wasn't rocket science
so once you've made some changes just
click that button and even as a tester I
could making changes click that button
and would see if the changes that i have
made has compiled properly or not and
that's what we were testing before
committing in the changes and then the
test then again the automated tests
about kicking off all the stuff was
deliverable to everybody in the company
in principle yes although about bills
yeah because people sometimes just
wouldn't do it I was the bill fails us
no executables so that's that kind of
solves that problem really need to get
back to whoever made that mistake and
work out what has happened exactly if
the bill fails as a Patrick as mentioned
they were no executables there were no
and even if the markers were being
copied and then the tests were failing
and we were getting the result back so
here's the test yes yes the tests were
new decline does that something is
something has happened yes yes in the
ideal world all the people who were
following the practices were doing that
that is checking before committing it
but you know it's the ideal world you
know we find some lazy person or lazy
developer a lazy tester just you know
committing anything and then good break
it
that's likely yes me maven is great for
java based applications and you know
web-based applications are they think
I've been clearing brush it though the
continuous build and the build developer
did my machine identical steps yeah the
only missing link is that when people
just don't do the build locally to
confirm that it works but there's still
the issue of them missing files yeah
that's what happened I must tell you we
are having Hudson right now in the place
where I'm working but still we are
having builds failing still we are
having developers who are checking in
the code so it's not a and Hudson is as
you mentioned as a continuous
integration system which is already yes
and so so it's it's it's a problem which
is existing everywhere it's just a
matter of practice and it's the process
that you are using and it's the
discipline at that a developer is having
so even it doesn't matter what tool you
are using if you're not having that
discipline at an individual level you're
going to have problems
yes team sedan no chances you also
however have problem a political problem
in that you'll have a number of
participants the process will all have
different interests and each of them
will define what a broken world is
differently now you'll get right to
maybe you don't the consequence of not
getting it right include the two or
three weeks of Nobel to get I know of an
example where that's happened so we set
up a frequent rule and the existing code
base did not comply with that frequently
here you go project the title they talk
is simple tools yes and there are
multiple viewpoints I think our messages
is that you said people don't change why
I disagree because actually people did
raise their game and there's there's two
reasons for this because it was obvious
what was going on ok so we've supplied
the tools so that people could avoid
embarrassment and after a while they
started using a tool to do that ok I
nobody had to go over the big stick and
beat over the head that's one thing the
second thing is is that increasing the
visibility of transparency by making
things simple allow people the people
that were interested to learn what was
going on to think about it and to
improve the process themselves and start
contributing more so you rather than
having a great lever that squash is
everybody down these ad hoc bills and
like you know let's let's struggle to
get it out you have opportunity for the
people that are more productive to go up
to a highly signaling I think that's one
of the messages of conditional equation
it and yeah you're right we even if we
did it again you'd probably replace some
different staff there's much better
tools even now just a short while
everyone but the real big difference is
is that this stuff with the same team
makes a difference yeah so if you've got
innovation like that and sink it through
and see what difference it makes and
just to add to that point I would say
it's not the tools that important it's
the habit which is important because
just as I always say like brushing is a
habit it's not important what brush
you're using even you can you do it with
the finger if you have a habit of
brushing but so similarly it was our aim
to get the people into that habit of you
know first because it started little you
know first try to introduce subversion
make the people familiar with these
things then you know just build a system
around it so that they have simple batch
files that they could build it
automatically and then we could have
some automated tests running on the via
machines and then we thought okay why
don't we integrate all these things so
it was just a matter of
putting up you know getting the people
into that habit of checking in their
code getting the automated test running
getting the response back and once
they're in the habit then you could
definitely replace with the Munich good
tools or much even much better tools
which are available in the market so the
idea is not to you know just throw away
the entire big bag heavy client-server
application to up to the people who are
already not into the habit of using the
best practices but to introduce you know
little things which could improve or
make your life easy and then move on to
bigger things and then maybe replace it
all together so it's you know tiny steps
that you have to take towards better
quality that's why the title of the talk
was simple tools to file fight the
bigger quality battle so the quality
battle still continues it's not that we
have a concordat and you will never ever
reach a position where you're going to
conquer this better no never because you
know every time you come up with certain
things then you'll hate this thing was
missing then you'll have new tools
coming in the market so the idea was
getting the people into the habit of
checking in their code in introducing
continuous integration
they gather this big group so I ever
person that heard the bill the last
person that broke the bill would take
all the animals and they had to sit my
office with all these animals the next
person bro everyone was always waiting
for the next person to break you know
the whole social pressure thing has to
be done quite carefully actually</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
