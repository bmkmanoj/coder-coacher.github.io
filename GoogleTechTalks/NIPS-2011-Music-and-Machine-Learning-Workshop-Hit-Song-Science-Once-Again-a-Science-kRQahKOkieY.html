screams oh baby
and and there's even a paper about the
truck in the neighborhood I would like
to convince you to convert these ! to
the question so why shouldn't they be
such this kiss was right and there's
definitely certain musical features
which changed through time Ian Conners
with popular music and some are more
popular than others and I'll do to
notice and recommends notice and they
exploit this I think if anyone follows
the UK Charlie lever at the moment
everything has to have a dubstep kind of
relates on animals in order people get
okay so there's a positive feedback loop
as well as very artists of knowing this
and then i'll make the features of eat
more and hits on size basically just
names to come to find these creatures so
I think it should be possible so this is
talking about today and just quickly
about the background by hits on sites
and get to be used the first description
on learning agents and results and
temptations from a paper good time
they've either to go on to some new
results which gives importance
so previous kind of work with some of
them tificate collecting a large amount
of data on his songs and pop some of the
journal is expensive and now we have
this wonderful economist platform until
you start as far as you know this become
too mate studies in one commercial
application on this area first paper
claims that it's a signal they found
second that there isn't so as absolutely
insensitive and this commercialization
planes I can do it but offered no
evidence or accuracy measurement first
papal is in eighteen thousand five and
they found that combination and forty
features as well as lyrics to explain
what happen they consider just number
one gets worse as everything else and
that's part of its own reasoning kind of
relatively small defects like those
planets but a total of ninety one hits
they try to identify and a total rocky
area of a perturbation of 16 months and
then in 2008 much of our study and seem
to say that classifying songs into low
medium or high popularity based on kind
of record industry records and chava
tones is novel season se a pacifier and
they found the popularity predictions
you do not see any better a random
funny does this you play site which
claims that if you upload a file and pay
them lots of money I'll tell you
question your song will be hit what you
played with even more money than a
platinum album and I'll tell you which
of us on wishing your songs to release
it seems the no documentation of Alice
works and what how successful is they
have some amazing results where they
predicted no returns would be very
successful after she became very
successful so so took by the data source
of town and the top is some a bit more
bit easier to understand that's like the
u.s. shot we just have one sharp which
is really well recognized the official
chart and basically any shop which sells
more than hundred singles week they
collect data from they came to collect
this covers a ninety-nine percent for
seniors release it's been very steady
since the conver Lee days and in 2005
they started including digital downloads
as well so only gathered was the all be
gathered was the top 40 from 96 each
2010 and looked at position of all
seniors so if some kind of was released
in 1917 keep them on the vibe when I'm a
more popular in two thousand in one
considers Appalachian a Nazi we can't
afford to buy every single okay it has
on it so I leaves the air finished just
straight down by crispy will you saw me
and analyzed ATF and from this virtual
yet so those sixteen thousand individual
songs and reflected 15 features boots on
and we just consider these as a bag of
features that my prior lake on which
will be more important than others it's
just picking it up after school and from
these we've competed some of our own
features and most of our work is based
in called recognition so well first of
all we calculated some kind of variation
features who have loudness and beat
variation basically tells the stability
of secant stability the loudness and
then two measures based on our
predictive chord sequences given the
primitive expected from the internet so
we have one port harmonic simplicity
which is just the likelihood report
sequence so sequence for cisco's local
cng sdfgsdfg is going to be given given
hmm what is going to be likely so we
sign up a pie for my whereas ones
which are two key changes modulations
and we report would have a lower
harmonics and listen I'm in a measure of
how noisy to sing on this space beats oh
and get this primary from echo nest and
we have our pretty cool sequins black
primer basically measure the difference
between the cord template on the chrome
so if the chroma mentor very well to the
core template and we think the sound is
what simple there's not likely much
lawyers so we pull this menu like the
Navajo modesty it's kind of a measure of
noises of the city alright so first
description is that he's informant and
have that so we saw for example in on
this is my last year that and the
billboard top 100 is as a really large
class of balance if it's someone enters
the Billboard 100 it's much more likely
to do well with my life
so we found the our data from the top
quarter number of songs of Pete a number
125 was the same number as Pete 30 to 40
the entire duration for my thesis
nineteen sixty-two thousand so it's a
boy to class imbalance we considered
these two definite crafts and ice cream
so the task Egyptian formally is given
that the song entered the UK chapter 14
and pizza 1 25 or 30 40 decide to which
of these classes loans based on mental
the approaches and to do this we used a
very simple learning agent just a
perceptron basically and but the
important thing we did is we consider
the time frame this as a feature so we
took all the songs sort of them by
release effect oh sorry our peak
position update and then basically move
this learning agent through time so
basically we're learning the optin
teachers to time instead of just picking
out the song of random of deciding if
it's gonna be a hit in what so you think
this is a pretty important feature i
mean like songs which were released game
like early 60s and stuff they sound very
different to the song listen today they
will have different analysis different
chord progressions of this kind of stuff
so we think this is a really important
feature and so this is the algorithm is
very simple and you put in some samples
and some audio features as well as a
memory perimeter Lando's just tells you
how long to remember the kind of optimal
and we said knowing that about half life
of something like six months and in
those just some indie weights and you
basically go through time and blood
product the weights against the features
and
if you all if the outcome it is not as
you expect an update update the weights
listen those nice as you get the
predictions out but you also get the
weights so these w0w k are going to tell
you the the optimal features for that
period of time this Samson results from
paper so i'm elected have curative
performance so slots off a little bit
uncertain this has been smooth that I've
got as well and just 18 rotation and the
you'll notice that this given us two
classes around them to form of random
test pilot get 15 performance but we are
worried about this and it stabilized
around point five six we've also got the
classification mattress the third decade
if her valves one standard deviation so
you can see for example between nineteen
19 2000 it was easiest for us to predict
its and also from the upper when we get
the weights so we've normalized these
weights and see how much free time which
features are most important for
predictor hits like on so you can see
for example in duration it seems that
there's a switch runs around the late
seventies longer songs this
disappearing coming up here
so there's fun to interpret these things
remove one sliding down to a very slight
modification of what we had in the paper
which is now we're using Ridge
regression and so much fun putting the
rank not just the quality and the kind
of the fun things you find in these data
at other corners so down the bottom left
so this is actual rank fix predicted a
bounce and left you half up songs which
we predict will do really well handed
and doing it very life so we call these
expected hits up in the top left the
songs which who predicts will not do
very well but in fact it's all highly on
the chops and interesting these are
wonderful things like charity singles
where the songs themselves aren't great
but as external forces active them down
bottom right we have songs which we
think are great but never really made an
impact on each other and they could be
considered kind of commercial failures
but like to think of the missing gems
for being greedy store cupboard
collection of time okay so add some
results may using this this ridge of
aggression rather than the so this is a
flight details drop it once but
basically the dark blue line is up for
three times so you can see it's always
about point five then I love the little
slates good fun now open the entire
duration of a chart 125 d position at
the same number of analysis that's
important but this year challenged by
month week by week so the love green
line the bottom shows the sorry the
light green line shows the actual class
of others through time so you can see
that when this is supposed two point
five around Cove barely 19
it's like why for us a great songs well
when mean when it's far from 2.5 million
different paths and so we found out was
actually our learner was learning this
class imbalance of that which is a bit
frustrating but also quite intuitive
because if you have a band like the
Beatles sort of churning out loads and
whether it's the maybe more hits the
magnets in a particular time for example
so the belt blue line a possible shows
are addicted are the class imbalance of
our predictions basically we can see
it's kind of got a lag than the actual
class performance and to prove that we
come as much cheating the light blue
line is the performance you expect if
you always predict to the dominant plus
so you can see the 60 below our document
showing that I'm and we will remove
everything than Britain Adama cotton and
finally the black line is just the King
music forms so let's hang on 16 I also
have some Dutch nation of the lace
so
let's wreck it
okay so i got the features going through
time in and which features are formed
for making hitsamateur let's important
and you can see how they evolved through
time as we can see public danceability
meeting up and down on an energy
features so especially when I love the
class unless were pushing a bad little
bit but kind of interpretation leave
results is really fun to see that energy
becoming a bad thing remove Lakers
okay this me a recap so i hope the most
convince you that there is a signal here
these are things can be predicted even
if marginally um but if anyone is not
convinced yet we are actually this
morning release the website score netcom
where we're going to be with all our
results those are interpretations of
them and rice you can make predictions
every monday when the UK charged release
for every song that we can get a chemist
features four-wheel make a prediction
and and the result fatal document pop
performance a very similar graph to the
one I showed before competing honestly
and I how good or bad is doing with a
ton of monthly somewhere together and as
this fun stuff on the site you can see
in some of the unexpected here so like
charity singles some really great songs
are kind of expected hits and things
like that and also need some source for
finding a cover story attorney James so
websites something like this some sort
of saw monitor and for measuring hell
with something good idea basically it's
kind of a CD player we did a press
release this morning's is actually
almost got two hundred stories worldwide
all readiness it's really bad for all
gun visitor score in purple
so the conclusions and I think it's
still quite early science it's on
science but we think we've definitely
found a signal and convinced it's it's
not random one and there's kind of
really I'd say no now we have two papers
for my against so probably still a bit
contentious but we found a signal using
pretty simple machine learning methods
and the key you think is the release day
because we had a similar-sized a face to
the vm the paper which could find
another signal but they did to the
reason and websites going to show if we
can maintain this so thanks thanks to a
