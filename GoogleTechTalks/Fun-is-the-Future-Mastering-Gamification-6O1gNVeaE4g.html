funny to hear your bio read out loud
because you realize you're very
sensitive to every like word I wrote
that bio so it's it's my writing yes so
you're very sensitive to every word and
then also I no matter what my
accomplishments are I'm humbled by the
quality of your kitchens I think it's
like things like one day I aspire to
have a company that has kitchens like
that where today I made my own espresso
which I'll enjoy for a second hmm so um
so as you heard my name is Gabe
Zuckerman I do a bunch of stuff around
gamification and today I wanted to talk
with you guys about it's a little bit
presumptuous to use the phrase mastering
with something as new and as a
slippery's gamification but we'll do our
best
I'm going to share some of the top
insights gleaned from researching the
book game based marketing which came out
in April work that we do with brands big
and small every day work on the summit
and the research that goes into the new
book gamification by design which is
Chris mentioned a tech book that will
come out at the beginning of the year so
when biting off a topic like
gamification or any topic for example I
like metaphors so I thought a pretty
good metaphor I realized a pretty good
metaphors can be found in the movie Mary
Poppins and if you're too young or too
straight to know this basic story of
Mary Poppins I'm going to recount it for
you
it's the story of a hard-hearted but
turns out fundamentally nice guy with
two really really super sweet children
really really darling children and they
need a nanny so they write up an ad and
this woman on an umbrella comes flying
into their lives she has magic powers
like being able to levitate or jump into
a chalk drawing and at the end all is
well which is an important part of the
story all ends well in the story of Mary
Poppins
so think of me as your Mary Poppins down
the sort of rabbit hole of gamification
I mixed literary metaphors there will if
you would like to talk about Alice in
Wonderland later we can talk about that
so as Chris mentioned I'm the author of
these books game based marketing which
you can get now I blog at gamification
Co it's a gamification blog we talk all
about the subject I advise startups I
talk about interesting things and then
as Chris also mentioned we have some
upcoming events related to gamification
if you are currently working on a
gamification project either from the
product or marketing or design side you
might be interested in November 12th San
francisco-based gamification workshop
amy-jo Kim and I will give a hands-on
full day come in with your problems and
we solve them working together workshop
actually almost sold out but if you're
interested in going let me know there's
really like one seat left at it and then
in January we're running here in San
Francisco again gamification summit
which is a full day of a full day event
focused on the subject bringing together
some of the most interesting thought
leaders like Jane McGonigal who'll be
revealing her new book I'll be giving a
keynote on metrics which I know you guys
love we'll talk about all that kind of
stuff okay
so let's let's begin with a simple word
definition gamification is the use of
game thinking and game mechanics to
solve problems and engage audiences
Foursquare not the product but four
squares yeah so it's game thinking and
game mechanics and this is really super
important game thinking is the product
of three generations of game players I'm
36 years old I'm the old hi my name is
game I'm 36 years old and I'm the oldest
cohort of people who grew up with games
as a core type of entertainment in their
lives
today's youngest children you know kids
who are well the youngest children B's
like just born but kids who are you know
maybe five years old today are growing
up with games as their principal form of
entertainment and that
multi-generational exposure has simply
affected the way that we think you know
if Shakespeare was a real person this is
the best analogy Shakespeare was a real
person he wrote he or she wrote all the
world is a stage
famously right but if Shakespeare were
alive today wouldn't he have written all
the world as a game because isn't it
just a better metaphor for how we think
about interactivity in the world and
that really gets the heart of what game
thinking is it's solving problems and
engaging audiences using a rubric that
comes from games okay so let's talk
about some of the main things that we've
learned from it how many of you in the
audience recognize some of the things up
on the board right now any of them okay
these are some of the top selling games
of the last five years and
include I'm not kidding being a nail
technician diapering a baby being a
waitress running a farm being an air
traffic controller which as many of you
know is the highest suicide highest
stress position in the entire world I
mean if you had come into a game
publisher five years ago into got a
great idea we're gonna make a game where
you play an air traffic controller
planes could crash what do you think
sound good right
you've been laughed out of the room that
doesn't sound like fun that doesn't
sound like fun at all it highlights a
really important conclusion which is fun
and the theme of the thing which are fun
are actually not connected if you've
been in a casino before and you've seen
the Oprah Winfrey branded slot machine
and the harley-davidson branded slot
machine and the neutral slot machine you
all as science-oriented people are aware
the slot machine acts on your brain
exact same way once you choose to sit
down in front of that slot machine same
behavior in your brain same engagement
loop same reaction ding ding ding oh yay
ding ding ding right it's the same thing
it doesn't matter which brand is on the
front of the slot machine theme is a
lure to bring people in to an engaging
experience it's a lure and that has
important implications that means if air
traffic control can be fun my friends
anything can be fun right it's an
opportunity it means we can turn
government we can make government fun we
can make getting fit fun we can make
searching fun or more fun all right so
it of course begs the question you know
what is fun so I put some words in a
word generator I put them up on the
board some the words on the top are
things which normally people associate
with fun and the words on the bottom are
words that normally people associate
with work and what's interesting is you
know there's a big bright line drawn
between the two of them in my childhood
you know I grew up in a house in which
my mom said eat your vegetables and then
you can have dessert right eat your
vegetables and then you can go out to
play there was a theme around vegetables
so these things though are arbitrary
distinctions they are arbitrary these
are lines drawn by people in the air
that say this is fun and this is not if
you're a parent in the room if I could
deliver for you up
piece of cake that had the same
nutritive value as broccoli the exact
same nutritive value as broccoli can you
honestly tell me that you would never
can even give your kids broccoli cake
right the point is these lines are
arbitrary they're meaningless we can
make anything fun or anything work
depending on its design and that's a
very important kind of like switch
that's being flipped in people's heads
and they're going okay so I can make
anything engaging and you really can um
which brings me of course to my favorite
allegory in this whole story so I played
a a game that many of you might
recognize called where in the world is
Carmen Sandiego if you played it put
your hand up if you played it on the
Apple to keep your hand up okay so now I
know how old you are um so okay so it's
the 80s and I'm playing where in the
world in car is Carmen Sandiego on my
Apple to green screen lots of fun would
it surprise you to know that that was
the last really successful educational
game in history would it surprise you to
know that since then 1,200 startups four
billion dollars have been spent on
educate mint software and not a single
hit like where in the world is Carmen
Sandiego and that it's a completely
captive market there are 60 million
children it is a captive market what's
happened here's what went wrong parents
and teachers got involved in the design
of the games and as soon as they did
kids could smell that a mile away
that's not fun that's work right in
parallel incidentally civilization and
SimCity have taught hundreds of millions
of people
basic basic tenets of the human
historical arc and how cities function
and civics basics completely
unintentionally Sydnor neither Sydnor
will will tell you they were on a
pedantic pedestal trying to teach people
with those games they simply chose that
as the framework for a game a setting
for a game that they thought compelling
they thought the real world would be
more compelling than a fantasy world and
it turns out that that's true nonfiction
has a big advantage over fiction and
gamification is
as nonfiction gaming its gaming with
your real friends and your real money
and your real stuff in the real world
it's nonfiction gaming so of course
going back to Mary Poppins there's a
famous song of Mary Poppins called a
spoonful of sugar and the premise of
that song is if I make the medicine
sweet enough you won't know that it's
medicine you'll take it right creating
the objective which of course is a good
analogy if any of you are marker
marketers in the room a word that
marketers sometimes used to describe
that phenomenon is loyalty program right
loyalty programs let's just do a simple
working definition are intended to get a
user to take an action in your favor
when all competing options are mostly
equal right mostly equal when things are
really in equal loyalty programs are not
that effective but when they're mostly
equal loyalty programs have the effect
of getting people to take a choice in
your favor okay so here's a brief
history of loyalty programs throughout
history 19th century you go down to your
local Morcant aisle in Boston and you're
wearing heavy woolens and you haven't
showered in a while and you're like I
need 10 pounds of sugar and the
merchants like are you get a pound for
free I don't know why it's a pirate
merchant I'm just okay but because all
people in the 19th century to me are
pirates it's like our pound of sugar
okay so buy ten get one free that turns
out to be a really sticky meme right
we're still doing buy ten get one free
as the sort of dominant model for
loyalty programs I don't know why I've
asked lots of researchers if any of you
are interested in doing a PhD on buy ten
get one free let me know I think I can
find you funding it's like we got to
figure this out we don't know why okay
that stays about the same until the
1930s when a company called S&amp;amp;H launches
their green stamps program it was very
simple instead of buying ten and get one
free went to participating merchants
they gave you these little green stamps
with you licked and stuck into a book
and you save them up and when you had
enough you went to the S&amp;amp;H store or to
the catalog and you redeem them for
stuff the brilliant thing about the S&amp;amp;H
Green Stamps II it completely broke the
users ability to keep track of a
redemption rate right it used to be ten
to one I buy ten pounds of sugar I get
one for free now I have no idea how much
I'm earning
in virtual currency as expressed in
Redemption right because it was actually
totally variable S&amp;amp;H knew what every
green stamp was worth to them but the
end user couldn't keep track of it then
no idea is ten green stamps the same you
know it's ten green stamps for a t-shirt
the same as sixty green stamps for a
transistor radio it's almost impossible
to figure that it turns out virtual
currencies are very powerful that way
okay that stays the dominant model until
1981 when American Airlines launches
advantage and a week later TWA in United
launch their programs which turns out to
be a good metaphor for that whole
industry and what American figured out
and what TWU and United aped
is that actually it's not about rewards
at all it's about status status is what
drives loyalty and if any of you tried
to redeem your frequent flyer program
points this summer for a trip to Europe
you'll know that redemption is not the
core value proposition of a frequent
flyer program or for that matter loyalty
program and that stays the dominant
model so just a few years ago in which
loyalty programs emerge like Foursquare
in which you cannot redeem for anything
in the real world there's not even the
notional concept of redemption right
they just dispense with it all together
let's be super clear I want I want us to
be super clear on this you cannot
extract one dollar from farmville there
is not a t-shirt a hat a badge in the
real world you can get for your
farmville credits not a goddamn thing in
fact it's all money in and no money out
in farmville to the point that when
Zynga did that super successful campaign
with 7-eleven for the slushies you know
the get a Slurpee get farmville credits
it wasn't get farmville credits for
every Slurpee
it wasn't redeem your farmville credits
for every Slurpee right it was buy a
Slurpee and get farmville credits let's
be clear no real-world redemptions money
in nothing comes out it's brilliant
right so the corollary which is probably
even more powerful is that while the
cost of a incremental unit of loyalty
let's think of a customer making a
choice of your product a choice in favor
of your product when all
our being equal the cost of delivering
that incremental unit of loyalty is
dropping precipitously it used to be ten
cents
it was ten to one it was 10 cents that
number is now closing in 2-0 as
completely virtual loyalty programs
start cropping up out of the weeds the
other thing which has become very
important is that the loyalty Choice has
now become public
loyalty used to be a private decision
right how did I convey to you that I
preferred Kitchen Aid mixers over
Cuisinart mixers in the past you had to
be in my house for starters right we had
to go through this ridiculous dance
where I somehow bring up the subject of
you know mixers to you and it's like hey
do you like my mixer and then we sit
down and we have a whole conversation I
mean books were written about
word-of-mouth marketing conferences were
held about word-of-mouth marketing it
was all
there was no process to word-of-mouth
marketing no one ever understood how it
worked no one still understands how it
works
Zynga knows how it works right now
there's a process for word-of-mouth
marketing it's on the social graph it's
precise it used to be random now
it's structured this is a humongous
change in behavior and it means that
every decision is public and when every
decision is public it means decisions
that are not taken aren't potentially
negative so if your product is not the
one being specified or chosen in the
public sphere that may be a sort of
lightweight demerit against your product
um so it begs the question my friends
what is status worth how many of you
know recognize either of the two people
up on the board okay we got a couple
people so anyone want to call out one of
them right okay so these two people are
both winners of fourth seasons of major
game shows on television right the
gentleman on my left is Christian
Siriano he won the fourth season of
Project Runway the woman on the right is
the first winner of Deal or No Deal ever
she won in the fourth season and she won
a million dollars okay he's a hundred
thousand dollars enough to launch a
fashion line in New York City it is not
he's a hundred and twenty five thousand
dollars the prize on Top Chef enough to
pull permits in the city of New York to
start a restaurant it is not
so what do these people play those games
for they play for attention they play
for power they play for status they
don't play for cash it turns out cash is
a great incentive if you have a bunch of
it to throw around right is also this
weird ten to one relationship comes up
here but let's let's set that aside that
that continues to be ten to one the
bottom line is if you don't have a good
status system to offer users in exchange
for their behavior you need to give them
cash and the worse your status system is
the more cash you have to give them
that's basically the basically the
relationship of these things and so at
the heart of all of this we talked about
this in game based marketing the book we
talked about this a lot this is called
the gamification loop and at the heart
of it is a point system and around that
point system are a whole bunch of what
we call game mechanics points badges
levels rewards challenges leaderboards
things that can be used to engage users
based on a point system point systems
are super important right we we use them
in real life money as an example of a
good point system but these things
around the point system are incredibly
important because often it's hard to
communicate to somebody exactly how many
points you have like it's really hard
for me in conversation to tell you
you're on how much money I have in the
bank I have n dollars in the bank right
so instead of doing that I buy a whole
bunch of stuff which tells you how much
money I have in the bank right it
signals to you through a series of AB
through series of status choices I
signal to you how big my point balances
signaling is an important part of this
kind of interaction right it's not
always about the point sometimes it's
about the signals for the points so some
other examples of of things that you may
have seen called meta games things like
structured exchanges gifting poking or
flirting questing and raids these are
groups of game mechanics put together
into one sort of unified experience
these are other things that we use to
create user engagement to create desired
behavior with users and games when they
you know some of them are fairly
familiar I want to share with you a
little quote if you don't know Kiva Kiva
is one of the leading nonprofit you know
social service startups in the world
they do micro lending
for important causes so we interviewed
last weekend in TechCrunch the founder
of Kiva Premal Shah said our biggest
competitor is actually Zynga consider
the implication of that right
he runs a non-profit he runs a
large-scale nonprofit he views his
competition as Zynga what is he saying
he's saying that increasingly users are
forced increasingly users are faced with
a set of choices that are basically
distinguished between we used to think
of them as work and leisure choices but
increasingly they are compulsory and
optional choices compulsory and optional
replace fun and work in the in the
language once we get into optional time
disposable time discretionary time users
are naturally going to gravitate to the
experience that they find the most
rewarding notice my choice of words they
will naturally gravitate to the
experience that is most rewarding and by
definition games have a big advantage
over just about anything that you might
be creating in your spare time right
which is they're designed explicitly to
maximize reward so if I can freely
choose like do kids not read books today
because they don't understand why books
are important no it's because they have
the choice of stuff that's way more
interesting than books
so they're choosing something more
engaging the books it's a hedonistic
response to mark a choice it also
highlights something really important
about the power of games games are the
only force in the known universe that
can get people to take actions which are
against their self-interest in a
predictable way without the use of force
and this is an important distinction sex
is extremely powerful at getting people
to take actions against their self
people's self-interest it's very
unpredictable
and you can pull a gun out and make
people do just about anything you want
but they tend not to like that games are
the only force that can get people to
act like they're sex-crazed maniacs but
in a predictable way without having to
pull a gun on them
I know I know I know that's a bit that's
a bit dark um but not I'm just king but
you get my point my point is this a
powerful force and it's what's being
expressed now in this like you know
relentless pursuit of engagement that's
coming from the likes of companies like
Zynga and behind this is important work
there's important academic work that
underpin some of these things there's a
guy named Richard Bartle who in the
1980s was one of the first researchers
to look at why people play games and he
identified and these were muds at the
time not MMO G's but they're our
precursor to ham emojis text-based
multi-user dungeon games and and Bartel
discovered identified four different
types of players he identified the
achiever the socializer the Explorer and
the killer and I'll tell you about them
a little bit what's interesting is the
four have since turned into 16 which
include things like a judge a politician
a lawyer but the four turn out to be
very enduring and Bartel never intended
them to be a personality type like an
MBTI type inventory but now that we have
three generations of game thinking I bet
you can start slotting some of the
people you know into one of these four
categories thinking of that as a
personality type so the achiever the
Cheever likes to achieve right simple
the only problem with a community full
of achievers is not everyone can win and
it's a big design problem right son a
little design problem is a big design
problem the second biggest problem
probably one I face the most in talking
to audiences about gamification all the
time is that you here in this room are
not normal you are way more
achievement-oriented than the average
population right way more if I gave you
an achievement inventory you'd score off
the charts by comparison to the normal
than norm population the norm population
eighty percent of the population are
socializers and they're after
lightweight non confrontational easy to
reciprocate social interactions with
other people they are in other words as
other you know sort of social science
researchers and said they are lonely and
they are looking for social engagement
with other people lightweight non
confrontational easy to reciprocate
sounds a lot like poke right poke is a
good expression of that idea farmville
is without taking anything away from
Zynga poke with cows
right it it leverages that socializer
instinct that socializer demand that
socializer incite to its extreme 10% of
the population or achievers 80% are
socializers explorers if any of you
played Super Mario Brothers right on
that SNES or the NES
you might remember having friends who
knew where every single like hidden
level was every Easter egg was which
pipes to go down which blocks to push to
get it access to the secret levels in
the days before the internet those
people were classic explorers in the
Bartle typology they had to play those
games for hundreds and hundreds and
hundreds of hours to find which pipe was
the right one to go down they'd have to
like you know go to the pipe push down
oh that's not it go to the pipe push
down the Explorer is playing for the
social credit for having discovered
something that's what they're after they
want to be the one who discovered this
thing they're they explore and killers
were the most controversial segments of
the market they make up probably less
than one percent the average group
they're very very similar to achievers
except it's not just okay for me to win
I win and you lose and not only do I win
and you lose but all of you need to
watch me kick your butt and then I want
as much credit from the community as
possible for having done that I want you
to say I respect you I love you you
killed me okay um killers are killers
sound bad but actually in many cases
they're really good um I'll give an
example I frequently talk to big company
executive management teams so I'm in at
a very very well-known publisher a
company you'd all recognize was a big
busy online a community of commenters
and so one of the best example of
killers is comment killers are really
really super common and obvious right
you post an article and those guys are
in there like berm right right away and
then someone will post a comment it'll
be like you're an idiot and then someone
else are opposed to come and be like
you're stupid right and so you see these
people on some of you might be those
people
if so I highly recommend keeping your
hands down for now so your friends don't
know so you know I'm talking with these
guys I'm talking with these publishers
about comic killers and you know in the
canonical webview or publisher view of
what to do about a comment killer would
be to tamp down that behavior right
you're going to write a script that
listens to the tone of the post and if
the tone of the post is too extreme the
post goes to moderation right or if the
person posts too quickly multiple posts
up to the to fast put them into
moderation right or ban them from the
website because they're disrupting
that's terrible that's not at all how a
game designer thinks about that right
killers are the most active most engaged
members of your community they're just
expressing their behavior in a bad way
so the right design from a game design
standpoint is to put them on Rails not
Ruby on Rails rails right which is shape
their behavior by creating a pathway
that they go down so in the case of
common killers we unpack their
motivation what drives a common killer
thereafter recognition right they want
to be recognized as smart by the outlet
or the writer so you set up a reward
system that says okay you can earn
dinner with Walt Mossberg you can earn
an op-ed in The Washington Post in order
to do so however you need to be the
commenter who's most frequently given a
positive review for the quality of
commentary right you set up an incentive
system that's more carrot less stick
right consider I can't guarantee that
we'll get a hundred percent adherence to
that we may still need moderation cues
but we will turn some of those people
and some is better than none another
good example the US tax system it's a
hundred percent stick and no carrot you
get nothing for filing early unless you
owed money and you get your money a
little sooner right but if you owe money
there's no one zero incentive for you to
follow early there's a lot of
disincentive free to file late why
empirical evidence tells you that it
would be better if there was an
incentive scheme why not offer some kind
of benefit to users preferably a status
benefit but why not offer them some kind
of benefit for filing early in on time I
this is the kind of thing that game
designers think about reward early
reward often try not to go negative good
axioms
so for you we'll do Q&amp;amp;A in just a little
bit I write it down think about it text
it to yourself if you have to okay um
that's so meta okay so it brings me you
know it brings me this important point
for you guys you know which is from I
believe that there's a seismic shift
underway and if we believe that
consumers understand metrics but in a
more abstract way like the metrics that
drive themselves but in an abstract way
increasingly consumers care about fun as
an actual metric it is a value pleasure
enjoyment fun is a value that consumers
increasingly expect to be in their
products and services consider this
right sorry I know many of you are
carrying android points consider we I
could be using an Android for this
example it's the same thing
consider this device this is not a good
phone people right we all acknowledge
this is not a good phone but we can
never go back to a Motorola StarTAC can
we we can never ever go back our
expectations have been changed
irrevocably our devices must be internet
connected they must be beautiful they
must like be able to play games and do
applications and make calculations for
us we can never go back and so consumer
expectation is rapidly shifting what was
once an advantage meaning clarity
simplicity of purpose may actually turn
out to be a disadvantage in a world in
which consumers are engaged looking for
more deep more engagement we've been
trying following this web design holy
grail of finding you know the most
straightforward cleanest way of
presenting information or data I
actually think the tide is turning from
a consumer standpoint I don't think
that's the main metric that consumers
are looking for at all i think the main
metric they're looking for now is fun
and engagement and increasingly that
will become their number one choice
factor in deciding what what wins and it
means for you there's a new metric on
the horizon and we haven't defined it
yet I'm going to I'm working with some
researchers between now and January 2 to
define this in time for the summit if
you guys want to work on it let me know
and I'm happy to have you
we need a new metric to describe
engagement consumer engagement because
the old metrics don't actually work
anymore pageviews doesn't describe
engagement daily active users does not
describe engagement right return time
spent on site returned visit these
things do not individually define
engagement there is a new metric for
engagement that needs to come out of the
miasma and it will become all-important
there will be a metric just like has
happened before of course you guys you
know you're in a good position to define
what that metric should look like just
like Facebook define the daily active
user monthly active user metrics but you
know we need to have that that
engagement metric so I want to share
with you a couple of examples in the
mall have time for Q&amp;amp;A so the first
example of a pretty good game of fight
system overall then I like to use is
Nike Plus how many of you use Nike Plus
anybody oh this is this awesome this is
awesome I'm never in a room without a
Nike Plus user so this is fantastic
okay so Nike Plus is a Nike Plus is a
game of fight system where you typically
you buy a low piece of hardware and you
you wear that on you and it records your
score and then you upload that score or
you can do it manually on the web with
social experience it's got points badges
levels leaderboards challenges rewards
all-around how much you exercise and how
you perform in xs/s context almost
exclusively about running and it's cool
its well-designed
considering that you know not many game
designers actually worked on the problem
but it has some issues that up top is my
actual score a Nike Plus today today and
I will tell you that while this is body
by butterfat I am not antithetical to
exercise I don't wake up in the morning
going or exercise or I hate it I'd like
to be fitter you know but Nike Plus
apparently doesn't care about me as is
evidenced from there the very first
minute of their design right I am not
already fit enough to play Nike Plus and
there's no incentive for me to progress
even the way this progress bar is
designed is a humongous disincentive
remember the olden days of walking up to
a video arcade machine in the old brown
cabinets and you walk up and the first
thing that you would see is
leaderboard of ten people with
astronomically high scores right like
Jeff ten million four hundred eighty
seven thousand six hundred forty two
right and then the next person be like
one point below that and then next
person would be like two points below
that and you'd be like you know and it
was it was actually one thing that we
learned from those leaderboard days was
how humongous of a disincentive a poorly
designed leaderboard can be bad
leaderboards are terrible terrible
disincentives bad scoring systems are
terrible disincentives you walk up you
see that in you're like I'm never
getting on that leaderboard and if
you're in any way competitive in any way
or achievement oriented and the game is
inherently achievement oriented you're
like well I'm not gonna play this game
I'm gonna go look for a machine where I
could maybe get on board right can look
for game I can get on board
so we've revamped leaderboard design in
the context of social games here's how
leaderboard should be designed now it's
actually like that prescriptive okay so
so in the new design of leaderboards you
put the user right in the middle and you
put their taught their next two best
friends above them and the next two
front best friends below that right so
no matter where they are in the actual
rankings they're in the middle two
friends above two friends below with a
little dialogue bubble that says in
order to be to do this
right it's so much better of a design it
turns out to be so much more engaging
than the old leaderboard design the only
exception to that and this is important
as well because I think this is this
kind of goes against some of the core
web design had Germany which is that you
actually think through different use
cases and explicitly redesign
experiences for different users so the
exception to that design is if the user
is actually in the top 20 literally in
the top 20 you show literally the top 20
right because that user probably then
really cares that they're in the top 20
and wants to see the top 20 right so so
anyway so so we've rethought some of
those things we rethought about
motivation another example of a game
that that I think highlights some of the
challenges is chase picks up the tab how
many of you know that I think it's an
East Coast thing basically the premise
was during this promotional period
chases run in a couple of years in a row
if you use your chase debit card and you
swipe it during the promo sometimes
you'll get an SMS from Chase saying oh
we picked up the tab and they'll reverse
the charge right so setting aside the
fact that that is clearly a casino game
that is absolutely positively absolutely
positively a slot machine and there's no
question about it and they should be
regulated under under like gambling law
and I don't know why they're not but
what I can't figure this out but they
should be okay so setting aside the fact
that that is a casino game the problem
with Chase picks up the tab is I have to
be a chase customer to play do
you know how much time it takes to set
up a bank account I have to go into the
bank now I have to bring two forms of ID
sign my Patriot Act paperwork wait for
them to run the background check on me
send me a give me a temporary ATM card
send me the regular one in the mail
activate the one in the mail sign up for
the promotion and then play that is a
mistake my friends Zynga would never
have made right why can't anybody play
chase picks up the tab why can't you
play the game just by connecting on Yoda
Lee right anybody comes in signs up with
Yoda Lee sign up for text alerts it's an
opportunity for them to convert a
customer later but they think like a big
old kind of dumb Bank you have to be a
customer of ours first the bar is way
too high and the market will no longer
support those kinds of AI
Diaz ad infinitum every opportunity
think I'm going to tell you this right
now social gaming designers every single
touch point is an opportunity to convert
a user there is no such thing as a
moment that exists in the world where we
can't draw another user into our
experience we have to start thinking
about the world in that way I mean you
don't have to things will work out
better for you if they do okay
so here's one that that more of you will
know the Nike+ um how many of you do not
know what the lunar xprize was oh
awesome i just used geek pressure okay
there was there okay there was there's
one person I'll just recount recount it
for you ten million dollar prize given
by the unsafe Amalie to the XPrize
through the XPrize Foundation to the
first team to launch a reusable
spacecraft into space twice in three
weeks with human payroll ode coming back
alive
okay the premise was we're going to
unstick the stuck space program because
NASA keeps launching crappy space
shuttles into space that don't make any
sense okay that's the premise so here's
what happened my amateur sleuthing
here's what happened
27 teams entered the Ansari X PRIZE of
the 27 teams a third of them are now out
of business
two-thirds of them minus one are doing
government and principally government
university contracts which begs the
question about why they didn't just do
that in the first place and the winner
the winner was going to win this contest
anyway
Burt Rutan backed by Paul Allen Burt had
twenty years of experience building
private spaceships he was so far ahead
of everybody else in the rest of the
world and backed by a billionaire who's
prepared to fund it to the tune of at
least twenty five million dollars to win
the ten million dollar Ansari XPrize
which is as we know a fundamentally
irrational choice to make so tell me
this who won the Ansari XPrize
I'll take opinions anyone the XPrize
Foundation won the insa the XPrize right
it formed an actual thing they come that
they got 150 million dollars worth of
free press from it and it highlights
probably the most important point I can
make for you which is the game always
favors its creator no matter what game
you're playing the house always wins
the deck is absolutely stacked together
I'm using metaphors there all point they
all point back to a fundamental truism
there is no way to beat the house
long-term no no way so you have the
choice in a more gamified world of
either being the house or being played
those are your choices but there is no
ambiguity here the sooner you build
gamified experiences the sooner you get
to you know taking your cut because it's
ultimately the best business in the
world to be in two people or multiple
people battle it out and you get a cut
of everything that happens you might at
Google be familiar with that um as a
premise so let me summarize some of the
I'll summarize some of the main things
that we talked about today then we can
do some Q&amp;amp;A so the first important
takeaway fun and theme are not
correlated we can merge fun and work you
know with games by using gamification
and game thinking that line is not so
bright and red status is probably the
most important motivator that you can
deliver to users cache is really should
be far down on your list of things to
give away unless you really love to give
away your cache the gamification loop is
a great guide points in the middle game
mechanics around the outside badges
levels challenges rewards leaderboards
fun is a new metric engagement is a new
metric and games fundamentally favor
their creators so um I'm really really
interested in hearing your questions and
I will lay out for you in advance that
there are three questions I get asked in
almost every single talk that I give and
so I am keeping a leaderboard in my head
of how well team Google correctly
anticipates those questions yes for
instance creepers haunted the corporate
stuff you talk about was strengthened
raishin so you think the next step might
be more social but then when you look at
Xbox Live you know you see the obvious
problems so I'm going to rephrase your
question because there were a couple of
different questions in there so um I
think I think the bigger the biggest
question that you're asking is can you
create a social experience that's like
fundamentally corporate but also social
and are there what are some of the
pitfalls of building an experience like
that so one of the things that happens
anytime you build a social social
interaction platform of any kind is you
get unintended user behavior users do
things that you don't want them to do
users do things that are not necessarily
on your pathway of you know design
concept so you want your users to be
there happily talking about you know
Google Checkout and they come and some
of them happily talk about Google
Checkout and some of them like start
talking about like neo-nazis right and
you're like okay it's unexpected thing
but uh you know what are we supposed to
do about it or you know they're like
obstructionist and make the experience
negative for obstructions that make the
experience negative for other people so
there is no substitute for good
moderation you know in a I gave a
keynote shortly after the world
financial meltdown that was actually on
the subject of how if a game designer
had been in charge of the Federal
Reserve how the outcome would have been
different um for the meltdown and one of
the most fundamental things that game
designers do not do is they do not ever
think that people will not try to gain
the system they begin with a fundamental
assumption that if what I built is
valuable and there's always that if but
if what I build is valuable people will
attempt to get whatever they can out of
it by doing as little as possible right
that's the that's the basic tension the
game designers believe exists in all
these systems so we're never naive about
that what's up we often make mistakes
but we're never naive about that so the
right answer to that it's a broad
omnibus answer but it basically means
expect the worst expect the unexpected
and think about things like a game a
game designer would so any game design
community has sis ops right who are
often promoted users who demonstrate
some clarity
and then some system of command that
allows most importantly the game to turn
transactions back at will that which is
really super important so in the real
world that's out of games normally like
when somebody defraud somebody else
you've got to go to court you have to
seek some third-party remedy for that in
the world inside of games with the right
Terms of Service the remedy is tell this
you know the sis OP notices either its
algorithmic or human or a complaint
somebody says oh that's not the right
kind of interaction that person's
misbehaving and they stolen something
something's weird they are able to pause
play read the log decide what to do in
like a couple minutes pause play read
the log decide what to do take money out
of someone's pocket put money back into
somebody else's pocket ban a person
change their status and the game
continues right it's some autocratic
it's somewhat dictatorial but it is
necessary for the in this context
necessary for the effective functioning
of of most multi-user experiences so you
need to get her that in your design if
it gets big enough anyway more questions
that can't only be oh yes please use the
microphone so we just went through our
annual performance review cycle few
weeks ago and when you were talking
about that system where you're in the
middle and then you see the two people
above below what would it take to move
up I was thinking well you know this
would be really useful during
performance review because um oh yeah
it's really unclear you know what it
takes you know to move up or whatever
and I was wanting you know how would you
run performance reviews as a game it's a
great question I love um I love to put
on the spot game design questions I'm
gonna be like alright so here's what I
do know um so actually HR is a huge
piece of I think the next big frontier
of gamification sales teams have been
using basic game concepts since the
beginning right they've often if any of
you have worked with a sales team you've
seen the leaderboard up on the wall
they've been doing that forever or like
like nonprofits for their donation thing
you know like where they show a
thermometer like with the number filling
up that's a kind of like sort of status
meter score health eater that you might
use
so some
these mechanics have been employed with
sales teams for a long time but they
haven't really seen distribution beyond
sales teams but there's an increasing
chorus of people playing with ideas so
one of you that wasn't implemented super
well but people kind of liked on the HR
side was a game that the guys called
serious ax T built which was a you it
was an email game and basically the
premise was you had to put a certain
amount of virtual currency behind every
email you sent and the amount of virtual
currency you put behind it demonstrated
how important email was so the recipient
the recipient could score to score their
inbox based on how intently you really
wanted them to read email right now it
was overly convoluted it didn't work
quite the right way the design wasn't
perfect but there's a germ of a really
interesting idea in there right which is
using a virtual economy to to signal
like intent one way or the other
and I think probably for HR and
certainly for performance reviews the
biggest thing that I would do is I would
expose the XP system of of reviews so do
you all know what I mean by XP XP is
experience points it's a point system
that generally is revealed as going up
continuously it never goes down it can
be reset periodically according to
calendars but it pretty much always goes
up and you get XP for all kinds of
activities in the world but XP is not
redeemable you can't turn XP into stuff
it's like experience points and you've
seen it in xbox if you play xbox live
you've seen it in LinkedIn that bar that
fills in that says your profile is 33%
complete is a type of XP okay so what I
would do as a test is I would expose the
actual process for getting a raise and
making an XP bar that everybody could
just see on your like personal homepage
here's your XP here's your distance to
next race right and you got to keep
doing the things you know here are the
challenges and quests you need to follow
you got to keep doing these things to
get to your next level right and at
least demarcate the next level um so you
know the other cool part about XP is
usually those bars never actually fully
fill up like you can never write you
never get to it's sort of is a
logarithmic project you know projection
so so it keeps getting you know closer
and closer to
you know vertical but never quite gets
there so you can kind of do a lot with
that but that would be my main my first
main hack would be to test that in
performance reviews and what effect
would an XP bar have on people's
behavior just if it was on their home
page every day maybe you know you logged
into your your home page and that was
the first thing you saw its how how far
away you are from your next race Jago a
question yeah power metric you mention
yeah if you've thought about what it
might look like sure what does the
engagement power metric look like that
I've described right there are so many
different ways to think about it so I've
been doing some preliminary thinking on
it and you know I would love to have a
dialogue with people were involved in
that kind of metrics around it and again
you know we'll talk about that at the
summit in more detail but basically I
think we need to amalgamate a few
different metrics and look at some new
ones that track track user behavior
against some norm because I think we've
been missing some of that normative
tracking components which are kind of
important and then there's some elements
on the eye I know these these two things
are already kind of flushed out in my
head we need a baseline and we need a
amalgamated metric and then the other
thing that I've been thinking a lot
about is we need to start measuring
certain behaviors in core analytics like
referrals friend invitation should be a
core analytic it should be in Google
Analytics actually like find invitations
right should be tracked by Google it's
like obviously missing there right
because it's important to everybody
right okay um just want to we're just
waiting to see if I'm like the only
person okay um so friend referrals a
simple example of something you know
that tells you so I think if we if we
pull together some of these things um
you know we can you know we can kind of
create some interesting hybridized
metric but we frequently when we talk
about metrics in gamification frame or
point systems you know we frequently
make things opaque for a reason you know
so I'm not I think the secondary level
to that is whether it should be
transparent or opaque and there's lots
of justification for some kind of semi
opaque metric you know a good example of
that is another good example of semi
opaque metric is
if I was building a game to help you
lose weight at your local gym or getting
people fit actually so broadly speaking
I'm building a game for engagement at a
local gym right if I created a linear
point system like old-school point
system thinking um I'd have kind of a
problem right because for me losing 10
pounds or for you losing 10 pounds are
two completely different values right is
that for me it's a rounding error right
for you it's like a serious weight loss
goal and uh and - yeah I actually do
lose like six to seven pounds in water
weight TMI um so uh so you know so these
two things would mean something
different and we may also even be
walking into the game with completely
different motivations I may want to lose
weight you're on may want to bulk up how
can we all be on playing the same how
can we all be in the same experience
right under those circumstances if we
use a simple point system that's like
measure the number of pounds you lose
and then on top of all that is the
privacy question right which is how
would people feel if their actual weight
loss was on a like publicly viewable
board in a gym right so these things all
point to that give you a lot of evidence
to support this idea you don't actually
need all of this evidence to support the
idea of an opaque point system in which
the game designer takes care of all that
and just produces one magic number and
the one magic number is you know where
you're at
against your goal and that's all you
need to know and if you believe that the
system is honest if you believe that the
game designer knows what they're doing
and you see some proof of that early on
you buy into that point system and you
just say oh that makes sense more
questions yeah I have a question so when
I go to play a game I've not a member of
the game so how would I be in the
leaderboard or how would that works so
the early days of any game are super
super important what the term that we
use in games to describe the first
minute or so that a user plays with us
is called onboarding which is a term you
may have heard before and the game view
of onboarding is totally different from
the web view of a morning so in the web
view of onboarding
a user might be coming from anywhere and
we don't really know what they want to
do so we're going to drop them on a page
which gives them eight or ten up
standard eight or ten options right
Google comm is in the notable exception
to this rule but most websites when you
land on them there are eight to ten
options of what you could do right
login register now tell a friend follow
us on Twitter
find out more read about us like press
section so a game designer would never
ever ever ever ever do that ever
there is one experience it is the
onboarding experience for the game it's
what we used to call a tutorial level
but now we just call level one and the
user is dropped into the game experience
and I'll give you the basic rhythm of it
right now the users dropped into a game
experience um knowing and the designer
knows full well that they're gonna lose
a whole bunch of people in the funnel
right but that's not the point so
usually this is what the rhythm look the
pattern looks like now
welcome do this simple challenge like
any idiot can do right dude do this
simple challenge yay okay here's another
one
can you do it cool here's one more can
you do it
yay register now
right and then most importantly invite
friends right that's the rhythm that's
if you deconstruct the you know if you
deconstruct the first minute of most
successful games they look like that so
in the olden days we dropped you on an
option that said start play to toriel
level now we just make that level one
you're in tightly boxed in as a user you
don't even know that you're tightly
boxed in but you're really tightly boxed
in in that first minute of the game and
some of the core things that we've
unpacked is you first get a reward yay
before you're asked to register and the
registration step is the one that you
use to claim the reward right so the
site is advancing value to the user
before the registration occurs and it
uses that value to get the registration
to occur which is really backwards right
from the way most web design is done so
that's become that's been very very
powerful and that also in those two or
three or four steps that we do in the
first couple minutes we unveil that we
reveal the complexity of the game in
slow steps right slowly let me show you
a little bit more Oh a little bit more
Oh a little bit more okay now you're in
one of the and then there's and then
there's still some revealing that goes
on right leveling up and so on yep
stations recently about some about
gamification of some areas in aren't
necessarily aren't obviously games and
one of the objections was that this
would take away from the value
proposition of what's already there and
sort of create this distracting layer of
game on top of this other thing that
already had gives value to users and it
would sort of shift the value to I've
got this behavior though I feel
compelled to engage in because I have
these innate human characteristics and
all these joke and the argument was that
now I've taken you've taken away from
the original value that we
is there how do you what do you say to
that that's that's a great question
so the question is I'll rephrase it and
there's two questions so one of them is
you know how do you gain a fine
experience that has intrinsic value
already so you know one thing and then
two what are the risks of gamifying
something that has intrinsic value you
know what happened so this is a two-part
answer for you
my favorite allegory around this is
JetBlue you know when JetBlue airlines
launched did not have a frequent flyer
program they said we don't need one we
are a new kind of airline our planes are
new and clean our employees are happy we
fly where you want to we give you free
TV and snacks we do not need a frequent
flyer program that's what crappy old
airlines use as a crutch our core
product are intrinsic product is good
enough how long did that last one year
approximately right and they're super
super not invented here like that's
that's why they were able to go for a
whole year you know the reality is
sometimes and I think it happens in
almost every commoditized market the
game subsumes the intrinsic action
activity it just eats it because it's
more important it's more compelling as
everything becomes more of a commodity
the loyalty becomes the actual end-user
product it's what the user is engaging
with this loyalty program not the
underlying product we used to have brand
marketing to do that right that was the
other lever that companies could use but
today it's really hard to get that
message through to user so increasingly
loyalty becomes important so that's
that's one aspect of it the other aspect
is a little bit scarier which is what's
called replacement so I did a weird
undergrad my undergraduate was the
psychology of gifted children and their
social emotional effect and so one of
the things that's been in the literature
of gifted kids for a long time is
replacement and here's here's
replacement in a nutshell you
intrinsically are great piano player
Chris you play piano you just start
playing piano there's just one around
you start playing you love it you're
playing music you're playing all the
time and your parents decide that you're
going to do competitive piano so now the
introduced competitive piano playing to
you you start going to competitions
you're winning
it's cool you're getting prizes you're
getting rewards
winning and then if we withdraw the
reward right we would draw the prizes
and withdraw the reward Chris will stop
playing piano full stop he stops playing
the underlying intrinsic behavior that
he doing before we ever came along with
our folk octa reward program right he
just did it because he loved it what
replacement is it's very very clear and
it happens almost a hundred percent of
the time if you replace intrinsic
motivation with extrinsic rewards and
you extinguish the extrinsic reward the
underlying behavior is also extinguished
once replaced intrinsic motivation
rarely comes back that's the basic thing
so it leaves you in a bit of a dilemma
which is you're facing markets that are
basically going to extrinsic rewards
everywhere that's effectively what's
happening and I don't think and I know
it's controversial I just gave a talk on
gamification for nonprofits like last
week in New York at this great meetup
for nonprofits and I was like I hate to
be the harbinger of doom for you here
but let me break it down there's an
opportunity rather than a threat but
intrinsic motivation is over
it's it's over depending on consumers
intrinsic motivation to take actions for
you as a brand is over the sooner you
accept that the better you will be we
can no longer depend on it in fact begs
the question of whether or not there is
an intrinsic versus extrinsic reward
system anymore at all right our private
lives are now public our social media
presence is omnipresent it follows us
around all the time
is there an internal life for people I
don't even know anymore but here's what
I do know everything every vertical will
become rewards will become externalized
and you'll need to find a good external
reward system to compensate yeah
I've got a deal with material business
terms a B C and D I can't get a partner
to commit so I introduce extrinsic value
I mean at what point are you crafting an
unsustainable relationship like you have
six months of exclusivity but six months
month seven are you still gonna be happy
with you right so the question is how do
you how do you make that sustainable so
I'll tell you kind of I don't know your
personal situation but I'll share our
story so from the time that and it may
be it's a very personal situation but we
can talk about it later so so from the
time when when United first unveiled
mileage plus in 1981 a week after
American until 2007 the top level you
could achieve in mileage plus was 1
million mile flyer that was the max
level you could achieve and of course
that seemed insane in 1981 a million
miles oh my god how many people would
ever get to a million miles that's crazy
so the designers didn't design past a
million miles what happened when users
reached a million miles they stopped
playing because it stopped being fun
there was no more reward to win they got
lifetime gold status right there was
just nothing to get out of the level
passed a minute using game terms strict
game terminology that was the boss level
of the game they beat the boss level
once they beat the boss level the games
not that much fun anymore right so three
four years ago you made it added
additional tiers beyond a million two
million three million they're not
necessarily thoughtful but they are
interesting because they point to the
fact that you have to constantly be
thinking about the game system and
constantly extending and redesigning it
I don't think that there is a there is
definitely not a magic like sprinkle
game sauce on something to make it taste
good there's no like you know there's no
like quick answer where you can like
just drop in one game mechanic and all
of a sudden man this thing that wasn't
working before now really hums you know
that that isn't the case these are
long-term engagement systems that we're
building and they will require care and
nurturing one of my big predictions and
then I think we got a wrap-up but one of
my big predictions is that I think every
company will have a chief engagement
officer we're
their staff whose a different kind of
discipline it's not quite marketing it's
about engagement whose responsibilities
you know encompass all the different
things that we've talked about so that
could be you for your personal problem
thank you all very much if you want to
continue the dialogue with me I'm on
