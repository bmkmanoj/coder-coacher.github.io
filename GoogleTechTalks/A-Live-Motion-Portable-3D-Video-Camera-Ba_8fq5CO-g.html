this video is going out on google video
so please save all confidential
questions till after the top I guess
I'll introduce everybody in the order
which I know them sitting over here is
no gorelik it was actually my boss for
nine years we worked on Mars software
together steve silverman here actually
built several of the Mars instruments
and is now working for dr. Roger
zehetner who started a company in the
90s to build a 3d camera system that
they're going to describe okay well
thank you very much we're going to talk
about a 3d video camera which basically
uses a laser like a normal camera would
use a normal 2d camera would use a flash
bulb and as a consequence that sometimes
called flesh ladar ladar is a short for
laser radar and so I'm as as Mike said
I'm the president of the company and
steve silverman is actually very
talented systems engineer who can
magically turn theoretical ideas into
actual hardware that works very
important person and and then once you
once you've developed the hardware you
have to turn it into something practical
and so you need software and so we
happen to have an old Orlick who himself
is a very magical guy and i think you're
going to be shocked and amazed and what
he was able to accomplish in in just a
very few weeks with no sleep so so i'll
start by by just talking bass a little
bit about ASC advanced scientific
concepts incorporated we're a sensor
design and fabrication company we've
been around since 1987 we've developed
different kinds of sensors from from
x-ray sensors to infrared sensors and
now finally we're doing a 3d
camera laser radar sensors and
essentially our claim to fame is that we
design things starting from the
integrated circuit everything that we've
ever done has been started off with a
cutting-edge integrated circuit and well
for for the 3d flash ladar it turned out
that that first we had to develop our
own lasers and then we had to develop
our own optics then we develop their own
mechanical systems so and that's because
we couldn't find anything off the shelf
that would work so now we essentially
systems engineer being the entire camera
from the integrated circuit all the way
through to make to the mechanical system
so what we have is a currently a camera
which has a focal plane array of 128 x
128 pixels now it could be a great deal
larger it could be 256 x 256 or 512 x
512 but 128 x 128 was was a useful
design to demonstrate this capability
and we generate 30 frames per second we
could again we could do a lot faster
than that but 30 frames a second again
was a very useful number similar to what
you would get from from a video camera
and so what we're talking about here is
something that's very much like a 2d
camera looks like a 2d camera it has a
lens like a 2d camera but actually
creates 3d images and I'll give you an
example of that in the next chart so
what are what are some of the
technological advantages what's out
there that also generates 3d and with
with a laser and laser scanners are out
there and what they tend to do is to
scan one pixel across in a region and
pixel by pixel create a
three-dimensional image and now what
we're doing is we're creating a whip
creating many many generating a 3d image
from many many pixels at one time for
example the 128 x 128 is sixteen
thousand pixels and
to go at 30 frames a second we're
generating a half a million pixels per
second whereas these scanners are a lot
slower than that and the other thing is
that they had when they scan they don't
take they have to take account of the
motion of the vehicle or and in addition
they can't take account of the motion of
an object that they're trying to see
well well if you're running 3d image
you're at 30 Hertz you're going to be
able to see birds flying Rockets flying
things things like that and and the
other advantage is that we can zoom our
cameras just like a conventional optical
system so here's an example let me just
escape this guy a second
if you looked at that the first part of
that that image was an ordinary visible
image but you wouldn't have recognized
that there's so much more information in
that image and this essentially shows
you the additional information this was
this was six frames that were stitched
together and texted with the visible ccd
camera and not only do you have the the
3d characteristics now this was taken
from one direction but you can measure
things so there's a enormous amount of
information that's available with with a
3d camera so here it is this way this is
what you would see with the 2d camera
this is what you would see with the 3d
camera and in addition you'd be able to
do measurements on it this is what it
looks like without the texturing and if
it was it this is taken at one kilometer
by the way in the Santa Barbara high
school and in its I safe so we even
though there might have been students in
there we we weren't endangering them and
if you went ahead and looked at the
range of say a flat object in this
particular image the range precision was
about 11 and a half inches at a
kilometre and this is what the camera
looks like and it's just as you would
expect looks very much like a a
two-dimensional camera way it works is
this is the laser section and laser
pulse is emitted and it strikes an
object the Pope's comes back is focused
by the received lens onto a focal plane
behind behind the lens just isn't in a
2d camera and we also have a couple a
couple 2d cameras this is this is a
visible camera and we also use infrared
that
x this section that's the laser section
the reason it's so large is we have fans
in here to cool the laser so this is an
error air cold laser and then behind
here are the cards that digitize the
signal and also provide the power for
the laser this particular laser is a 20
mil of jewel I mentioned it operates at
30 Hertz and this camera weighs 12
pounds now we didn't make any attempt to
reduce the weight of this system and if
if you ask well you know what what are
the relative weights of these various
pieces well this lens weighs about 5
pounds so you can see that this is that
this is a very very lightweight system
with the potential of becoming much more
lightweight actually we're really
looking at at the tip of the of the
technological iceberg in this system
this is a just the first prototype of
this kind of a of a camera one way of
thinking about it it to first order at
least is that this is a kilometer this
camera can take images at a kilometer
say you wanted to take images at half a
kilometer well that would be half as
much and if you square that you get one
fourth and that's roughly how you could
reduce the size weight and power of
these kinds of cysts and that's an
approximate figure force you do other
things to try to to try to do better
than just that factor now here is the
direction that we're going this is a
much smaller camera which does about the
about the same thing from an electronic
point of view and this is the focal
plane this is the 3d focal plane and in
the next chart i'll show you a little
bit more detail what the focal plane
looks like and of course you well there
it is the next chart you would need a
lens to to collect the light and focus
it on this focal plane and you would
need a laser to to produce the light but
if you're only interested in hundreds of
feet for example you wouldn't need a 20
mil of jewel laser you could use a much
smaller laser in this whole system would
be much smaller as well so let's take a
look at that focal plane what is it and
what you see is that it's composed of
what we call a relic a readout
integrated circuit and and a detector
array the detector what light hits the
detector a it converts that converts the
light to an electrical current you see
these little metal bumps well on the
other side of this is that as a metal
bump as well so the current goes through
these metal bumps typically the metal is
indium and then it goes into this
processor each unit cell has these are
called unit cells each unit self has a
the same circuitry in it and it has both
analog and digital functions it has a
counter a digital counter which counts
the light as the light goes out when the
when the light leaves the camera all of
these counters start and then when the
light comes back these counters stop
individually depending on how far the
far the objective and in addition we
capture the pulse shape with the with
the analog circuitry now in this format
we can use any kind of detector right
for example in the camera on the
previous previous chart we were using a
indium gallium arsenide detector array
and that allows us to use a nice safe
laser which is one point roi say flavors
1.57 microns if we want it to look
underneath the ocean we would use a
silicon detector array silicon is
responsible response at the visible
light Bluegreen penetrates water very
very well so you have a lot of options
in this kind of in this kind of design
all you if you have a particular light
in mind you just have to have a detector
that that that works with it now what
you end up doing
is wire bonding from these wire bond
pads to the circuit board that I showed
you in the previous and previous slide
and that's how you communicate with this
chip and the way information is read out
there's a there's what's called a
peripheral circuitry and that selects an
individual pixel and and needs the
information out through the peripheral
circuitry outer wire bond and then on to
that circuit board that that I showed
you now I want to illustrate there are a
lot of functions in this on this camera
and I'd like to illustrate them by
taking an example from your ordinary
life like you're flying around in your
own personal helicopter and that just
happened to see a dinosaur and so the
first thing you're going to want to do
is you want to go to want to photograph
it well I think what you should do is
take a three-dimensional image of it and
you might use the hard target mode and
so in the hard target mode you'd be
firing a pulse of broad pulse of light
the light would strike this entire
animal and the first pulse would be
reflected from the the mouth of the
animal come back and then you'd get the
neck of the animal and cotton and
eventually you'd get the entire animal
from like hitting it and coming back and
trippin trippin our counters and then
collecting the pulse shape and using the
pulse shape to give you a high
resolution image but suppose someone had
already captured your animal well then
you might want to take a look at if they
were treating them well and take a look
through the through the net and so you
could do that in the camera if you were
close enough to the net with the way we
capture pulses you could capture more
than one pulse and you could tell you
were getting reflection from the net or
from the animal or you can also suppress
the response the first response in other
words you can you can
program the camera to tell you when when
to turn on the the hard target response
and at that at that range you would be
hitting the net you would just end up
capturing the the the target in this
case the dinosaur well suppose it
happened to be hiding in the smoke but
you really wouldn't want to escape
getting that picture because that might
be unique picture and so you could
suppress the hard target response
completely and turn on your samplers at
some range into the end of the smoke and
and capture the returns from from from
the animal and process that data and
create the three-dimensional image also
now the reason you want to do that is
because you would end up triggering on
the the exterior of this smoke and you'd
never be able to penetrate inside so you
want to suppress the hard target
response and that's exactly what we do
in order to in order to see into the
ocean that's the that's the mode of
operation for not only seeing through
smoke and obscuration frog but also
seeing into the ocean water so I'm going
to turn this over to Steve but I just
want to emphasize the the differences
between this sensor and the mechanical
systems basically you end up with
mechanical systems are not dynamic they
distort images this flash is
instantaneous very very high data rates
in flash later and can be much greater
than than our camera we're registering
an entire open in scanning system you
really have to register every pixel as
individual and you have to register each
pixel individually and here we're
getting an entire frame of data at one
time hope all pixels are registered
automatically and but you end up if
you're going to to create a panoramic
view you have to register the frames and
that's what no will tell you about the
way
we're much lighter because we don't
really have a mechanical scanning system
and the size is the same thing the
scanners are limited in range because of
range ambiguity if you fire a pulse and
you're getting in return from a near
object and then you're firing another
pulse and that near object pulse comes
back before the second folks come back
you don't really know where it came back
from so there is range ambiguity with
respect to two-dimensional overlaying
very easy to overlay on a on a on an
array of three-dimensional data and
again you can zoom with with an optical
system so I'm going to turn it over to
Steve now who is going to talk to you
about different applications of this
technology thank you going ok ok ok he's
got me on ok hi nice to be here we've
been having a lot of fun Roger said he's
a mild-mannered physicist who had a
great idea and had lousy hardware
actually good hardware but it needed a
little bit of packaging and grouping and
refinement and when we did that we got
something like this this is something
that Knoll actually helped us with this
is taken from one position and how many
frames you think are on here there are
80 frames it is shot to this thing
basically turn on the camera and we just
start scanning it around and then this
comes out this is the sunken gardens in
Santa Barbara if you've ever been there
if you're going to go to prison this is
where you get sent to prison from it's
probably the last pretty sight you'll
see in Santa Barbara for a while the
nice thing about our system when looking
at the google sign up there that says at
the end of it equals MC squared we rely
on that see to get our range resolution
so this is a real time of flight system
the nice thing about it is single pulse
for each 128 x 128 means nothing moves
now i'll show you some examples of that
that will see was collected
about 10 seconds of division and he did
it with this camera basically by doing
this and panning up and down some of the
other things you can do with this like
Roger said it's a dynamic framing camera
we were trying to take pictures of
somebody throwing a football we missed
the football but we had some nice
cooperative birds flying through the
scene the picture on the left is our
test range it's looking out the front
out of out of our parking lot to our
unfortunate neighbors across the street
who have been spying on regularly their
blinds keep getting closed more and more
and more so it's okay this is just a
flock of pigeons that flew through the
scene this is this is the 3d data these
are not textured with visible this is
what and all of the data we're showing
you are uncorrected out of the camera no
pixel substitutions we don't take out
any bad pixels we don't do any smoothing
it's raw data so you can imagine what
this stuff will look like when we get to
clean it up the nice thing about this is
you can actually see some of the motion
on the bird wings if you put some color
on there which null has done on with
other things you could actually analyze
motion in flight with a rather crude
system when I say crude it's only 128 x
128 and if you the images on those don't
look great without the texturing this is
just a shot of it showing that I can
rotate this perspective around this
again was only running at about eight
Hertz or 10 Hertz and each area images a
full frame single pulse we wanted to see
how people were walking and this data is
about a year old at this point we took
our mechanical engineer he's also the
youngest guy there and we said okay you
go out lay on the ground for a while and
he did and he was happy about it and
this is a sequence again looking the
first one was the perspective of the
camera we can rotate it up you'll see
the things bouncing in and out it's
because this was prior to Knoll and this
application auto scales the range and so
the data is not really bouncing it's the
display tool it's pretty fun to see this
and we have not applied the range to the
x and y and z so the perspectives are
not are not to scale you can see in the
background his shadow projected on the
cars on the windows is because we bring
our own flashlight our flashlights lives
right here on this camera it just
happens to be rather exotic one it's
about a five nanosecond pulse it's an
air-cooled laser we had to build it
ourselves because we couldn't find
anybody that built what we needed so we
just the 12 of us got together and came
up with a laser design that dinosaur we
call a gel or electrical engineer and we
plant him behind these things these are
venetian blinds that are obscured
they're probably about fifty percent
visibility or maybe only thirty percent
visibility again if you range gate since
we're not integrating we're just
sampling you're not knocked out by that
first return on to venetian blind so
that's why you can see past it there are
other technologies that can range gate
but they take successive pulses so if he
was running around back there we could
tell you what he was doing the nice
thing is is you can tell if this guy's
walking away from you holding somebody's
hand or if he's pointing something at
you it might change your response in
that situation so it's a this is one of
the earliest uses that people were
interested in for this type of system
again here is just the two two shots of
what you can see now I can just leave
this camera in this mode if I know I
want to look past the venetian blinds I
can just leave it in the mode on the
right and have the movie run in real
time there because we have this area ray
imager and all we care about is returned
since we're not integrating again if I
get any light back to me I can see it it
turns out fog smoke dust big drops of
rain or have a pretty good mean free
path to an object and back which means
on any given pulse I see a lot of the
signal coming back and because it's an
area ray we can piece that back together
and the thing on the left is what you'd
see if you were driving your car and the
scene on the right is what you'd see if
you're driving your car with a little
ASC camera attached to it of course your
car would be worth quite a bit and then
these are the two shots of it we also
wanted to see how dust was turns out
that in certain deserts the sand there
is like cornstarch so we put cornstarch
inside of a tent got a leaf blower we
put a dummy that's actually a dummy not
a person back there it's a karate dummy
and you can see that you can actually
see through extremely dense particulars
which is another fun item we've also
looked through pouring rain and liquid
rain does not we haven't seen much
attenuation at all at over kilometers
vapor is a little work a little harder
to see through then then salt water and
that says well yes we can do under water
type of work this is just a if you pull
out the contrast on the right again no
smoothing nothing done and this one we
just stretch the contrast this we're
still trying to decide if it's me or
optical engineer his name is Brad short
who's 64 we flew this little twin otter
plane out of Oxnard we mounted our
camera in the bottom of this and we
collected some data flying around oh
this is looking straight down we were
only up about a thousand feet you'll see
it's a little hard to tell but the
things there's two cars parked there
there's a fence as it gets on the side
you can actually see the profile on the
fence and we were looking down on the
top of a roof line and you can rotate
that roof line around again no visible
textured on this this is that the 3d all
by itself
and then these are just a couple of
images they actually can measure the
height of the chimney you can measure
the roofline you can measure the where
the cars are you can see if the guy is
violating any codes or you can see if
this or your house if you could violate
some code than no one would capture you
catch you this was the this was a
coolest thing we were flying over oxnard
airport and they do trainings with
helicopters this helicopter was doing
touch and goes on the runway we flew
over the top of it it's off the ground
that's not an error in our algorithm and
that blade on the top is actually in
motion the tip of that blade is moving
about as fast as a small missile so we
freeze the blade in flight this was a
single shot just a single pulse of the
laser and also illustrating it now even
the visible image if we put it on here
that blade would be a blur so and this
again shows that that blade is actually
about that wide we've measured it it's
about the right width of a blades that's
a single pulse that some no scanner can
do that type of work now the fun thing
for me hardware guy um I was lucky
enough to send stuff up to Mars there's
good and bad things about that
everything you build has a very finite
window of schedule and then when it gets
there if it doesn't turn on you get a
stomachache um they've all turned on but
still I'm doing a demo I'm nervous is
this thing going to work I hope it does
but these are things that we've played
around with in the upper left hand
corner you can see one of our early
systems that's a 15 inch laptop screen
on the side of it is a little flash lamp
laser it's about this big that's about
four or five years old now Knoll says
that's the one we should bring and show
people but it's a one-shot type of
camera we can take a picture about every
five or ten seconds this thing is 30
shots a second and it's not much bigger
so on the left you can see systems we
built we put some in gimbals we have the
camera I'm demonstrating here we have
breadboard cameras we actually build the
electronics or self it's really cool in
this place we design the chips
we design the circuit boards we do the
layouts we specify the parts we grab a
bag of parts we send them out they get
stuffed we test them we get their chips
hybridized somewhere we wire bond them
onto the boards ourselves we design our
own optics we get the glass in we
designed the metal we get that we put it
together we design our own lasers or own
laser illuminators you put all that
together and from that perspective it's
a really fun mix of people there because
I've got all the disciplines and I'm a
systems engineer so I just I like it I
don't have to be an expert I just get to
put it together this is what happens
when you put it together you get a nice
reasonably compact design it just runs
into a frame grabber interface we use a
couple of little Kensington power
supplies to basic laptop power supplies
that runs the whole thing laser and
camera and it's this camera is one watt
so it's not like a processor in your
computer that's running at whatever
they're running at these days I'll be
wrong tomorrow it's running at about 450
megahertz but it's a wat you can you
know you can't even tell it's on there's
the fan noise you hear is just cooling
the laser so we can rent it 30 Hertz if
I ran it at five Hertz I wouldn't have
to have any fans at all I can air cool
it before I get on to Knohl stuff I'm
going to switch the monitor cable over
to here i'm going to show you a picture
just looking down the hall and no will
show you what we did yesterday running
around it was a very cool google let us
run around on the roof and take pictures
of their campus that's that's an
unusually an unusual event so let's just
switch this over and this is the nervous
part can I find the plug okay one down
and now I gotta do this monitor
below
this is my turn it might be your turn
well it did it on the yellow monitor I
don't see it seeing it
it's not projected please the screen
resolution is set to 1024 x 768 well the
screen resolution is too high why don't
we jump to your stuff I'm probably the
best thing if you come up afterwards I
can show you the camera operation on
this monitor I can tell you about it
though real quickly the camera boots up
essentially instantaneously with this
laser 14 Milla jewel laser down here
this is the laser part laser power
supply interface board camera this
camera stopped down into an aperture
this big so in theory I can take that
lens make it about that big stick it on
that little handheld camera and I can
take pictures of what exactly what knoll
has shown you this is the configuration
we used all day yesterday if I want to
go further I can just open up this
aperture so everything worked but the
projector so I'm sorry about that but
come on up afterwards and we'll show you
the camera operating
my hand a change
that might I might I might lose my
control window though hey give those up
um it was up on this monitor it worked
on the yellow monitored with that same
screen resolution so we pay around this
data collected I will identity seen your
snail
this is an action in sales call it's
just kind of I came here I met work with
you guys is pretty cool don't run bars
when i get done work with these bags and
supreme quality vs why not learn how to
make the Pacific cool Jesus here now so
at some point that was gonna grab is
comfortable nothing where you saw it
alright so this is
this is right in front of no-name cafe
if we throw it around you'll kind of see
what it is this is a couple hundred
frames stuck together and from this
perspective it's what we call camera
perfect the this is exactly what the biz
camera saw stuck on our 3d pixels and
you can't really tell it's 3d yet zip
around here and we will see what we can
do here
so yesterday there was some kind of
carnival thingy going on out there
there's the tents there's the google
logo up there you know you can see a
nice square feature on this building and
this software is about a week old I
wouldn't even call it alpha yet so nice
ground down here so around the trees
kind of caused some problems with with
visibility I'm going to go back here for
a second let sit back down to the ground
see we're under here
um I'm actually back up one more step
and get the whole view here
I'm leaning sideways so this is probably
giving you guys all kinds of seasickness
here all right I really am going
somewhere with this honest
so the soccer has a flashlight mode
where you can see individual frames
painted in that's each individual frame
as we took it they're registered
together I'm heading over here to the
sign there we go that's what I wanted so
we can zoom in on this guy peeing around
on him
stick our axis over there somewhere near
at
so there's the backside of the sign that
we couldn't see and so it got said two
times I made I made both of them say it
totally raw data I mean I'm literally
taking the data straight out of the
camera and throw it in a 3d viewer so
the clean up that can be down here is is
phenomenal but you know we took this 12
hours ago or something like that and and
then so we go back into flashlight mode
we see the other frames around it and
get it somewhere we like it you can
actually kind of come around here to the
tree I'll pull the back this way and
then we'll in flashlight mode here in a
second as we back up all the way and so
there you go
our pixels are our pixels are well
they're 128 of them the visit camera
we've got on here is a 512 camera so
there's literally four times the number
of this pixels as we have IR pixels and
so we can make use of that this dunk
tank thingy here has a sign on it that
we can kind of read even though there's
only a couple of IR pixels on this you
know the bars on that cage are really
thin and but because they're all
textured on you get a lot more detail
than the IR camera really has and so you
get some pretty cool up and scenes
there's a guy standing in here maybe
it's one of you guys
nobody i recognize he's a real far away
so that's kind of one data set i'm going
to show you another one now
that's how Ron is it's reading directly
from the camera file and it does that so
alrighty same team monk Bronx wrong one
up here sorry my bad
Mary so this is one of the ones we took
from the roof same height same deal when
it starts off your in-camera perfect
mode but you know you can zoom in pretty
much anywhere one of the cool things
about this camera is that sees through
all kinds of stuff so if your office
happens to be in the second floor of 43
right there we were watching you
yesterday you can see the tents those
are the tent roofs in the in the
building this is not the ID field
solution to see what I'm doing here so
stick our rotational axis down there
somewhere and kind of play with it
so we're hoping to get a full 3d map of
the quad frankly the software is not
that far along yet but it's pretty cool
all right so one more this one actually
kind of demonstrates the 30 frames per
second pneus and that's really the novel
part about this camera you can take some
stereo cameras out there you could take
a scanning lidar get a nice map of the
building people will do that for you
this this is different
there
so this was I don't know we were 300 400
feet away from the gantry way right here
yeah this one right here
what the long gantry way anyway so
there's a guy role in a mail cart
through we're going backwards for a
minute and it was a couple more people
right after them and so you can actually
you know we're looking through this
building we can kind of map the inside
of this building go through the back
wall back here we've got range on this
back wall you know before you guys had
stood up we'd see your head so you know
it's just cool stuff and we weren't even
running at full late year this was ten
10 Hertz so we can run at 30 frames a
second if you have need and we had we
have just a real general purpose lens on
this we were photographing from the roof
from the hive everywhere everywhere we
could so at one point we just pointed it
this wall and took a picture if we were
actually trying to photograph people in
here we'd use much higher resolution
lens who'd have gotten much smaller
finer pixels on that thing and you know
so you can see if that was cool I
thought you guys to think it was cool
so that's my demos I got 12 more if
anybody's interested but you know it's
the quad and other people so I think
that's our talk
you to hook up yeah that's right all
right when we're trying and see if we
can hook up the actual camera here
but we actually looks like it's going to
work so anyone want to volunteer for 3d
photo
we be recruiting it yeah we can save
something yeah lets you being did it
there sure i'll ever pose a serious
question or not we'll take it actually
go stand by the mailbox
hurt yay fellow we got standing over
there that's an old picture let me just
take one the way this works I'll just
start running pictures that's live and
you're going okay well why can't I see
him well right
shingle into there so this is that slice
mode I said we Sam we capture slices so
in that slice mode i'm going to start
with slice one and i'm going to step
through and if you lot watch the ground
that's the cool part this is a single
pulse from the laser and you can see
that pulse moving so if you us you know
Star Trek okay I watched it I still do
photon torpedo right there's nothing in
space to scatter the light back so all
right you can't see a photon torpedo but
if you had scattering media out there
and you could add one of these cameras
you could see this blob of 5 foot blot
of light moving down the hallway and
that's what you're seeing okay now if I
take that and I take that blob of light
and I know the time to it I'm not doing
it live but I'll take one so I can also
integrate those up so I just see the
brightest one each and I'm taking
pictures at about three frames a second
hold it out to your side there you go
okay so if i stop that which is there's
a perfect position and I I make a 3d
image of this here's a 3d image of it
and now in our crummy viewer pre no 3d
skin does not reflect very well at 1.57
but the rest of the image is there I can
move it around now I haven't put the
right perspectives on here I can stretch
it out so you get the right perspectives
I can do other things that if you really
don't like them I can measure the
distance to him he is 50 point 36 feet
away so I'm really tired of looking at
him so I'll set this new range for 60
feet and he should go away and he's gone
ok so there's our you can come on back
the camera operation is really rather
simple I can adjust the sensitivity on
the camera I can adjust the amplifier
gain and I can set my range windows and
I can move my range windows around this
is a very complex engineering screen its
really three buttons that you tweak and
you start it up and run it
the visible image that you're looking at
that goes with this is a very for camera
it's it's as good as you can do it's
it's a few years old it's something we
had because we cared about 3d this
really bad camera was what was used to
create those images that Knoll used I
think it's a 1024 x 1280 or something by
12 square it's a pipe told square
because we reduce the resolution but you
can imagine if you put a couple thousand
by a couple thousand pixels on there and
you cleaned up the bad pixels and you
did smoothing and nearest neighbor
averages and histogram equalization this
stuff would just light up and look
really good so now that concludes our
talk and I think we're ready to
entertain any questions you may have
just take some pictures oh just turn it
on sequence mode for here for a second I
only did you a sequence yes okay I'm
might work planner you want to point it
at the crowd and see if we can see him
it was like it'll work example of there
okay ready yeah
we're going to take a quick sequence
here go hey done so we take a quick
sequence of you know was gonna do
something with it I think not oh you're
gonna play I can play it back you got a
3d it'll be slow but you can see they
don't care okay so we can play this
thing back slowly because this computer
isn't knowles and let's see if I sit
down with ten fifteen forty it's either
side okay
right so run it and let's do think I
have to open that up
auto 3d slice play in the background
this will just be playing what we saw we
started over here and we're sweeping
across and it has a hard time up real
close because this wasn't designed for
real close stuff and again I haven't
stretched this out but if I do play
around with this and rotate this around
maybe zoom this back in
it really likes running at a hundred
feet to 300 feet that's a really good
range this is about the toughest thing
to do and especially with skin how close
it's it can be set to work better here
so again this is this is still engineers
building this thing there's no produce
ability on it it's all handmade it would
be really fun in our next generation to
have that whole camera fit inside of a
beer can so that I'm ready to entertain
questions how would you answer oh how
bright is the pulse compared to ambient
sunlight well that's a tough one to
answer because ambient sunlight has a
very broad spectrum this is a 14
millijoules it's only five nanoseconds
long compared to sunlight it's brighter
than the Sun if you could see in the
infrared but it's 1.57 so it doesn't
penetrate your cornea so the energy
density on your cornea is about three
orders of magnitude i'm guessing lower
than what the Sun energy would be on
your on the cornea of your eye
our students
a partner
what happens always compare the the
question was if you put this on your car
for for observation or collision
avoidance what would happen if every car
has one with the interfere it's a very
good question one thing we do sample
pulses coming back so we can encode
those pulses we actually have another
program where it does have encoded
pulses so that you could differentiate
on these between the cards and also the
time of interaction is very short and
the intensity levels could be
differentiated but that is something
that you would have to work out there
are solutions for it but as is there's a
possibility of interaction your pulse
durations on the order of 200
nanoseconds and if you're sampling at 30
frames a second there's a very long time
between pulses and if the lights not
very dense in time
if I partisanship
oh you can you can also ship the
frequencies I'm just repeating Rogers
answer you can also ship frequencies and
have some coordination interaction it's
something it could be dealt with
so that 43 was wasn't it it was that
just they that was actually all those
scenes were from one point of view they
were all just a pan we intentionally
collect oh he asked if we've tried
mining multiple scenes to fill in the
spots that are obscured I'm all over it
that's that's what I do when I'm not
sleeping which doesn't happen much so
yeah we intentionally collected two
scenes separated by about 120 degrees in
the on the ground and then when we got
on the roof we collected basically the
same two scenes at the same distance so
that should fill in just about
everything when this software is more
than a week old then you know we'll be
on it
how much trouble are specular
reflections it's my gosh I'm happy this
thing really dislikes cars car
reflectors are intended to to reflect
and so those suck other than that not
too bad the glassy buildings weren't a
problem trees amazingly are on an awful
problem we get a lot of pulse hits near
trees I'm eat it
Oh every time I complain about one of
these things they say oh yeah that's in
the next version it's already fixed so
right now it's bad but it's better
tumbled about reflectors is a it's not
so much a problem general problem
there's a solution what happens right
now is we get that much energy density
and a part of the array and it robs our
power supply solution is a bigger power
supply or other changes to the circuitry
we've solved that we just haven't
implemented it but it's a problem for
everything a dynamic range issue like
that it will obscure things around it
locally probably always UTX plans to use
multiple cameras imel taneously
interferometry array style
it's not this isn't a coherent style of
camera so we haven't tried to do
something like that but you could you
could actually in theory do what you're
suggesting to do time and to do an
amplitude and phase and basically get
hologram holographic information for the
other way to think about it is it's a
really a tomographic type of operation
we could do that we haven't really had
an application for it and since we're a
small company were completely contract
driven if somebody sent us money then it
would be fun but 10 I sorry I didn't
repeat the question was can we do
holographic or can we do interfering
metric type of imaging with this test
going off of that so what are the sort
of application that you guys can see if
this moment I guess what the military
they are unfortunately except for where
you're all lucky enough to work where
you generate a lot of of income I'm
assuming we have we're we're basically
driven by government government
contracts or government grants and right
now almost all of that is coming from
SBIR type of thing or military branches
of the military so we have contracts
with nearly every branch of the military
we have almost no contracts with non
military branches of the government
that's applications submarine site since
this thing works underwater you can get
a 3d model around the sub pretty darn
easily any kind of scene surveillance
you know you mount one of these on top
of a SWAT van when it drives up to a
scene you scam the entire area reverse
the view to the guys inside the house
and see where they can't see that's all
very very trivial the the other
applications are collision avoidance
projectile detection basically robot
vision those those types of things and
you can imagine you know what everybody
wants to do with them but the motion
part is pretty cool because you can
actually compute trajectory and speed
from two successive frames pretty easily
you've got 3d coordinates of the object
it's really straightforward it's true 3d
trajectories it's true trajectory not so
close to the young I might as well the
stockbroker now
okay Gail stitch these braids together
hi risks yeah they're both we're
continually doing hardware modifications
form factor matters a lot and these are
very very difficult chips to design a
lot of companies have tried to do it and
they haven't been successful and as a
result it's very difficult to not just
design the chip but also the interface
to the chip it's not impossible and it's
easy for us because we've learned all
the mistakes but then there's all the
other ancillary stuff if I wanted to do
pictures in a room like this I would
have a very different system than one
that I want to put up at 20,000 feet
doing remote sensing this one actually
will do 20,000 feet to about 9 feet it
doesn't do all that well here because
this is way too bright and that's way
too big so I can do a really nice job in
here if I you haven't noticed we've got
this stuck down like really really far
and it needs to be smaller and so I
could have a pinhole camera and do this
room so I can make a really compact
system and the laser is way over sized
for here by about almost a factor of 100
two orders of magnitude question in the
back
the question is can use x-rays with this
that was before I started with the
company but Roger had projects to do
x-ray imaging one answer that here you
run difficulty with x-ray imaging is
that there aren't any real x-ray lenses
so you have to block the light block the
x-rays so you couldn't really do x-ray
imaging with this system
question is how large to our 3d video
files get we don't have a 3d video file
yet we have the data dump from the
camera which is actually all 20 slices
they collect about a gigabyte per minute
now because we're sending down our raw
data we can reduce that by an order of
magnitude by just putting the 3d
algorithm into the gate array which is
there's plenty of room in the gate array
on the camera right now we process it in
the computer it's because the algorithm
is still in the state of flux so that
would cut that down to 100 megabytes a
minute and then we could compress that
because there's lots of redundant or
empty data to at least another factor of
2 lossless so it gets it down there it's
still a lot of data we in our imaging
yesterday we collected 10 gig of data
there's a question in the middle
are you voting too
largest
the question is that we worked much with
more advanced visualization techniques
and the answer is no the answer is we
are the other the desire is to do that
but it's that's the next phase
did you hear that
we register the 2d data and take the
pose from the 2d data and apply it to
the 3d your mixed
what this um how do we get them is how
do you get the pose information and
behind that
they could um the question though the
question was found to make it smaller
lighter and cheaper could we use I think
you asked about holographic optical
elements here instead of lens materials
and they could and it's something that
we've looked into but it's for what
we're trying to do for recognization
things like that this was a more
standard technology and it's just not as
off the shelf as this but it's actually
very sound idea
the size of it is the size of our
sensing elements we these are yes the
it's a 128 x 128 array the pixels are
the pitch is 100 micron pitch in both
axes all the circuitry lives behind each
one of those 100 100 micron 100 micron
pixels with a little bit of circuitry
around the edges for some conditioning
it's got two output amplifiers the laser
pulse energy is compared to what you
might get out of the solid-state laser
like cd-rom fighters
I'm not sure what's in I think the
cd-rom writers are micro Joule per pulse
but I really don't know that that this
is twenty millijoules per pulse about a
factor of a hundred over we can do this
job with a laser diode the trouble is
with the way our chip is designed it
wants pulses from about four nanoseconds
to 10 nanoseconds the laser diodes that
are out there either produce two
nanoseconds or they produce hundreds of
nanosecond pulses there's nothing in
that window but in this room you
certainly could do it with a single
laser diode and we're trying to figure
out how to get to that solution very
cheap right now we use big pump laser
diodes and it's very inefficient because
we're pumping a cavity so it's only
about two percent efficient while small
plug efficiency okay I guess that's the
last of the questions if anybody wants
to come up and look at the camera ala
will be here for a little while longer
and thank you for hosting us appreciate
