working in the accessory team in Dublin
and today i will present talk about the
linux telephony something completely
unrelated to it but anyway s so i
already gave the presentation of this
kind on this year at avalyn extreme
position and what I how I want this
presentation to be different from the OS
is I have a significant introduction
large enough introduction for the people
who are completely new to the telephony
if you feel that the introduction is
overly detailed over long or if you have
any questions you feel free to interrupt
me in the course of my presentation so
let's go this is the approximate outline
of my presentation so I will start with
the introduction of two generations of
telephony which is the traditional
telephony and the words called voice IP
packets which telephony I have bill
mentioned how to implement voice
services on the linux and using the
commodity hardware and i will briefly
talk about the current state of the
linux telephony engineer so for the
introduction as i mentioned i will
distinguish two kinds of telephony
services but they are both telephony so
they haven't come on a couple of basic
things the one of those is that the in
telephony we always have a conversation
which is the bi-directional major
transfer either voice or if you go to
the
more modern installations it can be
video conference in color then you when
you set up the conversation you need the
basic ways to control this so you need
the ways to do a call setup or Kotov
down and so called advanced functions
which is the cove origin call transfer
and wants a party they they are called
advanced but they are now coming to them
all telephony so I start with the
traditional telephony because this is
the little if only that everybody used
right now so the traditional telephony
is what we call the public stationary
telephone network this is basically what
the public stationary telephone network
is the same as the internet for the all
those interconnected networks so this is
the network of telephones addressable by
their phone numbers which you can dial
and the PSTN right now includes not only
their stationary phones which is the
plain old telephone system like oh wires
but also a mobile phones they thing that
usually called public land on your
network and the customers to this
network I usually customers are and all
customers and they usually connected by
an archetype lines in the plain old
telephone system but if you have a cell
phone the digital conversion is in your
phone but your this you still and all
customer voice in pstn networks in
general a circuit-switched so which
means that the code the call setup ways
you establish a circuit from one
customer from
one subscriber to another the other
party and the customer a and the circuit
between them consist of multiple
circuits of many types for example to
analog circuits from you to you exchange
and from exchange of another party to
another party and digital circuits which
is called the digital signal one circuit
also called the bureau channel in ISDN
it's the basic digital circuit of the
voice in the stn so this is the
approximately how it does when you call
and because it is super switched the
circuit is seized for all time off of
your discussion so you basically just
reserved this bandwidth oil and so while
I talked about the digital circuits and
I mentioned that we also establish the
circles between the exchanges in the
middle of the conversation a usually the
exchanges are connected together by
trunk lines which consists of multiple
circuits multiple video sockets and this
is usually a one or t1 lines e 1 is
Europe and t1 is the America and the
basic characteristics are on the slide
basically of the slides and when someone
talks about signaling protocols and
signaling in PSTN this is the call
control and management protocols which
is used to do the call setup or tip down
or various functions or call routing and
they control the state of the piston
network itself so there are various
signaling types which aim mentioned on
the slide I will make the slides
available but
I will talk about a couple of them for
example the subscriber were so strong
signaling is the subscriber signal Inc
is used on your subscriber line for
example if you use the analog phone then
signaling protocol on your analog line
is the DTMF signaling there beeps that
you won't produce when you dial the
numbers and the drug signaling is
performed on the trunks and there are
different kind of trunk protocols which
I mentioned which all international on
the next slide so I don't know if you
can see this I prepared it for the Linux
symposium so basically basically the two
per signaling protocol sale one to
mention in details is the signaling
system 7 and ISDN q.931 a signaling
system 7 is the de facto standard of
interconnecting the all exchanges in the
world so all phone exchanges are large
and small I using the ssl to talk to
each other and this protocol is out of
band which means that signaling
transferred via different circuits than
data this is the one on the properties
of signaling protocol which mention was
mentioned on the previous slide and this
is general in generally good because a
bit of history lesson 20 years ago
probably there were a different
signaling system as a standard signaling
system 5 which was inbound and if you
have an in-band signaling then you
basically can forge this signals of the
signaling protocol and do what's called
freaking
so anyway and the this is seven is there
not a single protocol but the protocol
stack which is can be represented by the
same model as the usual network stack
and is extensible so for example when
well networks were introduced we were in
need of new protocols to control the
state of mobile network and the state of
the customers like the subscriber
registration and the so-called
identification and h VAR interrogation
and short messages SMS messages all
those are implemented in the protocols
called transaction control application
protocol and mobile application part so
basically there are extensions which run
transparently on the whole network
infrastructure there is DN q.931 is
another signaling protocol but it is
used mostly between the PBXs private
branch exchange and the carrier
exchanges it is much easier to set up it
doesn't require the complex routing set
up of SSL and but it gives some
limitations in the design for example in
ss7 we can as I said because it's
autoban signaling clear and the
signaling over different circles and in
seven we can basically run it totally
different ways so voice data ran over
the lines which are latency sensitive
and the signaling Quran over the other
lines which not so not so fast
and latency is not so good but they are
more reliable in terms of packet loss or
data loss so in q.931 it is my
simplified because it was it was
basically intentional you usually use
what single a one or single t1 line to
connect the pbx to carry but anyway it's
the digital it's similar signaling
protocol which is used right now and
there are a couple of other absolute and
duplicated signaling protocols which is
which I mentioned on the bottom line of
the slide but they usually duplicate it
but they are still used in the in some
old installations by the way you can
find the complete analog systems in all
the installations but this is the
different story anyway so as much about
the signaling protocols and right now
i'll talk a short introduction to
pockets which telephony to voice acting
and when someone talks about voice IP
usually means the services and the
protocols and the technologies to route
calls over their opinion talk so by the
way how IP network works are what we get
from the voice IP is the packet switch
telephony which means because the
underlying network a packet-switched but
we still need the bidirectional
conversation we still need to talk to
other party so we built a virtual
circuit over the packet network the
problems here are because in PSTN when
we build the circuit it stays the same
all over the time of the conversation
and you have the same vein bandwidth and
the same way tension here we run over
the network which can
every time and which have its own
weather in the terms of bandwidth and
latency so this is the difference which
caused by their packet vs circuit
switched and there are protocols which
so-called voice IP protocols which are
kind of used to do this and there are
various types of protocol cycle
mentioned the most widespread the most
widespread is the cheap session
initiation protocol or and h.323 those
are essentially those signaling
protocols big because as in traditional
telephony we have two types of data
which passed between the nodes in our
network we have a media the audio data
or a video which need to be passed to
other party and with obvious latency
requirements and we have a signaling
which used to control this so the sip
and h.323 have signaling protocols and
they basically used to describe the
endpoints to each other or to central
server which will route the call and
when all the sessions it up in Seaport
323 is completed then RTP so-called real
time protocol which is the Sun protocol
over the UDP is used to transfer data
and preferably it is used to transfer
data between the endpoints without even
if we had intermediate routing for our
signaling we need to transfer data
between the endpoints to minimize
latency and the
a general in general to minimize the
word on the routers there are also IEX a
inter asterisk exchange protocol which
was invented by the authors of one of
the open source software packages
asterisk I will talk about later in I ax
both signaling can media transferred in
a single string and this girl advantages
and disadvantages advantages that we can
easily penetrate the net and
disadvantage is that as I said we need
the in seaport 323 case we can route the
media directly between in points here we
need to pass the media through our
server which will process it there are
also all also other protocols such as
sccp or mgcp they usually they used for
some on the load generic like a sheep or
a 323 for example mgcp is major gateway
control protocol which is used to
control media gateways basically and/or
HTTP is the proprietary cisco protocols
which is used only cisco IP phones and
some of those protocols require server
to operate and some aren't required so
oh so much about the signaling and how
it works in general but we still need to
pass out your data between our link
points so after the call setup is done
and all there for example we choose the
RTP to transfer the media but we need to
encode your voice and pass the other
party and another particle decode and
this is the part which is handled by
voice codec
and the there are plenty of voice codecs
out there the problem is that the most
popular good codecs like g 7 to 9 is
patented and other products wrap some
free codecs for example speaks which is
very good but it isn't used in consumer
equipment so when you're trying to
create some network using some cumin
some equipment which designed for voice
IP you will need to deal with this and
not to all of those codecs are invented
for OSAP for example 3 7 11 is how is
the PSTN code so as I mentioned you use
the digital da 0 to transfer voice in
PSTN and the voices encode it uses using
g 7 11 and in your cell phones you use
gsm 610 pollock so any questions about
introduction if you have please ask i
may squeeze the part but anyway no
questions so let's talk about the
implementing voice IP so in voice IP
network we will have basically two types
of unknowns the first type is the end
point so endpoint is what generates the
audio data there the voice below
actually and it talks some voice IP
protocol so it can connect either to the
voice IP server or to some boy sapient
point and pass the payload in two
directions so one example of the end
point is there a soft form another
example of the end point is this
voice IP heart phone which is plug 2008
and the other type of the note is the
soft switch and the source which is or a
voice IP server is white cold soft which
because it functions like a switch in a
traditional network so it does it can do
for example the intimate registration it
can do a code switching actual call
switching which means between two
endpoints if one calls other it will do
all call setup and all media transfer
will be handled by this and in can do
some advanced functions which I
mentioned as advanced in the
introduction slight Lake multi-party
conversation some hope forwarding or
whatever and because it is soft switch
it is basically it's a software we can
do almost anything here so especially if
we take some open source software to do
this we can extend this as we want and
modern open source or voice AP packages
can basically use any scripting language
to extend themselves and you can for
example right and ivr interactive voice
response or some of the responding
system or can take open source speech
recognition software and do something
with this some are the two special cases
of the voice IP services is the
multi-protocol switches and signaling
process and the soft witches with the
PSTN interface so the later is basically
the gateway which is integrated with the
soft switch so
power directly you can if your protocol
oh okay the question was is it necessary
to have a soft switch or you can call it
directly there there are protocols which
require server to operate and in in this
case you will need a soft switch but if
your protocol allows you to call
directly then you can you can do this
directly for example h.323 can call
directly between endpoints are also with
sheep and it's just so the former is
multi-protocol so switches and the
signaling probe sees the one particular
example of this kind as I said both sip
and h.323 uses the same protocol to
transfer the payload the RTP which means
that if you write some code coaxial
called signaling proxy you can integrate
sip and h.323 network so you can have a
bunch of devices which talk HD two three
by a bunch of devices which talks it and
they will talk to this server but media
will be passed directly between them
because the server will expose the IP
addresses of other party to each other
and everything will work so the couple
of examples of the voice IP software as
I said about the endpoints we have a
clients which I endpoints and dedicated
Hardware clients or a soft phones I
mentioned a couple of soft phones of
open source of trans for protocol three
she also mentioned so sip a three to
three and AIX I also mentioned skype i
should mention a google talk here
Hayley and there are also soft phones
because they are well the conversation
but anyway the skype uses the some
proprietary protocol and we will talk
use some open protocol which we can
currently find implement it anywhere so
the servers this is the most famous and
most widespread server package is the
asterisk and it's the open source of
course and if you install it if you want
to play with it you can install it and
you will get up out of the box see pi X
and working AVR so you can use any sip
softphone and call your freshly
installed us to risk and basically play
with the telephone and it will work okay
and this is the result of more than I
think more than 45 years of daily there
are other software packages out there
for example yet it's the completely
different architecture from asterisk it
started the couple of years later and
then architecture is much cleaner you
can look at it if you want also 8 is
less feature complete an asterisk
asterisk has a lot of convenience
functions called applications and then
eh it's just the basic engine it's very
fast but its basic if you want to extend
it you need to write a lot of God and
there are also packages which I
mentioned bottom line also but they're
less well known except probably the
first to call uber and free speech which
I will talk about them later so this is
all of those packages all of those
software for the recipe servers are of
course run on Linux
and the the question is is the max voice
IP ready so do we have anything to
improve here also I think that Linux is
mostly voice IP rating so what we need
to do basically when you do voice IP
only on Linux you ofcourse any any TCP
implementation can handle the signaling
protocol world I mean there are not so
much data transfer there what hurts is
UDP so as I said you can in some
protocols you can post dated between the
end points directly and then some
protocol see you need to pass data
through the server or you need to pass
data through the server if you need to
transcode it because one of your devices
can only talk g.711 and another device
can only talk speaks or for example g 7
to 9 and the transcoding takes cpu time
but even if you don't transcribe if you
just transfer the data through the
server the payload packets are very
small and you need to process them with
their minimum latency which means that
in the ideal case your application will
wake up on the on each packet to process
it and then send it so this is basically
the wake up storm of some kind and this
is this is really hurts when you have a
large number of clients transferring the
UDP data through your voice NT server
there are a couple of ways to solve this
problem the one way is I mentioned it as
a letter to avoid this problem so you
can design this need your network not to
place not to pass data through your
servers or you can just split the load
across the servers because you can load
balance those services for me
but if you're really concerned about it
and you have six month of time you can
probably implement something like the
net channels which is the complete
networking step in user space or if you
have a similar project here in Google
called the metrics it's basically the
same you move the networking to user
space and you colonel does on the
receive receive the packets and put it
into the memory buffer which is mapped
to your use of space application this
reduces the purchasing cover head of
multiple layers and Colonel but this
also removes all security like and such
kind of stuff but that's why why I
mentioned that this is not really useful
in general but can be used here and so
this is with UDP and another thing that
is required for voice Appian is the just
basic things like said the CPU scheduler
and the high precision timers but the
least ding you 26 currents things
started to improve here especially in
next ayee in last two months the CFS
scheduler and all this cpu scheduler
rewrite I think this will continue to
improve but basic already in place so i
can say that Linux is voice app already
so list to go to the PSTN connection
what I want to do is I want to take my
linux box which is the commodity
hardware and which works and which works
is was voice IP and I need to connect it
to the PSTN to handle the traditional
phone calls so the reasons why I want to
do here on this slide is the telephony
hardware costs way too much and the
telephony hardware is way less flexible
than our software solution
do basically anything we want on our
software but something vendor some
vendor equipment that you buy will just
you know a lot of all this and so so you
can you can also easily outperform your
vendor equipment on the community
equipment if you do everything right or
even if you don't out outperform it with
a single box for the same price you can
buy ten boxes and you will still perform
it and you can also achieve the
reliability by connecting you know by
using the bootcamp connections ethernet
and put one you one interface into each
box and if you want some I don't know
ten connections you use transfers and
each server candles only small part only
30 PST and calls at the time if one
server goes down you just lose about ten
percent of your calls so how to connect
the stn the ways to connect with their
personal ways like analog line plugged
into your box or Sdn basic rate
interface which is the digital telephone
or you can connect the carrier way so II
one or t one line with something with
some protocol like sdn q.931 or h7 and
you will also plug into a box but and
you have a hardware to do this actually
there are some manufacturers which
produce the e 1 t 1 cards if the digium
digium is the company vision basically
invented and started asterisk and there
are sangoma the United States
manufacturer of
into the communications card and there
are one Russian company projects which
equipment also can be used in the setups
I actually used it much so when you can
you exit so we actually take the pci
card and plug into your box and then
plug you one line to your and the online
from some exchange I mean you plug it to
your box you can do basically what what
I said before you can do voice AP PST
and gateway and so switch with the pasty
and actions and you can run everything
you just ran on your voice IP any
scripts arranging your tools like any
service and advance it weighs are also
some advanced should you switch for this
there are also wait to use this as a
signaling proxy for PSTN so sometimes it
is required because for example you can
have a really really courier type
alcatel switch and the East Ian
interface it can help for a lot of ss7
interfaces but is the interface the
single is the interface will cost to ten
thousand dollars and you can basically
buy a car to port card for 1000 and plug
into your box and launch the signal
converter which will basically which
functions similar to the signal proxy
for the voice AP it converts only the
signaling part but the voice are the
same it's the same 3711 you can also do
some mobile applications like SMS center
new box and if you have a salon
connectivity or you can transparently
monitor and record calls or you can
collect the statistics from the line as
you want when you connect to
pstn and translate your calls to voice
IP and back we will encounter a couple
problems one of those problems are era
the era is basically I have some
diagrams here there are two sources of
where is the hybrid transition and the
angelic the couple hybrid transition is
the decision which converts the four
wires input and output into two wire
line which you have at your form and
when you convert it back then in your
input you will get some reflected
signals from signal from output so
basically your signal is it is occurred
back and this is the first source of a
half and the second source if they'll do
leak so you microphone just hear what
happens in your earphone there are why
you don't matta circle in PSTN because
in PST and in circuits which network
they're usually they are very very low
latency so the granularity of transfer
is one bite and just pass it across all
circuits and everything works in voice
IP you have chunks of bytes to process
about the data to process and you have
we're all other heads of the IP packet
transfer which increase the latency so
you can hear a quick heal and there are
multiple ways of defeating there so a
constellation and the concentration echo
separation basically is defeating the
whole conversation so it's just mutes
you why other parties talkin and the
echo installation tries to subtract
signal from them so the other problem
with voice IP to pstn rational back in
the foxes which basically fraction
cooperating it work
doesn't work so because of many
assumptions which need to be satisfied
when you transfer the facts and there
are two types of solutions of this the
t37 and t-38 which are basically what we
are doing we not pass the foxing audio
data through our network we terminate
the faxing on one gateway and we
regenerate it on another gateway and in
37 is basically like you have a fax
machine we get the facts completely and
then you send it over the network and
another machine calls another other
party and tries to sham facts there and
t-38 Israel time it tries to detect when
you turn on your fax and then switches
all the channel all the gateways to this
mode then transfer the facts in real
time and then switch it back so what
software you need for a base 10
connection you need the colonel support
because you will plug a hardware into
your box so you need the driver for this
and the drivers are usually provided by
joint effort from the zapco framework
which is the framework for the telephony
de facto standard framework for the
linux telephony right now and interface
kids cards driver's zap chill includes
drivers for Digium hardware and there
are also other manufacturers usually
provide the compatibility layer for sub
shell so as a sangoma and chroniques
provides this and in user space you have
library
well we PRI which use to talk them ISDN
q.931 protocol and you have the software
packages itself which use the web here I
liber I which used the sub shell and
basically do their of the telephony so
the basic instructions to install
nothing fancy just couple open source
packages couple of kernel modules
modules which you need to mod probe and
you will have couple of device notes in
the directory and it will work zap till
internal architecture it's pretty simple
actually the e1 car driver does nothing
fancy it just generates interrupts when
it has data or it means to pursue it
means to transfer data to outside world
and the line rate is the same so we
regularly get the interrupts and on each
interrupt we get the data out of zaptia
framework and put it into the device
output buffer and also we can we get
data from device input buffer and put
into the subs or framework all other
processing is done ah we also call the
echo cancellation hawks all other
processing are done into the top so it's
actually the huge piece of code this
scepter framework which can do many
things that I just mentioned on the
right side of the slide so we can apply
hdl-c framing to some channels we need
to do this because the ISDN canine 31
runs over hdl-c and this still see
requires that we generate the flag bits
and the flag bits needs need two
degenerates it in kernel because
it's the need to be the free space in
your frame you need to be filled with
the flags and it can be generated only
one output buffer feeling that's also
can cross connect time slots if your
hardware is an able to do this cross
back roads connecting k means we can
pass the calls directly without touching
them in software so if you have two
incoming calls and you will need to
breathe them together you can do this in
some hard worker cards actually can do
this but if you don't tense up Joe
framework will do this for you and then
it presents the data to userspace via
device known as I said you will get a
lot of device notes and you dip
directory and each node will correspond
to some channel so for example if you
have one a one card it will have a 31
set up channel 30 of them will be voice
channels and blue channels and one of
those will be a signaling channel for
the SDN qa1 so we'll have this number of
the West knowledge the next question is
Linux the is living space tea and ready
almost the same question about once a
pea but here I'd like to say that Linux
is not pasty an Iranian so despite you
can if you right now can do this all
stuff you can connect to pasty and you
can do whatever you want however the
septal framework is external so it's not
actually Linux you take the Linux kernel
and if you want to do something with
this you need to deal with external
model and the external models are
usually the problem is external models
that they have a lot of compatibility
stuff inside because they intended to
run with the different versions of
kernel and there are basically it's a
big mess to try to handle this and each
kernel versions change the interface
slightly and you need to forward the
laptop to it and it also contains lots
of stuff which I don't understand why it
is there for example it contains the
timing source some time ago linux 24
timers were not so reliable and
basically what did room decided in there
asterisk they need they need the timer
and we know that our interface card
aruba interface anyway generates
interrupt a for each data transmission
so we use this interrupt as the timing
source and we have a special code in
your e in the driver which interprets
this and also our also use a space
application to be dragon for decisions
and this up shell for some reason
contains the whole conferencing api so
the whole mixing audio mixing code in
kernel so you don't do any mixing in
userspace you just open the device node
and then feed audio to this device note
and you a kernel does Oh mixing it's not
easily readable so it's a perfect
example of copy and paste programming
and when you feature sad
done wrong and there are also some
performance and scalability concerns so
right now every channel uses its own
device note for data transfer which
means if you have a four-in-one
interfaces you will have 120 device
known street from to read audio from and
if they are all talking to someone then
you will need to wait basically we will
need to do 120 different reads at the
each interrupt so 1000 times per second
and this can be easily fixed by coupling
but it requires the read/write of this
apt Oh framework of course but this can
be fixed by merging the Mitchells
together because they all belong to the
same card to the same interrupt you can
use you can read them at one plus there
are also reconciliation which can double
the load and echo cancellation right now
is done in the interrupt context place
uptown so you can also fix this I think
if we move this to userspace we will be
allowed to distribute it across the cpu
cores and this can be afforded to
hardware but dedicated take a counselor
for such channels costs at least twice
as much as the new cpu and UCP you can
obviously handle not only echo
cancellation so
there are short history course into the
linux california so as I said the
linux-based telephony started to gain
popularity with us to risk one which was
in 2004 some somebody already used the
estimate before the release but the buzz
started in 2004 and we have a new
hardware players since them right now in
2007 and we have a new software packages
and we have a some software which was
before asterisk but largely forgotten
and this light bulb isn't so readable at
all so in modern history what we hear we
have a Coal River which is the fork of
the asterisk 12 the fork is more open
because they're in asterisk digium
requires you to disclaim the copyrights
and some features for example the
generic timer support instead of the
timer there's actual timers which I was
talking about was never merged to
asterisk but was merged to coal heaver
and right now co Weaver is much more
portable than asterisk so it can run on
freebsd on mac OS or whatever and it
contains the most working the t-38
implementation so foxing support they
also many internal improvements like
they're replacing the linked list of the
all numbers with the hash table in
Anthony it's in asterisk on each action
you traverse the linked list of the old
numbers in your data plan the
free-speech package which is the
relatively new it's the different
architecture started from scratch by guy
who once hatched an asterisk but then
study decided to write his own OSAP
package and
basically it doesn't contain any PST and
support but for soft widgets already
feature complete and the right yet R
which is as I said is the very high
performance engine and can use the
native one pipe interface to some gamma
cards because it is partly sponsored by
some gamma but it also does some some
stuff better than asterisk so do you
have any questions about what I poked so
far no questions all those of reason
yes but the commercial one the problem
is that the commercial our commercial
software for the voice IP and for the
PSTN connection especially for the
piston connection usually comes with
some hardware part you know what i mean
so if you want to connect to pstn to
process the calls usually used some
vendor equipment which is so it's
officially it's effectively a bundle and
this is not linux-based this will not it
can be windows or some proprietary was
so this is essentially outside the scope
of the Linux three from the presentation
so I I don't know what else to say to
answer on this question any other
questions from the technical part over
there are three as far as i know three
implementations of a Sicilian protocol
for mysteries one of those are
commercial and two of those are our free
the 23 implementation actually one of
those is work I tried it unnecessarily
given to the port in Stacey fewer AG is
so a channel ssl the problem is as a
seven is it's not so easy to get a point
code which is the basically which is the
address in necessarily network if you
don't run certified equipment and
equipment is certified as a whole so
right now as a seven open surface the
seven can II can be useful only for
people who work in carrier or who work
in some company which manufactures the
equipment so i worked in the cell phone
carrier so this was very useful for me
and I did many things using great dick I
I don't want there are some probably the
afraid of you know some not certified
software will nuke then a whole network
down empty something like this so it's a
couple of success stories that success
stories that i have also during the
couple of years this is all possible
with the current state with the current
software and the current current colonel
however as I said like not very
satisfied with the PST and support and
need to be redone but another hand this
is all possible and for example with the
load testing co-founder VIP equipment I
was able also most of every time able to
out
for very expensive equipment of some
vendors for example the alcatel or
probably i tried northam yes so this is
probably a slight
excuse me our can you repeat the
question
so how do you do person this is how does
a resolution how do i register a phone
number and be able to plug into
somebody's public life I actually met a
call is there anything like that going
on sort of green tea
I mean space for programming there are
actually a couple problems here the
first problem is that in PSTN in
traditional phone network we require
that all numbers are essentially route
both so it's the global routable
addresses when you try to use some
random voice IP network for example and
Syd Network it doesn't employee anything
at all so you you connect to this
network but you don't get any number or
any global address automatically some
networks however try to interoperate and
there are some ways to do this and also
some networks try to interoperate with
the traditional folks but the way the
basic idea is that we have a voice IP
gateway somewhere which takes the calls
from the PSTN and forwards them to your
phone number but this is right now this
is largely handled on the individual
basis in some open source
implementations for example in a story
as to risk and support this and we were
can support this their so-called DNS
e.164 support which means that if you
register if you have a voice AP gateway
and you want to make it public you can
register it in genus with the special
name and then if someone who support
this standard also will try to call some
PSTN number from his IP phone it will
locate this gateway and try to terminate
the voice IP call in to PSTN Network on
this gateway but this is all that is
done so far with the routing countries
brush and I there are also in other
possibilities for example I there are a
couple of voice IP exchange some kind of
I don't know some organizations which
basically trade the voice IP traffic and
if you use some for example if you use
the cricket to call the PSTN number then
I actually tried to call some numbers in
Russian and traced it we use some voice
APK twist which is operated by some
voice IP providers which charge for this
so there are some central exchanges when
you can just put some money in and they
will give you some amount of minutes
only different in the different regions
so something like this but
to basically so any other questions I'm
i was most clear interested Alan I was
some how interested in some technical
questions because well the issues that
we have with Colonel support of the
voice IP well all of the PSTN sorry
require a significant redesign of the
subs of framework or I'll better say we
need to write in you telephony framework
and I wanted to ask if somebody wants to
volunteer to do this this is essentially
the linux kernel linux kernel stuff the
simple framework and the i don't hear so
but you know i've got almost no
technical questions so obviously i
failed with my expectations so anyway
thank you all listening to me i hope
that you found some interesting bits in
this presentation and if you interested
you can do two things you can go to the
voice i pvt which is a sorry which is
the voice IP info org and you can
contact me directly i will try to
explain something which left dark here
or if I screwed up some explanations you
can just ask me another time so if you
don't have any other questions thank
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
