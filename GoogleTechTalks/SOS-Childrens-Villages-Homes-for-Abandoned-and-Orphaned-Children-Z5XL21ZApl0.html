introduce mamita who hits the media
initiative for SOS Children's Villages
she also plays an important role in
household marketing and other
international fundraising programs for a
service USA she comes from an
advertising background she has a degree
in communications management from
symbiosis as well as a master's in
advertisement from Syracuse University
and she enjoys traveling and cooking and
I'm probably SOS without father wasting
any more time let me introduce mamita
good morning thank you for taking time
out to your about SOS as Krishnan said
I'm heading the India initiative for SOS
Children's Villages I'll just quickly
take you through the agenda will I'll
first take you through an overview of
SOS Children's Villages talk about how
we build an SOS Children's Villages
emergency relief programs then take you
through our corporate and celebrity
supporters talk about the strategic plan
discuss some numbers with you and then
come to SOS India overview our upcoming
the valley campaign and then
opportunities that Google can help us
with SOS Children's Villages is the
world's largest charity dedicated to
orphaned and abandoned children it's a
surprise that people in USA think that
SOS Children's Villages was founded in
USA but it's a flip-flop a social
villages actually was founded in Europe
about 60 years ago and we are the only
organization who takes care of long-term
care of children our vision is a loving
home for every child we believe that
stable relationships and a
child-friendly environment is essential
for the healthy development of a child
and this we think can be achieved best
in a family-based setting what we do we
build homes for often an abandoned
children we keep siblings together we
never separate siblings so if siblings
come together to our villages we make
sure they always stay together
we work with communities to strengthen
families we build schools and
kindergartens vocational training
centers medical facilities and run a lot
of emergency relief programs these
figures are really really daunting well
SOS strives to take care of children in
need there are far too many children who
are suffering from a lack of family or
lack of security and these numbers are
growing by the day how do children get
orphaned or abandoned you know there are
many ways that can happen one of the
huge reasons is health reasons that's
life-threatening diseases like HIV AIDS
psychosocial reasons like domestic abuse
drug or alcohol addiction armed conflict
natural disasters like tsunami social
cultural reasons even till date adding
in some parts of India a female child is
welcome and I think economic reason
about the biggest you know these
children are living in extreme poverty
they're probably living in a family
where they have too many mouths to feed
and these families of their life rules
by hunger so they cannot take care of
them and hence their abandoned what we
believe in we believe that every child
should grow up in their own biological
family and that means that the immediate
family you know if the child has both
parents or a single parent if the child
loses both the parents then the next
best option is traditional safety net
but the child lives with the extended
family uncle's auntie's grandparents if
these relatives are unable or willing to
take care of these children the next
best option is alternative safety care
where you know there are sibling headed
families but an older brother or an
older sister is taking care of the
family what we would like to prevent is
a loss of biological family because if
these if a sibling headed you know
person cannot support his family these
children could get into really bad
things like they could get into child
labor they could be sexually exploited
in India early marriages another thing
they could beg on the streets they could
become child soldiers so the next
is getting them adopted or short term
care SOS Children's Villages actually
should be the last resort if children
yes short-term care is the sibling
headed family you know if they can take
care the extended family of the sibling
based family if they can take care of
the child for a short term and then
maybe the child can be adopted an SOS
Children's Villages should be the last
resort if a child doesn't have a family
or an extended family or cannot survive
in a sibling headed household that's
when they should come to SOS Children's
Villages we make sure that a child who
comes to an SOS village doesn't have any
family because in our goal is that a
child should be happy in their
respective families and what we do is we
do a lot of family strengthening
programs because these family
strengthening programs are designed to
enable families to help support
themselves and you know cope up with
their life independently so we do a lot
of families rendering programs like
provide education meals hiv/aids
awareness programs we give micro loans
to women so that they can start their
own business and support their families
and we of course believe in forming
families once these children do get to
our villages you know each village is
based on four principles we think that
every child should have a loving mother
every child should naturally grow up
with brothers and sisters they should
live in a secure home that something
which they can call their own home and
they should live in a secured community
this is a typical path of you know when
an SOS a child comes to an SOS village
the average ages zero to ten years and
as I mentioned earlier we never separate
siblings we always keep siblings
together you know in an if a child goes
through the foster care system you know
if there are three siblings they could
be separated in different families if a
foster family says that we cannot take
care of three children maybe they just
take one and the remaining two children
move to other families whereas we make
sure that all siblings are always kept
together every child is emotionally and
materially supported through SOS and you
know education vocational training is
provided
and our main aim as I said is to keep
siblings together and these tryn grow up
in our families and don't live the
villages till they are actually ready to
go out and face the world so its
long-term care of children we always
build our children's villages with
government partnership we have never
left a village or a country or never
have been banished from any country you
know these villages are based on a
principle called SMI which is all
villages are sturdy they are modest and
they are integrated so they're always
integrated with the local community so
we use local architects local building
materials and always the desire the
design is traditional typically in an
SOS village there are 10 to 15 houses in
some cases of 20 you know where in each
House are eight to ten children there's
an SOS mother taking care of them there
are so as auntie is helping the mother
because one lady taking care of eight to
ten children is not easy and in some of
the villages there are medical centers
kindergarten schools you know as needed
a rebuilding in times of disaster we've
been there in times of you know any
disaster and SOS Children's Villages is
there to help out right now we are
running an emergency relief program in
Pakistan we did a huge full-scale
emergency relief program in Haiti after
tsunami in 2005 8 children's villages
were built they have a thousand orphans
after tsunami so we had to build eight
villages and till date do you know these
children are supported through SOS
Children's Villages we are still working
on rebuilding their lives these are some
of our major corporates and I'm being
optimistic and I've put google for a
maybe here so hopefully inter coming
months you know I can probably come back
in talk to Google again and Google can
be one of our supporters Angelina Jolie
is a really big supporter of SOS
Children's Villages after the Haiti
earthquake she's been to our villages
already twice and she has been
generously supporting us since a couple
of years now this is our international
strategic plan you know right now we are
raising 80,000 children in 132 countries
we would like to raise to 100,000
children by 2016 we are serving 250,000
through our family strengthening
programs but as I said you know our goal
is to help more people so that they can
live in their families so by 2016 we
would like to help 900,000 you know
people through the families rendering
programs SOS is a huge network in 132
countries we are already helping close
to 1 million people through different
programs women and children specifically
this is why I'm here specifically today
is to talk about the India campaign how
the India campaign you know we started
this about a year ago SOS Children's
Villages has been around in us for over
30 years now but there was no specific
marketing campaign for India you know
how this campaign started we found out
that there are four and a half million
Indians here in u.s. there's such a huge
need in India and we have the largest
number of villages in India so it's a
perfect fit you know we are you name it
and we are there in fact our 40th
village is coming up in Mumbai this
November it's coming in a place called
alibagh which is close to Bombay a quick
snapshot of SOS children's villages of
the first village was started about 46
years ago in Delhi we have children's
villages family strengthening programs
youth facilities schools training
centres and we are always there during
any emergency situation SOS Children's
Villages India actually has sent me this
chart where you know they say that
fifty-three percent of their you know
revenues were used for SOS Children's
Villages twelve percent for youth homes
ten percent for home and ger- schools
and so on so this is the spin for 2009
the average cost to build an SOS
Children's Villages is 2.5 to 3 million
dollars and this includes 15 to 20 in
some cases little more houses a
kindergarten ancillary facilities
because their SOS aunties as a village
director you know we create holes and in
some cases
medical centers and also as I mentioned
previously we build primary and
secondary schools so that's and when I
say one is to 10 ratio you know when we
build schools or we build medical
centers you know one person from the SOS
is using it but there are 10 people from
the community who are benefiting from
that service so that's what I'm and on
an average a child sponsorship in India
costs about two thousand four hundred
dollars of the year why do these
children need an SOS village or you know
why do they come to an SOS village you
know this research was conducted in 55
countries and on an average these were
the figures you know the death of her
mother was the prime reason why a child
came to an SOS village I think half of
these children are social orphans like
they are they have at least one parent
but the parent can't take care of them
or they are unwilling to take care of
them that's why you know they had to
come to an SOS village the average a
child's age at an entry in any of the
SOS village in India is between five and
seven and I'm repeating myself siblings
are always kept together we never
separate siblings they are kept in the
same family I think this number is yes
boys two girls ratio
yes they are balanced you know girls or
boys that's the average age group they
come into the SOS Children's Villages
it is a 50-50 ratio yeah means there's
no preference given so on an average
their kids spend 15 to 18 years so when
I mean long term it is really long term
they spend 15 to 18 years so this is
their family this is their mother you
know they keep in touch with the family
even are they've moved away like for
example you know you know when we move
away from a country you know we've come
here to study we steal this will keep in
touch with our family so it's the same
case here you know though they've
they've been a part of the village for
18 years so this is their family there
are over seven and a half thousand
mothers worldwide you know the profile
for these mothers are their single
divorced widowed in India a minimum high
school degree is required to apply for
this position they change for one and a
half two years before they become an SOS
mother because you know these children
come from different backgrounds you know
a child can come from an abuse
background a child could have been
sexually exploited lost a parent so you
have to deal with each child in a
different fashion so that's why these
women are given training before they
actually become an SOS mother and this
is a profession for them they've chosen
this profession probably because they
really love children but this is a
profession for them so they get a salary
they get a pension and in some cases you
know after they retire some of the
villages have created SOS mother
retirement homes so you know they are a
part of the village for a really long
time in India the average age of her
nest mother is 28 to 35 eighty percent
children in the SOS families India would
have had only one mother you know i got
these figures from india where they said
that in SOS india a mother stays for at
least 25 years which i think is a huge
figure and as i mentioned previously
that you know continued and stability is
the most important for the development
healthy development of a child and that
is what we try to provide at SOS
Children's Villages i just googled the
literacy rate in india and i saw that
the literacy rate in India's around
sixty-eight percent so based on that you
esso as kids ninety-eight percent of the
SOS kids have completed education we
give a strong emphasis to quality
education my India Office was you know
happy to share these achievements and
awards the Government of India has
appreciated those OS and had actually
recommended it to other child care
organizations in the country to follow
this pattern and we were awarded the
national award for child welfare in 2003
and for by Ministry of Human Resources
in Government of India this is the
diwali campaign now let me just the
valley is the biggest festival in india
you know i think everybody celebrates
the valley in india it's a festival of
lights it's taking place on 5th november
this year so our campaign for diwali is
called one the one child and this
campaign we've created to reach the
masses you know our goal is that
starting from this year whenever during
diwali people think of charity the first
indian charity which comes to their mind
the preferred charity should be a source
children's villages and our goal is to
help 5,000 children by November fifth so
this campaign is called one dia one
child where we are telling people that
you can buy a beautiful set of Diaz and
I have an example you have to show you
you know you can buy a beautiful set of
the years and help a child in India and
these dr's are just for $25 we're part
of the donation goes to the child and
$25 is not a huge amount but I think
this is a good way to involve more and
more people you know get them educated
about SOS children's villages and get
more and more people to help children in
India so you know this is our campaign
we have recruited 120 super volunteers
for all over USA creating awareness
about this campaign we are talking to
individuals corporates and companies to
participate in fact we've got Tata
consulting services already on board
they have around 15,000 Indian employees
here in US and this is
two Americans as well it's Diwali is an
Indian festival but this is open to
everyone but tada consulting services is
right now you know helping us do an
employee giving program where they are
creating awareness among their employees
about this program and encouraging them
to donate or support SOS and you know
the first email just went out last week
and the response has been tremendous so
we are hoping to have similar kind of
response here at Google as well so you
know as I said these dr's are $25 so we
are here at Google you know you can
select the level of support you are
interested in you know these are just
four levels which have put down here you
can decide to sponsor a child a group of
children help a village helper medical
center school or even a family
strengthening program and I think the
best way to do this is to go to SOS dash
india or g / google and you can select
the options to donate and i wanted to
quickly show you a video
so this is our SS India website you know
right now because we have the Diwali
campaign going on we have the valley
information here but you can always go
online and read more information about
SOS Children's Villages and thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
