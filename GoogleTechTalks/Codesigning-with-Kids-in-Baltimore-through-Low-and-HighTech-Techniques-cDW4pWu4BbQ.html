professor at the University of Baltimore
in the digital whimsy lab mm-hmm
he runs a co design team with kids ages
7 through 11 and today he's going to
talk about his experience doing Co
design with that group of kids in
Baltimore yes hi thanks again for
everyone coming everyone I know and
those that I've just met and anyone
online thank you
as Beth said yes I am gonna be talking
about Co designing with kids and
Baltimore through low and high tech
techniques so I'm an egomaniac so I
thought I'd just talk about me to start
I'm in my fourth year and as an
assistant professor at the University of
Baltimore but I what's important is that
I've lived in Baltimore for 18 years
I've lived downtown for 17 years like
legit Baltimore for 17 years I came for
a six-month internship to Baltimore from
Philadelphia and I just have never left
my focus is on dessert with children so
I really focus on all the parts of
design all the parts of from creating
ideas evaluating ideas to building
things with kids to keep myself busy I
also run all the Graduate UX programs at
the University and then so we have
master's in interaction design and we
have a UX design certificate which is
just four short courses you can take
entirely online case you're interested
in that I teach HCI and design and then
I run the digital whimsy lab which is
mostly just keeping the digital Lindsay
lab clean that seems to be the extent of
that those responsibilities so I don't
know if you've ever heard of the
University of Baltimore some people have
heard of the University of Maryland at
Baltimore County UMBC we're not them
some people for the University of
Maryland in Baltimore we're not them we
are the University of Baltimore we've
about 6,500 undergraduate and graduate
students so it's not a very big
university 62% of our students are part
time so we have a lot of working adults
and that's important for how we
structure our kids team fifty-four
percent of our students are of some
minority undergrad programs we have
design program as well information
technology and then we have the grad
programs I was discussing and we haven't
leave a law school in Business School
and all kinds of stuff like that but
these are the ones that mostly touch on
the types of co.design stuff that we'll
be talking about
so before I said talking about my
research I'm going to talk about what
the two questions that kind of drive
everything I do and they are how can we
include more people in the design
process and then how can we positively
change the world with that process so
that's kind of my goal whenever I do any
of this kids team stuff and design
research um with that in mind you have
to understand Baltimore so Baltimore was
in the news a lot last year with some
uprisings that we had and the university
is about seven blocks from the epicenter
of where those things happened we have
six hundred twenty-one thousand people
which is not a huge city at one point we
were a million in the 60s and that has
dropped considerably 63% of our
residents are black twenty-nine percent
are white 4% are Hispanic Latino and
it's a former steel town and so it's one
of those rust but Rust Belt towns that
have not necessarily ever really fully
recovered from the post-industrial
revolution and if you're really not
familiar with Baltimore that's where it
is it's just north of Washington DC and
just south of Philadelphia so we're in
the dead center there on the Chesapeake
Bay and if you saw this stuff on the
news about the uprising that was here
and here's the University not far delays
okay
I'll go back just to give you a an idea
this is the uprising here and this is
the University right here okay yeah but
what's really interesting about
Baltimore and I don't love numbers but I
thought it was really important to put
all these numbers in is that Baltimore
population so number 600,000 people
about 64 percent starting sixth twenty
one thousand twenty one twenty one
percent the city population our children
under 18 the children of Baltimore are
eight
three percent black eight percent white
seven percent Hispanic Latino which does
not mirror the actual overall city
population because what happens is a lot
of families will move into the city and
when they have children move out of the
city that's usually how white families
operate in Baltimore City eighty-four
percent of the kids in public school are
considered low income so they are via
free and reduced meals so that's a good
measurement for the economic status of
the kids so that's really low that's a
that's a really interesting population
that we're trying to work with and
children in general are very important
right we can sing some Whitney Houston
and talk about Kennedy where children
are the world's most valuable economic
most viable resource and it's hope for
the future we often overlook kids in
design so Allyson Drouin found that in
2002 they found that children under
twelve actually see the world
differently than those that are over
twelve we combined our eye and ear and
sensory inputs whereas children actually
split them up and they do experience the
world in a different way than we do so
that's something that that's important
to to understand and there's a lot of
academic interest in in working with
kids it's also really interesting
because kids 7 to 11 think very
logically but also very concretely and
they're very visual verse very verbal
and the one that I think is the most
outstanding is that kids are really
financially important to the u.s.
economy whereas children 4 to 12 spent 2
billion of their own dollars in 1960 so
that's what we call like allowance money
by bubblegum baseball cards the whole
thing by 2005 that had gone to forty
billion dollars that kids were spending
themselves like with their own money and
in 2005 they found that children under
the age of fourteen influenced 47
percent of all household spending so
that means you know what kind of car we
should buy what kind of TV we buy what
video game systems we buy so kids have
this gigantic financial impact that's
about seven hundred billion dollars the
kids have it influence over which is
pretty
so I wanna talk about participatory
design research I don't know if anyone
here is familiar with it I feel like
some people are it is where you work
with the actual target audience in the
design of something for them and we have
follow this thing called research by
design which is we build prototypes as a
way of learning and that's our inquiry
as we build prototypes we understand we
don't necessarily know what the question
is that we're trying to solve is until
we've built prototypes and refined both
the answers and the questions and we're
trying to create the right thing and
it's something that we do at Baltimore
and is done at University of Maryland
College Park and other places around the
country is we're including children as
partners in that design process so if
you think about the different ways that
kids can interact with technology at the
very center of our onion picture you can
see the kids are users right so kids can
be users that's easy they're the ones
using the technology then another layer
out they can be as a tester so
developers can give them the technology
to see if they actually can use that
technology how's the technology handle
how does the technology work at that's
that's where usually that's where most
places stop with kids in the role as a
tester then we have kids as informants
where kids you know will jump in they'll
tell you about what it's like to be a
kid you might interview them as like in
a focus group or something like that
which is nice and then design partner
where kids actually partner with the
group to be designers and their equal
partners it's not the kids our
informants or testers the kids are
actually design partners and so when you
think of participatory design which
again is this giant Scandinavian thing
that I could probably spend two hours on
that I'm not going to participate or
design is the very top and include it
include include a lot of different
things but specifically we're talking
about Co design where again we're
working with the target audience in the
design of something for that audience
and more specifically we're talking
about cooperative inquiry
which is this idea where kids are design
partners so kids have an equal say in
the design process okay and so that
brings us to this thing called kids team
and so if the cooperative inquiry is the
theory then kids team is the
instantiation of that theory
so at College Park which is where this
was all originally based kids team has
worked with people like Nickelodeon
National Park Service Carnegie Hall
National Geographic and Google the big
project that I point people to is the
Nickelodeon app that was released a
couple it's like what five years now
yeah a bunch of years ago and won an
Emmy which again is still my greatest
claim even though our names aren't on it
we still won that at me that was
developed through kids team and the
things that it won the Emmy for that the
Academy actually called out were things
that the kids came up with as part of
the design process so at kids team UB
I've been doing it for three years now
we have a little bit different and a
little bit different focus again because
Baltimore is so important to me are
really focused on very Baltimore things
we worked at the Maryland Science Center
we work with the Maryland Zoo in
Baltimore we have we have a really cool
project right now going on with a group
called Baltimore Orchard project whose
goal it is is to connect people with
each other through orchards in the city
as well as provide a food source so
making the city edible a group called
the creative alliance in Baltimore does
a lot of really neat work in all kinds
of art that we worked with them last
year and then we have this class called
designing for humans for undergrads and
so a lot of undergraduates will bring
their projects to kids team a lot of the
game design students will bring their
projects to kids team to get inputted to
understand more about how to work with
kids and games
so it's a very it's a small group right
now in terms of who we're servicing but
it I think it's really great um all of
our all of our design sessions start the
same way we always have snack time and
the reason we have snack time is because
it starts to introduce starts to change
the day for them right this is an
after-school program and if kids come
from after-school they're pretty much
used to school and so we kind of need to
stop that because that's not what we're
doing we're very much about bringing the
power the power balance to be equal
between the adults and the kids so in
this case we have a snack and it's
actually really fun we talk about
whatever we want there's no specific
dialogue it's just whatever and that's a
great way to sort of change the
conversation from school into getting
ready for design we have circle time
there are several people in the room
that are in this picture which is kind
of fun and in circle time we move from
the snack area we sit on the floor of
the circle and we say our names our age
and we answer our question of the day
and by saying our names and our age
again the adults do this and the kids
and everyone sits on the floor and
everyone dresses casually all the adults
again we are really breaking down those
power structures that they've been used
to all day and in the question of the
day is really nice because it actually
starts to focus the design session so
we've gone from this big wide giant area
that all the kids are concerned with
whatever they're concerned with when
they come in they start talking to each
other then we have a question of the day
and we start to focus that that thought
process like if we were doing a design
session for the Maryland Zoo we might do
something ask questions a day like
what's your favorite exhibit at the zoo
or have you when was the last time you
went to the zoo and they'll tell you
about time then which of the zoo after
circle time we have design time and so
in design time we actually will no
surprise design and we do design through
lots of different ways this is an
example of our low-tech prototyping
where we use pipe cleaners and pom-poms
and paper and all kinds of silly things
to get the kids thinking and they get
the kids building right because one of
the best things about this age group is
again
want to build and they want to be visual
and they want to tell you about these
these design ideas one of our best
examples of a low-tech prototype that
works really well with lots of different
types of kids is something called
layered elaboration and in layered
elaboration what we do is we have a
general idea that's on paper that's one
group of kids will do will add a
transparency and then have other kids
add to that and we'll add another
transparency and have it kids add to
that so what happens as kids are able to
add to each other's ideas but without
destroying the previous ideas this is
how we lay it out it's very high-tech we
use a clipboard and these giant
paperclips we put a piece of paper down
and then transparent overlay and the
funny thing about the transparent
overlays is that they're very hard to
find at the store anymore when I started
doing this project I could still go to
office max and buy a stack of
transparencies in like a number of 20
and now it's up to 100 you have to buy
them in packs of 100 because no one uses
them it's like me and and some math
professor you know is just insisting on
using them some of their techniques that
we've created again we have a very
different audience and at the at the
University of Baltimore the kids didn't
like to be sitting around doing things
like our kids were super active and so
we created this thing that I would call
it story walk but I actually got a cease
and desist letter really from somebody
who said this story walk is trademarked
although in a completely different
context and so the trademark doesn't
hold but the point is is that we're
going to change it may be walking
storyboards the point is is that you
have your storyboards down a giant table
and it tells this it tells the story of
a user experience and then the kids can
actually go through and make comments on
them with sticky notes in place so
there's other sticky note activities
that people do but this is just one
really nice one that gives a very huge
linear effect and it lets people walk
through the experience and give comments
along the experience
sometimes we just play with technology
in this case I apparently look very
surprised with the hands up but we were
using hand gesture sensing stuff with
something called the lead yes thank you
the leap and it worked really well and
the kids really had a good time with
that
but sometimes what if we want to design
a new thing that uses a new technology
we have to introduce the technology to
that all right we can't just say how how
would you control an experience at your
house with your hands if they've never
actually controlled something with their
hands and we balance that too because we
don't want it to them to think that it's
only this one way they can do it we have
giant pieces of paper we call this
technique giant paper and we're not
creative sometimes with our names this
was fun again because it's big kids can
move around they can jump in they can
add stuff and draw as they want to this
one was a neat one just because again
the kids were up and moving around and
it was the scale was so big that they
really felt like part of it and the
design wasn't just something on a piece
of paper it was this giant living thing
in front of them when we comes to model
sometimes we'll just have them make up
models this bag we pose to the kids hey
if you could design a technology that
would help you and your family
participate in science out in the field
what would it be like how would it work
and so they created this they took this
bag which was not actually in their kid
it just was in the lab and they said
okay what's gonna happen is every time
we walk through the woods and we find
something we're gonna pick it up and put
it into the bag and then the bag will
have a screen on it and that screen will
record where it was found we'll identify
what it is that's actually a bear on
that picture because it was bare fur
we'll we'll record what it is and then
upload it so you have this log and that
scientists could then go look at the
kinds of things that you find and they
can track that and there are some other
parts to it there are glasses that would
help you see and there was this thing
which I know I remember that was at the
time it was probably also
you
what we found though was that the kids
that we were working with in Baltimore
City in our first year really couldn't
stand art supplies I mean they just were
done with art supplies I don't know what
it was about them in particular and
again this is it I'm not generalizing to
the whole city of Baltimore but the kids
we were working with I'm just we're
tired of it so all they talked about was
Minecraft and playing on the computer so
we said you know what sure why don't you
why don't we use the computer so in this
case where I think we're using scratch
River that's a programming language for
kids we had them do some scratch stuff
we also do some acting so in this case
they're actually putting out there
developing a sketch like they're acting
out a sketch about how kids would use
technology we actually use this in the
last couple weeks about designing robots
for kids where kids made they made a
giant robot puppet and they acted that
out and so that acting actually brought
a lot of the hyper energy that they had
into check and as part of the design
process at the very end of our design
sessions we have big ideas right and so
big ideas are where we get back together
after we've designed and we talk about
what just happened and we find and we
definitely delineate between the groups
of what they came up with and then we
start to find what's similar between all
of these things and what's different
about these things what's really unique
what's something that's so exciting
about this idea that we want to follow
it and in our group we do that with the
kids like the kids are part of that
discussion it's not just the adults
going oh this is interesting this is
interesting it's hey guys what do you
think is interesting her hey guys what
do you think is very similar here and
those things that we find in big ideas
become the marching orders for the
future right that becomes that the
design requirements for the next Reve
Kanaya may have noticed that the
pictures from our first year were not
very diverse and that was because we had
a lot of trouble recruiting kids from
all parts of Baltimore instead we were
just getting kids who lived in the area
who were of means whose parents might
not you know only one parent works or
the other parent has a very flexible
schedule that they can actually drive
them to the University of Baltimore so I
want to talk about two kids Gary and
Calvin that's not really their names but
we'll call them that for today and Gary
was a little boy who was in our kids
team the first year and Gary's mom's job
changed so he had a two-parent
two-parent household he was a I think he
was an only sibling and the mom used to
leave work to take Gary to the kids team
and it was really great then she'd go
back but this thing happened where she
couldn't do it anymore
and Calvin was a boy who lived in a
Western neighborhood in Baltimore I
think he was from a single family he
came on the train every day so when
things are the University of Baltimore
is that we're at the hub of everything
so you can even take a train you can
take the light rail you can take a
subway you can do all these things and
get to University Baltimore so him and
his mom would come via the train the
light rail every day our every session
and his mom would wait around for the
session to be over and then leave
because he didn't want opportunities at
school but he loved computers he loved
technology and she thought this would be
great opportunity that it was a great
opportunity like he enjoyed coming so
she then got a different job and there
was no one to take him so he had to
leave kids team which brings us to
distribute a design like how can we
actually use these technologies and use
these techniques in order to get kids
who couldn't come to kids team to
actually participate with us because
really getting six kids into a room is
great but wouldn't be grateful to get
more kids and more ideas and more input
and there's some precedent for this we
did some work a bunch of years ago with
car
Hall in New York City where they were
working with teenagers teenagers in New
York City and teenagers in New Delhi
India and we wanted to do a design
session between the two groups and it
turned out that because of timezone
problems we could never actually do one
session between all the kids and there's
something called ICD L which is the
international children's digital library
that's available at Children's Library
org and the international children's
digital library was created by children
around the world and the way they did it
was they took instead of trying to do
some type of synchronous session they
did an asynchronous session or you know
kids it at their own time where they
took the techniques that we kind of just
covered in kids team and made it into
things that could be FedExed right so
worksheets or fill in the blanks or
drawings and then every four months
maybe every three months a researcher
would go visit that child to participate
with them and talk about their designs
there's obviously some limitations with
that first of all is very expensive to
travel to Mongolia to involve a child in
that design process um it's it takes I
think if I remember correctly 24 days to
get a package from a place like Mongolia
to Maryland which is pretty long right
so that does that time between
iterations really excursion grows and
grows which means it's not a very fast
process and you're limited to what you
can do on worksheets right and then
you're also limited to only having that
like one voice as opposed to hey what do
you think we do this or hey what do you
think if we do that and the and the kids
building off each other and there's
plenty of online synchronous systems
that are out there right so there's
whiteboards there's things like Google
Docs Google Drive right like there's
those tools but they're all very adult
focused and we did a session once with
using hangouts with kids a long time ago
and just the buttons were too small and
it just wasn't quite working out how we
wanted and you guys have just email each
other ideas but that's hard to manage
iterations
and these are all pretty standard you
know cooperative supported sorry
computer support and cooperative work
problems that we have so we create
online kits team my very first Reb of
that was a long time ago we were joking
today it looked like Google Wave that's
actually what we kind of based it off of
at the time and it worked really well
and we were able to do this for a six or
seven week process in the summer a bunch
of years ago like I said and what
happened as kids and adults would add
their ideas those ideas they would type
into this box their idea the idea would
then be saved as a layer and each piece
of layer information was saved and
building so so think of a layered
elaboration but on the computer and you
could turn off the layers turn on the
layers and you could see all kinds if
you also record audio if you want
so as I was saying the kids in Baltimore
when we started using the high-tech
things all they wanted to talk about was
Minecraft and minecraft and minecraft
and more minecraft and minecraft and
everything was about minecraft their
shirts their their backpacks if they had
lunchboxes they were minecraft
everything was minecraft if I haven't
emphasized enough yet
everything was minecraft and even kids
who didn't play Minecraft could tell you
about Minecraft because everyone at
their school plays minecraft so anyway
so we said you know what maybe we should
look at minecraft doesn't sound like a
bad idea let's meet let's meet our our
designers where they are so we did is we
said alright let's create a virtual
world using a Minecraft like tool so we
use this thing called mind test which
was a open-source version because
minecraft actually has a twenty five
twenty seven dollar fee you know to buy
it so we didn't want people to have to
buy it so we use an open-source version
which works pretty much exactly like
Minecraft
which again the kids really like and
first we just had them build right and
we had them build and we found that they
just wanted to play it like regular
minecraft so let me give them some
limitations like well let's build a
village let's build a kid team village
like how would that look what would that
be like once you build a house first and
then we start adding things so each kid
was responsible building their own house
and then when they were done Billy in
their house kids built things such as
planetariums aquariums underground
tunnels they built really neat things
with it and this was all co-located so
this portion of it was co-located when
we were done doing the co-located stuff
Craig and I actually built like a town
square and some common buildings so that
the kids who participate we would have a
medium place and we ran this for a week
for a spring break where we said you
know what stead of coming to kids team
just come online to what we call kid
crafts here's that here's the
information they've met us in the world
we had the circuit we had snack time
there's little silly food in Minecraft
so one girl kept throwing fish at us and
and ham hocks
like the in the game so that was kind of
funny but they all talked about snacks
like oh I'm eating goldfish or I'm doing
this and then we had circle time where
all of our little avatars flew in flew
because it's what's so cool about
Minecraft we all flew into a town square
and had circle time we went around and
answered the question of the day and the
kids like pivoted and looked at each
other as they were talking which was
really neat and I think we did that
entirely via text right because that's
what the tool support at the time and
then we flew together to a special
location marked and said you know what
let's build a library if you would need
to build a library for kids to
participate in kids team what kind of
information would they need to know what
would the library be like so they built
this gigantic library for us and I have
a quick video
not quite the library whoops
you
this is a building they built later
after the library that was all glass so
the kids would come in and they would
add things in this case it and and being
glass it was very easy to break we had
some real issues early on we're kids so
it's not the videos not going across the
streaming so well um can I get to a good
display so here is a circle time that
we're having in the building
one of the issues that we found in
Minecraft is that it's really easy to
deploy lava and so children
inadvertently destroyed other children's
things and that became very stressful
and tenuous here were plenty of flowers
in this video and then we just start
smashing things because we build we
smash we build there's Ironman and an
angel any other video here yeah so that
was cool that worked out really well
we enjoyed kid craft here's some stuff
they built on their own they just
started working together and designing
things that had nothing to do with the
design sessions and they would play in
there and we would have kids wake up at
7:00 in the morning and start playing
before school and then you could see a
taper off around 7:45 when they went to
school and then jump on after school and
I could watch you know all the all the
logs and see how engaged they were but I
also I also could track where they were
in the game and there were some kids who
would only come in when other kids were
not there on purpose because they didn't
want to co.design they just wanted to be
their own special person and they would
go miles in the game out into a desert
and just build their own houses there so
it was really interesting how they
experienced this online building
platform they said it worked well the
kids spent a lot of time what was great
was during that week of of spring break
gary was able to connect and I say Gary
connected a lot gary burnt everyone's
houses down inadvertent hay with lava
and then he tried to ploy water which
just turned it to stone and filled in
someone's underground tunnel and there
was there was a lot of tech screaming in
that that was really funny I don't know
I'm doing what's going on so that was
that was cool the one person's stuff he
destroyed the most actually then
mentored him and showed him you know how
not to destroy things in the future so
that that was a cool behavior to what
some problems limitations of that were
was that it required a client so the
kids had to actually you know connect
with software so it was not gonna work
on an iPad minecraft does work on an
iPad but it's kind of kludgy but our
tool did not work on
I've had did not work on a phone did not
work in a browser at the time it wasn't
working on a Mac so only kids with
Windows PCs or Linux you know if you
have that one-in-a-million kid that is
using Linux at his house could connect
with it so we did was we built a
prototype that ran entirely in your
browser and we use something called
voxel j/s which is a open source tool
for creating Minecraft the kind of like
worlds and we themed it like Legos it
was okay um the kids hated that it
looked like Legos which I thought was
really interesting because they're
they're not Legos right like it was they
had their own conceptual model in their
head of how things that build should
work and if it looks like Legos but it's
actually Minecraft those two things
didn't really go together so we ended up
doing was rebuilding it creating an
online server that supports it we use
nodejs we used the mumble audio server
for games we just did a lot of stuff to
actually start connecting the kids
together so again I'm not sure if this
is going to share a play at speed but
what we have going on here is this is in
their browser right so this is not with
any clients this is not using any 101
second
I want to meet him mm-hmm all right so
one will have the audio um
but you might not notice is that the
kids are actually can't because them
sounds off the kids are talking over a
chat thing but some of the kids they're
chatting their audio didn't work so if
they typed into the in the chat box it
would actually speak out what they were
typing so that was a way to connect and
Calvin was able to connect to this
session
so after Calvin had not been able to
come he was able to connect and interact
and participate and he added a couple
design ideas we had one kid act this is
a robot they were building a robot for
science
what would the robot be like what would
the robot do and well everyone looked
like ninjas I thought one of the things
that was very minecraft II that they
really liked a lot was that
personalization at the same time it made
it feel too much like Minecraft or too
much like a game so we kind of went to
sort make bring it back to being what it
is and give him that affordance of a
design tool so we made everybody look
the same so you can see that when people
are flying around but it's not Ironman
or it's not you know when Ames or
something like that it's just these
builders so to speak and so yeah we
could build it out it was really neat
how it all worked that is the Mun that
is the magnifying glass on the left for
the robot
there was a hat that was designed way in
the back background there that's a it's
a top hat room where one of the kids
insisted on building that so we could
have circle time in that top hat so the
kids again were acknowledging that the
the space acknowledging what we did as
part of kids team and we're act and were
active in creating spaces to support
that within this environment
you
one of the big things I found that I'm
sure people often find is that when you
try and make tech easier you actually
tech gets harder for you and especially
harder for you to keep stable right
because you're trying to mask a lot of
things and try and make it as easy as
possible for someone in order to do that
you're thinking a lot you're using a lot
of systems in the background so that was
that was a problem Calvin was able to
connect like I said which was which was
fantastic and I did my bait my big
finding is that voice chat plus outgoing
kids is trouble so one of the things
that we want to do in a future rebbe of
this is actually make it like a walkie
talkie where kids would have to press a
button to talk and then you would only
get five seconds of talking and it might
have a cool-down where like when they
let go it actually starts to countdown
so you can tell you're like yeah I'm
here that would be one second so it
might replenish in one second
but if they talk for five seconds it
might take five seconds to replenish
something like that and they could
always use chat so going forward um you
know like I said we were successful in
connecting kids we got two kids
that's better than no kids I thought
that was good my group is very small we
got kids from different neighborhoods
again we got kids who we couldn't
necessarily you know interact with or
design with but what we going forward is
we need to go where our designers are
and so we want to go to libraries we
want to go to schools um and that's
interesting is that we usually don't go
to schools for co.design because again
we're trying to break down that power
structure and trying to level it out but
if you go to into a school you end up
just reinforcing it because the kids are
still at the place where they have the
least amount of power in the world and
so it's kind of hard to get them ramped
up but we're going to try that the
library I think is a good third space
for that one of the reasons we didn't
get kids to participate besides
transportation was just all the other
activities that kids do if you have kids
I have a seven-year-old as my oldest who
only does ballet but apparently each
sport now takes the whole year apply so
if you like basketball you play
basketball all year feel like baseball
or soccer you play those sports all year
and some kids would say I don't want to
commit for the whole year to come to
kids team so we're thinking
about actually instead of being like one
semester long or two semesters long
we're going to break it down to four
week bursts where we work on one or two
topics and that's it
and we're going to continue to partner
with groups who benefit from Co designs
so we have something going on with NPR
in the fall at least 99% through with
that where we're going to create a
podcast you know NPR has no kids stuff
they have nothing for kids so how do you
what does that look like what is a
podcast look life right here and so just
in conclusion you know how can we
include more people in the design
process and how can we positively change
the world with that process those are
those questions I keep trying to answer
with this research and I think that
we're moving forward with those I think
we're starting to include more people
there's a lot more we can include
there's a lot more we need to do but um
again I'm not trying to solve this by
July 1 so thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
