bit about
platform gaming what what's difficult
about it what's what's important about
it and why why everyone needs to pay
attention to the issues that affect both
developers as well as consumers in a
cross-platform world so before I get
into that in a lot of detail and tell
you a little bit trans gaming if if you
haven't heard of us before we're
probably most well-known right now for
our cider product that's a product that
allows us to take a game that was
originally written for Windows and bring
it using our portability technology to
the mac and we we work very closely with
a lot of the major game developers and
publishers who are out there so
companies like Electronic Arts Ubisoft
Activision and so on so some of the top
titles we've done recently include the
sims 3 dragon age settlers prince of
persia and the list goes on what many of
you probably don't know is that in
addition to our our work with the mac
and things like cider we're involved in
quite a number of other portability
related activities so we have some
experience with both playstation and
playstation portable development we
recently shipped our first we title
which is armin van buuren in the mix and
then beyond that we have a pretty close
relationship with the current Oh screw
up or acronis members and we participate
very actively and openly in both the
OpenGL working group the OpenGL ES
working group and then more recently
working with you guys at Google in the
angle project which aims to bring WebGL
to pcs running DirectX in addition to
that the product that the company
originally started with is cydia it used
to be called Winx and that allows end
users of linux desktops to take their
existing catalogue of windows titles and
run them on linux desktops sua shader
which is another product that we've
worked with you guys on and ship that
with your o3d 3d technology and then
last but certainly not least is our game
tree TV efforts and game free TV is a
new system that we are deploying to
cable operators and
oems of connected connected TVs and
set-top boxes for next-generation TV
experience we're bringing games to those
platforms both from the portability side
of things as well as from the
distribution and content side of things
so what I'm here to talk to you today
about it is is cross-platform gaming and
why it's important why it's difficult
you know what actually happens as
developers look at the platforms that
are available to them and make decisions
about what platforms they should build
their content on one thing to understand
about game development is that it can be
a very expensive process whether you're
you know one of the EAS of the world or
rly softer Activision's the kind of the
kind of projects that those companies
get involved in can run up budgets into
the into the range of you know 30 40
million dollars for a top-end triple a
title it's very expensive it's very
important to those companies to make
sure that they monetize that investment
across as many platforms as possible and
right now if you look at the the
ecosystem 44 game platforms for systems
that run games it's actually broader
than pretty much any other market and
software so you have the traditional
consoles devices you hook up to your
TV's you got the 360 you've got the wii
u get the ps3 on the desktop side you've
got windows desktop which certainly has
that the largest share of the market for
games right now you've also got the mac
and a small number of users on the linux
desktop side then you've got portable
devices whether they be smartphones or
dedicated portable gaming consoles like
Nintendo or Sony devices now we have
tablets coming out we've got ipad got
android tablets coming out intel's got
me go tablets coming out and the list
goes on and then lastly as i was
mentioning earlier you have the
connected TV platforms which are really
just going to be starting to ship at the
end of the sea air and then into next
year so if you're a game developer this
is this is an enormous variety of
platforms to choose from and if you're
making an investment whether it's a 40
million dollar investment of an EA or an
Activision or whether it's the
investment of you deciding to
quit your job because you love gaming
and go and work with your buddies in
your garage and pump out a game that
investment you know that's your that's
your time blood sweat and tears that's a
huge investment so you need to make
careful decisions about the platform's
you target so when you think about
targeting multiple different platforms
to try and maximize that investment you
know the question you you might think of
if you're not familiar with the area is
why is that so hard you know Cee Cee is
pretty portable or you know some people
used to think the Java was really
portable but in fact it's not there
there are a number of issues involved in
in dealing with these portability so
first and foremost is hardware different
devices it seems obvious but you know
different devices have different CPUs
different GPUs different amounts of
memory different amounts of storage so
all of these things plan even even if
you're on the same cpu but you got a
different GPU there can be significant
issues you got different api's you work
with whether those are on the graphic
side with OpenGL or direct3d or whether
they're on the system side if you you
know if you've got a code base and some
of the code bases that we've seen in our
work you run into the millions of lines
of code you have a code base like that
you've got touch points potentially all
over the operating system the originally
designed your code for it's extremely
difficult to build a project of that
size and really have you know true
platform independence you guys I think
are well aware of that with some of the
projects that you work on such as such
as chrome I know it took a long time for
for Chrome to come up on on platforms
other than Windows it's a very difficult
problem even for a company as big as
Google for a game developer who's
working on you know smaller budgets very
tight timeframes it can be even more so
and then last but certainly not least is
the fact that you've got it potentially
completely different form factors so on
the one hand if you're going from say a
PC to Mac you you know you've got the
same CP you've got similar GPUs you've
got a similar form factor but if you if
you're originally developing for couple
anyone moved to PC or vice versa you
know there you've got control scheme
differences you've got
all kinds of other differences weird
things like the overscan and in the TV
where you don't actually have as much
resolution as you think you have and in
which the HGTV vendors have mysteriously
decided to continue on into the into the
HD world even though there's no real
reason to have that when you've got an
LCD panel different different
controllers keyboard mouse handheld
handheld controllers we have gesture
controllers coming out and the list goes
on so these are these are not simple
problems these are these are you in many
ways very very complex problems and
they're ones that I've been spending the
last 10 years working on and there there
can be a lot of they can be a lot of fun
even though they are sometimes very
difficult and challenging so you know
some of the simplest stuff to back to
the hardware you think about different
CPUs and how do you how do you typically
cross that that divide well you
obviously have to rebuild your code
what's what's so hard about that if
you've looked at some of the code that
comes out of a rushed through am coding
session from people who are trying to
get a game at the door to meet a market
deadline that's not always the code
that's the easiest to to build on a
different compiler C++ especially there
there there are all kinds of differences
between C++ compilers how they deal with
things like templates and many other
things and then just simply the actual
build system if you've got a million
line project with which is composed of
dozens of different components some of
which are from third-party vendors some
of which you don't even have source code
control the source code for you know
that that can be itself a very
challenging problem a problem that we
have faced in this when we've been
working with publishers has actually
sometimes been they don't really have
the code anymore they don't really know
what happened to it they ship the
product that was a while ago maybe the
the publisher wants it on the other
platform but they never got the source
code from the developer in some cases
they have the source code but they don't
know what the
correct version of it is they want to
ship the same version on mac is on pc
and they invite us to come spelunking
through their source good control system
with them these are these are if you if
you're not thinking about cross-platform
from from the very beginning these can
be extremely difficult problems to deal
with even if you are thinking from very
beginning there's still difficult
complex problems GPU performance this is
this is one of the issues that of course
happens when you're going when you want
to try and go from a game that exists on
a console or PC down to mobile device or
tablet the GP performance issues are
very serious if if you build a game if
you do successfully go cross-platform
well then you have of course now to
multiply your test infrastructure so if
you've got you know five or five or ten
different varieties of PCs you test on
and now you want to go to the mac well
you want to test on all the different
GPUs that Apple ships this this problem
I think in in the mobile world was once
and still today is far worse on the j2me
side where you know the proliferation of
different j2me devices is such that it
becomes a Herculean effort to try and
test a game on 300 different devices and
then you know once you actually are
getting damaging you say yes I want to
bring my game I'm going to invest the
time and energy we're going to we're
going to make this happen you can run
into all kinds of very subtle
differences so what I've what I'm
showing here is a difference between
OpenGL and direct3d so direct3d when
sampling and texture samples samples the
texture from the corner as opposed to
from the center actually it might be the
other way around I honestly keep
forgetting which way is which so when
that's happening if you want to move
that to OpenGL you can apply you can you
can either transform the texture offset
that that's being used that the UV
coordinates in at each vertex that
you're using or you can transform the
position of those vertices so
unfortunately
those are mutually exclusive things that
you can do on a global basis so if
you're if you do what trans gaming does
in terms of writing technology to take
care of things for you you have to
choose one or the other and if you've
done the wrong thing if you if you've
done a different combination of things
on the pc code to to adjust for that
offset you can run into issues like this
where you see these very dark seems
we're more textures were supposed to
have been sampled together but but they
weren't because that half pixel offset
turned into a half pixel on either side
and you have black in the middle so
those are those are sometimes very
challenging problems to deal with so on
games I'd sort of touched earlier on
some of the unique factors of game so
one of these is that games are generally
one-off projects that's a little less so
today than it was five years ago but for
the most part when game developers work
on a title they work through the title
they finish the title they ship the
title they move on to the next title in
many cases at some of the larger
publishers the actual development teams
for it for a given title are actually
you know the day the day of ship they're
literally split off into multiple
separate teams to go work on the next
project so they may not you know see
each other again so the that the code
it's the code that's used for the game
is not a living breathing system it is
it is a system that is by its nature
transient those developers often work
under very tight deadlines Christmas it
doesn't change so you can't you can't
push that off you need to get your
product out in time for black friday and
you know that's that's the way it is so
maybe you can push your manufacturer to
manufacture the later if you give them
some more money but ultimately you you
know you have to ship especially for one
of the larger scale developers you have
very tight deadlines to meet performance
not only do you have to meet these tight
deadlines but your game has to run
smoothly and it has to run smoothly
potentially across multiple different
GPU and CPU incarnations so especially
on the pc side when people are testing
pc games they have just a huge number of
different varieties of systems to test
against and and in some in some cases
there are you know
our test labs that are separate from a
regular QA QA system for a game
developer that that is used to do broad
scale testing across different hardware
to me ensure that it meets minimum
performance requirements because of all
this there's there's no premium on
reusable code again that's that's not
always the case that is something that
is the case in in some projects today
perhaps a little bit less so today with
with things like mmos and games that
have longer tails a lot of games have
downloadable content so they have a
longer lifespan and so that's perhaps a
little bit less of an issue for for
those developers who are thinking about
those things and thinking about their
game in the long term asset costs this
is a huge one when game developers are
dealing with resizing their content so
even something sometimes as simple as as
going from a widescreen aspect to also
supporting a four by three aspect that
can require major changes in art because
a developer has you know maybe made a
setup a fixed fixed 2d bitmaps for
overlays and things like that so art
assets can be very expensive to
re-engineer you you may sometimes need
to you know start from scratch if you're
going from a high-end platform to a
lower end platform you need to you know
have much lower detailed models which
means you know different artwork has to
be done to make those models look good
for that platform and the last but not
least is is the fact that there there
are licensing concerns whether those
licensing concerns are things such as
third-party IP libraries that you've
added into your interior system for you
know physics or networking or something
like that or whether it's that me the
developer has licensed the games of the
publisher for platform X and in order
for that publisher to publish on
platform why they need to you know
renegotiate their license with the
developer so it's these things these
things have from the even from a legal
perspective often extremely complex
legal requirements so traditionally how
do people solve this problem well one
way they solve the problem is simply to
ignore it release on a single platform
especially for independent developers
who have fewer resources they will pick
a platform that they believe will serve
them best put the game up for that
platform see how it does if it's
successful then they might look at
bringing it to other platforms have been
a few many developers who've managed to
do that the 2d boys have a cup game
called World of Goo which is which is
awesome and they've essentially done
that they they had success at in their
initial releases lots of fame and and
accolades and then we're able to start
bringing the game to other platforms but
you know even even when your your app in
the in the Triple A game space this is
not always something that that is
possible often a game we released for a
single platform and they'll you know
they'll think well if we can't make you
know both ps3 and 360 simultaneously
let's just go with one or the other
depending on various market factors or
potentially who's paying them for a an
exclusive license and the other platform
will sit by the wayside and and often
any any port that was contemplated will
die on the vine otherwise this gets
dealt with after the fact ports on the
Mac market in particular before trans
gaming entered the market this was the
the majority of ways that games came to
the Mac they would be generally licensed
by a third party publisher from the
original publisher and that third party
publisher would then pay for the
development of the mac version of the
game and gain the the value of
publishing that game for the mac that's
less the case now that that market
hasn't has not been as active recently
on the back side and I'm skeptical that
it will return in in any platform as
developers become more cognizant of
cross law firm issues and look at ways
that they can deal with cross-platform
more generally and
try and think about it earlier I think
that model is one that will remain by
the wayside another thing that
developers and publishers do is actually
produce completely different games but
call it the same thing this can be a fun
one for reviewers why I played game
exxon on my pc and it was great and then
i played it on my nintendo to yes and
it's a totally different game well that
shouldn't really be a surprise it's a
you can't fit the same game on your DS
but this this this happens you know
actually quite frequently that there are
entirely different code bases entirely
different teams entirely different art
and the only thing that's the same is
the name of the game some developers
that the dude do simultaneous crop cross
platform releases succeeded that with
early planning they think about it from
the get-go they know they want to target
you know the set of platforms and they
plan for it either by building an
internal engine that is capable of
dealing with that licensing third-party
a third-party engine that does that well
working with companies like trans gaming
to make sure that when they release
their game it's going to be across
multiple platforms and so on but that
means that if you're if you're thinking
about that you need to make that
decision early rather than late the
later you go the harder it is to do
cross platform release even if you're
using you know very powerful
cross-platform technology and then last
but not least especially on the arcade
side games are frequently emulated and
generally this is applicable to older
games where the CPU differences are such
that this is something relatively easy
to do so I trans gaming we've been doing
this for a long time and we approach
this in a somewhat different manner what
we do is we we cross the API and binary
execution barrier so typically when we
take a game from Windows to Mac or
Windows to Linux we're actually taking
that same original windows executable
and running it directly on the on the
target platform so are our cider product
does this on the mac side or cydia
product does this on the linux desktop
side and then
the gantry TV portability engine which
is essentially very similar to both of
those products all the same codebase
does this for connected TV devices going
to OpenGL ES so this is this is very
beneficial to developers because it
means that if you have if you're doing
this you have a single code base you
have a single build system the actual
binary that you've produced is the exact
same binary on both platforms this means
that things like cross-platform Network
play become very easy we had one game
that we were dealing with where it was a
real time strategy game where the the
network protocol required little bit for
bit compatibility of floating-point
calculations that were happening the
only way to achieve that is to is to
have the exact same instructions
executing on both platforms so there are
many many benefits doing this and of
course it can it can happen very very
quickly so some of what we do in this is
there's obviously a lot of complexity in
there but the probably that the most
important part of that process is our
support on the graphic side where we
take DirectX shaders and DirectX data
structures and at runtime run those
through and translate to OpenGL so as an
example an application might provide a
shader in Microsoft's hlsl form to the
Microsoft D 3 DX library this is a
utility library for Microsoft that does
shader compilation from source code form
to a binary representation our our code
would then come in and and actually
execute that in in this case we don't
have our own hlsl compiler we rely on
nvidia cg compiler we work with them to
make CG more compatible with hlsl so CG
takes the shader compiles it to direct3d
by code it then passes it along the game
passes that shader along to Microsoft's
d3d 9 library in this case on a Linux
machine we would implement our lib d3d 9
as a Linux shared library
that would send we take the command
stream of the DirectX commands send it
down to our d3 d2 GL conversion layer
which we call d3d GL and that would take
those shaders and convert the byte codes
from microsoft directx by codes to ARB
ARB assembly language or glsl high level
shader language that of course that
would then go to the platform opengl
driver which would then turn it into the
shade representation required for the
physical hardware and the hard work goes
next to you to the shader so that's sort
of how how that that layer of things
works so the reality is that you know
the difference between this and what
actually happens say under windows is in
many ways not that different there's
still a hol to bytecode compiler that's
happening at the at the d3dx9 that has
to take that shader and turn it into a
representation the hardware can execute
the the work that we do we try to have
as minimal as possible there's always
some cpu time required for it but in
general we try and push as much as
possible to the GPU so that the it's the
GPU bottleneck that that is that is the
major focal point that works well in
some cases and less well and others
depending on the state of the drivers
for the platform we're dealing with so I
see a couple people who have had a big
lunch and I figured now is a good time
to have a bit of a demo to show you some
cool stuff what I'm going to show you is
chrome actually you think I'm kidding
but I'm not what I've got here is eve
online Eve is a massive multiplayer game
done by one of trans gaming's publishing
partner CCP in Iceland and that actually
comes up properly and eve is is a space
combat game where players by in the
universe to take over as much property
as possible and avoid having their
their cargoes pirated and so on and so
forth so this game is is when is
executable we work very closely with CCP
to make sure that they stay within the
boundaries of what our cider engine is
able to translate to direct3d and we we
take all the shade all of this as is
being rendered using director ed and we
were translating it fully in real time
into OpenGL and there we go this is an
example where there is you know a quite
complex scene with something in the
range of 70 different ships on screen at
once all running in real time with you
know cool features like occlusions and
so on when the Sun was behind a ship and
various other things now one thing
that's the important to understand is
this is not emulation we're not we're
not doing CPU level emulation we're not
doing a structure by insertion emulation
we've actually taken the windows binary
loaded into memory and it's executing as
though it would would under windows so
the game is loaded the same address that
would be loaded under windows any time a
call is made to direct3d or any other
win32 api that gets intercepted by our
layer and executed but you know some
people might say well that's still
emulations lating the api well in fact
one of the things that we can do because
of the way the technology works is we
can actually integrate components that
are completely native components so what
you're seeing here once it comes up here
so this is actually a browser that's
built into the game they did this
because frequently users of the game
want to compare you know prices of
different objects and so on in the game
when we first it's true that when we
first when we first ported EVE Online we
got a bug reports I know copy and paste
doesn't work we're like copy and paste
why would you need to copy and paste
from the game and the answer came back
will we need to take the the tables from
the the marketplace and paste them into
our Excel spreadsheet so we can analyze
where we can buy the things most cheaply
so this is you know as part of
supporting players doing things like
that ccps is used chrome with through an
embeddable form called assam IAM and
integrated that so you can you know not
even leave the game and still have your
web browser but you'll notice that this
has a mac scroll bar and in fact what's
happening here is that this is win32 and
mac OS 10 code coexisting side by side
in the same process sharing an address
space calling back and forth using c
library conventions this kind of thing
is a lot harder to do with C++ but it
works quite well in C and and allows for
very tight integration between disparate
platform interfaces as you can see here
so getting back to our slides in
addition to our approach with this on
the on the game technology side we've
also applied this approach in in some of
the work we've done with with Google on
the angle project so angle aims to
provide OpenGL ES interfaces on top of
direct3d in order to enable WebGL which
is a GL based API under windows in many
cases the the windows open GL drivers
are insufficient to be able to properly
handle more complex things that people
want to build with WebGL and so we
worked with with Henry and Vangelis and
various other folks here at Google to to
come up with angle and my understanding
is that it's shipping today in the last
week in the canary build so anyone
anyone using WebGL under chrome right
now is using angle which is a very
similar technique we're taking opengl
and translating the shader traders in 2d
3d shaders translating the state dealing
with vertex buffers and so on to cross
that that platform divide
and then I mentioned earlier officiator
that's another way that we we cross
platform divides in that platforms that
have lower spec GPUs or older GPUs that
where people still want to run GPU
intensive software we have switched
shader which actually completely execute
the entire graphics pipeline and
software so rather than recompiling from
you know OpenGL to direct3d or back or
the other way we're actually taking
direct3d and taking the entire graphics
pipeline and optimizing every draw call
for a che a all the shaders all the
rasterization into blocks of code to get
dynamically generated runtime and
executed and it runs really really fast
so current trends in the game market
that affect this kind of these these
sorts of cross-platform things obviously
everyone has an app store of some kind
or another now Apple will Apple of
course with with the iphone and then you
know their various others being
developed by platform vendors one of the
things that we think is really important
to to think about as the platform
address you think about is the
difference between a flea market where
you know there's three hundred thousand
different apps and you can't necessarily
find really looking for and more
regulated markets and I'll get back to
that again a little bit but we think
that's that's a fairly serious problem
in that app store ecosystem right now
where users have a lot of difficulty
finding the things that they want web
and online gaming is huge right now both
in terms of systems like zynga's games
on facebook and and elsewhere as well as
massive multiplayer games so this is
this is an important one for game
developers especially in emerging
markets where piracy is a huge issue
where if you have to connect your game
to to a server somewhere in order to
play then you don't have to worry so
much with the piracy issue and in
certainly in those games that's where
some of the tendencies that I described
earlier that the game developers can
have to less quality code and less
cross-platform are not as much of a
problem because those are by their
nature living breathing
products another major trend to think
about in gaming is core gaming vs.
casual gaming the core gaming market is
one which is you know currently very
well served between the different
consoles and high-end pcs and so on the
but the markets that we see growing
explosively right now are the the
lighter simpler markets I had I was at
intel's IDF earlier this week and was
able to hear Wil Wheaton speak about
some of his experiences growing up in
the 80s in gaming and he had a really
interesting story where he talked about
how ten years ago and his wife brought
out their old 20 Atari 2600 console and
at first the kids were like well what's
this it doesn't look as good as our Sega
why would we care and they started
playing some games and they got really
into it and he found that over over the
next month they played an awful lot of
2600 as simple as the graphics were and
part of that is about accessibility of
games and getting making it easy for for
users to jump into a game and have fun
which is of course the whole point and
then lastly because of market pressures
and you know how expensive and risky it
is to invest 20 10 20 40 million dollars
in a large-scale console gaming project
budgets are coming down developers are
looking at the spaces where things like
the the iPhone and the iPad and tablet
devices and simpler devices simpler
games because it's less risky you don't
you don't have to make a bet that you're
you're you know 20 million bucks is
going to pay off lots of developers are
still doing the big bets and that will
obviously still continue but there's
quite a lot of interest now in lower
budget games and of course as I just go
down that makes it more difficult for
developers to think about going
cross-platform other other major trans
of course we have new platforms I
mentioned the tablets and mobile devices
are obviously coming on hugely and as a
social gaming the the platform that we
trans gaming are most interested in
right now
is the connected TV platforms these are
both devices that are being going to be
offered by cable operators and TV
vendors over the next 12 months and
beyond as well as devices offered by
OEMs for over-the-top services by
passing that the cable operator or you
know a buddy box beside the beside the
cable operator so this is this is a
market that we're quite heavily invested
in we work very closely with intel on
delivering games to this market through
our game tru TV architecture so when we
think about platforms and you know as a
platform provider what do you what do
you want to do what do you how are you
differentiating yourself against against
other platforms is an important question
how platform providers work with game
developers and their overall outlook is
obviously you know really critical as
platforms proliferate and there's a
there's a bit of a paradox for platform
provider because fundamentally most
platform providers want to have some
kind of lock in whether that's an
explicit lock in through you know doing
their own first party titles some
platform vendors antennas a great
example of this Nintendo makes a lot of
money on Nintendo consoles how much
money everybody else makes uh Nintendo
consoles is you know not as clear or
whether that's you know platform lock-in
simply through market pressures you know
Apple has done a tremendous job with the
iphone in the market that they've
created there that entices developers to
to to focus on that market it's going to
be very interesting to see as more more
Android devices become more powerful get
more powerful GPS to see how that that
is going to turn out and certainly I
think that the the store side of things
is going to is going to play a very
important role there but the platform
providers want to have some kind of lock
in and yet as budgets go down it's very
difficult to get that from developers
because they have fewer resources with
which to do that we've described how
complex this problem can be so this is a
very for a platformer this is a very
challenging thing to think about in some
cases on the triple-a consoles Microsoft
and Sony you know have in the past
literally paid millions of
dollars to developers to have platform
exclusive content so you know what what
can platform providers do to improve the
situation well first and foremost you
know they can simplify developers lives
as much as possible you know by using
open standards that enables developers
to to have AP is that work across
platforms so we trans gaming do that by
making proprietor otherwise for priority
or API is able to run elsewhere but as a
you know other platform vendors need to
really think about their strategy for AP
is and what API is to use so OpenGL is
the obvious one on the graphic side
that's where enormous amount of work in
in developing a game lies on the on the
audio side open Ailes out there it's not
necessarily as popular there are few
other choices certainly I would like to
see more more effort going into open al
by platform vendors to really make it a
first-class Audio API in and solve that
problem for for developers they you know
everyone knows what they're doing when
they're when they're building audio
another issue that we're seeing
especially as we move into the connected
TV market is input so that's I'm not
going to pull it out here but on you
know these various different TV devices
there are many many different inputs
available so some developers are
developing remotes that have motion
sensitivity other developers have
keyboards on the other side of a
traditional remote that you flip around
some developers have track pads with
keyboards you know press a button and
the keys light up so you can use it as a
keyboard some developers are developing
some really advanced very cool gesture
recognition technology where you know
you simply move your hands and and
there's a Zed camera that recognizes
where you are and and you know uses that
input but as a game developer how do you
deal with this problem of having these
multiple different devices it's
difficult enough going from PCs to
consoles or back between keyboards and
controllers and how do you how do you
tell users about it this is a problem
we've been thinking about a lot we have
an API
that we've been starting to get some
feedback on from third-party developers
which we call stream input where we're
trying to say you know if we can specify
the semantics of what the application
really wants Mike my game cares about go
left go right go up go down shoot and I
specify that in in some clear concise
way through through an XML description I
can think about the actual physical
input devices as as being generic so you
might have a mouse for example and you
you take the input from the mouse and
map that to the game you might have a
d-pad and map that to the game and so on
so we the stream of input API which were
the cyber we're hoping to start giving
more public showings too soon once we've
had some some further feedback aims to
provide a general cross platform system
for handling input four games in a way
that makes it easy for developers to
solve this problem other things that
platform providers can do to simplify
things for developers is to avoid
fragmentation I mentioned earlier day to
meet literally three hundred different
phone models that that you would have to
test there were companies that have
devotee Norma's resources to you know
edsource testing or you know very small
scale development to deal with different
screen sizes or what have you this is an
enormously difficult problem and I think
one that Google in particular needs to
think about with respect to Android and
as Android devices proliferate how
that's going to work with with games and
different different screen sizes again
we talked about four by three versus
widescreen you know dealing with that
can be complicated so as much as
possible the more you can avoid
fragmentation of OS versions and and all
these other things that's going to you
know have a tremendous impact on Game
Developers abilities to deliver their
games across multiple platforms and then
lastly embracing third-party tool
vendors there's there's plenty of people
out there who are working on good third
party game engines and other tools to
make things go across platforms
cross-platform
so the more that platform vendors look
at those and try and make sure they're
on their platform that just makes it
easier for the developer to choose the
technology they're familiar with build
the games the way they understand how
and they're good at and leverage work
that others have done two to go
cross-platform then lastly I mentioned
earlier this issue of the the app store
in the flea market versus a regulated
market there's a really interesting
article in Scientific American from
april two thousand four entitled the
tyranny of choice and essentially what
it says is that having more choices is
good but only up to a point and beyond a
certain point we as human beings tend to
get overwhelmed by the choice we we have
difficulty making the decision because
there's so many choices we we find it
very difficult to compare and we think a
trans gaming this is a serious problem
right now on markets like the App Store
so one of the things that we've been
looking at for our game free TV service
is to actually have more regulation in
the market and make sure that what we're
giving to consumers is something that it
is known as high quality that they can
they can trust as being good I think
there's some really interesting ways
that you can think about these problems
I suspect that you guys here probably
think about those problems in terms of
search and I think that's that's
interesting but if you don't know what
you want how do you search for it so I
think it's really important for platform
managed to think about this as they as
they look at store type architectures
and and so on and that is the end of my
presentation so I'd be very happy to
take questions if if anybody has any
yeah go ahead
yeah yeah absolutely so the question
when you do i do I think your for those
you may not be able to hear over the the
audio system the question was whether i
think that proliferation of phones that
have very similar form factors helps
their an absolutely you know if if
you're designing your game specifically
around multi-touch input then to the
extent that the device is out there are
multi-touch input that's great for you
as a game developer and that's a good
thing so yes absolutely mmm so streaming
so that's a really interesting so the
streaming services approach this problem
by saying well we'll run the game back
here in the data center and stream it to
you and it's definitely interesting
there there in trials now i think
actually on live is live here in the US
so there are several problems with that
kind of approach I for one you know a
lot of what's going on there right now
is aimed at the higher end market that
hiring market is already really well
served on the lower end market you don't
need something so complex to serve the
you know the connected TV type of type
of games that we've been looking at you
don't need something like that and it
adds an enormous amount of capital
expense to try to get get games out
there in the long term how will it play
i I don't know we'll see we'll see what
happens in the market but you know
certainly I so i've been i've been here
in san francisco for the last live in
san francisco for the last week and i
have to say you know my my 3g service
over the air has not been particularly
good not not to impress compared to
compared to canada and which is which
after which i have to tell you from the
perspective of a canadian
and dealing with with service providers
and bandwidth issues is is kind of
freaky but yeah it's you know I I am
somewhat skeptical that that can can
serve as an effective means of dealing
with the problem for you know from a
scalability perspective from a capital
cost perspective and then from just the
bandwidth perspective doing doing that
kind of streaming is bandwidth intensive
and you know we'll infrastructures
weather over the air or wired be able to
handle it well we'll see right so on the
connected TV space it's a very new space
right now we have trans me working
really closely with intel intel has been
pretty successful at signing up
operators and signing up Oh yams in part
because of the promise of gaming
operators know am see that as a great
market for people who want to play games
at home on their TV who may not be as
interested in a in a console type device
and they're very excited by that right
now as a game developer this is you know
this is a question for people people
don't know how to target those platforms
we at translating believe that you know
the best way to target that is through
game free TV and and by you know
leveraging the technology that we've
built and we brought to the table to to
bring games over in terms of non Intel
platforms um you know and will be
successful there a lot of those vendors
are looking at solutions like adobe air
and flash and things like that or even
you know j2me for for delivering content
on those on those devices I think it's
be interesting to see whether you know
if WebGL takes off well on the desktop
whether that will play a significant
role in that in
market going forward I'm not sure that
the devices that are the non Intel
devices will have the cpu and GPU
capabilities to be able to do those well
so i think i think my practical
perspective connected TV based gaming is
going to very much the intel focused for
the next you know probably 18 to 24
months go ahead so we have some of our
some of the games that we've brought to
the mac are are on Steam yes absolutely
yeah they're doing a shading stuff we we
actually have our own portal as well 44
game distribution on the max I'd rather
than game free TV it's called game free
online so a lot of a lot of our games go
through that as opposed to through Steam
anyone else go ahead no no I so again we
from our perspective any given
technology is a bridge we we believe
that we're in the business of building
bridges between platforms the form of
that bridge takes may change depending
on on the specific platform so you know
in the case of arm you know much of our
technology could still be applicable on
the direct3d side but you know people
have to either recompile their code or
deal with code translation technologies
to go to arm if they wanted to do
something like that in terms of you know
as again you know we want to we want to
be in position to help out the market so
I mean if them if the market tomorrow
all went arm then you know and and if
they went all LOL went armed and they'd
probably all be going you know opengl
and and so on there be other
technologies that we would be able to
bring to bear for that whether it might
be you know Swiss shader integrated into
major devices in in in a way to you know
provide GPU like services on multi-core
devices what have you so we see
ourselves very much at the you know in
that in that middle middle way
Bridge bridging role to help whether
it's a platform provider developer
bridge whatever gaps there are in bring
games the platform regardless of CPU
good native Native Client port of oh
that's an interesting question certainly
it's something that we would like to
talk more about Native Client is an
interesting technology I I still feel
like I don't have a complete grasp of
how it's going to play out in in the
marketplace and what the most important
points are what one of the things about
the win32 port a technology that we have
is that it relies fairly heavily on
underlying eunuch services and the
extent that native client has those who
doesn't have those you know dictates
would dictate whether that as a as an
entire system could potentially run but
certainly various different pieces of it
could could be could be useful for
developers and then I guess my
understanding is that Native Client on
the window side is going to be doing its
OpenGL implementation on top of angle so
in a sense were already involved those
the one that we focused on most for the
last while we have in the past explored
consoles in a fair bit of detail we we'd
actually brought some her our d3d
recording technology over the ps2 way
back in the day and for a variety of
reasons in part to do some of those form
factor issues and memory issues it
didn't actually make sense to to deploy
that because there were enough
differences between the platforms to
make that level of API compatibility
moot right now connectv is is the is the
biggest thing or looking and that's
mostly Linux really other platform
pairings are going to depend on we where
the markets are and what's what's
interesting what's popular
I mean else okay well thank you all very
much i really appreciate your time this
has been awesome for me I appreciate the
invitation to come down here I hope that
this was enjoyable for everyone and
educational thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
