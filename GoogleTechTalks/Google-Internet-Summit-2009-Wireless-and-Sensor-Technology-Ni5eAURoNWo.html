perspective on wireless and sensors I'm
Craig Partridge I'm the moderator of the
session and made the presumptuous step
of being moderator and allowing myself a
couple minutes to try to set the stage
with the idea being that the following
speakers then I'll tell you either
either based on what I said could use it
as a base or could tell you spend the
time telling you how horribly stupid I
was either which was perfectly
acceptable I think many of you in the
room know me but for those who don't I
got into this internet i joined BBN
about five or six months after the
tcp/ip cutover started and have been
lucky enough to be doing networking
research ever since did internet email
and network management research in the
80s did high-performance networking
research in the 90s and for most of the
past decade have been hanging around
worrying about wireless issues in
various dimensions I still don't claim
to understand wireless however so first
of all I just wanted to give a big
picture so everybody was sort of on the
same page or at least knew what they
were disagreeing with the conventional
technology wisdom for the future and I
guess this also requires explanation I'm
a futurist I'm spending most of my time
worrying about what the world is going
to look like 10 or 20 years from now if
you ask me about routing table problems
for next year I wouldn't have a clue
what to say but I could tell you about
them for 15 years in the future so the
conventional wisdom for the futures that
we're going to see something like that
circle on the right that is that the
core of the network is going to be fiber
some portion of the network will contain
copper sometimes all the way to the edge
that on that far side you can see copper
all the way to the edge and for much of
the edge of the network and an
ever-increasing chair of the edge of the
network as well as indeed for some of
our long-haul carriage you'll use
wireless okay there are at this point so
far as I can tell no reasons to believe
that this picture is incorrect indeed
the one of the reasons that fiber is so
firmly entrenched in the middle is that
fiber unlike almost any other technology
available to us creates its own spectrum
very naturally all right you we keep
getting better and better at
packing a fiber with far more channels
the the rate of change in fiber optic
termination technology is picking up not
going down that was why when we were
talking about underwater cables earlier
I was curious about what limitations
they had inside the cable because the
edge of the cable are becoming more and
more powerful and sophisticated every
day in terms of how many channels you
can pack into a fiber how much data you
can get through a particular channel all
those sorts of wonderful things so fiber
week every time we have a fiber there
we've got an almost inexhaustible
spectrum and it's getting more
inexhaustible rather than less as we go
forward which is why it will stay fixed
firmly in the core wireless is meeting
the need for us to be mobile to be
convenient and the fact that it's a pain
in the backside to wire up your facility
indeed nowadays if you were buying
commercial DSL for example what you get
is a DSL circuit to your house and then
promptly they put a wireless box on the
end of it nobody wires at their house
anymore I feel like them from the stone
Age's because I worried up my house ten
years ago so having made that general
statement let me just talk a little bit
about what I see is two of the important
drivers of wireless in the somewhat
distant future one is an I apologize for
the formatting problem here this is a
classic case of that going from a
Macintosh to Windows and back again
programmability people don't most people
I know don't seem to know this yet but
the answer is the image of the radio all
the signs are indeed there are such
programmable radios now the future of
radios is programmable radios okay and
in fact the only real issue for the next
ten years is which of the two forms of
programmability we're going to pick one
is what people call the software-defined
radio which is to say that you put
signal processing hardware in the system
fpg used to say you know processor and
DSPs now with the rise of highly
programmable quickly programmable field
reprogrammable FPGAs the answer is
people are going heavily to FPGAs and
using less DSPs but some mix of fpgas
DSP is in a processor you just load your
software into and it tells the radio
what to do okay
and it will pick your frequencies it
will pick your channel capacity will
pick your coding it will pick the whole
nine yards okay are the there is a
continuing fight just so you know
amongst RF experts about exactly how bad
the antenna problems are I can tell you
now that if you had the perfect antenna
that went from say 1 kilohertz to
several tens of gigahertz the answer is
that we have hardware all the way
downstream from the antenna that could
happily chop out channels it 100 and 100
kilohertz increments and run any coding
you wished on it um but the issue is
getting the antenna to try to pick up
that entire range all right so the
answer is this is all it's actually all
real now the military has radios of this
type around and they're increasingly
beginning to show up in commercial
radios as well the other choice which is
a very exciting one and just gives you
sense of the range of choices is
something called the software determined
radio here the idea is and this comes
out partly out of the RF engineers
perspective they say look you know there
are only so many different coding
schemes that make sense you know there
are only so many interesting ways to
chop up the frequency space so what
we'll do is we'll give you an ASIC with
say a million configuration variables on
it all right and you'll just pick the
right blend for your particular moment
in time okay and but then we can make
these very cheap because these asics
actually need to build an ASIC that's
this configures for figural is very
straightforward and you do a large
production run it's a whole lot cheaper
than trying to pack DSPs and other
things into your radio the key
distinction here is how well do you
think you really understand the RF space
right um but the implications of either
choice are dramatic and the answer is
that innovation and radios in the near
future is going to come with the speed
of a grad students all nighter all right
a grad soon will sit up have an idea
will find a way to code it up and their
radio test it out show that it works
you'll have the code they can distribute
it to others the innovation will happen
that fast it's not clear what that will
actually do for a future because there's
this whole massive policy apparatus that
we have around wireless it's sort of
sitting down stream of the innovation
and indeed you'll hear some more about
that later in the session but a couple
of things
clearly could do one is it's possible to
imagine a radio and and in fact there
are prototypes around that sit there
dynamically sense the spectrum figure
out which at parts of the spectrum
currently show no power usage and there
are otherwise legitimate for
cannibalizing and then use it and exit
as soon as they show see somebody else
trying to use that spectrum other than
the people they expect or or if the
incumbent shows up and actually tries to
use it alright this would dramatically
increase the amount of available
wireless spectrum to people the other
thing is that it's clear that
programmability blows a big hole in any
a business model that's based on
building hardware chips to a standard
and making them and having to produce a
minute of quantity be inexpensive so
this whole notion that we care about
exactly how your telephone works and
choosing between CDMA and GSM and other
stuff completely goes away and the
classic example it gives it will happen
is you will land in a new country or you
will walk into a new service area and
your phone will say hi I'm in a new
service area it will download the code
to run a telephone in that service area
complete with all the right frequency
assignments and it will just work all
right and this notion that it somehow
hardware during your phone is a complete
croc in the future all right so the
other thing is what's going on on energy
and here I'm less of interested in being
green then I am interested in actually
talking about how long devices are going
to operate before they have to be
plugged into the power grid again all
right so this is about keeping the
consumer happy it's neat to be green too
but it turns out this is about keeping
the consumer happy so the thing to
understand is that in any device such as
this we are rapidly moving towards the
world in which your radio and in
particularly the receive side of your
radio is eating up almost all the power
okay nothing else you know 10 years out
from now nothing else is going to matter
except how often your radio is trying to
receive data sending doesn't cost
anywhere near as much as receiving it
does now in some technologies but it's
all headed towards receivers or where
the pain is ok we can make these devices
far more energy efficient than we have
to date and let me just give you a
couple of data points one is some work
by colleague of mine named Jason ready
you actually got to be on the paper
because I contributed some teeny bit but
it's too
okay Jason's achieved a hundred times
reduction in the energy consumption for
the same data rate and almost exactly
the same delay okay using a three state
radio all right what do I may three
state radio well it turns out the basic
way you have to save power is you have
to turn the radio off and so the problem
is when do you turn the radio on and
what Jason it pioneered is a low-power
radio with a cattail whisker basically
on it which acts as a doorbell and so
when you wake when you wake your radio
up you only turn on enough power and the
receiver so that somebody sending it
full strength to you with your
particular radio mac address causes a
radio to wake up and that wakes up the
high power receive radio and you receive
the data and if you do things right
basically you can show that almost all
the time you're never in high-power
receive mode unless somebody's actually
trying to send you data okay and once
you do that you're pretty close to
Nirvana in terms of energy efficiency it
all works it's now in its third
generation and very vigorously working
when i go to Jason and talk with them
about trying to make it a more
widespread technologies as well first of
all we might as well get the stuff we
have working well and points out that
it's pretty straightforward to take the
attitude at eleven energy-saving
technologies and get about a 10 x
reduction in energy consumption except
nobody does it yeah yeah okay fair
enough Greg well I'm told us nobody's
implementing the spec well enough that
we can get it so it's not true so what's
your quantifiers it's not true about
everybody no no Greg I'm not I'm not
saying that you didn't do it I know you
did it if we're well it's the product no
we're not arguing I'm just saying yeah
you're right about 80 to about 11 I
think it's a it's simple
in a more widespread fashion that you
think because when you get Wi-Fi
certification you have to pass the test
that it's implemented I think what
happens is like things in Windows the
standard default configuration gets
shipped without the good stuff turned on
right the good stuff has not turned on
and indeed some standards software you
won't even let you turn it on so the
answer is you know when you get a box
are you getting attitude at eleven card
you software has no idea how to drive it
right so okay and then what this says
for our future is a couple of
interesting things one is that devices
run a heck of a lot longer than they do
now the other one that gets sort of
interesting and exciting is that you can
imagine a certain number of devices
sensors PDAs and other sorts of things
that actually run for a full year
without recharging which sort of gets
exciting and in this space so with that
I'm now going to switch over to Larry
who can talk with you about the rich
policy space and also to other good
things and what we're going to do is we
have told all those speakers that they
get about 10 minutes they get a question
or two such as Greg's and then we're
going to bring everybody up here to set
huh Ted I said 10 minutes right yeah 10
minutes so it as I say minute to get ten
minutes to talk and then we'll with a
min or so questions such as Greg's and
then we'll all come up here at the end
to do a panel special you're up thanks
Craig again my name is Larry alder and
see if I can work this I'm a member of
what we call the alternative access team
here at Google which isn't that well
known of a team we're kind of a small
small band got Rick wit who's in the
audience also on our team so for those
of you who don't know googles mission
it's to organize the world's information
and sometimes people forget the last
part and make it universally accessible
and useful so I always feel that the
alternative access team is spending a
lot of time on the universally
accessible part of the mission so I
always break down our mission into three
for the alternative access group into
three sub efforts the first we want to
see more and bigger broadband pipes not
that Google's going to deploy them all
and build them all but we want to do
what we can to help make sure there will
be more and bigger broadband pipes we
want to preserve
the openness of the wireline Internet I
might get in trouble from Rick to say
this but you know the current wireline
Internet's pretty open you can buy the
device you want you can get it connected
to the service you want and you can
choose the application you want that's
not so much true in wireless at least
when we started this team about two
years ago it definitely wasn't true the
carrier selected the device for you you
got the device the application and the
service all together and so that's our
third thing was bringing the openness
open ethos of the internet to wireless
and that's actually where we spent a lot
of our efforts over the last couple
years and I'm going to talk a little bit
about the wireless aspects today and in
particular I'm going to talk about
spectrum it turns out that the the
wireless industry is really driven by
spectrum in a way that most people don't
actually understand how impactful it is
the FCC makes decisions and 15 20 years
later those decisions manifest
themselves in a whole economic ecosystem
that happens so let's talk a little bit
about spectrum so first of all why is
why our Google why are we concerned
about spectrum first of all information
is increasingly going Wireless I love
the chart Craig put up with the the
fiber and the wireless even if every
home ultimately has fiber and there's
fiber everywhere people still aren't
going to plug into that fiber your
laptop is going to be Wireless your
portable thing the last leg if it's
going to be Wireless and so it's
important that the spectrum is allocated
to allow a lot of data to flow over that
Wireless because we've learned at Google
is that if people don't feel like they
have an unlimited experience an unkept
unlimited experience they constrain and
they stand searches go down and and
usage goes down they have to feel like
there's unlimited capacity for them to
use so spectrum is very important we
also think it's important to have the
licensed and unlicensed compliments in
the spectrum space so the licensed
spectrum is traditionally spectrum
that's auctioned and it's licensed to
usually a carrier this is like an ATT a
t-mobile a sprint and the unlicensed
spectrum is things there
use like Wi-Fi you don't need any
license from the government to opt to
operate unfortunately there's a lot of
constraints in both of them these these
are constrained areas right now it's
hard to get licenses and the unlicensed
spectrum is also heavily used so there's
issues so what are the issues well the
macroscopic issue is the spectrum is
actually if you look at it you know from
DC to daylight as they like to say it's
not well utilized if you wheel out a
spectrum analyzer you're going to find
that yeah most of the spectrum isn't
actually active in this room in this
room you're going to see like this
little band here I'm going to walk away
this little band here the Wi-Fi been
you'll probably see that band very
active in this room and not much not
much else this so that that means it's
really wasted in frequency and in space
like in this room might be different
than outside outside you might see a lot
of cellular signals the other thing is
that this could strain on spectrum well
let me go to the third ball so we've
also got a consolidation in spectrum
this is very troubling if you and I'll
talk a little bit about this in a minute
the licensed spectrum has consolidated
over time in fact if you look below 1
gigahertz right now all the licensed
spectrum essentially rests in two
companies hands verizon and AT&amp;amp;T so if
you believe that the industrial economy
was fueled by oil and gas you see what
happens when it gets consolidated what
constraints that produced on the
industrial economy you can imagine if
the information economy is driven by
information bandwidth that spectrum is
going to be bandwidth if that's
consolidating a couple companies that's
not a good thing in my opinion so that's
one of the concerns we have this
consolidation of spectrum ownership and
that's left leads us to innovation
constraint the innovation in the devices
is just much lower there's a lot of
companies individuals would love to try
all kinds of neat stuff but they just
can't because they can't get access to
the spectrum and if we look at on
licensed spectrum below a gigahertz
there's not really any so here's the
little spectrum map and this
gets back to kind of my main topic I
spend the most time on this I was
actually asked to talk first about LTE
and wimax what's happening in the
industry and my main message is the
industry is actually driven by the
spectrum allocation so back in the 80s
what happened was these two bands a
spectrum and this is kind of drawn to
linear scale these two orange bands of
spectrum spectrum were put out it
actually wasn't through auction was
through a convoluted process there's a
very good book called wireless nation if
everyone wants to read the process the
FCC went through this but they allocated
this spectrum for cellular services and
essentially AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon were born
and wireless cell phones for cars happen
in that spectrum and outdoor
applications and the big brick phones
then in the 90s this little these two
bands were auctioned off the pcs bands
doesn't look that big in court you know
in in the linear scale from 0 to 3
gigahertz and the reason I cut off at
three gigahertz is higher than that it's
hard to do portable applications mostly
fixed that was auctioned off and
t-mobile and Sprint were born and the
whole small size cell phones that you
could actually use this is where
expensive car phones were people had
them not the masses didn't happen when
this spectrum came online the masses got
cell phones t-mobile and Sprint were
born and that's where we are and today
some new spectrum three bands of new
spectrum have recently been allocated
and it's kind of interesting so the
first one oh and by the way here's Wi-Fi
I've already talked about so the three
bands of new spectrum is this thing
called AWS which was auctioned a couple
years ago and that's where you're seeing
t-mobile's doing the gphone that's where
the high bandwidth stuff is happening
t-mobile's there with the AWS and people
are doing this high bandwidth 3g type of
applications metro pcs and and leap are
offering dongle service for portable
broadband using that spectrum so that is
really the first spectrum where we're
seeing portable broadband happening and
that's been out for a couple years
recently
this big 700 megahertz auction happened
you can just see from the scale it's a
significant chunk of spectrum right
there my prediction is this is the
driver for LTE LTE is going to happen in
this band this is where more mobile
broadband is going to really take off in
a couple years they'll shift some around
between here and there but this has
great propagation characteristics and
allows people to put out wide area
coverage very effectively the other
piece of spectrum that's interesting is
up here it's the biggest blockinspector
of two minutes and that's where wimax is
happening with clearwire so Clearwire's
being driven there at a disadvantage
from coverage because they're way up
here but that's where that's where wimax
is happening and then the final
interesting thing is down here is the TV
stations and recently the FCC ruled that
we'll look there's a lot of TV channels
but in the gaps between the TV channels
will make that unlicensed and we can use
some of these devices that Craig talked
about that our intelligence maybe they
look at a database and we can have some
unlicensed spectrum down here so let me
wrap up my last slide really quickly so
what's going on in the industry I
already pointed out there's these
significant new bands 700 megahertz
verizon an LTE verizon AT&amp;amp;T will
probably be doing a lot of LTE there the
TV white space will be a new land of
unlicensed the two dot five gigahertz
will be where wimax takes a shot here in
the US it could ultimately go LTE as
well and so this is what we're going to
see in the market we're going to see
coming up more of these mobile broadband
devices they're going to be dongles
they're not going to be cell phones yet
they're not going to be you know plug
into your laptop your cell phone cards
dongles embedded right now it's high
prices because constrained spectrum has
that new spectrum comes along the LTE
and the wimax will take that mobile
broadband and drive it down and make it
a consumer offering so thanks
okay you need a microphone so the
question I have has to do with FCC and
its willingness or not to experiment
with sharing of wider band channels now
there was a discussion for a long time
about ultra wideband and its ability to
be dynamically shared in some of the
comments that Craig made suggests it's
technically possible to do that do you
have any idea whether from the
regulatory point of view there's any
option opportunity to try that out I'm
on the ultra-wideband I think the story
there is a little bit limited right now
and people are focusing on applications
like wireless USB things that might be
also done with different variants of 802
11 I personally think the big experiment
is going to go on in this TV white space
where there's this spectrum that is in
between TV channels and it's it's not
just big blocks of spectrum everywhere
you kind of have to find your little
niche and this is going to be the first
agile radio that really makes its way
into the mainstream and it's going to be
done both with the sensing and with this
database idea where the device is
checking with a central database and the
device says I'm here in this physical
location tell me what expect room is
available to me in this physical
location I think a lot of the policy
work is going to center around that the
ultra-wideband for now I think is a
little bit not on the fort is not really
being dealt with his actively by the
policy I in what in my many lives about
eight years of it I spent in this space
in the FCC and I've actually seen
similar presentations when I was there
and obviously it never happened that's
because this whole world is basically
alice in wonderland with all kinds of
people making sure that this stuff
doesn't happen and my only comment is I
think you know if Google one
to see more of this happen enhance to
play more effectively in the in the
industry for where that's going on I
used to be in for example ctia where
Google was persona non grata because
Google was not there so there's a whole
bunch of things you could be doing I
think to evangelize this and I would
domestically and internationally and I'd
like to see you go for it so a couple
comments there I think that that's kind
of the mission of the alternate access
team and we started to dip our toe in
the water turns out that Larry Page is a
big advocate especially the white space
and he personally really did get
involved in like this TV white space
ruling doing some personal lobbying and
I think he worked with traditional
rivals like Bill Gates and I think
working together we have move the bar a
little bit on the white space getting
the ruling and also in these auctions we
were able to get an openness provision
so Google starting to get involved but
we have a long way to go so your points
flotation there's a ton of stuff that's
license I have a completely different
question how's it going on the open
handset front I'm not the best person to
answer that question you sure I saw
Chris DiBona wanted to answer so that's
perfect hi so what do you mean no
seriously um and i'll talk about this
for like a second during during the
session at one-thirty but we have an
open handset operating system and that
runs on handsets and some of those
handsets are more open than others let's
just say it's been crammed into the the
the the free runner which is a gps
device that has a radio crammed onto it
which has is open all the way to the CAD
drawings and chef specifications and
then the Android G ones are fully
unlocked phones the ADP ones are fully
unlocked phones from Strictly shipping
it we we have it tripping on an awful
lot of handsets this year and we
already shipped over a million handsets
running Android and the Android
operating system itself you can
manipulate heavily and then install on
the on the dev phone so does that answer
your question yeah so are their legal
limitations outside the US on doing this
you I don't understand the kind of the
regulatory environment so if you look at
actually modern cell phone design what's
really really interesting about this in
your and and we should give an extra
minute or two summit and I'll take this
off my talk later is that if you look at
the the system on chip designs for cell
phones what you actually have on them is
multiple CPUs now you've got one arm
that actually runs the operating system
for the phone and one arm that runs the
radio and they're actually connected and
I'm not kidding you using 80 command set
commands between them and they share
memory and that kind of thing but it's
it's kind of ridiculous and in fact the
radio operating systems are often much
larger than a modern cell phone
operating system now because they handle
the intercompany handoff intercompany
handoff inter country hand off radio
power handoff requirements i mean it's
incredibly complex software so um so yes
but it's it's it's kind of they've said
you know we're just going to abstract
away the really really hard part about
this the the regulatory the radio power
problem and then see if that works out
and that's actually how the cell phone
business has kind of been now for a
while and i think it's been very
positive actually so i now want to
introduce summit and let him get his
talking and i do want to say this is a
fun topic and maybe we should find a way
to bring it up again either during
question-and-answer ordering another
session so thanks Greg good morning my
name is summit agarwal and I work on the
mobile team here at Google I don't like
speaking for ten minutes on end so
please please interrupt me at any point
I'm going to tell you a little bit about
the mobile team and what we do only as
an example of how we view innovation and
how we're trying to bring about the
future of mobile and give you an
example actually of how we've done a
little bit of that in one particular
area and how we've tried to share that
innovation with the community as a whole
to spur innovation and development on a
much broader scale than we could have
done on our own and then i will talk
just a little bit about how we might see
the future going so diving into what the
two respective teams at Google do in
mobile there's the mobile team and
they're the Android team and at a very
broad brush level they operate similarly
they're looking to bring internet speed
innovation in the form of services and
applications out to users as quickly as
possible they then take the core
enabling attributes and features that
were used to take out the first
reference implementation and try to
share those out with the development
community and then we hope that there
will be sort of a much larger wave of
innovation and so we try to do that with
things like Gmail that runs in a browser
using app cache and app DB so we're
starting to use device level aspects of
the html5 specification to broadly
distribute cheap free applications to
more users than we would ever use the
high-end client based version of gmail
similarly the Android team is building
amazing implementations of things like
google maps that have Street View baked
right in they were the first ones to
come out with the accelerometer and
compass integration in google maps that
allow you to move the phone and have its
view move in the real world along with
you and then we try to make all of that
available for others to build on top of
a lot of our technology is in the Apple
SDK for example my favorite story though
of things emerging that we couldn't
really have even predicted really comes
from Google Maps for Mobile and I see
Matt in the back who works in London on
our mapping team Google Maps for Mobile
started way back in 2004 with a couple
of guys who said you know we think that
these devices are going to get better
and better so sure they're really small
today and really crummy and the
bandwidth is really limited but it's
such a fundamental thing to have the
ability to see maps of the real world
wherever you may be and so they plugged
away on one device they had one little
client that ran on just a small number
of phones and they tried to get that out
there and Google got involved and we
started porting to more and more devices
and the phones got just a little bit
better in a little
better and there was a long period where
it was clear to everybody watching the
metrics that we were below the threshold
of widespread usability it was too
painful for some people it was too small
of a screen for others it was too slow
further it was too clunky but over time
all of those factors changed and
suddenly we saw runaway exponential
growth of people using the application
for what we intended them to use it for
routing and mapping and map and going
from point A to point B and also doing
things that we hadn't really expected we
didn't think that millions of people in
China a place where we don't have roads
and local information would want to
virtually explore other parts of their
country they just didn't have the
opportunity to travel as much as they
would otherwise have liked and they were
downloading map tiles of faraway cities
in China all the time at an immense rate
and something really fascinating
happened after that we started to get
signal back from all of these clients so
as we hit this critical mass of people
who were using our product on cell
phones all over the world we started
observing the kinds of things that we
could collect this is a single day's
collection coming from google maps for
mobile clients and installed all over
the world it's many tens of millions of
data points we obviously record a number
of parameters I won't go into all the
details but this is the basis and this
sort of observation and evolution that
really came about on its own was the
genesis of our cell ID database that was
from our point of view a milestone and
being able to take this incredibly
valuable asset of geolocation
information knowing where people were at
different levels of granularity and
using that in google maps and so a few
years after this game some maturity we
released a feature called my location so
an iphone rim blackberry you just tap a
key and the map and it zooms in to where
you are it turns out to be an addictive
and enjoyable experience for users they
tap it all day long and they immediately
run queries for things that are around
them and so the system just propagates
it creates a positive feedback cycle of
more usage and more intensely local
usage and greater volumes of usage and
so of course in keeping with that flow
that I described earlier of developing
an application taking it to users
discovering core enabling infrastructure
capabilities and then
sharing those with the developers we
made this available to everyone
throughout the industry and so now
you've got thousands and thousands of
applications that utilize this
technology and benefit from this so
that's how the Google views from
innovation in the mobile space it's such
a difficult space in which to gain
access to the assets that you need and
so many of those assets have been locked
down for so long that one of the most
fundamental things that we're trying to
bring into the industry is greater
availability of these very valuable
assets by all means I'm looking at this
chicken pox graph here and fine and I'm
trying to figure out you know this I is
that this is not the distribution of a
swine flu virus i hope i don't
understand what it means to have a dot
in the middle of the Pacific Ocean is
this somebody asked to see the middle of
the Pacific Ocean or they were there
when they asked for something and if
they were there how the hell'd they do
that I mean what what what communication
tool would they have used as you can
imagine a huge part of what made this
useful was having a sufficient amount of
data to run lots of high-power
statistics signal cleaning noise
reduction a lot of this is just flat-out
in accuracy someone is driving on a
highway and we think that they're in the
middle of the bay that's next to the
highway and that's okay it doesn't
matter the system is very very resilient
Matt Matt why are their data points in
the middle of the Indian Ocean
um I think our database does get spammed
as well so a lot of this might be spam
but as someone said the database is
really resilient so we have algorithms
that are running continuously cleaning
this up so this probably hasn't been
clean for spamming but why is there a
line they want to know why there's that
line do any idea i I don't know is my
answer III don't know why they're there
are lots of non-obvious and interesting
things that we're there some of these
are noise and some of them are and we
just don't always know the answer could
him Tyler be there are lots of
applications that are feeding data back
into our system it's Obama's black babe
i'll tell you one quick story though
about resilience that I think was
interesting it was obvious to us that
because we were doing this on our own
certain other entities in the space who
might have access to the cell towers
themselves might take a dim view of our
of our actions of our of our taking
records of where all these cell towers
were located and so they said we're we
need to rename these we said we know we
know you're going to be names and said
well we're gonna go read them next week
so they went and they started taking
some limited action and renaming and we
had anticipated that that renaming would
happen and we have ways of instantly
respond not instantly but very very
quickly using the volume of data we're
getting to deal with remapping so the
system is is relatively robust and can
handle people actually working against
it to some degree I spent a lot of my
time in the location forensics world
what specifications are you using and
are they proprietary are you and if they
are you gonna push them out some more
you might know the incident special
better than I'm not sure if I fully
understand your question you asked what
specifications were using for what
I tell you what I'm going to intervene
because of the time issue take that
offline at lunch and when you figure it
out let us know all right let's move on
Craig how much time do I have okay um
we're going to skip this because I'd
rather talk about the last one but I'll
take one second here the most exciting
thing that we're seeing is that once you
have enough sensors in the device once
it's got a baseline amount of bandwidth
and connectivity and once we see the
what I believe are now going to be the
winning basic permutation of devices a
full touch a keyboard plus a touch or a
slider design constraining to that sort
of more limited set of things I think is
actually going to allow everyone to
focus their time and energy on deeper
and more meaningful innovation we just
start knocking down all the different
things that people use to formally have
individual consumer electronics devices
for obviously Walkman and cameras are
the first to go and we'll see
progression down that list we're trying
to exploit and take advantage of the
eyes of a phone the camera the ears its
ability to listen and process voice Mike
knows this very intimately its skin its
ability to feel and sense and to know
that it's moving in a certain direction
and its ability to have location those
unique almost human abilities to sense
are the things that we think will drive
product development in the most exciting
directions Tesla wanted to transmit
energy wirelessly almost 100 years ago
and he figured out how the plasma will
work a long long time and this image I
have no idea whether this works but I'm
sure someone in this room knows whether
this works this work I found this on
flickr I think it should that just
captures in my imagination what mobility
is all about it's about these tiny
devices that seamlessly can go with you
all over the world tapping into whatever
assets are available there whether
that's the network as Craig was talking
about whether its ability to recharge
itself I don't care if it's got the
ability to preserve its battery for a
year or just grab energy from every
table at starbucks or the cup holder in
my car I just want it to do whatever it
needs to do and to seamlessly pull down
information energy location etc from the
cloud is really what's captivating to
our imaginations I'll talk about one or
two of the
there's a slew of things that we see as
two-year three-year applications that
are super exciting the first one is
augmented reality we're getting to the
point now where if we know where you're
standing and what vector you have and we
know what direction you're facing in
because we have the compass and we might
know what road Ron because we've taken
the Street View imagery we start to have
a pretty decent idea of what you might
be seeing and then we can start pulling
information down that overlays and
augments what's around you you can then
interact with that information via voice
or by typing or what have you and so
we're very excited about the augmented
reality the other one is just that as
you saw in the previous example as more
and more people use these applications
that usage itself becomes a very
exciting enabling asset and you can
start harvesting people's contributions
whether that's information whether
that's communication whether that's
Twitter whether that's location
information it creates entirely new
possibilities by sheer volume of cheap
sensors that I think are far beyond my
ability to figure out what what would
come next but that's a super exciting
thing that person and so with that I'll
wrap up are there any questions at the
end of this you know we've already had
some questions okay all right thank you
very much so Kevin you're up
all right listen census sort of okay
your choice of implement do you like the
colors yeah this is so this isn't really
about wireless and sensors so much as
some of the things that we've been up to
and some of the thoughts that I think
might be interesting to discuss related
to network architecture and how you
interface different kinds of systems
together I'm an Intel research in
Berkeley watch this space for this name
in the future it might be different so I
we just have a few a few minutes or I
guess I just have a few minutes and
these are some of the things that I've
been concerned with and event mentioned
some and some other things that I think
represents some of the challenges we
have kind of from a network architecture
point of view today and so some of these
things are we're looking at we have a
project called disruption or delay
tolerant networking you may be familiar
with and i'll mention it really briefly
but some of the challenges that we run
into today in in the tcp/ip type
architecture is includes includes these
addressing and reattachment and if you
have both the address space problems
than and the limitation on the address
based problems that have been mentioned
but also the management of these things
and where these things like addresses
get utilized in the network and network
management so if you have access control
lists you have routing of all these
sorts of things in you have policy it's
usually expressed at that granularity
this is problematic when you when you
change provider if you have mobility if
you have things move around and there's
a number of different pieces of work
going on some in the IETF context some
of the more theoretical context they're
trying to deal with this problem I think
personally that one of the biggest
challenges is actually rooted being in
terms of an algorithmic type
underpinning for it there's been in the
last I'd say five years or six years
some interesting theoretical results
from routing scalability but most of
this is quite divorced from some of the
work that's been going on in the
standards type organizations and most of
the things that I see there so I think
there's a bunch of opportunity there in
the next slide I have will be about
opportunity on the next part is about
disruptions and performance so we
started out well then started up before
me and this other group worrying about
networks with long propagation delay and
dealing with things that are you know at
interplanetary type distances my
interest involved also communicating
more terrestrially but if you you know
we had models of mobile ad hoc networks
and even other sorts of networks that
that have wireless connectivity but they
don't remain connected all the time if
you've had the experience you probably
have your your phone goes out it comes
back it goes out and a lot of times we
have and in it we have an Internet stack
that's implemented on top in that phone
or whatever that device is and we have
internet coded applications that sit on
top of that stack and by and large
they've been constructed in such a way
that if you lose that data connection
something kind of unfortunate happens I
also carry around a gphone I didn't sign
up for the data service it's an
interesting experience I only get the
connectivity when i have Wi-Fi nearby
and a number of the applications just
kind of fall over and you have that not
that I'm really digging at Google in
particular but it's an observation I've
made um and then this last one is maybe
is a meche may startle you a little I
don't know which is that I think packets
are actually a problematic abstraction
for security properties that we want to
have now it's not fact it's totally in
general but packets have the benefit of
statistical multiplexing gain right if
you have links do you want to keep busy
it's useful to be able to merge
different things called packets that are
relatively small together but when we
combine packets with the type of
encapsulation and protocol layering
we've done then we run into problems
when we want to do security and so this
picture it's a little bit hard to see
but it's the situation we have today and
it's basically says up here at the top I
have maybe submit a data these are
headers that kind of thing and as I
project this down through the protocol
stack I slice it and dice it in
different ways and the relevant some of
the relevant information that i actually
used for policy enforcement is put at
the beginning of this thing that looks
like a packet because it's
got to come out as packets down here
then we route them and we really would
like to be able to root them along
different paths to give us more
robustness and to give us load balancing
and so on but when we do this then we
get things like well this piece at the
beginning what this is says some missing
if we pass through various Network
elements that are attempting to do
security policy enforcement they don't
actually have enough information to make
very high level decisions and so they
have to make low-level decisions and so
this is what we have today where we have
to take relatively high kind of
intuitive security type policy about
where things go and map it down into
things like IP addresses and links and
stuff like that and that's the place
where a lot of credibility from the
system and brittleness comes in because
if you change addresses and you change
topology these things don't work so well
so um there's other aspects this is the
protocol kind of aspect and I'll come
back to in a minute but there's also
host type problems we've have this open
PC architecture largely that's you know
around the world and it was designed as
a general-purpose execute anything you
want machine and it's very happy to have
people give to it different kinds of
things to be executed whether you wanted
it to or not and so there's a number of
of activities that are going on to try
to secure the end hosts but all the way
down to the hardware level but also to
try and balance that against the
openness that you still want to have in
the platform and it's kind of a you know
it's sort of a trade-off of course these
things have to do with not just wireless
so that's at the beginning I said this
is sort of about wireless it's even less
about sensors but it's at least partly
about wireless and so um so those are
the kind of things that I think are
challenges for us however there's new
opportunities as well and I guess I come
from the area where we're at least
partly looking at these clean slate
designs so there's a number of projects
around the world partly in the u.s.
partly in Europe and others about
looking at what do we do if we could
change things or what do we do if we
could change some things and again as we
we came from a place where we're
interested in connectivity that could be
poor but we're also interested in
interfacing different kinds of systems
together and possibly pre-existing
systems so now I will touch the net
works of sensors for a moment if you
have some different kind of protocol
architecture and you don't want to
change that system what's often then
today is you put some kind of proxy
agent in between maybe the internet
connected cloud and the edges that or
some other networks that have a sensor
networks or whatever else they happen to
thee but there's not really a consistent
gateway architecture that's common
across all these and one of the
consequences of what we've been up to is
to is to sort of suggest one of those
and I want to just hit some of the some
of the things we've come across quickly
some of the these we've we've largely
accomplished and this one is perhaps
future work which is a multiple
namespaces in a protocol architecture
today but we ordinarily do and the
textbook would tell you to do is you
come up with a naming scheme where you
come up with an addressing scheme and
all of the agents that that participate
in that network architecture abide by
that and that's a little bit problematic
if you want to interact with existing
networks or you want to experiment with
different kinds of scaling and different
kinds of naming procedures there are
probably you're aware different
trade-offs in the performance of say
routing based on whether the labeling of
the nodes in a graph have to do with
their topological location or whether
they're flat identifiers the scaling
properties things like that so the
network architecture we've been
exploring actually allows you to pick
your addressing structure so that you
can try different routing simultaneously
at the same time and in that some cases
you can address things based on their
location in the network and other times
you can address things based on their
names um this part here has to do with
how which if you have such a capability
you want to name things let's say flat
how would you find them in a large
network how do you do routing
scalability I have two minutes okay most
of the the Internet's type work has all
been hierarchical decomposition so you
have parts of your network you label
nodes having to do with where they are
in the topology and your summarize well
there is some alternative structures
mostly from the theory community there's
an area called compact routing which is
kind of interesting I don't have time to
describe it but it's something we're
looking at storage is a first-class
concept so caching and content
distribution is part of the network
texture so instead so as packets or
whatever they are messages objects pass
through a switch node their deposited
there as long as this the persistent
storage that's available is sufficient
to make that possible such that when you
have let's say queries for information
or matching for those which is now
supported by the extensible addressing
structure you can pull it back from the
storage that's there and this
consequently because you have storage in
the networks you can tolerate disruption
in this connection because you can
deposit things as long as you're not as
long as you don't have QoS requirements
at applications that are that are
interactive type requirements which we
think is a fair number of them and then
finally object level of security is data
arrest in motion and use up to subject
to strong controls and Providence so
this is about today we we largely secure
a channel from a host to another host
via something like HTTPS or some
encrypted Channel but when we deposit a
data object in that channel and let it
out at the other side and say put it in
a filing system usually we lose the
protection at that point or somebody
else gets to that filing system a
different way they can get it out even
if the filing system is encrypted or
something like that where maybe it's
secured its secured in some other key
material than ours so as the generator
or the author of some piece of data we
have rather little control over what's
done with it now how to do this how to
deal with this I think involves both
securing objects so I can put them on
the wall or through the network or on
the USB key or whatever else but also
some level of protected sub system on
the on this devices that use it so that
we can have some guarantees about how to
how to manipulate it I said similar to
the digital rights management but it's
not exactly it's not really the same
thing because it's not that the author
is necessarily sort of the adversary of
the user it's it's more the adversary as
some other party although we could get
into that discussion and then this last
is understanding by the network the
picture I showed you before is that we
currently map objects and down through
the protocol stack into packets and we
lose important information to be able to
do controls in the network however if
you have if you do your protocol stack
the right way I would say that you can
map these higher level use controls on
data into the protocol data units that
are carried such that intermediate
devices can see them so what it said
another way the use controls I have on a
data object need to be copied in all the
different constituents components I send
through the network so i can do higher
level controls things like firewalls in
the future model whatever and ultimately
it should not be the case that if i walk
into a wiring closet with a bunch of
different routers and i just decided to
pick up a cable and hook things together
that that should be a problem right that
ought to be a benefit not a problem okay
and i think that's it really so we're
looking at network architecture with
storage in different addressing this is
this dtn project we have in order to
realize this we and to be realistic we
need to be able to have infrastructure
that we can program that goes reasonably
quickly otherwise it won't be taken
seriously we've used programmable
devices in the network whacked back in
the olden days when it was slower like
pcs that can that we're able to be the
rooters for the NSFNET project we're
approaching this again with newer pc
architectures at much higher speed and
then this is has to do with things like
the programmable wireless devices things
like that where we can change the
network topology for our own needs so
for example do channel selection we can
do beamforming and things like
directional antennas and so on I think
that's about it my time yep okay touch
over I want to make sure Debra gets her
moment in before you get to question
well I think we'll go straight to Debra
right every year up so um Kevin ippoliti
Walden apologize but explained that he
wasn't exactly speaking on the topic
that he was given and I noticed that I
was speaking sort of on the topic of
every other session applications
technology legal standard so and a bit
of whiplash from one topic to the next I
think if you can sort of roll back to
sue meets talk is a natural segue so
definitely not talking about sensor
networks don't do that anymore so
what I do do with a bunch of people at
the Center for embedded networked
sensing an NSF sponsored science
technology center is work on a sort of a
little bit technology up an application
down building innovative applications
for scientists or healthcare providers
or whatever or people interested in
citizen science wherever we can find
some sort of flexibly minded client
flexibly minded because we have a
certain thing to offer them so we want
them to be able to use what we have but
to sort of code design it so let me tell
you a little bit more concretely what
I'm talking about we did work and
distributed sensing for lots of
different applications and in that
process recognized how useful mobile
sensing is because you're not stuck
monitoring at one point in space right
you're moving through an environment and
then we started looking at mobile sent
at mobile phones as those kinds of
sensors because not only are they moving
through an environment but they're often
usually attached to something of
interest naming namely a human being and
so let me tell you concretely about
three example applications we've built
and then I want to touch on to sort of
semi technical topics that I think are
interesting pulling out of them so one
of them is a class of applications that
is very mundane in its use of technology
it's really just geocoded imagery but
it's coordinated geocoded imagery it's a
it's um you know geocoded imagery with
an opinion or a case to make so the idea
is whatever is your the data campaign
that you want to do you post a campaign
there is a specific app that's
downloaded onto your gphone or your
iphone and in a one click click the app
i capture the photo appropriate tags are
brought up to tag the photo it's
geocoded it sent up actually in our case
it sent up via flickr brought out to a I
to a webpage that is showing that
coordinated data so this is a this is a
live URL you can go to it as an example
you can go
two garbage watch calm which was our
first example of our data campaign on
the UCLA campus Fuji waste com could be
applied in the in the Google cafeteria
from my past visits there it's for the
kids in the dorm who have cafeteria plan
and they're trying to go through efforts
to get them to take less food and put
less back on the conveyor tray so
getting images of the food waste that's
going back on the tray and we actually
have a new one up that's called out
what's invasive or working with the
National Park Service to let hikers look
for particularly invasive particular
invasive species so that can be
identified early and eradicated while
they're still can be eradicated so most
mundane technology geocoded images but
when given some coordinated process
through a web through web coordination
you turn that very mundane into a pretty
powerful advocacy and data capture
technique second example I actually want
to move over to the to the right side is
an application that we call and wellness
as sort of a play on words our first
implementation of it is in it is in
Android but it's also that your phone is
also for wellness just not not just for
communications and the idea here is sort
of a take-off on the geocoded image but
instead of everything being about images
it's also about that notion of
self-report so in many things having to
do with health monitoring whether you're
monitoring for how you're doing on a
chronic disease whether you're trying to
titrate medicine changing medication and
seeing how you're doing whether you're
doing an epidemiological study or
whether you're trying to help people
with some behavior change such as how
they eat how they exercise or don't one
of the only mechanisms that we have now
to do epidemiological studies patients
reporting back to physicians etc is
through what's referred to as
retrospective self-report every once in
a while you go and talk to somebody and
you tell them how this particular
antidepressant or whatever it is is
working for you or how this shift in one
medication to another is working for you
as you're trying to balance side effects
natural medication so there are still
many things that can't be
directly by phone I'm intrinsically
interested I'm I'm not what Craig said
he was looking 10 or 20 years ahead I'm
very much right now at all those phones
that are out there I'm interested in
what's on them now and so I don't have
any way of sensing your actual condition
but I very easy ways of asking you how
you feel right now in the moment still
self-report but not retrospective and a
big difference and I can take that
self-report and I can geocode it and
time stamp it and upload it to a web
server and give you back information
about what you said over time so our
first instantiation of and wellness is
just a simple dietary tool which it
comes up both randomly or you can
trigger it and then we're building some
adaptive stuff so it comes up not
randomly but it's smart times asked you
when you last date what you wait where
you want plan what was a good quality
who did you eat with whatever is your
diet plan isn't usually what really
matters the issue is that people don't
adhere to whatever the plan is and so it
comes back and say sorry hard to view a
calendar view the red being when you
were off plan as opposed to when you're
on planned you look for patterns when do
I tend to mess up with my intended
eating habit let me think about a small
sustainable change i can do to address
that my colleague in the psychology who
i work on this with her favorite example
is herself she buys strawberries on the
way home she doesn't need ice cream at
10pm okay reminders to buy strawberries
eat strawberries at 9pm I don't need ice
cream at 10pm simple examples but as
applied to it can be about medication
adherence it can be about physical
activity adherence and so forth very
mundane technology this case it's a
geocoded response to a prompt a final
example of a type of data and really
these all combined in different ways is
what we refer to as the location trace
so this really is my gps + accelerometer
sampled on a regular basis every about
30 seconds in my case I've been doing
for well one night before I had
accelerometer my phone just GPS but been
doing this for over a year so my
activity trace my location trace is sent
up to a private account on it
debase activity classifiers are run over
it to determine whether I'm walking
running indoors surface street highway
so now I have an activity location time
series and from that we first end this
another live at live application called
pier which is personal environmental
impact report gives me back information
about my inferred exposure to PM 2.5 up
the one of the most harmful elements in
in air pollution I'm not measuring PM
2.5 on my phone I won't go into my long
rant about why that's not happening
anytime really soon on a massive level
but the city of County of Los Angeles
and many other large municipalities run
sophisticated air quality models those
are a function of some number of sensors
and a model that they have of micro
climate and measures of weather and
measures of diesel truck and so they
maintain basically rough exposure maps
they're rough but my personal location
trace gives me my personal version of
what that exposure map means to me
through the course of my day so my
exposure map my personal carbon
calculator we also have a fast-food
exposure calculator not whether i'm
eating that food but how much time what
are my food choices where I live yeah
right okay so what do all these three
things have in common they're all I
think interesting examples there are ten
other versions of each of those things
of things you might do with location
trace geo coordinated geocoded images or
these kinds of ability to look at my
behavior over time through geocoded
prompting and then presentation and they
all have a similar architecture to them
that use existing phones as to meet
described I you I have been using a term
that Vince has now almost cured me of
personal data stream I don't know if you
remember what you said the first time I
mentioned that term to you anyway but I
when we talked to the health folks we
now refer to this as sort of your living
record which is in the sense that aside
from your electronic health record
there's your living record which is what
am i doing with my days maybe maybe if
I'm going
for regular check-ups cancer survivor
being treated for cardiac cardiovascular
disease and any number of a number of
chronic diseases three days before I go
in I capture my living record I run my
location trace I capture my dietary
intake and that's part of what comes in
with me when I come in for my checkup so
a common architecture that does a
combination of capture a combination of
processing and curation on the web
server cloud side whatever you want to
call it as of now it's very important
that this information is has his store
is kept in a historical basis you're
often looking for anomalies and for
trends and it's a combination of data
that's just mine and models that exist
on the web lots of very rich GIS
information you guys know all about that
and it's this combined set of data and
processing and and capture that is
potentially highly revealing so one of
the things that I think is interesting
to talk about and that's emerging is
where can we introduce points of
standardization and common api's and
things like that so all of this can
happen rapidly into people's benefit and
then the last thing I want to say before
finishing is that given that I see all
this happening and I see such incredible
potential to what this data that's so
easily captured tells us about ourselves
I see such incredible potential about
what this data tells us about and other
people about ourselves and so the
privacy issues are intricately tied to
how easy it is to leverage the data this
isn't even like cameras on the streets
of London or in the subways in the
airports where computer vision is still
relatively high and processing this
stuff is easy easy to mind which is why
it's so exciting to look at the
applications that can come out of it so
one of the things that we're looking at
is sort of an architectural context in
which your data your living record comes
into a personal data vault you own it it
is run it might it might be physically
distributed it might sit in the cloud
but sit in a private container in the
cloud where nobody who has any interest
in it mines it in its raw form and as
you engage in
services you're doing that by sharing
filtered information maybe in some
context you share all of your detailed
information in certain contexts but that
there is this moment of pause in this
moment of indirection that allows you to
keep this extremely rich historical
information and now we have a separate
very difficult problem we've introduced
a level of indirection but still have a
very hard problem of what's the right
sort of a language and mechanism that
lets you do sharing of the data let you
do a kind of trace audit about where
your data is going later the some of the
things that the kevin was alluding to
and i'm being kicked off okay so now we
ask all the panelists back up front and
people should start firing questions at
its and it looked like the first one was
apply for deborah so i'll give her the
microphone so as the other participant
saw Debra it's always thinking about
some of this information and are you
familiar with Google Flu Trends Flu
Trends so and when you were talking
about like you know some of these you
know the environmental things that you
know people are like looking at Northern
California the Bay Area has it saved the
air they kind of thing because i canno
we know we're monitoring but the rest of
the world is not monitoring and there's
lots of places in the world so I google
search on like no asthma symptoms that
you can like mine at the same time would
tell you would tell people I can avoid
this you know I avoid you know some City
and grease like that day yes are you
looking at some of this you know how do
you augment it to a search so I think
it's a in some sense that big generic
box that I put about GIS and web and
that I see what you're describing is
like a almost like a GIS layer that
comes out of that that search process
right so you're doing that that you're
doing that mining the data that happens
through people's searches to get
indications that there might be
something it's a fantastic idea to sort
of think about that as a layer that I
tap
to through my through my location traces
so we haven't haven't done that and I
hadn't had that thought until you meant
in it until you said it I think it's
excellent well I've only thought about
sort of some things as being analogous
to that kind of a kind of flu search I
think it's a excellent idea no this is
for you these chairs are quite rickety
and they feel silly okay so one dream
I've had for a while which seems like a
very minor simple application is I'm
stuck in traffic a long line of cars in
front of me cars whizzing by coming in
the opposite direction know everything
that I want to know every one of them
knows what I want to know why don't they
talk to each other so that's starting to
happen and there's this Berkeley
Millennium Project where they've
capturing information off of course a
few years ago when I first started doing
some grad seminars doing projects
exploring this area we did a little
application where your phone with the
GPS you get obviously you get the speed
with which you're traversing those side
streets um I just I looked at that I
said oh cool we could do this but I have
no way of getting the right penetration
out that I'm going to end up having even
a minimal penetration across the city
that somebody's going to have
implemented so I think implemented it so
I can get the data I need so it's
happening slowly as commercial entities
are are pursuing that approach there's
the capturing of the information on the
surface streets and then there's the
getting it back to you whether in the
end it really makes sense I know it's
appealing technically appealing to think
about it coming from the cars coming
back to you but whether it really makes
sense to come from the cars coming back
to you or because you're checking in on
a central more central local repository
that's getting that information I'm not
sure that's that seems to me a big
architectural question and everything
that I'm seeing suggests send it back to
a central repository have it run by a
service as opposed to a sort of
community min a operation and I don't
fully understand
the dynamics of that you want to say
anything I think that his computer
scientists we'd like the answer to be
the ladder but that the answer is
probably the former it's just easier to
do it that way as long as you have the
connectivity probably in the other
applications are already there and you
can't work your way as it SAT but you
might also though a lot of the auto guys
that are putting computers on their cars
and everything are putting in networking
capabilities and they may be putting in
ability to program them and put apps on
there so if that's the case and you have
wireless connectivity and you have
programmable radios and all that stuff
too you could certainly do that I think
they're rolling out that right so so
this raises it though you had your hand
up so I guess you mentioned that there's
a consolidation of spectrum and as a
result and it seemed like the only
solution to that problem is to use
software-defined radios in order to be
able to jump around the spectrum and not
be constrained by the particular
spectrum and I'm not the
software-defined radios I know it's greg
is very very optimistic that in 10 years
there is going to happen but a lot of
people believe that though the ideas are
going to be very power hungry not agile
enough and so on so that may or may not
happen as quickly as Craig is suggesting
it may happen so if software-defined
radios were not to happen are we stuck
in this consolidation of spectrum story
or there is a way out of that so I think
you may have missed interpreted what I
said I certainly didn't try and draw the
conclusion that software-defined radios
were the way out and the only way out I
was certainly I was saying that you know
below 1 gigahertz if you look at the
license spectrum right now that's for
mobile access it's fairly consolidated
so one of the things i agree with you
there's a lot of unanswered questions in
spectrum you know agile radios and
spectrum sensing i do think this
database idea may help address a lot of
them i think the combination of this
database and sensing can be very
powerful the idea that a device checks
in with a central database
Stan what's available on the parameters
and the terms of that availability could
really solve a lot of these power issues
you talked about and so forth I do think
that the days of finding big blocks of
spectrum that are open nationwide are
getting are coming to an end you're
going to find much more pockets of
spectrum that are not used in space and
time and you want to take advantage of
being able to use them that's the
solution is being able to take advantage
of the unused spectrum and you got to
find technologies that allow you to do
that whether it's agile radios databases
or some other mechanisms so I just want
to add to that because it's clear to me
that the I want or what I thought you
were raising was actually a definitional
problem which is a third class of radio
which I didn't even discuss which is the
so called cognitive radio which is a
radio that actually sits there senses
the spectrum and rather than doing
something pre defined by the database in
its location which is very
straightforward since they're in
actually computes a plan for how to use
this piece of spectrum and this gets
people very excited because they start
looking at things such as water filling
which for those of you don't know it is
the idea that there's well you know that
you can overlay your signal on somebody
else's in certain ways to make to reach
the full Shannon limit of the particular
channel without disturbing their signal
if you manage to code the more thought
and also as well the charming things the
future for cognitive radios while
they're feasible right is much much more
distant simply because of the
computational power required to in real
time sit down I mean we I was on a
project ones that actually looked at
encoding part of the FCC spectrum rules
and saying okay when would I be allowed
to operate in this space and the answer
is you can do it you know in a typical
laptop this is about five years ago
could computer for a small spectrum the
space and semi real-time but the answer
is you know you were hauling this heavy
brick of computation around with you
where is Larry's point about the fact
that you you show up in an area and you
have your gps and you download a
database on whether the database simply
says these channels you can use or here
are your set of three or four options
which the way you should behave here
that should work with maybe a tiny bit
of sensing that's the more likely style
of cognitive radio will see in the
coming years now and you know and I'm
optimistic because in fact you know we
now feds are now in the process
I'm a cognitive radios for well under a
thousand dollars per which means if you
look at a price curve by 10 years from
now they're going to be dear cheap I
want to make one other what I think is
important point I think also that a
solution to to this problem a spectrum
cog concentration is openness so up
until a few years ago if you wanted to
have a Wi-Fi in your cell phone the
carriers wouldn't let you do it okay it
was it was blocked and the ideas they
wanted to keep you on their spectrum
that they could control if the spectrum
opens up where we saw in the 700
megahertz auction they're saying look
any device any application then people
can be innovating they say look I'm
going to use this spectrum when it's
appropriate and that's fact you know
other spectrum like you know why I'm
going to move on to wife I'm and move on
to my femtocell when I've got good
coverage from a high bandwidth spectrum
like 25 gigahertz I'm going to use that
but when I have no coverage except for
some low frequency spectrum and use that
people could build devices that take
advantage of the different spectrum the
different people own as long as there's
open api's and there's an open ability
to do that this idea of the one
monolithic network we're all going to be
under one monolithic network I think
those days are ending and so I think
that's also a solution to the
consolidation Debbie how are you doing
identity management and just a kind of a
footnote again i love the spectrum stuff
having been in the FCC Office of Science
and Technology dealing with this the
reality of who controls spectrum and for
basically for revenue earning per you
know purposes or for national security
purposes is a significant factor that
will bound what you do
so the easy but not adequate answer the
question of identity management right
now a lot of our stuff we're just using
account setup and identities that you
have through other things whether it's
through flickr an account we set up for
you on pier but that's not the answer
because we if you share location traces
for example and even if you share
geocoded in for bread crumbs that you
leave behind through images that you
share your very easily sharing your
identity right and so there's one aspect
of just letting people know that through
the breadcrumbs we leave we share that
information but as you move into things
like sharing your location to capturing
your location traces and using it over
time over the course of years for some
health management and then what your
insurance company or something might
want from that or how that's that's used
what NIH epidemiologists think about
that information they think they can
anonymize data and of course you can't
for the most part anonymize location
traces without getting rid of the
information you're trying to maintain
the same problems they have with with
genomic data so you can use straight
forward identity management when you
talk about personalized accounts but
when you go to actually use the data
which is inherently self-identifying you
know maybe we're going to need something
like an equivalent to Gina to protect
you from location discrimination in the
way that you have protection from just
genetic discrimination it's a much more
complex question so I had a response to
Tony which was that one of the
interesting things if you go very far
down this question of adaptive radios
and open platforms and things is yeah
finding ways for people who think they
own spectrum or control the spectrum to
actually make money often and there are
in fact straightforward ways that you
can imagine that says in an open
environment or the radio that you can
give somebody the right to use spectrum
and most of the people who you know have
spectrum rights actually are using them
in large parts of the country and
they're sitting if you go to them with a
proposition that says hi I will suddenly
make that non non productive spectrum
start to give you money they get very
excited and the obvious way to think of
it is as part of the database that Larry
discuss one of the things that goes on
is that there are pieces of the database
which require you to have a signed
credit in your device that says hi I'm
entitled to you so-and-so spectrum i
paid my one year my when your chit that
says I will you know I'm allowed to use
you know verizon 18 tianyu spectrum in
the western United States and you have
that in your PDA and and so when
you show up with your GPS you can hand
that over as part of the process of
downloading the map and you get a richer
set of options about how to operate and
they're getting money because you paid
them for the right for the year and that
gets them very excited and that's sort
of a way to subvert the process in which
everybody feels they own it nobody wants
you on you mean in terms of their
spectrum or in terms national security
law enforcement guys but I yeah what do
you mean what at which particular issue
are the National they want access to
which the spectrum or the data right
well that's that's the open question of
whether you know what kind of a
certificate I have to have right can I
just can I just show i bought a
certificate valid for a year does it
have to have my name attached to it you
know and those i'm just saying for
pragmatic purposes of trying to make
sure the spectrum is available there are
mechanisms for doing that that cause
revenue to flow in the right ways which
may make the process a little easier and
okay i work in for made in cyber
security for the air force where I've
been reservist for 12 years and although
we want an enormous swath of information
the greatest chances we have of getting
that information are primarily around
the people who have the least sort of
people who are here people who are US
citizens the people who we really really
need to get ahold of will continue to
confound our ability to exert a very
centralized command and control type of
approach so I'm not sure what your
specific question is but i think yes we
want all that data i don't think that
our desire
going to match up the reality in the
near future I'm not personally making it
worse I'm sort of trying to figure out
what we should be doing but yes I think
the situation will continue to get very
very bad for us one of the pieces of the
puzzle here is the spectrum that's
actually owned and operated by the
federal government they're the big
single biggest user of spectrum a lot of
it is for national security reasons but
a lot of is given to the department
transportation in a department of
agriculture and a lot of these folks
just don't use it and so one of the
challenges happening in DC in recent
years is figuring out how to create the
right market incentive so they kind of
use or lose their spectrum and give them
the ability than to lease it out or
share it with folks on the underlay
basis for example so that there's more
access freed up for commercial or other
types of uses yes on that score one of
the more horrific things I discovered is
that the frequency maps for the military
are often set up six months in advance
admissions right today says they sit
down there's not a whole lot of
flexibility of oh hi these guys need
bandwidth today you know it's something
that they're stuck with whatever they
got assigned six months ago when they
were shipping to whatever battle area
they're going into it's it's yeah it's
it's spooky but you know the flip side
is the allocation zone it was good there
was an article recently suggesting that
we don't have enough bandwidth allocated
for real time flight testing and the
reason is the more sensors on the planes
they want more bandwidth that of the
planes and they don't have a way of
allocating that amount of capacity and I
looked at that and had two reactions to
it one of which is yeah I believe they
need more capacity but the answer is
they're looking at this for like a
single test you know three months from
now they want a large amount of capacity
for about eight hours and this is the
ultimate what you want to use dynamic
spectrum for but you know I have two
questions first one has to do with
wireless as a broadcast medium it's it's
true that you don't have to treat radio
as a broadcast medium you can have
point-to-point antennas and horn
antennas and so on but for the moment
let's imagine that we're operating in an
environment where multiple parties can
hear transmissions I'm not sure that I
heard very much in any of the
conversations about our protocols that
take advantage of knowing
the various devices may actually
multiple devices may actually hear a
transmission possibly making more
efficient transfers of data because
multiple parties receive it you don't
have to transmit it separately possibly
other kinds of applications so that's
one piece of protocol that I'd like to
hear some reactions to the other
question has to do with layering there
already were comments about the network
knowing more about the application as so
as to adapt better to it layering has
been a very powerful tool because it's
allowed large number of different
technologies to participate in a common
structure so that doesn't matter whether
you're on a radio or an optical fiber or
something else somehow or other you can
emit an object that somebody else in the
network can receive yeah but that's also
been argued to be limiting and so I
guess I'd like to hear a little about
the layer in question and whether we
need to break that model in order to
take better advantage of either wireless
or multiple transmission systems but
let's let me start with the first
question Kevin so with regards to the
first one this is other transmitters in
a shared media there's been a bunch of
work at the coating layer in the last
couple years a bunch out of MIT that
that shows that kind of the convolution
of multiple signals can be deep involved
in such a way that you don't have to
resend things over where that fits in an
architecture protocol layering I suspect
would be somewhere down below but maybe
it has something more more interesting
if you know ahead of time like what so I
don't know the exact answer but what is
routing mean in a network in which you
fractionally got stuff that somebody
else admitted that some previous point
in time I think the coding has been
largely worked on but I don't know if
the higher layer implications on data
distribution has been sort of worked out
pregnancy to butt in okay please so then
in the in the cellular industry I think
things are trending away from
broadcasting so what's happening in the
in the cellular industries is that
people they started with you know
broadcast antennas they went to sect
rised antennas and now they're really
going with this OFDM that's part of
wimax and LTE they're going to multiple
antennas that are coherently combining
signals actually at the spot where the
user is in order to eat as much capacity
as they can out of the spectrum so I
think the trade-off they're saying is
that most of their communication is not
broadcast it's you know unicast and so
they're starting to optimize their
systems around that now some people like
the services that Qualcomm runs that are
like television to the mobile phone
that's a different thing and they build
whole different infrastructure around
just a broadcast medium but i do think
cellular is trending away from broadcast
and going to these more directed
spectrally efficient technologies so so
let me try to do something in channel
somebody maybe we should have invited
which is van jacobson who argues the two
questions you asked to the same question
and that in fact the the broadcast
aspect of wireless when you use it right
is a wonderful tool for reaching out and
finding the right person who has the
right or the right entity that has the
information you are looking for locally
and he is in fact if you go listen to
his you know video talk that he gave
here google you look at the interview
that he gave an ACM q it was published
in january you know he talks quite a bit
about using content structure as much as
kevin described in which you signed the
data objects okay and then you think of
moving those around that one of the
things that Wireless is extremely good
is is finding out who has it locally
rather than the unicast model of going
instead off to some server which may be
off net to tell you oh it's over there
or whatever you say anybody kind of
locally and that you know wireless it's
suddenly that query which had previously
been as he puts it a case of you sending
to 10,000 people 9099 of whom throw it
away becomes a useful way of creating
all 10,000 in the room immediately and
saying who has it and he's points out in
many cases you do have it oh boy now
we've set off both Steve and Greg so
this is fun would you reconcile the
interview just gave to what Deborah gave
me what I asked a comparable question
with respect to peer-to-peer versus
central
sharing information I don't know that I
how much I agree or fully understand the
depth of the Craig channeling van
comment but they're different in the
sense that one of my arguments for you
is that you have to you have to have
this collaborative network of man a
deployed to get all that data back to
you with enough probability you're going
to count on it being useful to you
whereas in this context you're talking
about I think largely communicating with
things that are for the time being
static and might well have information
cache near you so he's just I think
talking about basic locality yes not
it's not as many sort of multi-hop the
whole system that has to come together
to make it work it is more involved in
the man a case it might ultimately go
there because that would be the more
optimal case once it's wildly successful
I just don't see that as the deployment
path and ends up being so I mean the the
other question you asked was about the
layering and and so I'm not against
layering per se but we also normally
have layering with an encapsulation
model where the encapsulation model
causes us to have complete opaqueness to
the layer about we just say we're not
allowed to look in there I think that's
actually part of the problem is that
when you project downward you don't do
full opaque encapsulation you still may
have layering but not the so picked us
because it's those high level properties
that you don't want to lose regarding
the other thing it's true in the in
local wireless type beats this is very
helpful to find things and do limited
and a limited distance discovery you
start to go further and further and
further and everybody's trying to do
that and now you're you're advocating
going down to an object level of say
data or you could even push it all the
way down into a word in a document
what's the scalability of that and how
do you summarize that how do you do that
so the question I raised about I think
how to do scalable discovery / routing
is is a really fundamental one and that
I think there's this disconnect between
what we might call
networking heads and the graph theory
people and I think the graph three
people actually have something to offer
we have something to receive but we're
speaking a different sort of language it
could well be and let me just say van
argues that what the content stuff plus
the the ease of using broadcast media is
that the narrow waist should be moved up
and so if you read bands discussion in
January what he's arguing is for the
late that they're still layering but the
narrow waist is not IP but it's actually
right up at around content and greg has
been waiting very patiently which is i'm
liking so well this thing on you know so
the the second word that comes up when i
hear the first word broadcast is storm
broadcast storm right so the concept is
clean and easy and it was a fallback to
avoid figuring out how to deal with the
inability of broadcast to scale
especially when after the broadcast
their responses right it just falls
apart so even though the concept is
correct and you want to be able to query
large numbers of people require some
serious engineering and maybe thought in
order to make it work at scale that's
the only common which is probably an
excellent comment on which to end and
head for lunch so I hope you all enjoyed</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
