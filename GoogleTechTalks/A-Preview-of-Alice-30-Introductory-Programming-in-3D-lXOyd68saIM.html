a programming language I'll point out we
have Peter Norvig here today is one of
the biggest fans of Alice Peter and his
daughters I believe right I'm pleased to
welcome my friends from Carnegie Mellon
or here today to talk briefly about the
Alice 3d authoring environment and
they'll show us how it fits into
computer science education as many of
you know Randy Pausch started working on
Alice back in the early 1990s and these
are the folks this is the team that he
is entrusting with her future
I've known Randi for many years and I've
been keeping a close watch on the Alice
team and the progress going forward
today we'll hear from Dennis kagra
Dennis cosgrove and the the team about
the future of Alice Dennis was
discovered by Randy Pausch and then I'm
told carefully conscripted into
indentured servitude for the Alice
project right from the beginning dennis
has Co offered several papers and
presented at various conferences
including sig Chi unable to be with us
today is Caitlin Kelleher an assistant
professor of computer science at
Washington University in st. Louis
Caitlyn's graduate work at Carnegie
Mellon featured the development of
storytelling Alice which is which
introduces programming as a tool for
telling stories
however we are pleased to welcome Wanda
Dan and Dan Jenkins from Carnegie Mellon
Wanda recently accepted a position and
faculty position at Carnegie Mellon and
now serves as the director of the Alice
project a role for which she was
handpicked by Randy Pausch please join
me in welcoming the Alice team to Google
I wish to begin by thanking all of you
for being here today and thank you to
Jeff Wallace for arranging this meeting
and to all of you for allowing us to
give this presentation today we want to
particularly extend our thanks to Google
for your continued support of this
project
the Allis project has been a part of
Carnegie Mellon University for the last
10 years and I have been very pleased to
join in that in that research group as
an overview of our presentation today
we're going to first talk about what
Alice is then we will take a look at the
current version of Alice how it is being
developed and researched and its impact
on pre cs1 and high school students by
cs1 we mean the first rigorous course in
computing majors at colleges and
universities nationwide then we will
take a look at Caitlin Kelleher's work
with a special version of Alice called
storytelling Alice that she has tested
with middle school girls and finally we
will take a look at the future of Alice
in the next version which will be Alice
3.0 and our push into CS 1 Alice is a 3d
graphics and animation environment it
has a drag-and-drop interface it allows
the students to create a virtual world
in which they put various objects and
then tell a story create a game perform
an animation task you're going to see a
demonstration of this environment in a
few minutes what are the research goals
of this group and how does Alice to fit
into or reach those goals well basically
when we began to work in developing
Alice 2 our goal was to better prepare
students for a rigorous cs1 course I do
want to stress the preparation part of
this we do this in introductory
programming courses in high school and
and what are called pre cs1 courses at
the freshman level in college I do want
to make absolutely clear that we are not
trying to dumb down
cs1 what we have been trying to do is to
better prepare students to do a good job
in CS 1 and we want to allow professors
who are teaching the rigorous cs1 course
the opportunity to actually strengthen
the curriculum in that course so how do
we better prepare students for success
in a rigorous cs1 course our goal has
been to focus on the fundamental
programming concepts so we aren't really
departing from the traditional kinds of
concepts we simply want to go about
preparing students for understanding
these concepts to greater depth and we
also want to make it easier to add into
the traditional curriculum the
object-oriented concepts this has been a
struggle for computer science
instructors in college and university
level because we still have the 14 weeks
during the semester to teach the same
traditional concepts that we've been
teaching for 25 to 30 years but we are
now adding in the object-oriented
paradigm and classes and objects do not
make this process any easier so we want
the OP the object-oriented concepts to
actually be easier to learn so that we
can focus on the traditional concepts of
decision making repetition sorting the
various algorithms that we all know and
love and we want the students to be good
problem solvers and we very much like
them to understand and be able to use
effectively the logic involved in the
programming
as I mentioned a minute or so ago we
really haven't changed the fundamental
concepts that we want to teach but what
we are looking at is how we are doing
that teaching and what tools we are
using to do the instruction just to be
honest I started to teach computer
science in the mid-1980s and when I did
so I was teaching in C and in Pascal and
the first program that I taught was the
hello world program and I'm sure you
recognize that this program in Java is
the same type of program it's just
somewhat different syntax maybe a little
more complicated all it does is print
out hello world when I start to teach a
class of this type just today's students
what I find is that they look at all
this code and they realize that what
they've just done is they print it out
to the screen hello world in this little
black box and then they look up at me
and they say and this is supposed to be
exciting I can just take a cell phone
and type in hello world as a text
message and send it out that's cool this
is no longer considered to be a cool
thing to do and so really in today's
world with today students who have iPods
and cell phones and all kinds of
multimedia in their world every day the
traditional programs that are still in
our introductory level courses are just
not exciting so the question is how do
we turn today students on to programming
how do we introduce them to programming
in a very effective way and still not
dumb down curriculum
well what we decided to do is somewhat
revolutionary we wanted to take the
traditional concepts and the traditional
problem-solving techniques and not lose
those but add some new ways of going
about it so we decided to change the
design technique to storyboards this is
a technique students are familiar with
they're very into the animation film
industry they love the films coming from
studios such as Pixar and Disney and so
they understand this process and we
found this an easy way to get them
interested in the design we also wanted
to use program visualization we knew
that the change of state that occurs in
the depths of the computer somewhere
were simply not visible we wanted to
make that change of state visible to do
that we use a technique called program
visualization and that's another talk
all by itself but we also wanted to talk
about the highly motivating features
that we felt we could use from Alice the
3d graphics and the animation the
students find this very interesting
they do enjoy working with the animation
so what we're going to do is a brief
demo of the Alice 2 system to give you a
flavor of this and then we will talk
about did we or didn't we succeed Dennis
ok so I'm gonna give you a little demo
of Alice 2 which is currently available
for free on the web and everything like
that and this is Alice and the idea the
what you want you to take away from it
is it's like the world's simplest it
still it's an IDE that's designed to
make it really easy to learn to program
and so first thing I'm going to do is
I'm going to add in an ice skater and so
I go to our gallery I scroll over to
people and I'll
and I've sort of set up half of the
scene as you can see there's already
this frozen lake and we're gonna have a
little ice-skating demo here I'm gonna
drag her in and so then I can move her
around in the scene and what I'm going
to do is just set her up so she's facing
this way towards the hole and I can
click on the ice skater over here in our
our tree which has all the objects that
are in the system you can see that the
ice skater has a number of methods so
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
start to program and I'm just going to
drag and drop this method to tell the
ice skater to move forward one meter and
I'm just gonna play that and watch my
program execute okay and so then when
we're done let's say after she's we're
gonna do a little routine here so let's
have her after she's done moving forward
let's have her turn all the way around
and so I'm able to quickly explore and
play and learn to program but I don't
have to worry about where the commas go
where the parentheses go if there's a
semicolon or a colon and just other
things you can actually you know we we
commonly think of things like
parallelism and secret as being a
complicated process but we just sort of
make it complicated little kids actually
have no problem at all with handling to
do together construct so let's say while
she's moving forward we want her to lift
her leg while she's going and so we'll
select her right leg and have it turned
forward a quarter so while she's doing
this she'll do a little her little
routine so if you notice I have this
little hole precariously located over
here let's place it right in front of
her and right now I want to introduce
some conditional programming so let's
Greg grab the if/else clause and the ice
skater in addition to have a whole bunch
of methods that you know animate and you
can watch the state change over time
also has some questions or functions
that you can ask her and so let's ask is
the ice skater within let's say two
meters of the hole and if that's the
case then let's just have her move down
ten meters okay and so now when I play
it what's gonna happen is she's gonna go
over the whole skate and fall and that
wasn't it that wasn't what I wanted
right I want
I don't want her to do her her turn over
the whole what I really want to do is
have this turn happen down here in this
else clause but because it's not some
hidden data and it's not summing up all
the numbers and then taking the average
and at the end getting the wrong number
and not knowing where it went wrong all
on the way it's you can see it execute
so you can figure out really much more
quickly where your problems are so just
to blaze through and get some more
things that you'll commonly encounter in
a computer science class or all the
concepts of computing let's make a new
method and we'll call it skate up to and
around okay and what I'm gonna have the
ice skater do is and skate up to and
around is I'm going to teach it to teach
her to skate around the red cone let's
say that's our first task so we're gonna
have a turn to face the red cone okay
let me move the whole out of the way so
we can actually get some stuff done and
I'll move these cones out into the world
a little okay so first of all I'll
return and face the cone and then we'll
have her move forward some distance
we're not sure how much but let's just
have her move forward a meter for now
and then we'll drag this in just like
the other methods and have her skate up
to and around when she's done with her
forward turn and then she's going to
turn to face the red cone and move
forwards on the mouth and again we want
to want to be able to use a function
here and so we're motivated to use
functions at this point because we want
to know how far away to this particular
thing so rather than moving forward a
meter let's move forward the distance to
the red cone okay again I'm able to
explore all these concepts of computing
without having to worry about syntax and
everything sort of happens in front of
me I can watch it happen and kids are
able to tell these stories and make
these games that are motivating as well
we don't want to go all the way to the
red cone we're going to get up to and
around it's let's drop off a meter from
there and then we'll have her turn left
say a quarter and then turn all the way
around the cone
and we'll do that by just using the cone
as a reference frame which sort of a
legacy thing from back when Alice was a
3d graphics system design for making
cigarette papers a long time ago okay
further you can then parameterize this
method so you can say well what do you
want to skate around and then I can drop
this in where ever there's the red cone
okay let's see what I got here now let's
hook it up to skate around the blue cone
instead see if I this actually it's
going to go right okay okay and one last
thing you can do you know a lot of
people first reaction to Alice is that
it's you know just a toy and everything
like that but you can really introduce
you can do recursion you can do all
sorts of things in Alice whatever the
teacher decides that they want to teach
and in this case I'm actually going to
just run through like the iterating for
loop construct where now we're going to
iterate around all the cones and have
her do a little routine so that's just a
little flair a little taste of what the
Alice 2 system is about and at this
point I will hand it back to Wanda
thank you so as you have seen we really
haven't dropped all of the fundamental
concepts we've just made those concepts
a lot more interesting a lot more
attractive to today's students Alice is
downloadable from the web and this has
helped us to have the system adopt
adopted by many schools many colleges
we'll talk more about that one of the
things we found out in our research was
that in order to have the software in
use in classrooms across the country we
really needed to provide some
instructional materials why is that well
because in addition to coming up with a
3d animation system that could be used
for teaching we had to teach the
teachers how to teach with the software
and so we developed many instructional
materials for this and in our philosophy
of let's make it free these
instructional materials are also free
for instructors on the web as with any
good research group we now have to
determine well does it work is it
effective in teaching what we want to
teach are we better preparing the
students for success in CS 1 we
immediately found out that it's a highly
engaging approach it's very motivating
we get hundreds literally hundreds of
emails every semester from instructors
around the world and they tell us that
for the first time in their teaching
career they have students who linger at
the end of class they have students in
closed labs who do not want to leave the
room to let the next group of students
come into the lab the students are quite
clearly enjoying the process
so that they sneak extra time to work
with the software they download the
software on their own and put it on
their own machines and work on it for
many hours on the worlds that they are
preparing fun
oh my well what this means is you're
going to get the Statler's and the
Waldorf's out there who are going to say
well if the students are having all that
much fun are they really learning
anything hmm
well it's a reasonable question are they
really learning anything so we decided
to do some formal studies in which we
set up these pre cs1 courses we put in
there the students who had had no
previous programming experience who are
typically at risk of not doing so well
in a rigorous cs1 course then we
followed them into CS one and we did not
tell the CS one teachers who the Alice
students were these students took the
regular rigorous cs1 class and they took
the same exams as everybody else and we
just wanted to know how did they do hmm
we found their grades improved by a full
letter grade and we found that the
retention of these students following
them from CS 1 into CS 2 was nearly
doubled
textbook publishers tell us that the
eight textbooks which are already on the
market are selling like like hotcakes no
kidding
one publisher tells us that their one
textbook is now in been adopted in
approximately 10% of the colleges
nationwide that's a great success story
backing that up what we're finding is
increased downloads from the Alice org
website we are approaching 1 million
downloads at this point in time so to
sum up what we found was that this no
syntax based frustration from the
drag-and-drop interface and the fact
that the objects are now visible and
that the change in state that can be
seen as the program runs and the highly
motivating context of Alice has given us
higher achievement and improved
retention so now what we're going to
look at is well first goal check what
next Dennis all right so I'm gonna talk
about another research goal which is so
we've talked about retaining the
students who come in - who want to be CS
majors but then end up getting turned
away somehow we want to talk about now
is how do we attract more students into
computing and with this I'm going to
talk about Caitlin Kelleher's PhD
dissertation she just received her PhD
in computer science from Carnegie Mellon
it's always tricky I think when you try
to present someone else's work because
it always gets blended in you know
especially when they've moved on to a
new university in everything like that
so one of the nice things about being at
Carnegie Mellon is a you it's got this
great fine arts department so you make
friends with these artists who can draw
pictures of your friends and so this is
Caitlin and I try to and she would
probably kill me if she realized I was
putting this but now on YouTube so I'm
sure she'll find out but I'm gonna put a
little picture of her in the bottom
corner just as a subtle little reminder
that this is Caitlin's work which is
especially important because now she's a
she's
an assistant professor at Washington
University and st. Louis and continuing
in this arena so I just definitely wanna
give her greater than so this big
problem where we need more and better
computer scientists and they're just
dropping out right we actually have lost
over half of our computing majors in the
last seven years which is pretty
startling it's even more disturbing to
me at least is that we have this ever
widening gap between the demand in
computer science and the women in
computer science so that dotted first
line is the men's coming in to be
basically declaring themselves as
probable CS majors and the bottom we
have the women and what you'll notice is
what's really disturbing is that you
know we've actually reached new lows
here we're actually got the lowest level
since in the last thirty years as far as
women coming in to computer science and
so how do we address this and so if you
want to get more women into computer
science right you have the basic the
basic idea is that you have to get them
early and that's before they turn away
from math and science which is generally
considered to be you have to get them by
middle school so what caitlin set out to
do was a rather ambitious goal was to
build a system that would ler that would
lure middle-school girls into
programming okay so how do you do this
well the first observation is that easy
isn't enough and that we in the Alice
research group where you know they're
other people you know the boys in the
group we're essentially just working on
making it easier to program so we're
just trying to lower all the barriers
we're getting the syntax out we're
making this program visualization we're
just making it so it's easier to learn
how to program this is an actual quote
from an actual 12 year old girl who was
going through one of our tutorials were
you gonna play with the stupid bunny and
she's like okay so I can move the bunny
around but why would I want to
and what Kaelyn found was that if you
prove if you if you can build if you can
provide the the support just for
storytelling if you can present
programming as the means to end to the
end of programming you can actually
lower Laura the middle school girls into
computing and so just as a comparison
there's a whole bunch of really good
results that she came that she
discovered in her dissertation and I'm
just going to highlight a few of them
here and one of them just to sort of
compare the differences between
generic or alles to to storytelling
Alice's system that she built is it an
Alice 2.0 all the objects are created
equal if you notice when I brought in
the ice skater I went to the gallery and
I went to the objects and I sort of
scrolled over to people because it's
listed alphabetically which when you
think of it now is pretty embarrassing
that people are somehow just at the same
level as chairs and because we built
this system that was designed to be
generically useful for everything so we
have these generic methods that come
from our you know legacy of being a 3d
graphic system so we have moved turn and
roll and resize which sort of which are
now gets to translate rotate and scale
from the graphics community and these
are sort of useful these are you know
they're there they make it possible to
do anything but they're not really
well-suited to do things for articulated
figures like people which is you know
something you really want to be able to
do and so should all this formative
evaluation which she's got all these
people coming in and using her system
and keeps iterating on it and she
basically determines that what you need
to do to support storytelling is you
need to start it off with all it has to
be people centric and then those people
need to be able to communicate they need
to be able to walk around they need to
be able to change posture attend to
things interact with things which
actually these methods are really bad
for especially when you start
accumulating Euler angles on joints it's
just a disaster and it's a disaster for
everyone not just seven seventh-grade
girls so she comes up with all these
methods she builds this wonderful system
and then like any good PhD student she
does a summative evaluation and she gets
these representative students she draws
from the Girl Scouts so they're not self
selecting she decides this wonderful
sort of classic control group versus
experimental group thing it's really got
all these clever little things which you
know I I suggest you all go and look
into it it was really fabulous I'm just
gonna point out a couple of little
things but just one thing about him and
so while the students are using the two
systems she's comparing sort of Alice to
is the green bars and storytelling Alice
of the blue bars she tracks what
everyone does and basically everything
you do in Alice can be pretty much fit
into three categories doing scene layout
so moving the ice skater around on the
on the lake if you will
editing your programs and running
programs and obviously if you want
people to be low learn if you want
people to learn how to program if you
can get them to spend more time editing
their programs and less time doing
interior decorating and just moving
stuff around that's good
but you actually have to do something to
pull them into programming and so nicely
if you compare the bars it's over here
in this is just how much time they spend
in each activity and you can see that
the girls who are in the house two
conditions spend a lot more time doing
scene layout than editing the program
right we get all these people we draw
these girls into programming and I find
even more encouraging than that so if
you look at this this scatter plot this
is all the girls who are in the all the
you know Girl Scouts who are in the in
the generic Alice 2.0 condition again
and over here we have the time spent on
scene layout and on the horizontal you
know vertical axis time spent on cielab
horizontal axis time spent editing their
program so just to be a gross metric
lower and further to the right are good
okay you see this whole population of
girls who do nothing but layout the
scene because either they try to edit
the programs and there's just nothing
they want to do or they just don't get
drawn into it but there's this whole
population of girls who don't do any
program if you overlay on top of that
all the girls in the storytelling
conditioning condition all of them do
some healthy amount of programming and
as you might imagine all the girls in
this group learn a lot more about
programming than those girls so like I
said Caitlin is continuing with this
research and if anybody is interested in
this whole thing I suggested you contact
her this is our webpage but you can also
just type in Caitlin Keller into Google
or Caitlin Allison to Google or a house
into Google never storytelling else okay
so I've been telling you all this we've
been going on about how storytelling is
good if you bring it in you can bring
all these new people into computing so I
think I'll take this moment to tell you
a story so I'm at the airport and I got
my Google t-shirt on
and I get up to go to the bathroom and
you know sometimes when you're waiting
for your flight and you've been working
and you're tired and you're not really
paying attention and you're sort of
spaced out a little so as I make my way
into the the restroom I'm confronted by
all these women and I immediately
realized I've walked into the ladies
room so I sort of sheepishly turn around
and start walking back out and this
woman behind me says you're feeling
lucky all right so there you go that's
an actual true story
so with that pathetic attempt at humor
we'll talk about what's next and so the
biggest demand that we get from Alice
right now is from cs1 professors you
might have met as you might imagine you
can show people that if you add a new
pre cs1 class you can improve everyone's
grades and retention and everyone's like
well that's fine but I either can't or
don't want to do that so what a lot of
people want to do is simply take Alice
and use it for the first couple of weeks
introduce some of the concepts and then
immediately get them to a professional
programming language now whether or not
you think that's a good idea or not I
personally would think you know you can
wait longer but whatever they want to do
we're trying to support them the problem
with this is is that well if we get when
we get feedback from people right now
this is what they're having the hardest
time with is that they're able to
introduce people to the concepts of
computing and that's working really well
and it's helping them it's obviously
helping them their grades are going up
by a full letter grade later but if you
think about it we've just taken out one
part of the problem and then when they
when they get when they go to move to
Java what happens is is all at once
right they didn't with the syntax then
some professional IDE which is really
complicated if they're lucky they're
actually a lot of people still use make
files in CS one
they changed the API on them so they're
used to using you know they're used to
telling the ice-skater to move in turn
or use these higher-level methods and
Allison we change that on them and we
voice hidden data not hidden data on
them as well so we take out the program
visualization do all this at once and
you actually have this you know it's
it's it's better than not having Alice
beforehand but it still could be it
still could be better and one of
big mounters for the owl's project is
one hard problem at a time and so like
we've said before we don't want to dumb
down computer science we're not trying
to make it out like this isn't a field
without its challenges but the way I
think of it a little bit is that it's
like if you want everyone to be able to
park an 18-wheeler at the end of your
course the way we approach computer
science is a little bit like we sit them
down in the 18-wheeler on day one of the
class have them deal with everything
from day one and say and look some of
them make it through at the end another
approach would be to start people off in
an automatic little compact car and get
them familiar with that and once they
get they can deal with that they move on
to the standard transmission and oK
you've got that and now we want you to
deal with just the tractor we're not
going to put the trailer on as well and
then we add the tractor in the trailer I
like this analogy because a little bit
because a lot of people think syntax is
important right and to drive an agent to
park an 18-wheeler you do have to know
how to do a standard transmission right
but once you don't have to handle them
all at once right and once you've got
the standard transmission down it really
isn't a problem there are not and
neither is syntax really it's just a
problem at the beginning all right once
you've got it down it's not really a
fundamental problem so what are we going
to do we're going to apply all the
lessons we've learned and build Alice
tree so we're gonna keep the drag and
drop to prevent syntax errors we're
gonna keep the program visualization
we're gonna we're gonna have this
transition to Java which is going to be
gonna make it so that people can just
seamlessly move on and we're gonna
provide this storytelling things so
we're going to focus on the people we're
gonna have all these higher-level
animations it's going to be all these
social animations we're gonna let people
create there's going to be all these
characters that they can make in their
own image it's like how are we gonna
pull it all this off is the real answer
the question sorry the real question if
you look at it these are the sort of
things that is your sort of typical
academic computer science research group
can do right but to do this right
requires a lot of modeling and animation
talent a lot of artistic talent that you
don't typically have and so I started
about this time that Randy comes to me
we're like talking about doing ilustrate
he's like I've got a shot at getting all
the assets to the sims 2
which to me at the time seemed about as
likely as this incredibly ambitious
spiders plan but the spiders right if we
pull this off we'll eat like kings and
as I've already alluded to you earlier
in my embarrassing story I'm feeling
lucky so let's go and for those of you
don't know much about the Sims I
certainly didn't at the time I hadn't
played it before but I started playing
The Sims is the best-selling PC game of
all time it's the best-selling franchise
and unlike most of the things on this
list it actually has more female players
than male players and when this whole
thing was starting to come to reality
and it looked like it was actually gonna
happen
I started playing The Sims and I got to
see exactly why it's absolutely the
perfect match for what Alice wants and
so when it was becoming a reality that
this was actually gonna happen people at
EA actually they asked us well is there
a different game that you'd rather have
because maybe you know they make a lot
of games it's like is there something
else that we'd be a better suited and I
was like no it's perfect and the reason
why it's perfect is not just from all
the things we learned from Caitlin's
research but there's also this book
called unlocking the club house which is
a really it's a great book and it's been
very influential on me and it really
opened my eyes to a lot of the reasons
why we have this gender imbalance in
computing but they discard describe this
study by Brenda Laurel at interval and
one of the things they determined was
what would be the ideal adventure game
for girls and it would have it would
would basically take place in everyday
real-life settings it would have new
places to explore and have a strong
storyline but the characters in it would
be everyday people is real to the girls
as their best friends and success in the
game would be determined by development
of friendships which is exactly what the
Sims is it's just a perfect match and so
one of the things I want to make sure I
emphasize is that you know we're talking
a lot about how we're going to make this
so that we can attract girls into
computing but just like the sims seems
to have this this characteristic that
you can bring females in but not turn
away the male's Alice also seems to have
this property where you can provide
these higher level animations provide
the storytelling theme bring in some of
the girls into computing but not turn
off the boys
so why would Electronic Arts do this
right the first thing is never
underestimate the power of executive
vice presidents who have middle-school
daughters who just turned away from math
and science okay it really hits home you
show them the results of Kaitlyn's work
and they know exactly what you're
talking about they're they're their
daughters just you know they were fine
they loved math and science and also in
middle school hits and they decide it's
not for them the other thing is that
they believe that they determined that
it's in their best self interests right
it's in their vested self-interest to
improve the talent pool because they
hire a lot of computer scientists so if
they can make they can bring more and
better people in then they'll have
better people to hire and they're also
in they're especially concerned with
bringing more women into computer
science you know they want to bring more
girls and women into computer science so
that they can hire more women to build
more games that maybe they can tap
better into the the female game market
okay and wait so what does Alice 3 get
Alice 3 gonna be okay just to reiterate
it's gonna be drag-and-drop program
visualization line for line Java so when
you're executing things the old house
was sort of had its own virtual machine
and sort of interpreted things and and
its own way of doing things but like you
were talking about earlier like when you
want to do overriding how do you do
overriding you just override it's going
to be all eclipse underneath so that
again to facilitate this transition to
when that when the professor decides to
do that we now the storytelling theme
from kitten's dissertation and we're
going to use the sims 2 assets to pull
it all off we're on track for having our
alpha test next fall it's at Carnegie
Mellon and Ithaca College and the next
semester we're gonna open it up to a
wider beta test and one of the things
we've found that works really well there
is the reaction to just demoing Alice 3
as you can show them in any half-baked
form and they just want it and so when
you have a lot of people want to use it
you can basically make them assign a bug
catching TA to each class so that a lot
of times what happens when you're in a
classroom and the software has bugs in
it
the TAS will want to help the student
get past it because they've already
wasted some time and which makes sense I
mean that's good but while you're in the
beta testing part of the process you
want to have a TA who's sole
responsible for going around finding a
bug helping Chronicle it and send it in
to us so we can fix it that's with that
I'll give you a sneak peek can take
house three there you go
and so
so the first thing that you know as I
said on the slide it's going to be ready
for alpha next fall so as you can
imagine it's not all done so I'm going
to show you a number of pieces to the PI
and hopefully you could be able to be
able to pull it all together at the end
and this part is just to give you a
feeling for what it's going to look like
this isn't exactly how it's going to
look like what it's going to look like
but you know we'll have you know the
ability you'll have the sort of this the
scene that you're working on over here
on the top right we're actually able to
if you'll recall in Alice 2 is actually
kind of busy right there's a lot of
stuff going on and what I like about
this system is that it's becoming more
complicated underneath but the interface
is actually becoming simpler and because
we're going with these higher-level
methods and people centric approach we
can get rid of that whole tree where you
have to see the skeletons of everything
and all the cones and all these other
things and just go with the people so
you can actually collapse these two
things into the same see here we have
the methods you know actions questions
and properties and you'll be able to
pick up and drag and drop and all those
other good stuff I'm going to show you a
little bit of how it's going to react
because although alice is pretty
successful it does a really bad job of
giving well it doesn't do a good enough
job of giving enough feedback so just
giving people a little bit more feedback
on you know how it's gonna look this is
again just a little demo of how it's
going to feel another thing is oh and
just to let you know this is a little
bit of a demo I'm going to show you in a
minute which is a daughter trying to
ride their dad to get into shape another
thing I want to show you is just having
these docking bays and trying to give
people cues about type and so for
instance you know this is whether or not
the daughter is facing something you can
see like the bully and things will light
up and go in there where that goes and
again if you look at the dad you'll be
able to you know when you pick this up
the dad's name is a string so it fits
into the string docks and everything
like that so we're just going to try to
give people some feedback there moving
on
I'm going to show you just the person
builder is to just give you a little
feel for just how many you know just the
vast change and the content that we're
going to be able to have so first of all
there's a new problem right there is
that you know when you have a games
thing you try to bring it into middle
school classrooms the the the female
outfits are gonna have to be called a
little that makes any sense for adoption
one of the things I like about having
all these things you have all these
there's there's all these males and
females characters there's a superhero
character one of the things that's a
that this is actually kind of
embarrassing but when we first made
Alice my first made Alice we had all
these freely contributed models from
this class at Carnegie Mellon and it was
great but all the models in and all the
models and animations were sort of made
by students at Carnegie Mellon and
that's sort of a narrow subset of the
population and so then it was used at
inner-city schools in these after-school
programs and they couldn't make anybody
in their own image that's really bad and
embarrassing for a lot of reasons but
it's nice to be able to have this have
all their assets because you can make
kids can make these characters in their
own image they could be male or female
and I really like the ability to to be
able to say that anybody can be the
ambulance driver right that we're not
steering anybody down your path and just
to sort of overreact to the whole thing
we made it so you can make green people
now and everything just because you know
it's really bad to not be able to so for
the purpose of this demo we're going to
have a daughter we have a little story
we want to tell the daughters going to
try to ride her dad to get in shape so
let's get the data an outfit here
personally they're just my personal
favorite is the or is it the red smoking
jacket very nice
but let's get him a sweat suit give them
the blue walking outfit what changes
hair color here and give them the old
the old chrome-dome so it's kind of a
you know little dad sort of situation
and again this is just a very a
prototype it's going to be hopefully
it'll be much
this eventually and when we accept this
again this is sort of behind the scenes
but it's going to generate the code to
insert this into your world if you will
and the students won't see any of that
but there's actual Java instances that
back each of these things so we make
this ten and the next piece of the
puzzle and this is a prototype that is
running on top of Eclipse so Eclipse is
now for those of you who don't know
about Eclipse Eclipse is this fabulous
integrated development environment but
it's definitely it's wonderful at
helping you manage the complexity of a
million line program and it's not good
at all for your first introduction to
computing when you're not when you don't
have to deal with a million line program
so what we want to do is we want to use
their framework to build the IDE that's
designed specifically for learning to
program and so you can see here we're
sort of we're parsing arbitrary Java 1.5
code you can sort of pick up these
blocks and move them around and you can
press play and you can see this world
play out I actually haven't shown you
this yet so let me show it to you so you
need to shake get in shape dad we move
it over here so you can see the world
okay then he's gonna loop three times
gonna do a sit-up while she counts it
out and then like me he'll get a little
tired and you know she'll sort of ride
him and then he'll start doing to
another loop and he's gonna put in a
little conditional thing where if the
daughter is facing him he's gonna sort
of show off and do these one-handed
push-ups and if she's not facing him
he'll kind of slack off okay and so
there's some concern when you take out
all these lower-level methods that
people still be able to program still be
able to do things but in 20 you know in
basically ten lines be able to build a
little story where people laugh at the
appropriate moment and so that's really
encouraging and you can change these
this is just a little demo but you can
change this thing to do ten times and it
does all the incremental compiling and
everything and it'll run it ten times
this time but that's just a little
technology download I could speed it up
they go and for just the last little
example of it but you can imagine since
that's an eclipse the eventual for those
of you know eclipse the eventual
thinking the eventual plan is to be able
to just okay so the professor decides
we've done enough of the concepts I want
people to actually learn the syntax of
Java now they'll just be able to turn
essentially into Java perspective and
just start typing in Java and then maybe
at some point they decide oh we want to
go back and learn about the iterating
for loop they go back into Alice drag
and drop and the thing about this is is
if you just have to worry about one
problem at a time right you don't switch
your con you don't switch the the
classes that you're working with the API
like everything that all the data
doesn't become hidden you just take on
one problem at a time and you march
towards getting people fully prepared
and so the final thing is of course that
then here's the Java code behind it and
you can you know say something like dad
you really need to get in shape and
something and eventually you know they
could just go all the way out and be in
Eclipse or some other ID oh who knows
why it's not working but there you go
and so just to sum up okay well we're
aiming to do what we're aiming for is to
be the way everyone is introduced into
programming okay we believe that if
you're going to be if you're going to
learn to program at any level anywhere
your first exposure to it should not be
with syntax and all these other and
hidden data and all these other things
that everyone should be able to start
out this way and then transition okay
and this is rather ambitious but with
all the incredible positive feedback
we've received from the previous
versions we have reason to believe this
and I hope you do too
and with that I would like to thank you
very much for your coming your time your
attention your support free t-shirts
and we'd be happy to take any questions
you have
okay
I really like Carol I learned the first
thing I ever used was Carol there's
actually a Carol interface with with
Alice and so that's a little point to
say is that do people want to teach
different ways right we're going down
this story telling telling route if
somebody wants to go down the Carol
route or the logo route we're going to
try to support those as well if somebody
wants to go down the games route if
somebody wants to go down to Google's
API Google Maps API route right over the
physics route so we're gonna try to
support all those things I love Carol
what what Caitlyn would say is that that
that doesn't draw enough people in I
also love logo right I also love squeak
but that in some ways those things don't
draw people in enough as the
storytelling things it worked for me I
think it's fabulous but it isn't
inclusive enough I don't think so if I
can jump in on this I would like to say
that we feel like we are standing on the
shoulders of giants and we are rich Pat
us a lot for called robot so that said I
would also like to say that I think what
we're going to see in Alice 3 is a
progression to a point where we can move
back and forth between the Alice
interface and the professional language
IDE and that was very difficult to do
with the versions of Carl robot this is
probably a pedagogy point but
nonetheless that's what we're trying to
do is to teach
death sentence crashes - but but other
at least until you get to the issue this
transition to
but I think there's definitely a lot of
overlap and that's because of squeak
which we're both I mean everyone who's
been a student in our research group has
ended up doing a internship with Alan
Kay almost I I think one of the things
is the approach that we latched on at
least at Carnegie Mellon in the we're
gonna team with a pedagogy expert who's
going to write a textbook and make it so
that we're going after this formal
education part and there are more of the
plaything but I I'm a big fan of you
know of that whole thing to write I
think one of the things is that you know
you have to seems that the status quo
isn't working and something has to be
done differently and I don't know if
that's Alice or scratch or whatever but
we're certainly going down this road but
you know obviously a big fans of
certainly certainly squeaking scratch I
think there are many of us working on
this problem and we are fans of scratch
as well
there's actually a four circle answer we
have really highlighted today for you
our appeal to girls and young women I
however have been in the classroom
teaching with Alice for several years
now and I have found that the guys are
just as turned on by Alice as the girls
the guys have very different context or
the stories they tell and they prefer to
build with Alice interactive games and
as much as we have tried to tone this
down there's only one gun in Alice in
the gallery nonetheless they find ways
to tell the stories they want to tell
it's rather interesting however that
over the course of the semester they
tend to be very very creative and come
up with things that are not just
shoot-'em-ups the other thing is there
is actually a it seems all the anecdotal
stuff that comes in seems like it's
bringing in the women but it's not
turning away the men because you know
everyone wants to direct or whatever but
there is a study in the plans to do the
same study with the Boy Scouts so as you
can formerly show that that these things
are happening and that's in the pipeline
go ahead
in getting access to all these accents
for me a special
but it's surprisingly well my first I
was really surprised at how well it ran
first of all the whole thing is rendered
in Java and all these other things but
then I realized that the Sims is a game
that's designed like it runs really well
on a five-year-old laptop because the
Sims 2 came out more than five years ago
so the assets are designed to run so it
is a much more complicated it means
doing real-time skinning algorithms and
all these other things but it really it
I thought it was going to be more of a
problem than it really was because it's
designed for older it's designed for an
older machine and it's also designed it
has levels of detail so you can fall
back to lower level models and textures
and everything so it hasn't been as big
a problem as I thought it was gonna be
doing here is that all the reason
expecting him
too much like I mean writing a program I
mean like when they're the middle school
I mean moving these objects but then
later on I mean ask me but the same
person they can be spending I don't know
if they've tried like the C program that
thought but them something that very
simple it's simply how this transition
or something
I think one of the things is that if
you're shooting for the middle school
age what I'd really like - you know you
could almost take the exit condition
from that being they just know that they
can do it if they just have the
confidence that they know that they can
do this and they can do cool things in
computing it doesn't all have to be
whatever if you just had that one thing
right that would almost be good enough
but also I mean there are there are hard
power problems in computer science it's
not like somehow dragging and dropping
is going to make synchronization of you
know multiple threads going to all
sudden become easy but the idea is to
get more what we want to do is we want
to stop having the filter be on the
wrong things if you're filtering people
because they can't handle logic well
then that might be okay if you're
filtering people because they get
frustrated because they used a colon
instead of a semicolon
it seems really dumb if they're able to
handle synchronization and you know
multiple nested you know conditional
statements sorry I also would say that
although we have talked today about
computing majors it is also the case
that that first course in computing is
for non-majors and that means that you
have people who want to learn how to use
computing to do biochemical research
neurology research so you know they want
to be physicists all of these other
majors are taking this course as well
and we need to make it accessible and so
I think looking at this broader range of
population it's very important for us
one thing we didn't say about Alice 3 is
because it is implemented in Java
because the students will transition
into the Java environment totally we
anticipate that many researchers will
build what we call thin api's to allow
them to assign to their students
problems in engineering and
some physics and so forth and so on and
that we think is a very
interdisciplinary part of this project
it would also be nice if you you know
when you're talking about having these
other people are not intending to be
computer science majors be nice to show
them that to draw them into computer
science would be like oh maybe I don't
want to do biology maybe I want to do
computing get better more and better
people into the field do you feel that
you address the missing piece that Peter
so what's the basically he was concerned
about the fact that Alice 2 is not truly
object oriented meaning that it is not
fully implemented so you can't do
inheritance in hours 2 for example but
because we're moving into Alice 3 with
the Java underneath and the line for
line equivalency between the Alice code
and the Java code we believe that as
much as Java is object oriented so will
Alice 3 the object-oriented thank you
