to before we commence with this talk
that this talk is going to be posted on
google video but we're not supposed to
ask any confidential questions until the
videotaping us over so if you ask
questions you know make sure to
discreetly obfuscate any confidential
information that might be content within
so it's my great pleasure to announce
Nick Weaver he is a researcher at ixia
and broccoli and his research is mostly
a security related he told me it ranges
from carbon to silicon and he can tell
you what that means a good example is
one problem i'm working on his user
authentication making it easy enough for
my mom to use but secure it enough that
i will use and cheap enough that my bank
will pay for which means that's all the
way from user interface to building
little dongles so i'm going to talk
about another hardware-based problem and
that's work at building intrusion
detection so this is drink work with
Vern Paxson and Gemma who's a recent
graduate also a lot of contributions
from others i'm using a board from
stanford actual hardware on stewart dan
ellis funded by a bunch of people who
opinions are my own not theirs and it's
also how we're thinking about the
problem as much as actually building so
this is in many ways a work in progress
talk so first of all i'm going to talk
about the intrusion detection system and
intrusion prevention problem so how to
detect attacks in the network the local
area network problem not only do you on
an attack detect attacks in the network
we need to do it cheaply and at high
rate because i want every packet to go
through the ids even the stuff to the
file server arm talk about genting which
is in a hardware mechanism we've built
hardware and software to allow a lot of
ids traffic to work at high rates
including
the hardware and then how to use it to
abuse the network so that you can
actually have all your packets go
through but first of all a correction I
believe that the intrusion detection
problem is really how to enforce a
policy on the network not how to detect
attacks because detecting attacks is
hard and gets into this metamorphic arms
race but enforcing policy is a bit
higher level but it also requires more
work so I'll tell in a minute what I
mean by that so the goal of the work is
to take a policy oriented intrusion
detection system that's based on first
reassemble the TCP streams and then
parse the protocols so for our all
traffic try to figure out what the prep
what the traffic really means so layer
seven analysis in the buzzword parlance
and then once you understand what it
means then you apply target specific
policies and so then we want a mechanism
that will allow this to run at high
rates and in line rather than just being
out of band so our goal is to be able to
block attacks as they occur be able to
do this cheaply be able to process to 24
gigabits on a a commodity PC not a
cluster and also be able to ideally do
all traffic in a network switch and
using very low-cost hardware and
commodity acceleration and it's based on
two key things the key observation is
all traffic must pass through the
intrusion detection system if you want
to block attacks as they occur but in a
heavy tailed environment only a small
amount really benefits from detailed
examination I'm not going to try to
examine all the YouTube video traffic
for an embedded exploit because although
there may be an embedded exploit in that
massive 50 megabyte blob the CPU is
probably better focused on stopping the
lower hanging fruit and the key
technique is given this assumption is
process ninety percent of the packets
simple cheap in precise hardware and ten
percent or less and software so before I
get in more it's why should Google care
about this talk at all everybody knows
Google designs they're on motherboards
the hardware i'm using is actually
relatively cheap a 4-port ethernet by a
small not too big fpga i'll tell more
about those later on and four megabytes
of SRAM it's the kind of thing that you
could build on to a motherboard for
maybe 150 200 bucks a board and you
might be able to do a more cost
optimized version where it's only a
single Ethernet or two Ethernet and get
the price down to 30 or 40 aboard and
the basically this is a design
philosophy on the hardware side of do a
little compute memory look up on the
packet and hardware and then either now
know what you can do and do it and have
the hardware do it never bother the CPU
at all never bothered the memory bus or
know that the hardware has no clue what
to do shove it at the big CPU and let
God in the Intel and Andy Grove sorted
out because I don't want to build
hardware that handles all these
obnoxious corner cases I want to build
hardware that only considers the main
case so conventional view of network
intrusion detection is distinguished
good from bad and either report attacks
or block as they occur in general we use
IDs to refer to both and in practice
everybody runs them and everybody
ignores them because you run them
because your auditors say you need
intrusion detection and you ignore them
because you get all these alerts and
false positives and stuff because
everybody just runs snorter the like and
snorts stateless pretty much and it's we
spent our dragging down a false positive
from snort a little while ago from the
Berkeley campus um and in general yap
false positives a false neg
give as you miss attacks these are
considered annoying but not necessarily
critical false positives in an IDs can
pollute the law true positives can
pollute the log to you don't want to log
every failed attempts by all these old
worms that are around there because
there's just so many of them on a false
positive in an intrusion prevention
system where you block traffic that is
network autoimmune disease that is your
security system is attacking your own
network this is really bad however we
take a different view of the IDS problem
in general we believe it's policy you
have to learn or define a policy detect
violations and block is appropriate and
it's not just security its usability
efficiency authorization these are all
policy problems so this is something we
can't do today but we dream of doing the
corporate policy for bittorrent because
on one hand BitTorrent is evil it's used
it may open up huge liability concerns
on the other hand BitTorrent is really
nice for grabbing those fedora core is
OS so first of all it gets into fine
print so I'll read them out log
everything who requested what data when
what piers duration volume terabyte disk
arrays are cheap when in doubt just log
it because who knows you might be
interested in that data how the local
cache BitTorrent consumes a lot of
bandwidth but it's very easy to make a
cash for torrents um BitTorrent the
whole protocol works very well all you
have to do is tell the cash to contact
this local user on this cracker and now
the BitTorrent protocol will just shove
all the data back and forth between them
because they have good links and at the
same time since it's cash let's limit
the non-cash bandwidth to that host to
some reasonable threshold because we got
to pay for every bit that goes across
the network so why should we pay for it
if it's not in the local cache
more than a couple people have fetched
it tell the cash Oh add this torrent
these are all these piers go talk to
them sort it all out and throttle the
bandwidth because I don't want to pay
for it anymore if our site wide Internet
bandwidth is some above some threshold
let's just throttle this some more
because this is lower priority than the
CEOs checking of his gmail account if
it's possibly a copyright violation use
some heuristics based on file name who
it's talking to where the if the
torrents in pirate bay um throttle it
heavily but not completely this is make
it seem like they're getting really
really really really crappy performance
and send an email to somebody human to
actually take a look and since these are
large files you throttle them down it's
bad performance you've got an hour or
two to send out the nasty grams if it's
almost certainly a copyright violation
block the connection report user to
security and these are security problems
if you're a company because this is
liability this is the RI double-a comes
knocking on your door with a 10 million
dollar lawsuit if the communication
itself contains a violation of the
protocol you need a detailed model of
the protocol and you know what the
fields are you go this field is out of
spec probably an attack report it and if
it contains anything a known attack
block that attack as it occurs and
report it but this is a very hard
problem to do because the first thing I
need to do in order to implement that
lovely policy is actually understand
this god-awful protocol um and so you
first need to encrypt understand the
protocols and cryptographic protocols
are a special problem but if you're if
you're somebody who's suitably evil in
charge of corporate IT security you can
get around the crypto protocol by saying
you're telling the IDS the keys or we're
cutting off that communication
um company the attitude of the company
is you don't have secrets from us buddy
um so if you try to hide something from
us will block it it's very hard to
express a good policy this here was just
a pure paper design if I actually wanted
to put it into a form a computer would
recognize we're looking at something
that's probably a couple of pages even
once you have all the parsing done even
simple problems are hard TCP stream
reassembly um is for a high-bandwidth
site is this annoying problem that
requires hundreds of megabytes of state
and its adversarial attackers can work
around it and overall this is a really
hard problem when dealing with just a
little dinky hundred megabit link but we
want to do better because the problem is
is how we build our networks we build a
perimeter so something in the network
that acts to check and control data so a
point of enforcement point of control
the problem is is a few observations
once this perimeter is breached all bets
are off Google's corporate security
better hope that I'm not an evil
individual because this little thing
could get stuck into some random Google
computer and you'd have a problem so
your big perimeters have problems and
part of the issue is something like the
firewall needs viewpoint this inside is
too big the bigger the more scope your
perimeter encompasses the easier it is
for an attacker to breach and once an
attacker breaches the perimeter you can
no longer make assertions the people at
the front desk can't make any assertions
about where I am but people who are with
me still can't um and basically once an
attacker gets through the firewall and
gets to the nits uh they are an insider
so in reality the bigger the firewall
the morning
have to deal with the insider attack
problem the end hosts on the other hand
has a real nice fine perimeter you're
protecting only a single asset so by
making your perimeters very fine you get
very good coverage and in case of a
breach you only lose a little bit the
problem is these systems are pretty
fragile so many of the apps already
straddle the system you you escalate to
system level privileges you start
running you blow away the antivirus and
although the virtualization techniques
promise to make this barrier here a lot
better your printers are computers and
your printers aren't going to support
all that lovely virtualization
protection and the like and let me tell
you if you're a corporate spy who cares
about the computers if you have a tap-in
the one of these high-end workgroup
printers you basically know everything
the corporation does so so the the end
hosts have weaknesses as well and thus
we believe what is necessary is policy
analysis and enforcement in the local
area network so we believe that what is
needed is security at the switch so that
every packet is going through at least
some level of analysis horribly this is
a dream this is something we can't do
today but we want to do tomorrow but of
course this makes the problem horribly
horribly hard 100 megabit access to the
internet that's about 2,000 bucks a
month you might get down to 1,000 it's a
lot of money a 48 port managed gigabit
ethernet switch with all the bells and
whistles that's 3,000 bucks and I pay it
once and it's maybe 50 bucks a year in
power also the local area network is 10
to 100 x larger than anything else
internet for my business so that's one
to five locations what's easy deal with
five places so
which I might have hundreds of switches
even a reasonable institution and so our
goal is to make it as price-sensitive as
possible start with the conventional
intrusion detection try to make it run
at line rate using very simple hardware
acceleration and we starting with two
pieces the bro intrusion detection
system and the mechanism is the net
fpga-based research platform so first of
all what is bro bro is a high level
intrusion detection system designed by
Vernon company that's designed to
express signatures specifications in
anomaly detection and it's centered
around analysis and policy
interpretation packets come in pass
through some filters go to this event
engine which is parsing the network
traffic the parsers are written in the
combination of C and this high-level
language called bin pack then the
parsing goes up to the policy
interpreters which implement site
specific policy and so you've got the
analyzers you've got the policy scripts
and you can hook it up to responses if
you scan Lawrence Berkeley National Labs
with more than 10 or 20 probes your IP
gets blocked at the border just simple
it'll go away things um so why are we
using Bros a starting point well first
of all it actually does work
operationally it the early traffic is
often the most important for policy so
for example connection setup for an ssh
connection you want to see the
connection setup you want to ensure it's
not password guessing and that you can
do just looking at the traffic without
even having to know what's what's in it
um it's open source it's extensible it's
also well we're a Dixie we use bro not
snort institutional bias and its policy
focus rather than signature focused on
because we find that signature attack
signatures tend to be just too limited
there are too many ways around them so
the other part i'm using is this net
fpga board developed at stanford that
has a not too big fpga something on the
order of a couple hundred bucks a
hundred bucks when you buy it in the
boatload craig quantities for gigabit
ethernet scumming in 22 megabyte SRAM's
and a pci bus a 3332 pci bus this the
network is vastly more bandwidth in this
pci interface so basically you have to
process most of the packets on the board
because if you tried to bring too many
to the host that would just drop packets
the internal bandwidth is all two
gigabit links which made it relatively
easy to meet timing and performance so
why did I use this it's large enough to
be interesting for gigabit ethernet
seeeeee with control logic and enough
space to put in my own cut so enough
logic to actually do something real but
small enough to be reasonable this is
not okay it's actually six hundred but I
think it gets below 300 plus when you
buy a lot digikey is the most expensive
provider for hardware but they sell you
single units so it's really useful um
it's got enough memory to be interesting
two megabytes of SRAM without reasonable
the memory cost on the board single unit
is 60 again it ends up being 30 or less
when you buy a large amount and this is
really useful to me is it's tightly
coupled to the host and it behaves like
an Ethernet if I can't do the decision
in hardware I throw it to the host and
the host sees an ethernet packet and
there is a Linux driver click works
anything that processes packets just
sees it as another network device and
there's a revised board in the pipeline
that should be about 2,000 bucks aboard
so a reasonably cheap board that has
programmability in high data rates so
how many know what an fpga is
okay then I can largely skip this slide
basically cheap too horribly expensive
but as I mentioned there's this key idea
that all traffic must pass through our
IDs otherwise we can't do this per
policy enforcement but only a small
fraction really benefits by examination
so let's go through another policy
example SSH log all connections as I
said when in doubt log everything if
it's Rida peated password guessing login
block so block that source for the next
day or two in general if you're doing an
automated block we find that it's good
to just have those blocks release after
a little while because that's good
enough to act as a go away but also good
enough that if you have a false positive
it will clear itself up by the time they
actually get around to complaining to
you if there's a number of new
destinations for that particular source
if it's above a certain threshold blogut
high fanouts unusual it should probably
be reported if the tax detected in the
connection setup because you can do
something in the connection setup block
that packet before it can actually
infect the host block that source log it
and report when the connection
terminates we want to log the a rough
approximation of the traffic volume and
the time because this tells you a huge
amount of information were they stealing
500 megabytes of your corporate secrets
or who knows what or was it just an
interactive session this tells you a
heck of a lot but in order to do this
all we need to do is examine connection
setup a little sampling of the traffic
like one in a thousand one in ten
thousand packets is good enough to get
the volume and connection termination
and so our goal is to provide a simple
mechanism that can support this so what
we did
is added in an inline element that
replaces this whole initial filter
network interface model the shunts an
inline element it sends the packet up to
the event engine and it's rejected by
the IDs one of the great things about
this event model is how grow normally
processes packets is it has this event
queue if the event queue is empty it
grabs the next packet this packet does
its analysis this analysis may trigger
more events a it's if it's just a hole
well that just the stream reassemble or
does it and that's it and then the next
packet that fills in the hole that might
trigger a lot of parsing which might
trigger policy which triggers all these
different events fortunately bro is not
multi-threaded bro a single threaded so
if we just fortunately because it allows
us to make it in line with a very simple
hack you take the packet you hold that
packet in a thing you run through the
event queue once the event queue is
empty and it tries to grab the next
packet from the interface you see was I
supposed to drop this packet if yes you
drop the packet otherwise you just
inject it back into the network we don't
have a full integrated software path but
just a minimum hardware software path
that just sort of a test harness is only
in the tens of microseconds even if it's
up to full full software we expect only
a millisecond or two because if we can't
process packets at that rate we won't be
able to keep up at all um and so the key
is is this hardware however is in front
of it is to allow bro to say okay this
connections not interesting so basically
for each host or connection associate in
action either drop forward this packet
onward this is an ssh connection I don't
care anymore
this is the big YouTube blob I don't
care for the next 50 megabytes forward
it for the next 50 megabytes drop the
packet drop the host this is a bad host
this is a host who's trying to overload
my intrusion detection system let's just
block them completely um sample the
packet with some probability so I'm
monitoring this with a 1 in 10,000
chance or and the default behavior is
shunt to the host and the IDS can easily
inject new rules into the system and
each match has a priority and so you do
the highest priority so you can say this
host is behaving badly block him but all
packets going to that host will white
list those connections at a slightly
higher priority so I can block an
offending host from contacting me but I
can still contact him by playing games
with the priority and the IDS controls
these tables and one of the keys is this
is if there is no match it goes up to
software so this can be a cash it
doesn't have to be complete I don't have
to track all connections I only have to
track a cache of connections so um Chema
extended the API to allow bro to you
shunt and I've been building this
Hardware element that's look up the
packet in every table one of the great
thing is is it's very easy for Hardware
it's only a couple of fixed lookups
because it's a cash I don't have to do
pointer chasing and hardware you want to
make a hardware person scream have them
do arbitrary pointer based data
structures um it's very easy to just go
look up in a few fixed locations and a
priority encoder and then there's a
software element to manage the
interaction between the two um this is
from Chema thesis on a trace of lawrence
berkeley lab's access link with his
shunt to where policies
basically it allows you to ignore about
eighty percent of the traffic um for ssh
for example on you have to see only a
teeny amount of the packet um for HTTP
however the analyzer had to analyze most
of the data however we could still
reduce the HTTP load by saying forward
for sequence because sequence number
gives you an approximation of traffic
and that's just another look up it's a
additional comparison do I need to
forward pass his sequence or not and
that allows you to bypass another twenty
percent of the traffic one of the nice
things or not nice things is that we
can't analyze all this crud Sonique we
are given that you are giving your
talking in Poland I would presume that a
lot of our Jessica's HTTP do you have
any ideas how to get this even better
than maybe even be a twenty percent
number there um i think for google's
point of view okay the question is what
about for google production where you've
got almost all HTTP could this strategy
work i think it could because you aren't
as interested in the outgoing data
you're interested in the incoming data
into Google so you'd probably do full
analysis on every request but the
responses are less interesting you're
going to trust that that fifty megabytes
of YouTube is truly legit I'm assuming
um so it's I'm not sure how well this
would work for Google however um however
one other thing and the reason why I
said it is interesting to Google is not
what I did but how I did it the notion
of you can get real simple hardware
offloading some of these problems if you
can turn the problem in to do a couple
of lookups and know that you can solve
the problem
so one of the problems is about half the
traffic at lbl we don't know how to
analyze it all and this is higher load
one of the things we haven't done is
integrate the dynamic protocol detection
that bro now supports into the shunting
framework one of the things that bro now
supports is the ability to analyze
traffic as if it's every protocol so
ports are meaningless let's analyze
everything as if it could be anything
and find out what it really is or if not
give up so we don't know how that would
affect this fraction of traffic
BitTorrent for example what protocols
fit in the fifty percent a bit torrent
for example we don't have a good bit
torrent analyzer skype tends to be a lot
of just random traffic a lot of its just
here there be gremlins we don't know
what it is it's just a lot of crud
of course there's a couple of huge
limitations is it offloads the packet
transport and preliminary processing but
it actually doesn't reduce the cpu load
much on this trick this approach allows
you to avoid having to transfer a lot of
packets but bro's already set up to
focus its computation on the interesting
stuff so for all the stuff that doesn't
have the analyzers on it at all those
things are dropped in the BPF filter for
things like ssh once it's the ssh
protocol analysis is done it pretty much
just ignores the packets however as I
said we want to control all packets in
the network not just ones crossing the
local area network fortunately there's
this lovely thing called VLANs VLANs are
this beautiful technique to abuse that
what you can do is have every port on
the switch be its own unique untagged
VLAN arm and I believe the same project
at Stanford is using the same trick as
well so you can only send and receive
traffic to that VLAN each port can also
be tagged on multiple vlans so that you
can send and receive to any allowed VLAN
and you have this added VLAN tag between
the source MAC address and the ethernet
length type field um and your Ethernet
packets are actually allowed to be
slightly larger when you have this tag
note that the Linux kernel doesn't
respect this brand the spec sorry
colonel book that bitten me the other
day this gives us the ability to do
traffic isolation that what you do is
you have every system on its own virtual
every area network and then you have
your IDs and ports on trunks for all
vlans so in a pack when a host sends a
packet so in this case b sends a packet
it ends up going to rewrite
port that either goes oh this connection
is good it should be re-written to this
destination mac and this destination
VLAN tag re-inject the packet and it
goes off to the destination or it could
be I don't know what to do with it yet
so you throw it up to the whole ideas if
the IDs so this allows you to have only
a small amount of additional hardware
look up all you have to do in the
hardware is support the notion of for
this connection rewrite it to this Mac
in this VLAN and that's all you need to
to be able to do this so how did we
build this in hardware is we will build
simple hardware with software
deceleration what I mean is the software
world you guys love the illusion of
instant infinite state branches and
infinite processing the hardware world
wants none of that we want fixed
processing so we do this this this we
want fixed states both in terms of
volume that this is a two megabyte SRAM
and nothing shall change and fix access
patterns so I go I get a packet I'm
going to need to do for memory accesses
at these locations and branches are evil
from the hardware viewpoint straight
line that's easy that's just sequential
blah blah blah blah blah conditional
logic you want to avoid so the idea is
to build this Hardware simple but faulty
so the hardware uses fixed memory tables
and static computation with single-sided
errors so if the hardware can make a
decision it knows what to do the
decision could be let software sorted
out or if the hardware doesn't make a
decision or makes a mistake the mistake
is always let software sort it out when
the hardware could have solved the
problem
so the API for the shunt is you have
infinite capacity but for the hardware
it's fixed capacity so for tracking IP
addresses we allow only 2 to the 16
total IP addresses we can only track 64k
IP addresses and there's a couple of
cool cash tricks that I have a paper on
that allow you to make this bet more
efficient for tracking connections we
can only track 64k simultaneous
connections anything else let's software
sort it out however this is good enough
to get a Miss rate that's really low in
practice for a sequence skipping we have
2 to the 15 entries so for this
connection you only want it valid for
the sequence range you have a pointer
and you say ok this destination peach
should be rewritten so that you can
support the rewriting we can support the
sequence skipping and if there's no
entry toss it up to software um however
the software basically has to redo the
hardware calculation because this is an
imprecisely is you provide the illusion
of a infinite capacity API so I built
this by taking this initial design that
the net FPGA group did which was a
4-port ethernet and modified it so in
front of every ethernet i added some
logic where would read the packet into
the buffer this would read in two
gigabits extractor headers do some
decision I gave myself a crossbar to
memory so that all four of these could
access the same memory which the host
could access as well so this is where I
do the cash and the host can get to it
and then decide where to write the
packet and either write the packets of
the host because I don't know what to do
with it looks like a host packet or
write to any of the ether nets and the
ethernet schnauzer o spar so I have a
5-2 a five-to-four crossbar
for output so I can RUP packets to any
destination one of the cool things I
have to read the packet into the buffer
completely because I have to modify it
but once I start writing out the packet
to another ethernet i can start reading
in the next packet because all the
memories are nicely dual ported so this
was designed as a nice general building
block it works it's available as part of
the net FPGA distribution and I will be
updating it for their new board that's
coming out so the hardware works arm
developed a couple of cute cash tricks
on the hardware works it'll rewrite MAC
addresses it'll skip sequences and I
have a nice little click API for stuff
that's staying only in the hardware path
five microseconds latency it's from a
hardware viewpoint I see five
microseconds and it go god that's
forever that's evil that's vile when I
show that to Vernie goes what's a micro
second there's this mismatch that we
really were able to take advantage of so
in terms of future work on this ah
there's always more bugs to fix so
there's a bug that causes my inputs to
to freeze up at 450 megabits that's
fixed in that FPGA 21 and we want to
play it we're planning on deploying on a
mirror of Berkeley's networks ooh so
we'll be running real traffic through
real hardware I want to do some other
troops with the hardware build scan
detection um we're working on a cluster
bro where we're we're splitting bro into
a cluster and so you can use this as a
load balancer our current load balancer
software but as Berkeley's net continues
to improve we're going to have to make a
10 gigabit load balancer so we're going
to have to look at hardware for that one
of the interesting tricks is you can do
this as a router forwarding plane
because what costs money on a router
it's the bloody crossbar
the crossbars are these horribly
expensive things but I can go out and
buy a cheap crossbar it's called an
Ethernet switch so read the patent so
have an ethernet switch you have half
the ports be external half the ports
going to these FPGA rewriting engines
packet comes from the ethernet goes to a
specific port you rewrite the mac
address you'll rewrite the VLAN tag you
decrement the TTL re-inject the packet
and the ethernet puts it on to the
destination so there's a lot of other
cool tricks you can do with this
hardware that we're just only starting
to explore so it's and it's the notion
of tricks like this is why Google might
be interested you don't this intrusion
detection stuff you guys just cluster
eyes everything just have every cluster
node running its own IDs who cares but
this style of stuff might be useful that
you might have a role in your data
center for shove the packet back onto
the ethernet to someplace else why
bother the CPU with this so let's see
conclusions conclusions so um although
it's still working progress we're got
pretty good proof that you can take a
cheap simple cheerful hardware
architecture if you're build this as
part of an Ethernet ASIC the additional
cost would be a trivial amount of gates
in the nest ram and plus the
conventional intrusion detection allows
you this high-performance intrusion
prevention um do things by table lookup
and hardware it works well make it a
cache and what software sorted out that
works really well um however were it a
limit we're focused on cpu we will peg
out the cpu once we turn on all these
analyzes and dynamic protocol detection
even if we are skipping eighty percent
of the traffic skipping eighty percent
of the traffic is still useful because
it saves that memory bus bandwidth for
something more valuable but we're still
starting to really struggle with limits
on cpu time so we're looking at how we
paralyze this problem
um we have some ideas but nothing
concrete yet and so significant research
is what can we else can we do in the
local area network and also are there
other interesting hardware hacks that
you can do with this methodology this do
a little look up decide what to do or
throw it up the software reason why we
haven't seen a lot of this in the past
is most FPGA boards don't have this good
network and good host connectivity these
FPGAs will have embedded processors but
there are only 300 megahertz power pcs
not three gigahertz Intel's and I really
need that three gigahertz Intel to be
able to run everything else so open
questions so questions comments flames
I wonder how do you avoid the text in
which say users would would send spoofed
packets in order to prevent some other
parties from communication with the
interior in terms of the jojob style
attack there's nothing really you can do
about that simply if you're blocking
based on scan detection if you're
blocking based on a real interactive
attack arm you can't spoof packets and
get TCP to work ah maybe you GT or some
other connection different in that case
that's that's a policy problem it's how
do you deal with that one of the
fortunate things you can do is you can
start whitelisting those hosts and the
other thing is is you can do a symmetric
so that um that I'm blocking that host
at the border I can still contact him
from internally by by playing these
priority games so so I see the sin going
outbound that TCP syn says okay now I'm
going to whitelist that connection so
when that connection comes back I can
see it so that would be the best way but
in terms of dealing with somebody doing
that kind of attack coming in there's
not much there's not much really you can
do about that that's fortunately however
a lot of places now block spoof packets
there's an economic motive for isps to
block smooth packets so that problem is
going away the other thing that concerns
us and this is actually a bigger issue
is we have the fastpass slow path set up
fast passive process and hardware slow
path is go to the CPU how do you take
down a router you kill the slow path
with traffic exactly um if you aren't
able to spoof packets and you're getting
stuff into the slow path that's why we
have that IP block that that if you have
more than 64 K IPS able to attack us you
can just blow us off the net with just a
brute force d das you no longer have to
worry about brute force d das
the IDS if you only have say 10k zombies
if I can identify those 10k zombies I
can block them and protect my slow path
so if you're building this for a router
you're still going to want this IP block
functionality to protect your CPU force
that I'll move on you get a further down
the path of the actual hardware select
instead of actually allowing the
connection to get through before you do
that you create a TCP syn cook and
rewrite the that would basically require
adding that functionality into the
hardware that would work but i'm not
sure if that would be a real benefit if
rewriting sequence numbers in the
hardware would be a benefit presumably
if i have 10,000 bots i can just do a
real TCP connections to you anyway yeah
and the thing is is 10,000 bots my goal
is to identify those 10000 block bots
and block them if you have a hundred
thousand bucks I'm not even going to try
because you can just blow me out of the
water so it's also only bother enough
security to the point where they're
going to do something else my deadbolt
on my door lock is not very good my
girlfriend can kick it in we've proven
this in practice when it froze up due to
corrosion but it's still stronger than
the window
