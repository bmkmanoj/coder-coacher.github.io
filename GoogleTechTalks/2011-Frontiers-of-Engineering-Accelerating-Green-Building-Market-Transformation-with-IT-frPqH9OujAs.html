Chris Pike from the US Green Building
Council all right so it is a complete
privilege to talk with you today and I
am gonna cop to a couple of things right
off that I you know this is an
unenviable position you guys had a great
lunch you're in comfy chairs you just
heard something interesting and now I'm
supposed to keep you awake until coffee
so um that's not going to be easy but
I'm gonna try ok so my actually here's
the carrot I have for you which may or
may not be worth it no modeling for the
next 20 minutes we will I will not know
modeling I will actually inflict upon
you data and and I think actually in the
spirit of the the dinnertime
conversation dr. Spector told us last
night we're going to get a little
empirical and let me let me start with
this which is this is a concept a few of
you heard me say this yesterday is it
what I believe we do at the US Green
Building Council which is a by the way
not an agency of the US government it is
a non-profit 501 C 3 nonprofit
organization 18,000 member companies and
a seventy eight chapters and a whole
bunch of other people working together
to move this so the idea is it out there
in the universe there is a prevalence of
practice across multiple performance
dimensions so what is this this is a
debt this is a histogram or a density
plot that represents the prevalence of
practice so how many actors how many
buildings how many projects are
performing we're across a spectrum and
our goal is to induce to cause to do
interventions that create a permanent
and self-sustaining shift in the
prevalence of practice across the
dimensions of what we understand as
green and so unlike I think the point
was made earlier that agnostic as to
what is good better and best we are not
we actually have an opinion in our
opinion is that we want things to go in
a certain direction with respect to
energy efficiency renewable energy
materials waste human experience and so
forth and so we're going to chase that
curve through the next 20 minutes and
see if we can go from a conceptual curve
that is the basis for what are
movement has done over the last two
decades to a data-driven version to that
curve that we can seek to understand and
track over time so we're gonna I'm going
to start by placing you though for those
folks who aren't familiar with green
building as it is right now I want to
talk about the incredibly unstable
moment that we find ourselves in we are
at an inflection point basically a
movement that is unstable we are ending
what is called what I would call it the
era of firsts for the last decade we
have had an awful lot of fun in green
building we have got to do the first
leed-certified building in in this case
first LEED certified laboratory in the
west coast first platinum building we
had the first green building at Harvard
the first green building in Peoria the
first one in Tampa the first animal
husbandry facility the first wastewater
treatment facility we don't get to do
that again and actually what we are
entering into we have combined those
firsts into a pattern of unique green
buildings that have become regional
patterns have combined to be national
patterns and ultimately spread into 110
countries around the world in
collaboration with with many different
countries who are advancing green
building so we have created through an
era of firsts we're basically every many
many different projects were first of a
kind many many different projects were
kind of a unique this is our first time
through this process and we could all
feel good about that and at the end of
it we one of the things us GBC is known
for its we hand out a plaque and we say
this is your gold silver platinum plaque
that's great ok I'm not going to talk a
whole much about that because that
you're not the era of handing out
plaques but the era of it being exciting
that it was the first time just to kind
of reflect on how I think about that if
I told you one man survives cancer we
have a special publication for that we
call it like National Enquirer you know
if we if we cure cancer in a population
that is worthy of our attention as
scientists and scholars and we put that
in the journal like The Lancet or
something right so these are a bunch of
maybe in a certain way not not to demean
them but is this is one man being cured
of cancer what we're interested in is
this we're interested as we saw earlier
today in
altering the prevalence of practice in
the design operation construction of the
built environment at this scale all
these lights represent built
environments from dog houses to
skyscrapers that we are trying to alter
and we were trying to shift that
distribution not just around energy
efficiency but across all the dimensions
all the green dimensions that these
urban areas are impinged and so let me
talk about how I think we're doing that
but I also want to start by giving you a
sense of where I think we are now so
this is a justice I was trying to convey
what I thought about that the nature of
data flowing from the built environment
today and this is about as close as I
could come so we have an asset that
typically costs millions hundreds of
millions sometimes billions of dollars
typically the only real time no time the
only data stream we have off that is a
wire that goes to an entity that sells
us that sells us electricity right and I
think that what is an analogous
communication system look like well that
the telegraph but then actually the
telegraph isn't actually dumb enough it
actually is instantaneous communication
and it bi-directional so our current
information about buildings is actually
worse than we were in 1944 so the
question is we are rapidly with the
assistance of many people in this room
moving toward this kind of reality where
the entire nature of our understanding
of these built environment is should be
and will continue to be instrumented
data-driven and empirical in nature and
the nature of that flow of information
this couple things I would point out
that make this more than just a movie
graphic are that the information density
about the building is complemented by
information density about the people in
the building the people are the sensors
you know we raise their hands and said
how much we like this space or didn't
like this space or whatever we really
get down to it your experience of that
is the only legitimate sensor of that I
don't care about ashtray 55 or a 362 or
the other things your experience is the
only legitimate barometer our collective
experience is it so we are trying to
collect multiple channels of information
what are we doing what is a green
building what are the
those of what are the green dimensions
of performance that we are trying to
collect trying to foster we are
interested in the efficient use of
energy we are interested in the source
of that energy biet renewable or
something else we're interested in the
flows of water waste the indoor
environment the acoustics the thermal
the ventilation rates we're interested
in the your experience in here and
actually I would partition our interest
in your experience from many others as
we get into this you'll find that at
least from my personal perspective our
goal in the green building community is
to not just provide you with a
satisfactory experience but our goal is
to understand what it means for you to
have an exemplary experience an
exceptional experience in this space I'm
interested not just in your experience
in this phase I'm interested in how you
got here your level of physical activity
the public health concerns your your
that and I'm also interested in the
financial dimensions and biodiversity
and many others okay that's a lot to be
interested in but that's why green
building is a really big tent it is more
than any one of those things and when we
say green buildings that's one of this
to me this density of information is
where we're going the challenge as many
people have said is how what do we do
with it how do we turn that it's one
thing to collect the information but I'm
not agnostic as to the state of that
information I am directional I want this
information to move in a certain
direction so this is where in my mind
one of the things we have at our
disposal are rating systems just because
everyone thinks I'm going to talk about
writing systems I'll talk just a little
bit about rating systems the what rating
systems do is they provide a lens to
interpret some of that data so a rating
system is something that us GBC and
others around the world create and what
we do is we plop a value judgment on top
of a piece of data and so the simplest
case would be basically what we're
trying to do is to say that observation
is good that one's better and that one
is best and we're going to through a
collaborative consensus based process
and all that define that good better
best spectrum and we are going to create
competitive advantage and reward for
those folks who are best over those who
are good and in far excess of those who
are none of the above right and so a
simple example of what I mean is we can
take a data stream so the US EPA creates
a benchmarking tool called
Energy Star portfolio manager for any
given building in the commercial
building in the u.s. like an office
building we can score it between 0 and
100 men you guess old hat the question
so that's great we have a line of data
we took the utilities we benchmarked
them against the building stock in the
US and we get in the member 20 100 a
rating systems job is to basically sit
on top of that data stream and say if
you're 69 yeah that's all right if
you're 60 if you're 86 that's an average
for a green existing building in the US
that's that's good and if you're a
hundred that's best so that's the
simplest case of dozens and dozens of
those kinds of interpretations that we
make but that said the result of
certification is at we are pushing
beyond the notion and that actually
really what I want to focus my remarks
on is we are ending that era where the
result of certification is a glass
plaque on a building that act of
certification is the beginning of a data
stream that we will use in all sorts of
different ways and we're in keeping in
mind why one of the fundamental reasons
that we do this is that we have a vast
market failure in the building industry
that relates to the absence of
information there is no we don't have
information on the comparative energy
performance of different buildings I
can't tell you how much water that
building uses or how much people love it
or whether it provides great acoustics I
can't know that and so what I'm trying
to do is create the kinds of labels the
kinds of disclosures that allow us to
efficiently allocate resources to the
better performing assets and I'm not
going to just do that alone i'm going to
do that in partnership with others who
have different bandwidths but the bottom
line is we are going to create a great d
our goal our purpose is to create a
great deal more transparency about
multiple dimensions of building
performance and to take it to scale not
a conceptual problem a brass tacks
problem about i need to know more about
that asset so i can decide how i'm going
to allocate my resources am i going to
buy space in it am i going to invest in
it am i going to run away from it what
the heck am I going to do and what I can
do once I have that data pipe every
certification that we get every building
we come in contact with we can offer
them something important in return we
can offer them content
and in my simple-minded world I am NOT
an engineer and III understand the world
more simplistically I understand that
there are things on the left hand side
of this graft if I look at a
distribution of performance across a
density distribution of projects I have
someone the less on the left that if I
continue to create projects on the
performance level over here I will drag
my average down and I will be moving in
the wrong direction if my goal is to
achieve higher levels of performance if
I get delivery of projects on the right
over time i will move my dry average in
a positive direction I will accomplish
my goal of market transformation and in
moving the population in one direction
and so what I have is a universe of less
successful solutions and more successful
solutions as an organization what can I
do with that information I can create
competitive advantage in differentiation
for the ones on the right and I can
ignore the ones on the left so how do
how do I see this playing out what I
want to do is create mechanisms
interventions that reward those
successful projects the hot based on
performance on multiple dimensions that
you and I get to choose we don't have to
agree on the dimensions of performance
you can like energy efficiency more than
I do I can like toxic reduction more
than you do but we need that
transparency so you can make that
decision and I can make this decision
and I can choose my project and what I
want is to move the entire massive
performance over time forward and I want
to see it with empirical data in near
real time okay so with that aspiration I
promise no models and then I gave you 10
minutes of concepts yeah so there's no
free lunch right well maybe there is so
they this is the one place you can
really say there's a freelan so the so i
want to show you how we are actual izing
those concepts through a set of tools
that we call the green building
information gateway I considered an
environment when we are developing and
demonstrating solutions to do what I
just described to you and you can get a
sense of where we're at and you can also
envision where we're going so this is
something that we've been working on for
I don't know about a year and we are
very committed to working on in the
future going forward so the
thing about this part of the talk is
actually if you don't like my talking
you can pull out your iPad right now and
go to G big org and follow along you can
actually click on any of these these are
variety of apps and whatnot that you can
try it your leisure and I want to focus
on a cut on these four key
functionalities first the the number one
thing that we've needed to create is
transparency I need to not just in a not
just walk up to a building and see an
energy star plaque or a lead plaque I
need to unpack that plaque and learn
more about it okay that's pretty easy
right at least it seems easy okay so I I
can take a view like this of downtown
Chicago I can take these buildings that
have plaques on them I could also show
you the Energy Star ones you can go in
there you can use your iPad like this
hit that little locator button and look
at the characteristics of green
buildings around you I've started to use
our own toy and I love it actually i'm
downtown New York and I'm like what is
this building okay and so what i can do
is i can pick a building like the
merchandise mart i can click on it i can
zoom to the street level using our
friendly street view I can see my little
icon right there and I can also see the
very creepy heads on spits which is
that's actually what happens if you're
successful luminary in Chicago if they
put your head on those things the and I
can then drill down to get information
about those assets so I've begun to
create a framework for providing asset
level transparency in real time in other
words the story doesn't end with a
plaque the story begins with a plaque
because that gets you on the map the
next thing I can do is I've now created
a data anchor so i can now attach all
sorts of other people's great insights
you don't like my metrics you don't like
the things i collect fine what I've
created is a data anchor and this is not
rocket science for all of us but but the
practicality of it is a bit of rocket
science and so I can say well let me
look something up and let me attach a
walkscore so a third-party metric about
the relative walkability of that site
and that's only a tease as to anybody's
third-party resource so if you're out
there and you're saying I have a better
way to represent the performance
dimensions of this asset be it
walkability perform a physical activity
financial value I have a mechanism now
through web services and other IT
protocols to expose this to you I can
share this to you as a JSON object I can
consume your API and attach information
to it so that's the kind of architecture
that we're doing
the next thing is that I want to be able
to not just explore it connect to it but
I want to compare it right because now
i'm going to start that process of
creating competitive advantage for the
better actors and the example i'm going
to give you today is is a quick one is
based on say a jurisdiction so i have
two municipalities i want to basically
inspire or promote or show chicago how
it compares to its rivals in new york
city with regard to green building
activity i could be looking at energy
efficiency i could be looking at at the
number of accredited professionals the
workforce that they've created but what
i can do is i can track and trend this
over time and so you can go create this
comparison and I don't there are numbers
down here don't worry about the matter
what I want to show is that there's a
basis for going in and comparing place a
to place why and looking at the level of
activity across multiple metrics
ultimately the goal is to customize this
is it how many green building projects
how many energy star projects how much
revenue from green businesses do you
have there this is a platform from our
from our world to create that comparison
to provide a dashboard the other thing
that you'll immediately appreciate is
that basically Chicago and New York are
just instances of groups that happen to
be Geographic so if this is company 1
and this is company to or or your
portfolio your collection and my
collection the same function works so
the basis is the Sinton the most simple
thing I'm trying to do is to allow you
to inspire and to compare yourself to
others and see where you stand but I'm
really not satisfied by that I want to
go back to that curve I want to find
that curb and move it and so let's spend
the bulk the rest of our time talking
about that so going back to the curve
conceptually for the last time what I'm
really trying to do is differentiate
these these two dimensions the house
side which is the high-performance side
where what I'm trying to do is provide
you with increasing rewards for being a
high performer and so let me give you an
example of one of those types of
projects so this is an example of a of
an existing green building that was
certified in Chicago so this is the FBI
building okay so up to now historically
we would have given you a plaque and
said platinum building that's great good
on you that's fine but what I want to
understand is I want to begin in
creasing levels of detail to unpack what
that means on what dimensions did you
perform and how were you performing
relative to your peers so what i can do
is as one example of many i can break
the performance of this building down
into in this case the the six categories
that you guys are familiar with energy
materials indoor site water innovation
and critically i can find those curves i
can use the data every day we get about
a million and a half square feet a day
which is added up to over a billion
square feet of real estate over the past
decade and i can use that to establish
the distribution of performance in this
case the word points essentially refers
to metrics I understand different
channels of information on energy
performance of which I have a positive
result they did something affirmative in
25 of those channels and so the key
issue is not just where they were
against my requirements but where they
were against the rest of the market so
that distribution is the distribution of
achievement in energy and atmosphere for
all existing all buildings that
certified in that existing rating system
so i can say that i understand just how
good that building is it's good i mean
pretty much 95% of the buildings that
pass through our system are worse than
it on that dimension I can do that from
materials I can do that for ieq
sustainable sites water and what you'll
notice is that we'll come back to this
we can start unpacking these
distributions and ask why are those
distributions where they are what what
is the combination of Technology costs
behavior that are causing these through
these distributions and conversely i can
also turn around and talk about why why
are some buildings not like me and this
is obviously i'm comparing green
buildings to green buildings but i'm
still equally interested and why someone
is doing a below-average green building
for some market and we give you an
example so here's a case where a
building is doing the bare minimum for
energy they're still exceeding code in
this case by fifteen percent on lease on
a design basis but what there but
they're lagging the rest of the market
so I look at this and a gosh if I was
the building owner or investor I
wouldn't accept that I mean regardless
of what else you know right
I think that's what units on there right
if you if your design team comes in and
says this is our project okay I would
assume that most people in this room
would reject that project and say take
come back to try again and but I can
also look on the same project they've
actually has done above average work on
materials they've done dramatically
below average work on an indoor
environmental quality their average for
their site their way below on water
efficiency my goal with this is to
provide this information early in the
process in the proposal in the design
phase and ask folks you know to confront
this comparative situation because i'm
going to hold them to it later yeah so
let me give you an idea how we can drill
deeper so i don't have to worry about i
don't have to limit myself to individual
there's lots of different performance
dimensions and that's what i find rich
about this space i can worry about
energy efficiency as represented by
energy star i can worry about a
performance to vent to mention like a
ventilation rate or in the case of
something we call a greenhouse gas index
I can take the 29 different channels of
data that we collect that relate to
greenhouse gas emissions wait them by
their relative contribution to
greenhouse gas emissions so I can wait
density and transportation accessibility
very high i can write energy efficiency
very high i can rate materials or water
somewhere a little bit lower i can rate
them in proportion to their relative
importance and i can combine them into a
synthetic synthetic index where 100
equals everything you could do weighted
by it's important and 0 represents doing
nothing and i can start to dig into
these distributions in two different
ways the first thing i can do is i can
basic the blue i can look at it over
time and i can look at it by segment and
i can say well you know we didn't design
a rating system to have a mean of
roughly 48 which is what this this
distribution has but the market is
telling us based on its voluntary uptake
of these things that that's what it's
willing to provide at this time and i
can begin to unpack it and I can also
see that but using the same yardstick
don't have to worry about the idea but
the ideas we're using the same yardstick
to say the same set of criteria that in
the time period two thousand six to two
thousand eight verse at the time period
2009 to 2011
I've seen a small positive shift in that
distribution so projects are doing more
with regard to things that reduce
greenhouse gas emissions in those two
time periods so I can know this I can
track this I can slice this I can
present it back to you and I can ask you
to position your asset in your proposed
asset or your real asset in this space I
can also break this down and so I can
tell you the two biggest components of a
GHG index include the the location and
the design of a site so how
transportation accessible is it and I
can start finding some interesting
patterns if I look at the distribution
of us projects that's the blue and I
look at the distribution of lead
projects in China there's a few hundred
of them there and I look at that
compared to the distribution of all
other international projects I can start
to see systematic differences in the way
that those projects are adopting GHG
abating strategies writ large so I don't
think it is I'm sorry this should
actually say gee HD index but the idea
is the same the idea is that this right
this this thing right here saying us
projects are adopting slightly less of
what's available then our than our
counterparts in China then our
counterparts internationally writ large
there's a bunch of good reasons behind
that but the crux is we can unpack it
and you can compare it so if I'm just
comparing your appt the the differences
in these shapes are important to
providing that context that creates
competitive advantage a similar story
actually probably more germane to some
folks in this room is the adoption of
energy and atmosphere activities that's
energy efficiency commissioning
renewable energy monitoring and so forth
and one of the things you can see is
that we have a distribution that's
centered on about thirty thirty five
percent which is where actually this
number of points five or six points and
what we have is this incredibly long
tailed distribution so we begin to get
out we can begin to get in a position to
use this information to ask what's going
on in this tale what's going on in this
tale why is this peak centered where it
is because we didn't design it to be
centered this way this is information
content on the receptivity of these
groups for this and this is something
that we can track in near real-time ok
so where I hope I've got
me too and in the remaining 50 seconds
before I take your questions is the idea
that we 20 years ago started a movement
with the goal of taking a distribution a
distribution that was actually
completely devoid of data and through a
process essentially ready fire aim we've
trying to set benchmarks and drive
projects toward it now ten years after
we really operationalize that system
we're at a point where we can track real
distributions in real time and asked and
use that as the basis for understanding
the underlying mechanisms and it's just
in time because this is the playing
field that that's going to play out in
so our interests in creating the kinds
of scalable information analytics that
we're going to need to tackle this
problem so with that I really welcome
any questions it says I might be sure
from Los Alamos so here citation so my
question is do you have any influence on
the policy like some of these things
have to be imposed because you might
come up with data but people may not
want to do it because of cost yep so
there's two answers to that so when we
look at moving a curve we understand
policy as one intervention and
particularly in the building sector
policy is there is there's kind of
public policy then there's building
codes and standards and so forth and
what we're trying to do is Amy but
fundamentally we're trying to mix those
whole things together and so when we say
do we have impact on policy there's a
couple different ways we absolutely have
impact on policy but on the other hand
that the goal is to create a create
competitive advantage for the
high-performing actors in the space so
that it is desirable economically
beneficial to adopt those higher
performance practices I think that it is
a candidly I think it's a mistake to
understand these distributions in
strictly as much as we might like to to
understand this kind of stuff in terms
of ROI this this stuff this distribution
of energy efficiency distribution of
renewables these real projects out there
in the world are partially responsive to
narrowly frame kind of
national understandings of ROI and there
are actually responsive to a lot of
other stuff so the last part about that
about regulation there is obviously a
very close coupling between codes and
standards at like building codes and
energy codes and this and our
understanding is that this creates room
and the literal for raising the bar with
regard to standards and we've seen that
so for instance right now basically the
average building this this number of
points corresponds to about thirty
percent better than ashrae 90.1 2007
which is the kind of most widely used
energy code so what that basically said
is there are thousands of projects out
there who are readily capable in
delivering today thirty percent above
code so we can take that back into the
codes process and argue to raise the
floor and what are we going to do we're
going to move thirty percent we're going
to keep raising so that the competitive
advantages realized thirty forty fifty
percent over so we're not going to be
done we're going to work move together
so a lot to unpack in that sorry this is
off say from Eastman Chemical you are
using and rating on dozen of factors
doesn't factors to qualify whether the
building is green or not and do you see
whether those scoring on each of these
factors could change over the life of
the building number one and number two
whether the LEED certification or the
net energy zero audit is this one time
analysis audit or you go back in five
years ten years and yes they are too
okay so two questions sue the dominant
issue is that the idea of certification
over the last decade has grown up around
span of control essentially saying we
have we understand a building design and
construction time period and we have a
set of metrics and a set of things that
are under control and then we have an
operations period under which a
different set of conditions are under
control and so I think it's absolutely
critical to understand that that is
there's not a the goal is to connect
those things together but the goal is
that they will they are necessarily
different because the currency of design
and construction aec construction is
different than it is for operating and
those are necessarily segments so to
your point yes there are different
performance metrics yes there are
different issues that are under control
in different phases and that's why we've
had a pearl
alishan of segmentation so noted a we
have 14 different rating systems that
deal with everything from interiors to
homes to warehouse distribution data
centers commercial schools retail
neighborhoods and so forth and it gets
to your point the other part about the
the time value so within the last year
there's two or three profound things the
entire green building movement is moving
as John told us earlier toward a focus
on performance and where the first issue
is how does the building perform and the
next issue is how did you perform well
so up to now we asked kind of what we'll
be putting in inputs and then hoping
that it derived outputs that we liked
there's a lot of good reasons for that
but what we're doing is creating a whole
new paradigm or performance drives the
show because of that what the there's
also another way to answer the last part
of your question the market has
basically said that certification of
buildings whether it's lead or Energy
Star the market has valued that at about
a five year shelf life I certified
building today that creates marginal
benefit in terms of rent effective rant
Tennessee and so forth we can detect
that through economic analysis that
premium basically falls away within five
years so whether you are following our
recommendation which is to recertify
your building every three years or
whether you're letting the market be
your guide which says if you don't Reese
or 25 in five years anything you did to
create advantage last time is not
believed by the market one way or the
other three to five years in you need to
be doing this my feeling is we need to
approach a per state of continuous
certification a state of continuous
evaluation that to me is more like a
diving board on a submarine you know
like green lights ready to dive right
green lights we are in a constant state
of high performance and and what we're
asking is how do we work back from a
technology we have today episodic
scorecard sort of approach to a set of
automation that allows us to assess
continuous performance that's the
transition
Norman stalker MIT this was extremely
interesting you emphasize a lot the
gradients within a pool of buildings
that already belongs to the green
buildings and yeah it wouldn't there be
more value in trying to get more
buildings into this category and
secondly by emphasizing the buildings
within this category need to be top
performers might you not be putting off
those who are about to decide whether
they should enter the pool of green
buildings right that's a I get
discussion a lot so there's two ways
answer that one is I would love to have
more buildings enter the pool of green
buildings for a bunch of reasons because
first and foremost it is the first step
in this transparency it is the fact it
is the point we've become aware of them
it's the point we know anything about
them at all so I want that to happen but
at the same time what was it not you
actually can do this mathematically as
well saying is that we have the the the
diversity the heterogeneity of green
building performance has increased we
created the voluntary system it has
heterogeneity and so we i do believe
have a sufficiently large cohort of
green buildings that we can stimulate
internal competition and that's actually
the right thing to do after being doing
this for 10 years because i'm not going
to look at you and say i don't think a
certified building is great shakes and i
don't think that the delivery of that is
a minimum level and i think it is fully
within our power to create competitive
dynamics within the pool of green
buildings because people like ourselves
want to compete in that pool so i want
to compete to bring more entities onto
the radar screen whether that's through
certification or just through advanced
data channels or other types of things
but i need it but i but I it's a both
and i think is the answer to your
question is it's a both anti want to
stimulate competition within the pool I
want to enlarge the pool Sam declar
Cummins in order to push push the
distribution the way you'd like to see
it go where do you see the weak link in
clients or customers asking for it or
builders available to provide it I I
think them it's a demand problem largely
I think that the level of statistically
that's probably answered that too
quickly but i think my gut reaction is
that many of these are demand problems
the market is capable
of delivering more sophisticated higher
performance solutions and they have not
and we have a variety of reasons that
inhibit demand for those higher
performance solutions I think there are
exceptions I think what I said is true
with regard to energy performance I
think it is is probably much more
debatable when it comes to water
performance because water performance
basically we've set standards that
basically everyone is meeting they're
all basically seventy eighty percent of
projects are meeting our highest
standards with regard to water
performance and we're not really sure
where to go with raising that bar so if
you look it so in other words that's not
demand driven we're not sure if the
market would demand higher but the
market isn't really clear about how what
next to offer here in this space we know
that higher performance solutions for
energy with regard to efficiency and
renewables are available but there's a
lack of demand for them and these and
these cases where people are performing
at this level are special in some way so
that zit I think the answer is you can
find situations on different performance
variables the last one I'll add to that
is say if we think energy is demand
limited water is some sort of limitation
and supply of good idea and an occupant
experience you know how much do you love
this space is completely limited by the
lack of data we we don't add to the
point that was brought up it was brought
up earlier with michelle ashley the
issue was saying i don't have the data
on enough spaces to get people to really
compete on the quality of these spaces
in this same way if i did i could open
up that competition but i can't right
now please anuraag gin with white
lincoln or associates question is what's
the correlation between us GBC LEED
certification and green building codes
such as Cal green yep good question so
green building codes and standards are
our there's two two answers to that the
first wait got first put it in context
today there there are two there are two
there are two universes of green
buildings there this summer we reached a
parity point in u.s. GBC where there are
as many square feet of existing green
things ie existing buildings that have
been recognized as green as new
construction that's going to continue in
that parody going forward so for half of
the green buildings we deal with codes
are not really relevant because they are
existing buildings that are performing
against operational benchmarks for the
half that are new construction which
increasingly over half of that new
construction volume is overseas it's in
China Korea Indonesia Brazil it's an
over developing world markets where
that's really relevant so that's an
interesting codes twist too but the
issue so for that fraction that is new
built what we understand is what we're
trying to create is a complementary
relationship between green codes and
voluntary standards so we're trying to
create a Delta where the voluntary
standards get the market experienced
reaching up to higher levels of
performance which allow us to raise the
green codes levels so us GBC has been a
very strong supporter of ash weigh 189
of IGCC and to a degree Cal green and so
the goal has been to move these up in
lockstep where the voluntary reach
standard is tied to incentives and other
things that are helping the market
stretch and the codes are bringing up
the floor we still don't know well
though we know a lot about we're doing a
study right now that compares all the
intricacies of codes and voluntary
standards we still don't really have we
have essentially no buildings that have
been built to green codes yet so there's
a lot there is a major transition stuff
between the adoption right now we have
green codes as hypothetical documents
the adoption of those codes and then
people building to those codes is the
next step we understand what about what
a LEED building is we don't really
understand what a green code built the
building is yet so that's a long
conversation hi all the Williams that
marks research I think the last couple
of questions actually spend my question
but I'll say it anyway the thing that
occurs to me is a little bit is that you
know obviously we sort of the zero net
energy examples and these great examples
of goin platinum LEED places that but in
some sense the goal is obviously to have
good energy efficiency for the whole
globe taken as shaking it and that to
have you know point zero zero zero one
percent the buildings being outstanding
and everything else not so great is it's
better that it's not as good as having
like fifty percent that were good
and so obviously you want these things
that sort of trickle down a little bit
and it's not entirely obvious that that
some of the techniques that you're
rewarding by providing things like you
know platinum status are scalable you
know could every how could every house
in a large development you know scale to
having all of the great things you're
rewarding there and it got disease you
said that fills into code and other
things but it's just great so it took a
question I think we have to ask
ourselves some profound questions about
scalability although I will point out a
couple things in the commercial space so
right now we know that green building
practices are written into the specs of
seventy percent of commercial new
construction in the US that's from the
analysis of building specification by
mcgraw-hill and so the idea whether
green building as a kind of integrated
holistic concept like a LEED Platinum
building it or Bram excellent building
is is a is possible I think that they
play an important role as a test bed and
need to be understood as pilots and test
beds and market early things that are
easing market adoption what we
definitely see empirically is the uptake
of those practices into down market and
so the how that plays out is a critical
concern I mean we all are asking
ourselves we know what we want what you
just said you know we want that bra of
scalar adoption we understand it as a
diffusion of innovation problem and we
understand how do we create multiple
interventions to bring it down market
and we can look at very specific note I
think we can hang our hat on some things
that are maybe sound trivial but we're
actually quite effective like the
broad-based adoption of low voz paint
it's something where the the green
building industry help get people
comfortable create demand incubate
demand for low POC paint and now we see
the substantial adoption of low vse
paint across the market you know you
there's not the kind of really swing
from the trees examples we want then
maybe 10 years on Whitney colella
Pacific Northwest National Labs thank
you for a very interesting talk I'm just
curious how you calculate the GHG index
I'm happy to follow up with you and give
you details the crux of it is what we do
is we take a prototypical reference
building in this case a typical US
office building and we
conduct a series of use a series of
models to estimate the basically it's a
hundred and seventy three hundred and
seventy-five thousand square foot US
office building with a certain specified
occupancy and a certain specified use on
a one-acre parcel of land that uses
irrigated water all sorts of different
things so what we do is we specify a
prototype and we we basically divide out
that carbon footprint that would be
associated with that reference building
so in a sense that reference building is
the target for lead for new construction
and so that building has a proportional
carbon footprint this much from
transportation this much from the
building systems this much from solid
waste this much from the lifecycle of
materials and then what we do is we
basically look at the ability of
individual credits those strategies to
abate different pieces of that of that
distribution of that of that pie and so
the larger a chunk of that pie you're
going after the greater a coefficient
you have in the index so basically you
have a vector with 29 coefficients each
one is they achieved or not of a of a
lead credit and so what we track is the
achievement of those credits and we
translate it into a proportional value
for ghg reduction we also have a variant
of this that actually works in tonnes
which is but you have to actually
specify the prototype more so again if
folks want to see I have a there's an
online demo of the that tool available
and there's a lot of documentation for
the index the thing I'll mention about
the index is the index is one of 13
indices that make up lead 2009 so
there's another 12 that are equally
accessible and there are 25 more that
are in development and we actually have
working with academic colleagues to
develop indices against other issues
such as we're working with neuro
Department of Public Health on a active
design physical activity index that
works the same way so that was a lot of
information but the idea is that indices
as ways to interpret credit achievement
are very important to us and I'm happy
to follow up with anybody who finds that
remotely interesting because I can get
really nerdy about jamie has sickened
Arkansas I was just you know when you
doing this a lot of the big buildings
and this is kind of going back down to
the house exam was on and in my
experience people want to be green they
really do I mean but they in houses
really don't have any idea how you know
it's like in its seeming like a lot of
the stuff that's been talked about
throughout all the speakers is higher
upfront initial costs energy savings
down the line but I mean is the result
of this also going to result in
like-for-like some sort of heuristic of
okay if I want to be green my first best
thing for spending a little bit more
money up front that's on my mortgage is
this and then second to this when you
have a slide right yeah well I think
that exactly I think that okay so homes
are really important homes are different
so we have a whole group in San Diego
who focuses exclusively on homes and
homes have a lot of different issues but
what I found motivating i'll give you my
what i want to be with respect to homes
is I want this same context I live in my
home and I look down my street and
there's a half-dozen other homes that
are essentially the same as my house I
have no idea which one's of those homes
perform better or worse than the others
and I have no idea those homes that do
perform better how they do it so in the
same way that I want to offer this
context to a commercial project I
desperately want to offer it to
residential because what I lack is I I
mean this is you know if some of this is
channeling Oh power or channeling other
people in the field but the idea is
basically saying what I lack as a
homeowner someone who's trying to make
those decisions is any sense of context
or perspective on how green I really am
or what the highest performing people
like me are doing those are questions
that we can inform we can unpack and
then say those high performers what
systems are they using how are they
going about doing it blah blah those
sort of things so my dominant connection
between this and what you're talking
about is that desperate desire to give
home owners and occupants of homes
context so that they can begin to put
themselves in context and act on that
but they a lot of other things come from
that
sure I'm say there's to be in a row so
whoever sorts today jaded aside from
University of Maryland I had a question
actually a follow-up typically for a
residential house if you look at the
cost of constructing a LEED certified
home or you know green to sufficiently
large extent than what is currently
probably out there for a typical home
what is the cost differential that is a
great question okay so we have a study
going on in California right now so in
November come back and I'll give you the
answer but there's actually two ways to
do it if you do a bottom-up cost
estimate and you ask you know basically
how much does it cost to get into an
energy star or a lead home relative to a
conventionally build the rough order of
magnitude is fifteen hundred dollars
because you're really paying for
envelope tightening you're paying for a
few prerequisite type activities it's
actually an incredibly note low number
and so a bottom-up estimate of the sort
of basil amount that it takes to get up
to an energy star level of efficiency
and those things is of that order of
magnitude so that's a pretty trivial
amount of money and that's when you
really get down to it you can obviously
take that too much larger sums of money
when you put on photovoltaics and you
start doing mechanical ventilation and
lots of other things you've got that
number can skyrocket right but that
basal level the interesting thing though
is so when I made this distinction
between a bottom-up cost estimate which
is just what does it cost to get there
the real interesting question right now
is how the market values it because a
lot of developers are going around and
saying I'm going to try to sell you that
that green home for twenty percent more
and so they're they're trying to get
quite ambitious markups and so it's
going to be quite interesting to get
some real market signal about what the
what the market is really willing to
absorb we know what those numbers look
like in the commercial office space
because the residential space has been
such a disaster like we launched lead
for homes and lead in 2007 yeah that was
good right so we've been battling
through a tough market and if you want
to understand what the shape of that
market looks like gets wonky but the
issue
it's a bimodal market basically the home
activity is dominated by multifamily
affordable and and relatively expensive
custom builds the market rate homes are
there are the the hardest to do because
they are the most first cost-sensitive
and they're dominated by production
builders and so that is changing slowly
but that's the nature of the market so
we have the most information on these
kind of weird ends of the market that's
more than you wanted well please help me
