is Andrew Calvo I'm the marketing
director for post carbon Institute today
Richard Heinberg will be presenting a
talk that he's given just once recently
and this he's actually doing a little
take for for Google on this on
sustainability and resource depletion
Richard is a senior fellow at post
carbon Institute
he has written eight books the last four
have been on energy on peak oil
primarily and he was for ten years a
member of the core faculty at the new
college I in the Santa Rosa campus and
he's recognized as one of the world's
leading Peak Oil educators so Richard oh
thank you it's really a pleasure to be
here at the Google campus and what I'd
like to do over the course of the next
40 minutes is talk a bit about
sustainability and perhaps more depth
than most of us are accustomed to
thinking of it and looking at
sustainability particularly with regard
to natural resources both renewable and
nonrenewable over the course of the past
couple of years I've gotten interested
in the word sustainability how it's
become sort of a buzzword that we tack
on to everything including sustainable
profits sustainable rates of return
sustainable growth etc etc and who
wanted to see if there were any
essential aspects of the definition of
this word that that we could learn from
in applying to social systems in general
so in in tracking down the history of
sustainability of course it was
necessary to start at the very beginning
which turns out to be in Western
European literature back around 1712
with the very first appearance in the
literature of the idea of sustainable
forestry
first non-european peoples indigenous
peoples have had sustainability as part
of their worldview for a very long time
famously Native Americans did things
with the seventh generation in the
future in mind made made their decisions
the definition of sustainability that
probably most people are familiar with
these days was one that came out in 1987
in the Brundtland report that describes
sustainable development as development
that meets current needs without
jeopardizing the ability of future
generations to meet theirs that's very
good but in my view it's inadequate
because it really doesn't tell us very
much about what makes an activity
sustainable so after months of search in
the literature and there are if you go
on Amazon there are something like
20,000 books with sustainability in
their title in one way or another I do
not claim to have even become familiar
with all of those much less to have read
them all but in looking at the surveys
of the surveys to see you know who has
actually tried to get to the bottom of
what sustainability is all about I found
that there are some ideas that recur
again and again and I've been able to
summarize those in four simple axioms
that I think if we took to heart would
actually change our society pretty
fundamentally the first axiom that I
thought it was important to include
actually doesn't explain what
sustainability is except in terms of its
absence we know that most complex
societies most civilizations in the past
have collapsed and in just about every
instance we can trace that collapse to
some way in which the society was not
functioning very rationally with regard
to its resource base now collapse is
is is virtually the opposite of
sustainability I mean the essence of
sustainability is you know what can we
continue to do over time so if a society
it has collapsed obviously they have not
continued to do things that they were
previously doing the best book on the
subject is one that was published in the
late 1980s by Joseph Tainter who's an
archaeologist in the American Southwest
a book called the collapse of complex
societies and in it he he tides social
complexity to the effort to solve
societal problems now given language and
our tool-making ability it was more or
less inevitable that we would create
complex societies and we did so in order
to solve specific problems like feeding
more people so we developed agriculture
and agriculture led to full-time
division of labor and full-time and
division full-time division of labor is
really the essence of societal
complexity but as Tanner points out in
his book the effort to develop societal
complexity to solve social problems
tends to yield diminishing returns over
time so the very first investments in
complexity say an agriculture tend to
yield large returns but then over time
well just with agriculture we see soil
degradation erosion and so on and
eventually unless the society develops
other ways of dealing with those
problems it faces collapse
so what axiom one does in my mind is
underscore that the notion that what
we're talking about with regard to
sustainability is not just a matter of
being eco-friendly
sustainability ultimately is about
survival it's about this survival of a
society and so it's very serious it
should be right at the center of our
public agenda axiom two has to do with
growth and it states simply population
growth and/or growth and rates of
consumption of resources cannot be
sustained on the face of it that sounds
pretty harsh
after all we have had population growth
over the past well actually over the
past millennia but particularly over the
course of the past couple of centuries
and we have had growth in rates of
consumption and we're still here well
the the the axiom doesn't say that you
can't do these things temporarily what
it says is that you can't do them
continually and simple arithmetic pretty
much proves this let's say you have a
one percent rate of population growth
that means the population is going to
double every 70 years suppose you start
with a population of 1 billion after 70
years it's 2 billion after 140 years
it's 4 billion 210 years
it's 8 billion and so on and this this
kind of growth doubling every every so
often achieves astonishing numbers in
relatively small periods of time think
for example of China's consumption of
coal China is consuming about 250
billion tons of coal per year currently
which is about twice what the u.s. is
consuming China's rate of consumption is
growing about 7% per year currently so
that means that China's coal consumption
is doubling every 10 years well what is
what does this mean in terms of well
first of all climate change obviously
the implications are horrendous
then what does it mean in terms of the
amount of coal that China actually has
to burn and clearly there's an enormous
amount of the resource in place but if
your consumption is doubling every ten
years even an enormous amount drinks
away pretty rapidly so here we are this
is the obviously the the graph of human
population we reached 1 billion in 1820
2 billion in 1933 billion in the
nineteen 1960's four billion by the late
70s five billion by the late 80s six
billion by 1998 and we're up to
something like 6.7 billion human beings
on the planet currently how many human
beings can planet Earth sustain no one
knows the answer to that question but we
may be about to find out axiom three has
to do with renewable resources and this
gets right back to the the original use
of the term back in the 18th century
with regard to sustainable forestry to
be sustainable the use of renewable
resources has to proceed at a rate
that's less than or equal to that of
natural replenishment and of course
you're much better off if your rate of
consumption of renewable resources is
considerably less than the rate of
natural replenishment because the rate
of natural replenishment of renewable
resources is variable due to weather and
other factors and if we're using those
resources at the absolute maximum rate
then we're likely to get into trouble
we're likely to find ourselves actually
reducing the sustainability of that that
resource base well are we following
axiom 3 in the world currently no not
with regard to many resources this graph
here of course is marine fish catch and
most of the world's fisheries are at the
point of
overconsumption if not exhaustion but
that's only one example the world's
forest cover is shrinking by an area
equivalent to the size of Ireland every
year these are these are trends
obviously that can't continue very long
this is a fairly obvious lesson that we
haven't yet learned axiom four has to do
with non-renewable resources now it
should stand a reason that there is no
sustainable rate of consumption of
non-renewable resources I mean if we're
using them once for once and for all as
in burning them there is no sustainable
rate if we can recycle them then one
could argue that it's it's then still
possible to use non-renewable resources
but in the case of non-renewable
resources that are actually consumed it
can't be fully recycled the only way we
we can approach a condition of
sustainability is if the rate of
consumption is declining and the rate of
decline has to be substantial it has to
be at least equal to or greater than the
rate of depletion well what does this
mean example oil production world has
something like a trillion barrels of oil
reserves that's the amount of oil we
think we'll be able to extract in the
future at current prices using current
technology we're consuming something
like two to two-and-a-half percent of
that trillion barrels on an annual basis
so in order to have something like a
sustainable relationship with petroleum
we'd have to be reducing our rate of
consumption of oil at about two and a
half percent per year and in that case
by the time we really got to a point
where we were literally running out we
will we will have already voluntarily
reduced our reliance on oil to such a
point that it won't make any difference
that's not what we're doing of course
we're increasing our reliance on oil
we're increasing our demand for
petroleum and petroleum products on an
annual basis and this is a subject that
I'm going to go into in a little bit
more detail because it's one that I
happen to be fairly familiar with as a
result of ten years of study and an
analysis and talking to people in the
oil industry and and seeing some
forecasts that a number of us have been
making fulfilled as time goes on I'm
sure all of you are familiar with the
term Peak Oil the idea that world oil
production will reach a maximum at some
point and then begin to decline we know
it's going to happen because it's
already happened here in the US the u.s.
is a post peak oil country our domestic
oil production peaked around 1970
discovery peaked in 1930 has been
declining ever since and so what used to
be the epicenter of the world oil
industry is now a country that imports
two-thirds of the oil that it uses and
we are by far the world's champion oil
importing nation numbers two and three
are China and Japan and we import about
twice as much as China and Japan
combined so here we are
why have gasoline prices gotten so high
lately well first of all it's it's
surprised a lot of people here's the US
Department of Energy Energy Information
Administration in - in 2006
telling us that in the high price case
forecast we might get up to $100 a
barrel for oil by 2030 in the low-priced
case we could look forward to $35 a
barrel oil all the way out to 2030 well
there were a lot of us who at that time
thought that that was a very unrealistic
forecast but just how unrealistic was of
course underscored just this past year
we got up to $147 a barrel
in July 2008 and that wasn't supposed to
happen until sometime in the middle of
the century
here's CNN money telling us that the
consensus of analysts is that oil won't
hit $100 a barrel which is about where
it is right now
well what's brought us to this point
obviously the falling value of the
dollar has had some role to play
speculation in oil futures has had a
role to play rising demand very often
the rising demand is is attributed to
countries like China and India and it's
true that oil demand is increasing in
those countries but for reasons I'll
talk about a little bit more in a moment
I think the more important rising demand
is not in China and India but actually
in the oil exporting countries like
Saudi Arabia United Arab Emirates Russia
and so on but meanwhile these first
three are what the the commentators tend
to focus on the last one is seldom
discussed and that's the fact that
supply has been pretty much static for
the past four years this is the best
ignition of peak oil that I've ever seen
it's from my friend Chris Grabovski
who's the editor of petroleum review in
London he puts it in terms of a kind of
seesaw or teeter-totter effect countries
that are past peak like the US and most
countries that produce oil have already
passed their all-time oil production
Peaks past peak countries are seeing
declines in production so in order just
to stay even there have to be other
countries that are increasing their rate
of production just so we stay even so
the point in time when we reach peak oil
is the time when the decliners outweigh
the advancers when it's no longer
possible for countries that are
producing more oil in an annual basis to
make up for those that are
headed south well we should keep this in
mind when we hear about new sources of
oil in the world we hear about Brazil's
good luck in finding oil on the outer
continental shelf in that part of the
world there have been some new finds in
the Gulf of Mexico in the last couple of
years we hear about good luck in the
backend Shale in Montana we hear that
there might be 50 billion barrels of oil
and the Arctic regions of the planet
that we might be able to access in the
future well that looks really good if we
can simply add all of that new oil to
what we're producing today but the
reality is we have to take account first
of the declines before we can make these
additions and we are seeing substantial
declines and the rate of decline is
growing we just heard this year that
Russia's oil output has reached its
maximum and has been headed down for the
past six to eight months that's
extremely important because Russia has
been the main source of non OPEC oil
production growth for the past decade so
outside of OPEC there's very little new
oil coming online these days Nigeria is
having trouble not just from because of
geology but also because of of local
politics maintaining their rate of
production Mexico's oil production is
declining rapidly it's it's star
oilfield Cantarell which is the world's
third largest oil field peaked about
four years ago and now Cantrell's
productions declining at about 30
percent per year so this is this creates
a daunting challenge for for the world
oil industry to make up for those
declines and actually create advances
now this is the scorecard for 2007 on
the left side our new
additions to supply in on the right side
are our declines and as we can see
Mexico is a big decline er Saudi Arabia
was a decline er and in 2007 now the
Saudis are saying of course that was
entirely voluntary and had nothing to do
with geology but for pretty much all of
the rest of these it's it's a matter of
depletion of those oil old oil fields
that were discovered back in the 50s 60s
70s and 80s the days when we were
finding giant giant and super giant oil
fields today what are found typically
our much smaller fields in much more
out-of-the-way places places that are
more expensive and difficult to operate
in so that was last year's scorecard
actually the same thing happened in 2006
the decliners outweighed the advancers
again why are all priced is so high
well this fundamentally I would say is
at the heart of the reason so this is
what actual crude oil production has
looked like for the past few years we've
been on a sort of treadmill since about
nineteen or excuse me 2005 things have
looked a little bit better in 2008 and
there are some substantial new oil
production projects coming online in
2009-2010 the question is will they be
able to make up for the accelerating
decline rate from more and more
countries that are going over the top
every year there are fewer oil exporters
and more oil importers meanwhile I
mentioned earlier that oil demand is
growing especially among the oil
exporting countries so even as total
production has remained flat and in fact
increased a little bit in the last year
net exports have started to decline
countries that export oil first have to
satisfy domestic demand
before they can sell oil on the market
now Saudi Arabia's domestic demand for
oil is growing at about seven percent
per year which means that it's doubling
every ten years at that rate even if
Saudi is able to maintain current output
it will cease to be a net exporter
sometime around 2030 now there are
questions as to whether Saudi Arabia
will be able to maintain its current
rate of output but the the export
dilemma is is an added difficulty on top
of that this next slide is a little
complicated but it's worth taking a
moment to look at this is a wiki project
on the part of a number of petroleum
experts actually dozens of petroleum
experts around the world and what
they've done is first of all look at all
of the new production projects that are
coming online historically and in the
next few years what will be their
maximum rate of flow where are they and
then what will be the decline rate from
existing fields and then on top of that
they have added in projected rates of
increase of domestic demand for oil in
those oil-producing nations and what
they've come up with is a chart of world
oil net exports history and future
projection and as you can see it looks
as though global oil net exports peaked
in 2005 and whether we're actually
reaching technical global peak oil now
or next year or the year after that or
in five years time in some ways is
beside the point for countries like the
United States that rely on imported oil
because what we rely on is not just one
total figure of global production what
we need is oil that we can buy on the
global market and that is clearly about
to head over a cliff
so why of oil prices softened in the
last six weeks well essentially
volatility in price is something that
those of us who have been talking about
peak oil for the past decade have
predicted that's this is as as necessary
commodities become scarce their price
tends to fluctuate ever more wildly so
what's actually happened since July is
that the very high price is getting up
close to $150 a barrel for oil resulted
in serious economic pain for the
American and global economy Americans
started driving less using more public
transportation the airline industry
started grounding planes cutting routes
farmers found that they were having
trouble affording the crop inputs and
fuel for their tractors this is not just
in the US but around the world
countries that had been using diesel
fuel to generate electricity started
keeping the lights on not twenty-four
hours a day but maybe only six or ten
hours a day so this balanced the books
as a result of demand and destruction we
were able to actually reduce world
demand for oil over the past few months
particularly over the last six weeks or
so and that successfully brought the
price down now of course this is
coincided with some other economic
problems having to do with some subprime
credit crunch I see a few headlines in
the newspapers I'm not sure what that's
about but supposedly that's a big deal I
don't know anyway that that has also
killed some oil demand
and also LED oil futures traders to
believe that demand for oil in months
ahead is likely to be lower so that's
brought down the price meanwhile global
supplies of oil haven't really changed
and amounts available for export have
actually declined this has all become a
big political issue of course and we're
told that we can solve our problems just
by drill drilling here and drilling now
the absurdity of that is becomes
apparent when you look into the history
of oil exploration and production in the
United States we are the world's most
mature oil producing province here in
this country more oil wells have been
drilled in North America than in the
rest of the world put together
so what we have left to produce on the
outer continental shelf and an Anwar and
a few other places are really the dregs
the absolute dregs a study was done at
Rice University looking at using the the
most robust estimates of how much was
out there B to be produced and then
looking at how much time it would take
to bring it on stream and so on and you
can see what what an influence this is
likely to have the red dots are of
course actual production of US oil and
and as you can see by the time we get
any substantial rate of flow again in
the best-case scenario from these
off-limits areas we're looking at
something like 2035 2040 and by that
time production from existing oil fields
in the US will have declined by about
half of what they are today and this new
oil won't even be enough to lift
production back up to where it is today
so forget about drilling for oil in the
US as a way of making the country
independent of oil imports or even
imports from the Middle East we assuming
that our demand for oil is the same 20
years from now as it is today we will be
importing more
even if we drill everywhere so the only
effective remedy for the problem is
reducing demand as we've seen over the
past weeks that's the only thing that's
actually lowered oil prices it's the
only thing that's likely to oil lower
oil prices in the future we have to find
alternatives to oil we have to stop
using as much petroleum well what are
some alternatives we could make liquid
fuel from coal and the US Defense
Department is busy trying to build some
coal-to-liquids power plants to do
exactly that to make fuel for military
aircraft after all we can't rely on oil
from the Middle East to power our jet
fighters to that whose main mission will
presumably be to protect oil from the
Middle East in situations where that's
in question so we have to have some
other sources and coal-to-liquids could
work unfortunately that's very expensive
technology it's only been developed
historically twice once in Nazi Germany
and the other time in apartheid South
Africa both in situations where there
were embargoes against the import of
regular conventional oil that was the
only way that this production of this
stuff could have been cost-effective it
has a very low energy return on energy
investment it's very dirty process and
coal supplies in any case have been
wildly overestimated globally I'm I'm in
the process of finishing up a book on
global coal supplies the title is black
out it will be coming out in the spring
essentially we've all been told that the
world has a couple of hundred years
worth of coal but we can't trust
statements like that the very form of
the statement we have 200 years worth
implies that you know we can continue
using coal at some arbitrary rate and
then one day
just all runs out and it stops whereas
in fact we know that with every
non-renewable resource there's a kind of
a bell curve of recovery we get the
cheap easy stuff first we grow
consumption until we can't grow it
anymore and then it declines slowly over
a long period of time that's what Peak
Oil is all about Peak coal is exactly
the same kind of phenomenon and it will
happen so who's doing Studies on when
global coal supplies will actually peak
the US Department of Energy isn't doing
such studies it turns out that just over
the last three years the very first
peaking studies for global coal have
come out and they have concurred in
their forecast of a global peak in coal
production around 2035 2040 so that's a
lot less than 200 years and it's well
within the planning horizon if many have
any new coal power plant we'd be
building today so coal prices have
doubled over the past two years they're
going to continue on their way up as we
go as we move toward 2030 2040 the price
of coal is going to increase both
because of scarcity because we are
exhausting the highest-quality resources
first and also because we transport coal
using oil whether it's in a ship on a
train or in a truck we transport coal
using other Bunker oil or diesel fuel
and as that fuel gets more expensive the
price of coal goes up very often the
price of delivered coal at the power
plant is up consists of up to 70%
transport costs in some cases more so
making liquid fuels from coal it will
happen but not on a very large scale
I won't take as long talking about
biofuels because the the great rush to
corn ethanol has has turned into a bust
the price of corn advanced so high over
the past year that now the ethanol
distilleries are operating at a loss
corns too expensive even with gasoline
prices
as high as they are the price of corn is
so high and part of the reason the price
of corn is so high is that the demand
for corn has grown because of the demand
for ethanol could we all be driving
hydrogen cars it's not likely to happen
in my view because hydrogen is not an
energy source we've got to make it from
something and the cheapest way to make
its from fossil fuels we can make it
from water but then that requires the
application of electrical energy and
where do we get the extra electricity so
if we can run cars directly on
electricity we can bypass the hydrogen
all we needs a better battery with
hydrogen cars we need several
technological breakthroughs with better
battery cars we just need one better
batteries well so we're headed toward
higher oil prices
why have I spent so long just on this
one subject because we created a
civilization that runs on oil this is
not a trivial matter of course our main
use of oil is for transportation and you
could say that transportation drives
everything else quite literally planes
trains automobiles ships how much of
what we see around us would be here if
it weren't for cheap transportation the
whole phenomenon of globalization that
we've seen over the past couple of
decades really has been based on cheap
transport fuels but we also use oil as a
feedstock for producing all kinds of
plastics and chemicals perhaps the most
disturbing aspect of this whole
discussion is how dependent we are on
oil for our food system we've created a
food system that is basically uses soil
as a medium with which to grow crops
from oil for every calorie of food that
we produce we invest about 10 calories
of fossil-fuel energy in the u.s. in the
form of fertilizers pesticides
herbicides crop inputs and outputs fuel
for tractors
for crop drying for prop storage and so
on and as the price of oil has increased
over the past few years we've also seen
a concurrent dramatic increase in the
price of particularly green crops this
is just wheat prices up through early
2008 and as a result of that we've seen
food riots in poor countries in the
world this is a trend that is not about
to reverse itself any time soon it's
likely to grow much worse as time goes
on because all of the factors feeding
into this trend are long-term
factors that are actually worsening as
time goes on just within the last couple
of weeks I've had opportunity to have
some discussions with an executive from
Boeing and the head of the Air Transport
Division at the World Bank over the
implications of all of this for air
travel and these gentlemen are very
worried they take they take this
discussion quite seriously and they're
seeing what's happening to the air
transport industry right now I mentioned
earlier that the airlines are grounding
planes well what does this mean for
Boeing for example I mean if if airlines
have no use for the planes they already
have how likely are they to be wanting
or needing or able to buy lots more
planes it's it's pretty grim business
Boeing is looking at a future of
producing super efficient airliners and
on one hand and military aircraft on the
other but they're there civilian
aircraft division is likely to shrink
pretty dramatically even just within the
next few years basically we're looking
at a return of the jet set you know in
the 1950s only the wealthy few were able
to get on airplanes and fly around and
every
took the bus or drove we were just a
less mobile society we didn't travel as
much or as far and we're going to be
that way again now one could even argue
that Peak Oil could mean the end of
economic growth as we've known it
because we've based economic growth to a
very large extent on cheap energy not
just for transportation but for
manufacturing and distribution and just
about everything else energy isn't a
part of the economy energy is the basis
for the entire economy without energy
nothing happens the entire economy
grinds to a standstill so if we have
less energy in the future the only way
we'll be able to maintain economic
growth is if we're able to increase the
efficiency of our use of energy faster
than the rate of depletion of energy
resources that may be possible but it's
going to be one heck of a horse race
that's why the chief economist of the
International Energy Agency is now
telling us that we must leave oil before
it leaves us we've got to get out ahead
of the depletion curve if we can reduce
demand for oil voluntarily that will
keep prices under control that will
enable us to reduce our vulnerability to
oil supply shocks while we transition
and the transition process is going to
take a while it's not something we can
do overnight yes we all could be riding
in electric cars but the reality is that
not everybody buys a new car every year
it's going to take Detroit several years
to get those cars on in the dealerships
assuming Detroit can even survive and in
the interim and then it'll take about 15
to 20 years at current rates for people
to jump their old cars and buy new ones
and replace the current fleet so that's
about a 25 year strategy just about
everything that we can do to solve this
problem of Peak Oil
at least a 15 to 25 year lead time
except for one thing and that is
behavior change if people can you know
start working at home rather than
commuting if people can start growing
more of their own food in their
backyards rather than buying food that
has been trucked or air freighted in
from hundreds and thousands of miles
away that immediately cuts demand just
by behavior change of course we started
this whole discussion talking about
non-renewable resources and oil is by
far not the only non-renewable resource
that's that's depleting this is just a
list of some interesting ones
interesting because they all relate to
the computer industry in one way or
another many of them relate to
photovoltaics which is one of the the
technologies that we're going to be
relying on to make up for fossil fuels
as time goes on everything from antimony
to zinc okay so that's axiom for and I
was just in closing out the discussion
of of non-renewable resources and
particularly energy resources just want
to mention that I read yesterday about
google.org plan to invest four trillion
dollars I don't think that's four
trillion dollars of company money but
for the country as a whole if we could
invest four trillion dollars along the
lines advised we could get off of fossil
fuels by 2030 I think it's a very
interesting plan and it's good that more
of us are thinking along those lines
axiom five is the pollution axiom
sustainability requires that substances
introduced into the environment from
human activities be minimized and
rendered harmless to biosphere functions
and of course we've been polluting our
environment for a very long time and
it's it's not just about fossil fuels
for example
hunters and gatherers tan the leather of
animals they kill so they can tend hides
are very useful they last a lot longer
they're more not only more durable but
they have other more supple and and
easier to use but tanning is something
that requires you know a process know
you can tan hides with the brains of the
animal that that you've killed another
way is to use tanning agents like tan
oak which of course gets its name from
from the tannic acid in the in the
leaves and bark well mmm if you're doing
it on a small scale it's it's not that
big a deal but when European settlers
arrived for instance in California and
saw that the natives were using this tan
oak as a tanning agent to tan hides they
decided they could do the same thing and
started a leather tanning industry and
the tannic acid runoff from from these
factories basically killed all of us all
of the streams that were downstream of
their operations so here you have a
perfect you know perfectly natural
substance the tannic acid from oak trees
but it's being concentrated in a way and
released into the environment that it
results in in environmental disruption
well of course as we've increased our
population as we've increased our
consumption habits as we've increased
our extraction of non-renewable
resources and release of their waste
products we have been altering the
environment in much more fundamental and
widespread ways than ever before and the
the most serious of these has to do with
the release of carbon dioxide into the
atmosphere and the resulting climate
change this is clearly the most serious
environmental crisis in our history as a
species and
I'm sure you're all familiar with the
details of that so I won't go into the
into them and any take your time with
that I would just point out that it's
also a problem of fossil fuels just as
the problem of peak oil peak coal and
peak gas is a problem of fossil fuels so
are necessary strategy as a society over
over the course of the next two three
decades has to be to get ourselves off
of fossil fuels as quickly as possible
whatever our motive now in in my view I
think efforts to combat climate change
are likely to come into or likely hit
some brick walls in the in the fairly
near future as hmm as we see the true
economic cost of carbon capture and
storage for example I think that the
likelihood is that that technology won't
be deployed societies are going to be
desperate for energy to maintain their
economic activities to maintain economic
growth and I think efforts to deal with
climate change are going to be easily
and quickly tossed overboard in that
rush to maintain economic viability
depletion of fossil fuels I think is
going to be a key argument in in this
discussion because we're as the efforts
are proposed to you know for example
solve our oil supply problems in North
America simply by drilling more it's
going to become obvious very quickly
that that's not solving anything and the
only way ultimately to deal with our oil
supply problem is to reduce demand well
as it turns out that's also the only way
we're going to deal with the problem of
climate change is to reduce the demand
for fossil fuels so these the the
solution for these two problems is
essentially the same but I think the
argument from the
the depletion side is ultimately going
to be more persuasive
I don't think policymakers are as likely
to make their policies on the basis of
the welfare of other species and future
generations when push comes to shove as
they are on the basis of immediate
economic survival which is what the
problem that will that depletion will
presenting for us so just to sum up
sustainability is not optional it's not
just about you know being good green
citizens we're talking about survival
unless we as a society can adopt
sustainable practices with regard to all
resources both renewable and
nonrenewable we will not survive as a
society and something to remember with
regard to this is is a an ecological
principle first formulated all the way
back in the 1860s by a soil scientist
named Justus von Liebig it's called
liebig's law or the law of the minimum
basically it says that carrying capacity
is set by the single factor that is most
out of balance now what does this mean
suppose we have an African violet here a
plant what does it take to kill that
African violet do we have to get
everything wrong you know too much water
not enough water wrong soil pH too much
sunlight not enough sunlight all of
those things happening at once no just
one thing just not enough water or wrong
soil pH or any of the other factors that
that plant needs all it takes is one
thing to go wrong and the plant dies
same thing with civilization it's not
going to require you know every
environmental factor going haywire at
the same time all it will take is one to
send us over the edge into societal
collapse
second takeaway is the new paradigm for
success is going to be using less if you
axioms two and three regarding renewable
and nonrenewable resources are true then
the only way we're going to survive as a
society in the 21st century is to find a
way to use less of just about everything
and that's also going to mean we're
going to there's gonna have to be fewer
of us - we're going to have to start
taking populations seriously I know
there's a huge political component to
that discussion but just because it's
inconvenient or unpopular to talk about
it doesn't mean that we can get away
with ignoring it population has to be
part of the discussion we're going to
have to start sourcing materials more
locally and in fact building more
localized economies if in fact
globalization was based on cheap
transport fuels that means that the
future is going to be a much more
localized future and that has some good
aspects to it you know we gave up a lot
in the process of globalization in terms
of local regional national manufacturing
capability self-sufficiency and so on it
could actually be very good for us to
relocation clearly if fossil fuel if the
if the project of getting off of fossil
fuels is central to our survival we have
to bring that down to cases and
everything we do look for the fossil
fuel inputs everywhere in absolutely
everything we're doing and reduce them
continually not just do it once and
forget about it but then do it and find
ways to do more constantly and then
finally we have to prepare ourselves
psychologically socially politically for
a century that's going to be very very
different from the century in which we
all grew up you know the 20th century
was all about more bigger faster
the 21st century is not going to look
the same way the the 21st century is the
century of limits where we find we
finally come up against basic resource
limits and we learn to live within them
if we don't then that's the end of us
you know we can solve this problem or we
can let nature solve the problem the
nature has ways of doing it but they're
probably not going to be to our liking
so the 21st century is going to be a
century when we we learn to live with
less when we learn to value other things
than we have learned to value in the
20th century you know during the 20th
century we we developed more and more
wants and desires and this was not a
natural process it was it was fueled by
the advertising industry and and in the
process we became consumers rather than
citizens rather than human beings we
became consumers well we need to think
more of ourselves as members of
communities members of families as as
contributors as creators and much less
as consumers as time goes on and in
doing so I think we'll be much happier
as people we there are lots of
opportunities in this process of
adaptation just as in the Great
Depression you know there was enormous
human suffering and hardship we had to
do with a lot less and yet
the effort was very much a collective
effort in in which many people found
meaning and we ended up building new
infrastructure in the country that we're
still using post offices and bridges and
on and on and many people who are still
alive who lived through that period of
time look back on it as some of the best
times in their life so if you'd like to
know more about our work at post carbon
Institute this is how you can find us on
the web
I also have a personal website
Richard Heinberg calm and I'd be happy
to engage in conversation Thanks
if I could advise one policy for the
next administration first day in office
it would be to use this current
financial crisis as an opportunity to
entirely shift the priorities of the
country you know where we are going to
have to do something about the national
economy it's very clear we can't just
you know pretend that this financial
collapse isn't isn't happening but the
question is you know do we take a
trillion dollars and shovel it at Wall
Street or do we rebuild the economy from
the ground up
we need new infrastructure in this
country energy production infrastructure
but also the infrastructure by which we
we use energy new electricity grid new
transportation networks and so on that's
going to require investment but that
investment is going to create new jobs
it will has the capability of rebuilding
the economy from the ground up and I I
think if if a new president grasps that
opportunity then there's there's the
possibility of turning this crisis into
into a rebirth and opportunity for the
whole country
yes yes well how much what's the size of
population the earth can sustain over
long-term a number of people have tried
to calculate that and of course it
depends on what kind of technology you
assume that people are using and so on
the most optimistic well let's see there
there are people like Julian Simon the
late economists who have proposed that
the earth could sustain population in
the range of tens of billions there
those of us who have ecological
backgrounds think that's very
unrealistic and among people who do have
a background in ecology the most
optimistic estimates that I've seen are
in the range of one to two billion
humans over long term now we could get
down to one to two billion humans by
2100 if we had a policy of you know one
child per family zero to one child per
family and over the course of of the
next you know nine decades we could we
could actually achieve a population of 1
billion we'll see if we'll see if we do
that yes
yes
was isis surprised at the speed with
which this transitions happening you
know mmm
mentally no because you know i with my
colleagues we've been looking at the
same set of data for 10 years now and
and it's it's been clear consistently
clear in that data that the world would
have start having severe problems with
oil supply within a couple of years of
2010 so starting to see prices go up
you know exponentially around this time
is no surprise at the mental level but
at the sort of visceral level you know
to actually see the economy shudder and
start to collapse to watch the airlines
consolidating and Ford and GM and
Chrysler talking about bankruptcy I mean
it's there there's no way you can look
at the at changes of that scale and
magnitude in the world that we all live
in and take for granted without feeling
queasy and frightened and and all the
rest
right a question about oil speculation
isn't that isn't that really a symptom
of Peak Oil yes absolutely of course
partly it's people who had been invested
in other things looking for a safe haven
for their their capital and seeing that
commodities might be a you know a good
place to put their money but then you
know why would Boyle look like a good
bet in that case well if you see that
demand is increasing and supply isn't
well any any intelligent investor is
going to see that as an opportunity and
so it's natural that speculative capital
would flow in that direction yeah you're
right any other thoughts comments
questions
well good thanks for being here during
this past what is it 45 minutes hour or
something like that
I appreciated the opportunity to share
these thoughts I hope we can take them
forth into our work in home lives and
make a difference thanks a lot</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
