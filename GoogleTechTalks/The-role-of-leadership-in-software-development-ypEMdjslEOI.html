software engineer here and I'd like to
thank Joe little in the back for
bringing Mary and Tom poppendieck to
town and I'm not going to tell you much
about them you're all here because you
know who they are and you wanted to hear
them so without further ado cute evening
everybody so um so I'll uh thank Adam
for uh for choosing the topic for
tonight so I didn't actually choose it I
gave him a list of several things and I
if you don't like it I can change it I
got my computer here okay let me talk
about something else or ask questions
about something that's quite all right
because this one happens to be about
leadership actually I said a history of
leadership but after a late dinner last
night I went back to the hotel room and
started to gather together the talks
that I've done before and I really
realized this was the first time I or
second time I did this talk it was
already videotaped and on the web so
maybe I better say something more or
different than that
so I renamed it a history of leadership
and changed a bunch of stuff and we'll
see how it goes but I would like really
to encourage you to ask questions and
you know if you don't like a challenge
me or whatever you want and then we'll
just go in from there a little bit about
my background I started out life as a
programmer back when programmers were
called programmers and stud developers
and programmers did like all sorts of
things like understand customers and
test their software and you know work
with engineer electrical engineers and I
did process control systems first a did
the controls of physics experiments at
the University of Wisconsin and then I I
did process control systems for 3m and
then I became a manager at a
manufacturing plant where we found
ourselves in serious competition
with Japan and decided we had to do
something entirely different we've been
doing before and we did something that
in the early 1980s was called
just-in-time
which came to be called lean and we did
change our plants around quite a bit a
little bit more about that later on in
the talk and later on I went back to
corporate headquarters and I did a bunch
of product development so I was an IT
manager I was a developer and I got into
product development I did lighting
systems with ultra pure plastic honest
and eventually in the late 90s 3m had
this really cool buyout offer that I
couldn't refuse so I went off and found
myself managing a software project again
as a program manager it was a government
project and it's the very first time I
ever heard this thing called waterfall
we didn't do that honest you know I
learned how to do software projects as
an engineer in a department where they
didn't do computers computers were new
but they could put control systems on
processes in their sleep so I learned
about projects from engineers who knew
how to put plants together and always
hit deadlines and that was kind of
interesting so then I we I spent at 3m
perhaps a dozen years or more being a
manager and I kind of liked the role of
manager and got involved in talking
about how you can apply lean ideas to
software and I found some people that
weren't software thinking like really
bad things about managers maybe with
good reason but you didn't like the fact
that there was a stereotype that all
managers are bad and should disappear
and so I occasionally talk about
leadership and what leadership is all
about and what can do when it's done
right so that's what I'd like to talk
about today although it's not going to
always be about what leadership is done
right because we're going to start back
in 1850 because it's a history I like
history and on October 5th 1841 was the
first serious train wreck in the u.s.
honest at least that's what I understand
from reading the history
and the interesting thing was that up
until this time there weren't any really
big organizations outside of you know
church and military and some government
stuff but big companies were just
starting to exist because transportation
was just becoming available and you
could just start amalgamating a bunch of
things and creating big companies and
trains used to like go from here to here
on a track and then another train a few
days later from here to here on the
track and all of a sudden they started
putting a lot of trains on the same
track and one find a couple of them ran
into each other and then said oh who
caused that so there was a big question
about how do you run a large dispersed
train or a railroad organization in such
a way that trains don't crash because
you can't have lots of people sending
people down the same track the answer
after a you know government
investigation and all that sort of stuff
was guess what you've seen this
hierarchy before it was an
organizational structure that kind of
looks just like the you know pyramid
that we've all come to wonder about and
and the investigation came up with six
principles of administration this is
sort of the first this is what
management is all about or this is what
managers are supposed to do first one
was there was supposed to be proper
division of responsibilities so that
people had you know control over who
decided who what trains went where there
needed to be sufficient power conferred
to enable this the people with the
responsibilities to carry them out there
had to be a means of knowing whether
such responsibilities were faithfully
carried out there had to be great
promptness in reporting all derelictions
of Duty got it and information obtained
through a system of daily reports and
checks and adoption of a system to
enable the general superintendent detect
errors and immediately point out the
delinquent person so it was all about
assigning blame if something went wrong
because that's what that we're trying to
do is if the
trains crash somebody has to be
responsible and take the blame this is
from a very interesting book called the
leaders handbook by Peter Schulte and if
you want to read more interesting stuff
about leadership this is I think this is
the book and he's actually quoting the
visible hand the management revolution
in American business by shandler in 1977
and in that book Chandler says basically
everything there was to know about
management was invented by about 1912 or
1915 I think stuff has been learned
since then but that's what he said in
1977 and so the beginning of management
and big organizations is all about
hierarchy and assigning blame now there
were other big organizations as I said
they were basically military
organizations and they're you know doing
the right thing is a matter of life and
death and other things so let's talk
about what happened in 1880's
about this time guns became more
prevalent in war and it turns out that a
general could no longer stand on the top
of a hill and orchestrate a battle
because distances were further and guns
were you know it enabled you know things
got just way more confusing than they
used to be and so um Suzanne you're
gonna have to help me
helmut van Mulkey yes did I get that
right she's from Munich so you know she
can get me right here uh as the chief of
general staff in the Prussian army from
1857 to 1888 for 30 years and he he
instituted this concept of command
intent he said you know in a war when a
general can't stand in front and tell
everybody what to do we have to do
something different no plan of
operations extends with any degree of
certainty beyond the first encounter
with the main enemy force where have you
heard that before lots of people are
quoted but that's where it started when
Moki and so he had this thing called now
what's that Oh
got it Ultra ultra KATUSA okay or pulse
anyway which is mission tactics and it's
all about delegation of decision-making
authority to subordinate commanders with
the within the context of the
higher commands intent so instead of
telling people what to do you tell the
next level of command what you want done
and let them figure out how to make it
happen and so that's command intent and
he said the heart of mission command is
this the advantage with which a
commander thinks he can attain through
continued personal intervention is
largely illusionary bengay by engaging
in it in it he assumes a test that
really belongs to others whose
effectiveness he thus destroys he ought
to multiply as his own task to a point
where he can no longer fulfill the whole
of them so the idea of delegation down
started with people who had to win wars
where the rules of engagement had
changed and one of the interesting
things you'll see is that a lot of the
good ideas about leadership actually
have come from this origin of various
military engagements where things got to
be a matter of life and death where you
know this is way we always did it
doesn't actually hold anymore now let's
go to 1910 and it's a it's a you know
the Model T has just been invented and
is about in 1913 was the first assembly
line
automated assembly line and in 1911
Frederick wensel Traylor wrote the book
the principles of scientific management
this is not the same as a scientific
method okay it's totally different fact
180 degrees the opposite but he had this
idea and you got a picture it's the u.s.
it's the automotive industry or the
steel industry most of the people that
are working there have come from some
other country can't speak English so
certain people think they must be not
very smart can't speak English and they
have to be told what to do so there's a
lot of in Frederick wensel tailors ready
I'm sort of kind of sentient to people
who actually do work they're not smart
they have to be told what to do they're
lazy they will not do the job unless you
make sure and keep track of every last
thing that they do so the the underlying
theme here and the underlying assumption
is that workers will do as little as
possible but workers do not care about
quality so if they aren't forced to have
quality it won't happen and that workers
are not smart enough to know the best
way to do their job so you need the
smart people the engineers to tell the
workers exactly how to do their job and
there's a lot of that in the things that
he did and this hit a lot of the
assembly type manufacturing environments
like automotive and also there was
widely done in the steel industry his
view of efficiency was that efficiency
comes from knowing exactly what you want
men to do and then seeing to it that
they do it in the best and cheapest way
so they don't know how to do it best and
cheapest but you know the smart people
the managers the engineers they do
experts define the best way and the way
they do it is by breaking down the job
into individual parts and finding the
best way to do each part and then paying
the workers extra if they do it the best
way that has been determined the the
highly insulting flavor to this is is
really there I mean that's it comes
through in many of his writings actually
I just reread this book about a year ago
and I was kind of appalled and it's true
that it was written in another age but
it has the flavor of there are only
certain smart people and everybody else
is lazy and needs to be told what to do
and if you watch management in many of
the Western societies that theme has
made it into a bunch of places but not
all places for example um I worked at 3m
and I never actually noticed this kind
of philosophy and I'm pretty sure the
reason is because 3m processes were big
role goods you know make big rolls of
sandpaper or tape or something like that
and the people who operated the
production equipment had to be extremely
skilled workers in fact the first R&amp;amp;D
um ahead in three I'm the first person
headed up hardy got fired because he
couldn't get along with the production
workers and the production workers knew
everything there was to know about how
to make tape and if the air india guy
didn't wanna listen to him we needed
somebody else in charge of our d--
interestingly enough you'll find in
Toyota a very similar that's the way
that things are manufactured and the
skill in manufacturing this is the
primary focus and things spin out from
there so that's the one best way
somebody figures it out somebody knows
what's the one best way and tells
everybody what to do and you see a lot
of that in some industries but now let's
go to 1920s and this isn't very long
after that and we'll talk about Charles
Allen he was the guy in New Bedford
Massachusetts who started up the whole
concept of industrial training if you
look into the vote tech schools in the
United States you'll find that most of
them had their origins in Massachusetts
with three fellows one of whom was
Charles Allen and his idea of on-the-job
training was that there are people who
really know how to do a job and the way
to get people to learn how to do the job
is have a master train the new people
coming onto the job he said second class
trainers produce second class learners
so you really need experts who know how
to do the job to do training but one
thing that experts may not know how to
do is how to train people so he focused
it how do we train experts to train
people because they know how to do the
job but they don't know how to train so
you had a four-step method now this is
the days of divide every job into a lot
of little bits and there's nothing
totally wrong with that but it wasn't
have experts figure it out it says have
that master craftsmen divide the job
into four steps preparation presentation
application and testing and then train
people how to do it now we have a war
there's a lot of war that triggers stuff
in my story and this particular war was
a war of attrition at sea whoever had
the most ships at the end was the winner
basically and so there needed to be a
lot of ships built in Massachusetts and
so Charles Allen was asked to put
together a training
over him for shipbuilders and he put
together a training program for
shipbuilders by training supervisors how
to train people how to build ships and
in two years 88,000 ship cthe
shipbuilders were trained with a hundred
supervisors learned how to do training
and at the end of the war in fact there
were more ships on in the US than other
side so I guess it worked in any case in
any case he wrote this book it's called
the instructor the man in the job a
handbook for instructions of individual
of industrial and Voula text objects
that he wrote the whole concept of
training people with on-the-job training
it was very different than the
scientific management of the you know
the automotive industries and think
about it a ship is a little bit
different than a car ships are all sort
of one of much more so than cars and so
you needed skilled workers that could
bring their skills to other areas and
now it's the 1930s we're going back to
Germany and we have a concept of got
that drove inferred Terp inferred okay
which is unit command and this is the
German Field Manual from 1933 1934 and
there's some interesting things in here
you can see the history from my multi it
says in Section four lessons in the art
of war can that be exhaustively compiled
in the form of regulations the
principles must be applied in accordance
with the situation good idea
simple actions logically carried out
will lead to the most surely to the
objective the command of an army and a
subordinate units requires leaders
capable of judgment with clear vision
and foresight and the ability to make
independent and decisive decisions at
all levels of the organization an
officer is in every sense a teacher and
a leader the decisive factor despite
technology and weaponry is a value of
the individual soldier the battlefield
requires soldiers who can
and act independently who can make
calculated decisive and daring use of
every situation and to understand that
victory depends upon each individual
okay so you think perhaps of military as
being tell everybody what to do but the
concept of make sure that everybody is
able to think for themselves is what
really works so now we go to another war
lots of words and this is um 1940s and
that is actually IBM kaput kept see
point and the workers they're mostly
women because of course most of the men
are over in Europe or someplace like
that and there's a need for wartime
material to be produced and in that time
women had very little experience in
industrial I mean actually nobody was in
factories until like twenty or thirty
years before that and women didn't work
in factories until there was need for
production and no men to do it so you
had a very inexperienced workforce that
need to be trained adventuring very
rapidly and what did they do they went
and they dust it off that instructor the
man in the job book that had been
written twenty years before by Charles
Allen and they said oh this looks like a
good idea and after a full start they
decided the first thing to do is to
train first line supervisors who should
be masters at their job so you have a
few people that know how to do the job
what you got to do is train the
supervisors how to train how to train
the workers to do the job and it was
divided into three parts job instruction
which is how to train workers basically
break down the job in two parts and
teach each person how to do each part
how to improve the way work is done and
how to treat workers with respect okay
job methods how to improve so it wasn't
teach people how to do things it was
teach them how to do things and then
constantly improve the process and also
teach workers with respect now remember
they're making munitions that haven't
actually ever been made before airplanes
those were kind of new and things like
that and so they had to figure out how
to manufacture
so he had to constantly improve the
process and how to treat workers with
respect now this is was a very
successful printing training program in
fact in this quote here it says without
question the most successful corporate
training program in the history of the
United States about 1.7 million people
were certified and trained at the same
time we had Deming this is a W Edwards
Deming at that time and what he did was
he taught statistical process control
basically defense contractor engineers
and technicians training over 30,000
people these two programs were
extraordinaire like successful in
increasing productivity in the United
States and in Canada basically in North
America and however they were war
programs and when the war was over they
were dropped pretty much except you know
they were moved to countries that seemed
to need them because they didn't have
any infrastructure and these programs
are brought to Germany and especially to
Japan and in Japan they were very
interested in this programs and so both
TWA and SBC went and we're taught in
Japan in the early 1950s so for example
here's the materials from training
within industry it was introduced in
Japan and as I said late 40s and 50s and
all three sections were very well
received but most importantly the job
instruction one how to train workers
through their supervisor how to break
down the job into details and train is
to this day one of the pillars of the
Supervisory training program in Japan
it's a 10-week program where you have a
half a day and then you do the stuff and
at the bottom of the training materials
that we have some another slide I don't
I don't have here it says if the learner
hasn't learned the teacher hasn't taught
so the burden is on the supervisor to
make sure that the people know how to do
the job job methods how to constantly
improve stuff was pretty good but tto
know the guy that invented the Toyota
Production system had a better way to do
that so eventually he had it in
and to this day the improvement on that
is taught in in Toyota too and then here
is Deming he went in 1950s to Japan and
he was kind of annoyed because he got a
no he got ignored in the US after the
war was over and he said it's much more
than statistical process control it's
the whole system so he gave lectures to
the tune of you have to appreciate not
just the piece you're doing but the
entire system you have to understand
variation and Deming when he talked
about variation he said the thing you
have to realize about variation is that
there's two comings there's a stuff you
can't do anything about in the stuff you
can do something about
so there's common cause it's just there
and they're special cause and it's a
good idea to find out if there's a cause
what the cause is and fix it but it's
not a good idea to try to get rid of
variation that's just plain inherent in
the system if you try to do that you
actually are going to make the system
worse and he had a training course I
have a brother-in-law who went to it in
the yeah ladies and he would he would
have somebody like you come up here and
he would say here here's a bag it's got
some marbles in it I only want you to
get white ones out of it and you put
your hand in blind and if you got white
ones he would say you are good and then
he'd have you come up and you would put
your hand and you get a black one and he
would bawl you out and tell you you
should I told you not to pull out any
blacks what do you you know what don't
you understand about that and then I'll
tell you what try again here's some
money now put your hand in and and and
don't pull out any black sis and if you
get only whites you get this money
didn't work okay and the point is that
if variation isn't hearing in the system
no amount of yelling no amount of money
is going to change that you have to
change the system instead he also talked
about the theory of knowledge that is to
use the scientific method not scientific
manage but the scientific method in
order to solve problems think about it
create hypothesis do experiments or
sometimes called plan-do-check-act
you've heard of that
and then psychology when it comes to
people it's not numbers it's pride its
commitment its pride in your work it's
applause it's trust that matters it's
not making sure that numbers are met and
he was very big on that policy too
somehow we seem to have forgotten some
of that stuff anyway
um in the 1950s
another thing was going on in the US and
that was the Cold War another war and
and and you're going to see here that
war tends to bring out good behavior
this was the Polaris Project was one of
the most successful weapons projects in
the US and what it was was a weapons
program that was triggered by a scare
the scare was oh my gosh
Sputnik went up and we're going to get
you know missiles coming at us we had
better put some missiles underwater at
sea in patrol this project was supposed
to take like 10 years 9 years but
everybody was worried so they changed
the schedule and started launching
submarines that could control with
underwater missile launching capability
in three years so they took a nine-year
impossible schedule and made it into
three years schedule it was an amazing
feat and guess where perk came from
you've heard of pert and all of its
derivatives it actually came from the
Polaris program now there's a guy that
evaluated this program because after the
Polaris success its success was
attributed to this wonderful management
technique called pert and so I'm here
Harry
Harvey Sapolsky Desai was asked to do a
sort of a check it all out interview all
of the people and he was allowed to do
an independent summary of what actually
went on in the Polaris Project part was
a management system that rear-admiral
Rayburn thought was just told the whole
world and Congress especially was the
one thing that was going to make this
program so much an assured success that
they didn't have to worry about it and
really what Sapolsky says you
is it was a facade to keep Congress
happy if Congress thought it wasn't
people it was the system that's going to
make it work they would keep funding it
actually in practice it wasn't really
used to manage the program day to day
not for the first four or five years
when they launched a submarine and in
fact the technical officers thought it
was unreliable and the contractors
thought it was relatively worthless
however it became the gold standard
against which we decided that we should
manage projects after that honest and
Sapolsky said why was the Polaris really
successful was it really this management
tracking system or was it something else
and he put in their quality of
leadership was first the technical
director who was levering Smith
maintained control not only over all of
the engineering drawings but also over
the description of success what an
interesting thing so over the time every
iteration which was about eighteen
months to two years he got to define was
success at the end so he decided when he
knew what he could do well we're gonna
define that as success and then that
would be the next goal and they would
meet it because you know he knew they
could so he got control over that and he
also had control over all the interfaces
and he focused everybody on nothing but
get this thing in the water
in fact the very first week two weeks
when he got in signed he said let's see
how can we do this fast you know
somebody's building a submarine down
there and I forget where and it's about
half done he's to tell you what why
don't you take that submarine cut it in
half stretch it out
think it was sixteen feet and put it
back together and we'll figure out how
to put missiles in that 16 feet and he
did that like within two or three weeks
after he got started and yep to this day
that is the standard length of what a
missile submarine carries is 16 feet why
because seem like a good number at time
and he had to have one fast that was
abundant the number of missiles was
because he talked to a lot of the
submarine captains and talked about what
they would be comfortable with and those
decisions were made within the first
month he had a decentralized competitive
organization
had Tim fundamental technologies they
had to invent in a very short time so
what he did was for every technology
every subsystem technology he had three
or four competing vendors competing to
be able to have the honour of putting
that in there now imagine a government
program doing that today kind of
interesting and we call that set based
design in in design in hardware design
that is have multiple options and when
you get to the decision point you choose
the best one which is what he did
emphasis unreliability if there was one
thing that Smith was criticized for it
was being too much of a fanatic about
testing those of you who knew agile hmm
so that was his big criticism and then
everybody was really engaged in making
this happen
contractors went out to and had meals
with you know government people that
wouldn't be allowed today either but it
was then and that's those are the
reasons why it was successful so really
good kinds of things that we talked
about in lean product development were
involved in making this successful now
we go to the 60s so we're the next
decade and we have the Toyota Production
system suddenly coming on the world it
actually had been going since the late
50s and here is th e oh no who was
involved in making this thing work
inside of Toyota it's very
counterintuitive it seems okay today
kind of makes sense but you know when I
was in a manufacturing plant in the
early 80s it did not seem very sensible
to us we thought they were nuts and so
did most of the people in Toyota and
even the people he managed so you know
for the longest time they didn't call it
the Toyota Production system they taught
called it the Ono system unit because I
figured if it failed it was his system
and and and but he kept getting more and
more responsibility and as more people
reported to him they kind of had to
adopt it and after a while discovered it
actually worked as honks
counterintuitive as is and so he has a
system that's fundamentally about
just-in-time flow which in our plant we
thought was nuts but actually it worked
for us too
and stop the line culture don't build in
anything that has if you find in there
you stop and fix it but not only that if
you are building something that might
have defects you need to put in place a
mechanism to find the defects the moment
they get injected and stop everything
and fix them don't find them later find
them right on the front so mistake
proofing your manufacturing line and you
can think of that as mistake proofing in
your code with a test structure right
away as soon as you do something wrong
in the keyboard I did too when I was
programming you have a mechanism to run
it against something to merge it with
other code find out if something's wrong
if it is you fix it no problem you just
did it in last 10 minutes you come back
10 weeks later and find out something's
wrong as much bigger problem so that
stopped the line culture mistake grupa
system so errors cannot get injected and
lastly relentless improvement I'll tell
you a little more about that in a minute
so his book was this book here which was
written in 78 but it didn't become
available in English until 88 I wish I
could have read it in our plants in the
early 1980s because it really would have
helped us we had a book it was not very
good but it helped I mean it was good
but it was not very well translated into
English those detailed industrial
engineering stuff by shigeo shingo but
it was our Bible and figuring out how to
do just in time in our plant this book
is really good and even today it's good
it's a wonderful book to read in any
wrote another book which was published
in 1982 it was translated then and then
recently retranslated into English in
2007 I just going to read you one thing
because I have here relentless
improvement learning through
experimentation which is one of the
pillars of the Toyota way today and he
didn't write much about it in his book
but he did write about it in the
workplace management so for example this
is just one quick example out of that
book he said um standard work no you all
heard of standard work do things one way
okay
he said when creating standard work it's
going to be difficult it's establish a
standard if you are trying to achieve
the
best way and we're going back to the
scientific mini there's one best way sis
now there's not a best way this is a big
mistake what you really want to do is a
document exactly what you're doing now
if you make it better that's Kaizen that
means change for the better and if not
and you establish the best possible way
there's no motivation for Kaizen so the
idea is you don't want to be perfect
otherwise nobody gets to improve it
that's why one way of motivating people
to do Kaizen is to create a poor
standard interesting concept so remember
the goal here is not to have the best
way of doing things it's to motivate
people to constantly improve the way
things are done don't make it too bad
okay without some standard you can't say
we made it better because there's
nothing to compare it to so you have to
have a credit standard for comparison
and then you take that standard and if
the work is not easy to perform you give
many suggestions and do this Kaizen and
the whole idea is to have all the people
that are doing the work constantly
improve it that's Kaizen so that is his
constant improvement is much more
important than telling people the right
way and there was this feeling and I
recognized it because we also had it in
our plan that only people who really
knew how to do the job where people who
were doing the job so those are the
people who figure out how to do the job
it's true that a supervisor needs to
train new people but it's also true that
the people doing the work are the ones
were the problems the issues and stuff
like that and they're the ones who
should be constantly improving it so in
the 1970s we had Theory X and Theory Z
you've heard of those okay
Theory X most people dislike work and
don't give their best efforts at their
job therefore people must be encouraged
with financial incentives or threats to
work towards organizational and
objectives generally people would rather
avoid responsibility and prefer people
to tell them what to do now there are
plenty of people that actually believe
this I don't happen to be one of them I
haven't observed it to be true but there
are people who kind of
you can tell from their behavior that
they think this and then there are
course they don't tend to be the people
that are being directed they tend to be
the people that are doing the direct and
then there's Theory Z and Series II
became popular when people discovered
that what was going on in Japan was
actually more successful meant what was
going on in the US and hmm let's see
what's this all about so there was a
book even written by theory Z Seri X
came from McGregor and theories efj came
from ot there was a theory why to but
I'll skip that and theory Z says on the
contrary people are motivated by the
satisfaction of doing a good job the
enjoyment of cooperating with others and
being recognized by them in the
satisfaction of using one's talents to
the fullest fundamental difference in
perception what motivates people and
this is became the basis of what was
going on in fact you can see this in a
book for example by Ishikawa how many
have heard of Ishikawa diagrams their
cause and effect diagrams okay well
those of you who haven't they're pretty
good anyway this is that Tama Ishikawa
and he wrote the book what is total
quality control and this is in um it was
in the I think it was in the early 70s
because otherwise I wouldn't have it on
the slide right okay and so he was from
the 50s a a very strong leader of the
quality movement in Japan which really
was what was pattered what the quality
movement moving to the u.s. in the early
80s was patterned done and Ishikawa
proves in many of his writings that this
theory Z is the fundamental perception
of what that whole told quality movement
was built on he said in the book the
fundamental principle of successful
management is to allow subordinates to
make full use of their ability sounds a
little bit more like the you know the
the war manual than the scientific
management everyone who is connected
with the company must be able to feel
comfortable and happy with the company
and make use of his capabilities to
realize his potential a lot in his
writings about people must be able to
realize their full potential
this management's job to set up the
situation so that they can top managers
and middle managers must be bold enough
to delegate as much authority as
possible and that is the way to
establish respect for Humanity as your
management philosophy now this is not a
delegate delegation so you can assign
blame you know back to trainwreck
management this is a delegation so
people can work to their full potential
and that's their easy so you know I have
a book on my shelf that I bought in
about nineteen you know late 1970s and
it was maybe I think it was early part
of 80s called theories II management and
it was all about how you know some
people might think this but this is what
actually really works I was lucky enough
to be in the company where theories II
was kind of the philosophy anyway so
that was very handy and just about that
time I had been working in print in
process control and I did a process
monitoring system for videotape
manufacturing and my system went into a
plant about 60 or 70 miles from where we
lived and they invited me to come out
and be the IT manager in the plants so
I'd never been a manager before and it
was a little scary because you know I
read books that say management's
different than being a technical person
and I was really good technical person
and I had no qualify to be any good at a
manager but I thought I'd give it a try
and it was kind of fun actually um we
went to the plant I went to the plant
and my boss Dave dolger who was a plant
manager said so you you own
responsibility for systems now systems
are not just computers there anything
that makes things work around this place
and I actually spent four years taking
computers out of the plant because we
had um this thing at that time you know
computers had just learned how to do
scheduling and they were used first and
foremost to schedule manufacturing
plants this thing called MRP material
requirements planning so back in those
days there was MRP there were MRP
systems and they said if you would just
do what the MRP system tells you to do
exactly then your plant will be perfect
and if you're not perfect then you're
just not trying hard enough
now our plant at that point packed out
about for every week we'd schedule what
we wanted to do and we'd look ahead and
all about 60% of our weekly plant you
just weren't trying hard enough right
60% of plants and the other problem we
had was that our competition started
selling video cassettes which is what we
made for a whole lot less money than we
could make them for so this was really
serious we weren't actually we're doing
all the right things according to the
book and they were doing stuff in Japan
it was so much better that they we
thought they were dumping nope they were
making stuff better
they were makin stuff higher quality
than us and they were getting it over to
us and selling it at less than we could
make it for and they were making money
and thinkin whoa either we got a closes
planet or we got to do something like
dramatically different we decided that
we didn't believe in this at first we
didn't believe in this thing called
just-in-time
but you know the more we studied it the
more we thought well it seems to be
what's working for them as much as it
doesn't make sense
so we there was a small Justin type
movement in the u.s. there weren't any
real consultants maybe one or two there
was a little tiny group this is sort of
like agile software development in 1999
right and so we went and we learned
about it and we gave it a try because it
was that or close the plant and what we
did was we took a conference table about
like this big we laid out paper we drew
all of our processes on it and then
garius being the materials Control
Manager produced a weekly pack out and
then we had coffee cups and in the
coffee cups we had as you can see little
sticks and this guy each coffee cup was
a cartridge a cart a video cassette say
a thousand video cassettes stacked on a
cart and and that said the stick here
said this is you know t120 black or
two-and-twenty red this what kind of
video cassette what color
how many minutes that sort of thing and
so we pretended that those were carts
and we had some carts ready to pack out
and what we did was we simulated all no
computer systems all we did was we had a
pack out we started with some inventory
we started packing out and when we used
one of those cups we would take the
stick and we bring it down to the next
process on the table and we say okay
process make that and then we would
simulate having that process make some
more of that and see what we would need
to do to be able to pack out so we
simulated a pull system and after a few
hours it kind of worked so we said okay
this is cool but there were three of us
and this is a plant with a thousand
people and a lot of complicated
processes all scheduled by my computers
and so we decided we better get the
general managers to come in and take a
look and so the next Saturday the
general managers came in to take a look
at this and the five of us simulated
this and they said might work seems like
pretty interesting concept but you know
we're just managers we can't make this
happen and remember there is no II's
around there's no consultants to help us
so we have to figure this out for
ourselves and so the general manager
said we better call in the general
supervisors because they could help us
so then two weeks later the general
supervisors came in on Saturday and we
spent all day doing this coffee cup
simulation and the thing with these
dozen or so people we were able to do a
much more detailed simulation and it
kept locking up after like 24 to 48
hours and so we changed the rules we
change those sorts of stuff went to
lunch had a big break came back change
some more rules and suddenly we got it
right we got the idea of level loading
and we were able to simulate one full
week of pack out with no lockup yes so
we thought wow this is pretty cool
so the general supervisor said yeah but
you know like we can't make this happen
there's a lot of detail work here we
better get the supervisors involved so
then the general managers gym
supervisors are shift supervisors all
walk through the simulation on the three
shifts because we were three three
shifts a day six days a week and they
all walk through it and they said oh
this is you know kind of interesting it
might work actually but we're just you
know we're just the bosses around here
and there's a lot of work so we better
show this to all
all the shift workers so everybody that
was involved which is like 90% of the
plant went through this simulation and
then the shift supervisors with their
teams on their shifts figured out with
the up the you know opposing chefs how
to make it work in their area how to put
the little cards in what things were
going to happen because remember all my
computers are going to get turned off
one day one day because we couldn't
figure out how to phase it in had to be
cold turkey and one weekend we did we
turned off the computers and we printed
out the week's pack out and we sent it
to packing and held a rest okay and by
the end of that week guess what our pack
out percentage was 95% now remember
we've never done much better than 60 or
65% trying this MRP thing forever it
just couldn't be done and suddenly we
started a pull system and while we could
pack out basically everything in one at
every single week
pull systems do that for you you know
and if you try it in any other kind of
schedule you'll see the same thing but
that's not the idea the lesson is that
we couldn't have done this without
engaging all of the people in the plant
to figure out how to make it happen why
did we get 95 percent because guess who
figured out how to make it work wasn't
some you know people coming in from
outside say and you put this here and
put this here it was the shift
supervisors puzzling through with their
shifts and the people next to them how
they were going to make it work
something goes wrong guess what people
who have to deal with the problems have
already simulated that kind of know what
to do make some adaptations figure it
out and that's why it worked because the
people doing the processes design their
own processes so it wasn't like we went
to the people in the plant and said oh
dear we are in bad trouble what do you
think we should do that doesn't what we
did we said we're in bad trouble we have
a plan we're pretty sure that this is
going to make things better we're not
sure how much but we think it's worth a
shot here's the general idea and we'll
show you with a simulation in detail
give you all the help you need to work
it up but in the end you
to figure it out and make it work
yourself so there was a lot of
leadership from the management team but
in the end the details were worked out
by the people on the floor and that's
kind of my vision of leadership in
addition to the fact that I also got a
interesting taste in my mouth as far as
Outsiders coming in and telling people
how to do stuff I'm pretty convinced
that if we had a bunch of outsiders
coming in and telling us how to do stuff
we wouldn't have been successful
anywhere near as successful as us
puzzlin this out figuring it out banging
her heads against the wall getting
everybody involved in admittedly uh you
know it was a close the plant or figure
it out situation so it's not like we had
a choice but it was everybody getting
engaged in figuring out how to make it
work
so um that was the result and the
employee said it was the best thing that
ever happened in the plant so this if
Japan can't why can't we that's up there
because there was a video in the early
1980s about Japan being so good all of a
sudden when they used to you know before
this Japan was known for making cheap
junk do anybody remember those days when
Japan was cheap junk okay well didn't
happen at about nineteen late 1970s at
kinda changed around and by 1980 it was
huh why can't we do that and this video
was made with Deming unit and Deming got
rediscovered and from 1980 until 1993
when he died and by the way he was born
in 1900 so he got rediscovered when he
was 80 worked until he was 93 and
basically kind of turned Ford around and
lots of other people and many of the
things that you read up from him came
from that that time now let's talk about
the 1990s actually in the 1990s I was
not in computers I was working in
product development in 3m which is fun
thing to do because 3m kind of does new
product development for a living I still
think that google has copied a lot of 3m
ideas like our 15% time and things like
that but you know so I kind of get some
of those ideas and I think highly of
Google because I kind of thought
Schramm and I was a lot of similar
culture there but in the 1990s I was
doing product development with plastics
not not well I had some with embedded
software and some with plastics and I
was what I'll show you later product
champion most of the time and so what
was going on and software at that time
was kind of hidden from me but we had
this thing called waterfall as Jack cook
told you I didn't hear about till the
end of the decade you've seen that yeah
ok and then there was this process
maturity model yeah we saw that too I
learned about this one in 1999 actually
us and then we had you know project
management and all sorts of flavors good
old pert coming back to haunt everybody
and the thing I think about this in
particular is that having moved from a
scheduling system that was push to a
pull system and seeing the difference I
never believed that if you guys would
only try harder to meet your project
deadlines you know it all would be
perfect probably you get 60% performance
against plan on a week-to-week basis
anything that's scheduled at a detail
level that's pretty much what you get
and if you switch to a pull system
instead you'll probably do a whole lot
better so um there's this pulse push
system here and then there is a Six
Sigma and I never was too much involve
this 3 ohm got involved in that after I
left and so there was lots of process ok
in fact there were some companies they
still some of them exist which think
that process is going to solve all of
our problems if you just have a standard
process anybody can do it everybody in
the company should have the same process
so if they're doing the same thing
should be the standard across the
company interesting ideas it's not like
processes wrong because you know we had
a lot of process improvement we had to
constantly do in our plant but making it
the be-all and end-all and so we can
have fun gerbil people and so that
everybody does exactly the same thing
means forget process improvement forget
constantly having new ideas from people
forget people working to their maximum
of their
seneschal so I want to tell you about
plank roads just because I want to tell
you about plank roads this is the plank
road and it's in the mid-1980s 1840s to
1850s you ever hear about plank roads in
the u.s. in Milwaukee where I live we
have this road called Watertown Plank
Road goes to Watertown so what happened
was railroads came into the country
about this time you saw it at the
beginning and there was a massive boom
in plank road construction because they
wanted to get stuff from the farm to the
city where the railroad station was and
so there wasn't a whole lot of money
around so they thought we start up these
little businesses where people would pay
to have this plank road put in and get a
lot of investors and it would be paid
for with tolls the tolls were generally
regulated by the state so instead of
building rows the state just had these
these laws for you know one cent a mile
or something like that and they were
amazingly successful you know you find
this hard to believe because you haven't
ever seen one but actually there were
immediate positive results far superior
to mud eroded roads dramatic decrease in
travel time expand much expanded roll
market so they were very very successful
and therefore well they got built all
over the country you can look in the
south east you can look in the Midwest
you can look all across New York and
you're going to find that huge numbers
of plank roads were built but there was
a problem the investment period was 10
years for pay off that's what it was
sold as turns out after something like
four years they started to die they you
know woodrats in' four years later every
single plank road within four years
after was built had to have serious
maintenance in fact which was less than
half the projected life screen and
annual cluster maintenance were for
instance twenty to thirty percent of the
initial cost and guess what that money
didn't exist it hadn't even pay back its
initial investment so stuff would rot
out and they would take out the wood and
putting gravel and in the end all the
plank rows ended up becoming gravel
roads but when they were gravel they
were no longer toll roads and they
basically got maintained by the state so
that's the story of plank roads they
were amazingly successful at first but
they as Jim source key says in the
wisdom of clouds the first plank roads
were huge success people looking for a
solution to the road problem found a
ready-made one at hand as more people
built plank roads their legitimacy
became more entrenched and the desire to
consider alternate solutions shrink it
was years before the fundamental
weakness of the plank roads that they
didn't last long enough became obvious
okay it's sort of like for every problem
there is a solution that is fast cheap
and wrong and this is one of those and
so to go back to our process chart I
think for every problem there is a
solution that is quick cheap and wrong
and heavy processes happen to be in that
category in my view just a quick this
isn't actually fair but I thought I
wouldn't pick on the software processes
but there is this a interesting thing
that was reported in Fortune 5 in
Fortune magazine in July a 58 large
companies that have announced Six Sigma
programs 91% have trailed the SP ever
since well anyway what really makes
organizations work is not one standard
process and fungible people that do
exactly what's written down that's going
back to tailor that doesn't work least
not in my experience so let's look at
organizations that are what I'm going to
call high reliability organizations that
is organizations where mistake is a
matter of life and death for example
fire fighters nuclear power points power
grid dispatching centers hospital
emergency rooms air traffic control
aircraft carriers those kinds of places
think about an aircraft carrier I mean
the planes don't have a lot of place to
land and a lot of place to take off and
there's huge amounts of potential for
accident and they're going to be fatal
if they happen most of the time
high reliability organizations have more
than their fair share of unexpected
events and they persistently have less
than their fair share of accidents and
they really relate to this because our
plant worked in almost exclusively
highly explosive chemicals that's
basically what you know happens in our
plants when I did computer control
systems I had to put my computers in
class one group do you enclosures those
of you have been in explosion
environments know that that means that
no spray you know it's got pressure out
so that no spark can get so that no
spark from the compute pressure in so no
spark can get up kind of thing and so in
our plant actually in all three on labs
all labs have an explosion wall case you
know whatever blows up in there just
will collapse out happened once or twice
ah we had we had a plant - we had a fire
once and the plant manager was really
pleased it was in our coating area
lasted about 15 minutes this is the
first time in the plant that a woman
caused the fire a woman found it in a
woman put it out and because he was
proud of that but anyway we had we had
an occasional disaster - and I was
involved in a start-up at the Oklahoma
City plant where I was doing a start-up
I was sitting in the control room and
the project manager was there and the
alarms went off and he looked I looked
at him he says they're just testing the
alarms today and then all of a sudden
that guy got up and shut out of the room
and I says he just testing sure and and
they weren't so I went out and here's
this cloud of smoke what is it it's co2
now co2 sits in all three implants by
the coder head because if there's a fire
that's what you got to do is suppress it
immediately with co2 but if you're a
person and you get suppressed with co2
you're going to also get suppressed so
this is not a good thing and this is a
startup startups are the most dangerous
time in any kind of an environment and
here was this huge cloud of co2 question
is was the area clear now fortunately
for everybody the plant engineer
happened to be at the co2 room door when
this happened and he was smart enough
and he always knew exactly what to do
because he lived in that
and he cleared the area and by the time
the project manager got down there the
plant engineer had everything under
control
knew that the area is clear but it was
scary because as you know when you get
involved in life critical situations you
have a huge emphasis on safety in our
plant we had somebody did nothing but
make sure everybody understood safety
the common characteristic of these kinds
of organizations is mindfulness this is
a very interesting book about these
kinds of organizations by a sea wife
yeah why can't your cliff and it's
called managing the unexpected sharing
high performance in an age of complexity
and what they say is that in these kinds
of things nuclear power plants aircraft
carriers that sort of thing mindfulness
is the thing that makes things work is
the thing that you have to have
throughout the culture of your
organization in order to have high
reliability what is that
it's preoccupation with failure which
sounds strange why are we preoccupied
with failure think about it
you have to always expect that
something's going to go wrong and always
be prepared for it there is none of this
life is good just ignore all those
little problems you can't ignore issues
you never ignore issues you make sure
that you're always aware that something
unexpected could happen and you're
prepared for it because it can anything
that can go wrong will eventually go
wrong you know if you're building
something that's going to be in a
transaction processing environment
someday in your code and you say well
that'll happen once in a million or once
in two million times you know it's going
to happen someday it's going to bring
some system down and it's going to cost
one whole lot of money if that
transaction system gets tied up for an
hour to a lot more than it would cost
you to pay attention to it on front
reluctance to simplify the fact is we
live in a complex unpredictable world
and standard procedures cannot replace
thinking people so you will not you will
find oh like I went to an airport and it
was very interesting I was watching
driver and he had a you know a luggage
cart behind him and he got out of the
luggage cart and he seemed to be totally
absent-minded as he walked at the front
of the luggage cart took these two
triangles that were sitting there put
one by each wheel and they went off and
did whatever it was so routine I'm sure
he didn't think if he didn't look like
he was thinking about what he was doing
but to him stopping a car meant chucking
the wheels there was no question that
just like was so automatic it happened
you could see how automatic his
reactions were that's what happens here
you you have standard procedures you
must check the wheels but you also have
everybody paying attention to make sure
that that doesn't that that happens
sensitivity operations what you really
have to do is be attentive to the front
line where the work gets done and it's
called in in to Toyota Production system
go to the gemba go where things work and
an aircraft carrier the the head of the
I don't forget which go to Admiral will
spend time on the deck because that's
the only place you can really feel
what's happening commitment to
resilience you have to take every single
smallest incident that happens and deal
with it stop investigate find the first
root cause and fix it and also you have
to have deference to expertise doesn't
matter if you're the most senior guy in
the ship the experts are the ones who
really understand the technology and how
to do the detail stuff so you use
mission command not detail command
I'm going to talk about mission command
versus detail command later so you just
have to remember that for a man oh no
its next mission command versus detail
come in gah
okay so this is straight out of the
Armed Forces command and control book
scald mission command command forces and
it's about what constitutes command and
control in the US Armed Forces and by
the way it's an interesting book it
doesn't have it doesn't have a copyright
it says please use this however you want
so that's why I get to copy it and it
defines very clearly there's mission
command and detail command and mission
command if you look at it assumes that
war or whatever it is you're doing up an
economic war you name it is if you're in
detail command deterministic and
predictable but if you want mission
command what if war is probabilistic and
unpredictable then maybe you have a
different approach it accepts mission
command that there is disorder there is
uncertainty and therefore it tends to
lead to decentralization spontaneity
informality loose rein self-discipline
initiative cooperation acceptable
decisions faster rather than optimal
decisions later Inc we sit over here and
so the kind of leadership you need is
there now that's command and control so
I don't like the term command and
control is bad because people tend to
think the command and control means
detailed command but in army manuals
that's not actually what it means at all
it means both of these and when you have
this kind of an environment over here
which is all of these probabilistic and
other things then you want mission
command versus detailed command so where
does software fit in I think it fits
over here just like just like those high
reliability organizations fit over there
so now where does software fit in um
when I was at 3m I was what with that
last decade in the 90s I was what was
called a product champion and I'm going
to call it for purposes of now a product
leader or at Toyota this person would be
called a chief engineer so when you're
developing a product it is really
important for the organization to make
sure that they get the right thing they
get what people really want and and I
was a very big advocate and I still am
of making sure that when people are
working in a product they talk to
potential customers they walk in their
shoes they understand them but when push
comes to shove it you don't leave
important decisions up to a vote
somebody takes the responsibility for
making the ultimate decisions or maybe
you can have a committee vote but if the
committee votes you know then who's
responsible
or maybe you can have a marketing person
say oh all of our competitors are doing
this maybe we ought to do the same thing
but you know that's not going to give
you the next generation product either
so instead when you need to and have
somebody that really is deciding what a
product wants to be this is a leader not
somebody that tells everybody what to do
but somebody has a vision an act Toyota
and actually at 3m the chief and the the
champion was exactly very similar
responsible for business success and it
was okay to have failures too because if
you didn't have a few failures you
weren't trying which probably sounds
familiar at Google right
don't have a few failures you're not
trying but you got a half also
responsible for business success
develops deep customer understanding so
this this product leader is responsible
to really understand customers and bring
the team out to understand customers
develops the product concept but Note
creates the high level systems design
the chief engineer at Toyota is one of
the most skilled technical people in the
company highly skilled engineer at 3m
the product champion was 95 or 98
percent of the time a highly skilled
technical person not from marketing
didn't mean you didn't get marketing
input but the vision had to marry the
available technology with the market
need and that was generally done through
the eyes of somebody who really got the
technology and then understood the
market and that is also the same concept
that Toyota has with their chief
engineer sets the schedule that's
interesting I can talk more about that
later if we have time if you ask
questions but the chief engineer sets
the schedule decides product concept to
release is going to be 15 months it's
the major milestones and that's what
happens understands what the customers
will value and conveys this to the
engineers making the day-to-day
trade-offs by walking around and talking
to them by making sure they understand
the metaphor of what you're trying to
accomplish and this is important the
chief engineer has deep knowledge of the
technical details not every technical
detail but certainly is a highly
competent technical person
arbitrates trade-offs when necessary and
defends the vision and what is the chief
engineer or the practical you're
defending the vision against or from
well then we have other people here in a
classic matrix organization anyway you
have another kind of leader this is what
we would call a department leader
functional leader at 3m so you have a
product development process of some sort
and the end is to create not just a
product but a value stream that brings
in some money somehow and you have
somebody who has a vision and
understands technical opportunities and
really understands the market and knows
how to create some outcomes valued by
customers so that you can get some money
in and then you have a development team
that works and the important thing here
is these technical people that are
developing the product they're also
learning stuff and one of the things in
any product development process is that
you're not just developing a product you
are developing knowledge that will be
used in future products and that has to
be captured or you just relearn it you
dump it on the ground so you have useful
knowledge where does it go and like in
my product for example I was working in
light fibre and we had a lot of optics
and I'm mathematician I got the optics
but we had a lot of chemistry and I'm
actually not a chemist so we also
created a lot of chemical inventions and
we had to have places for that to be
have a home so here is where somebody
who protects the knowledge of a
particular technical area will come in
and create functional expertise whether
it's how do we do user interaction
design how do we do security how do we
do chemistry whatever or in our case it
was how do we do micro structured
surfaces how do we do ultra pure
plastics you know detailed how do we do
a specific area of chemistry so I had
access to like some of the best people
in the world in the chemistry
environment in the areas that I was
working in and that's because they had a
functional home where they had their
equipment their material their their
processes and they could do
Aronson bring it into the product so the
product leader and then the functional
leaders and then what happens here is as
these functional people with deep
knowledge get assigned into teams they
bring good decisions integration
thinking innovation comes from this deep
technical knowledge brought to bear on a
new product that people are trying to
develop so that matrix of somebody
leading the product and somebody
understanding the underlying
technologies is where I'm thinking about
in product development in general and
certainly even in software development a
an idea of leadership this kind of
leadership of the product and leadership
of the technical expertise so I'll look
at it this way when you have a really
important brilliant product you need to
understand you need to have somebody
that really understands the market that
has business responsibilities customer
understanding overall planning anyway
trade offs and you need to have
technical leadership you need an
architecture you need some technical
guidance on trade offs and integration
and stuff like that and that's what I
call the product leader product leader
can be one or two people if it's two
people however into it for example
always does this with two people they
have a brand manager up top and they're
very good at that because they're
history you know they were founded by
Steve cook who's a brand you know
Procter &amp;amp; Gamble brand manager graduate
and then they have a technical leader
and these two joined-at-the-hip
working closely together direct the
product she can do this with two or one
but my observation is brilliant products
have both some way to understand the
market and understand timing in some way
to understand the underlying technical
capabilities married in the head of very
you know one or two people which then
bring in a technical team but you need
one other kind of thing you need let's
go back to the training within industry
supervisors job is to act as a teacher
make sure people who are new know how to
do things solve problem
and set standards constantly improve and
make sure that everybody that's there is
assigned into jobs and career paths
where they can reach their full
potential somebody that's taking care of
people and so somehow that role and
these roles become my vision of the
important leadership roles in any
development organization whether it's
software or whatever now we have some
other people we see around we see
process leaders okay and if you have a
new process it doesn't hurt to have
process coaches but over time that needs
to become embedded in the organization
and become the job of the supervisor
line manager as opposed to the other way
around and we have these people that
call project leaders worried about
funding and scheduling and tracking we
actually didn't have project management
as a valid title in 3m until the mid to
late 90s because we had products but we
didn't really have projects okay so the
idea here is that if you have overall
release planning with people able to
meet the schedule based on you know
milestones that they meet then that is
something that can be assumed into that
job so any questions so far
none I got sort of yeah go ahead
probably go myself
yourself we're consultants
well you know I actually told you that
already oh you want to know where
Consultants fit into this picture you
know at 3m you didn't have consultants
unless you needed help and your goal in
life was not to need help okay so and
remember in our plant I I think I
mentioned the strong bias against
depending upon consultants and so I see
consultants as teachers seeding ideas
and getting people on aligned on the
same thinking process so that the
management team can get their act
together and head together and figure
out in detail what it takes to move
forward okay so lots of I lots of things
about ideas but not going in and solving
the company's problems the company has
to solve its own problems so new ideas
new ways of thinking about things new
ways of thinking about how to aligns
processes we had a we did have a
consultant come in to our point actually
he was there for a day looked around the
plant and at the end of the day he said
you ought to go see the Nabisco Factory
in Chicago I mean we were in you know
Hutchinson Minnesota's a long ways but I
used to work in Chicago and I remember
them in the visco factory is they make
cookies you know what you make isn't
much different than cookies but cookies
have to be made and got into shelves and
sold and in people's house and eaten all
in a week it's really fast those food
companies they have this problem solved
you ought to figure out how they do it
that was like golden information it
never occurred to me until that time
that there were companies that had been
doing this for like decades is
just-in-time thing and it was entirely
possible if you had perishable items and
in fact if you look at Missouri which
does very rapid replenishment of
clothing in fashion stores they treat
clothing like perishable food and in
they do
so the idea is don't figure out what's
going to be bought constantly replenish
and rapidly make and move stuff into the
market get it bought and get it used and
in a very very short cycle time that's
really about all I remember he told us
but it was very interesting very good
idea
very good mental model for us it made
the whole thing seem possible
oh maybe those guys in Japan weren't so
nuts actually if they could do it in a
bisque oh surely we were smart enough to
do it too that's what we figured we were
young and we were kind of foolish but we
were actually also quite successful so
um consultants can see ideas but in the
end the company has to figure out how to
solve its problems and pretty much I
look at a management team that has you
know close responsibility for the lives
of maybe you know few hundred people
getting a line and thinking alike and
figuring out how to change that world
and that kind of group of 500 thousand
people with you know a group of
management that is you know eight or ten
that can talk to each other not 50 that
kind of group can make dramatic changes
fast if you're talking about three or
four thousand people that need to be
changed I'm thinking yeah I don't think
so so so I don't try to go there um so
that's um and I have this bias because I
really do not spend my life being a
consultant I spent my life in a as a
manager in a large corporation in which
if you had to have a consultant you
weren't really doing your job and I have
that bias to this day although they do
have some good roles
things that were sort of camp processes
that were replicable in an Operations
environment or in any business apart we
used to really rely on them for more an
objection of an external perspective we
fit here yep makes sense
a really good idea especially any
process which anybody in your industry
can do already okay so if you want them
to look at your you know precious
proprietary things probably not but if
you there's a really good process that
everybody in your industry has to do and
you're not doing it as well as the
others you better just figure out how
everybody else is doing it and either
buy it out or or bring it in makes a lot
of sense so you definitely want to make
sure that on the stuff that doesn't
really matter you were at least equal to
everybody else in your industry don't
even try to be better than what you
really want is what are those few things
where if you're better it's going to
matter to your market and those are not
where you want the consultants because
once you teach the consultants how to do
your core important things right you
know they can sell it to somebody else
but yeah that's another good spot for
consultants is standard processes that
must happen correctly within any kind of
industry you have no business doing it
worse than anybody else okay once that's
known in the industry how to do stuff I
remember I was a as a process control
engineer one of the things I did was
evaluate these computer screens that
were used to control processes and
actually at least in my opinion and I
biased and have a memory under mine to
be quite right but as I recall the TDC
2000 or 3000 the Honeywell screen set
the standard for user interaction and
process control design and then I went
out to all the other companies that have
process control systems and anybody that
didn't look at what Honeywell is doing
and invented their own user interaction
screen they just you know they they
couldn't they couldn't come close and I
couldn't really have a lot of respect
for the ones that didn't recognize the
standards been set just go follow it
instead of trying to invent your own
thing because you're probably not going
to come up with anything better so
there's areas where you definitely
should be seeing what everybody else
does and either buying in it or having
helped make it happen and I'm not even
saying anything wrong about Six Sigma
because in our plant if
have really high discipline and good
processes we certainly weren't going to
be able to solve our problem in you know
capture the market and we did we changed
the whole plans around we dropped the
prices dramatically we had very standard
processes but they were all devised by
the people and the quality program in
the Six Sigma programs have many many
things in common so you know nothing
against that that's actually why I
picked that one is because I think it
has a huge amount of good stuff as long
as you don't think it's going to save
your company because it isn't the people
I wasn't mine I was just doing a funny
quote there mm-hmm well I'm not gonna
chase down that path how about that any
more questions yes so the marketing
leader has to have access to deep
technical and market not too deep
marketing knowledge not have it so let's
take the case of first of all I won't
answer your second question for a minute
but example is the Lexus when Toyota
decided to do they decided that they
were in a cheap car market and they're
their buyers were going up and getting
more money and they better have a luxury
car so that was a decision by eg Toyota
who pretty much said we need to go this
way
and they tapped a very senior marketing
executive from the US to figure out how
to sell the car because it was a u.s.
car and he wrote a book about it and he
said in that book that the hardest thing
he had to do was go back and tell eg
Toyota that the car could not have the
Toyota name had to have a different
brand and because it would have the
wrong image now the chief engineer was
not figuring out what kind of image the
Lexus had to have in the US was not
figuring out that it had to have a new
distribution market but the chief
engineer was responsible to make sure
that that was thought of and that that
happened in the same amount of time
frame is
everything else so while the he was
doing all of this marketing
investigation he was also going to Japan
talking to the chief engineer and the
team like that so he had access to stuff
and understood that entirely new
distribution market distribution system
had to be set up in time for the
introduction of the car and while we're
at it they also had to build complete
new manufacturing facility because the
tolerances on the car were much tighter
than any existing process equipment so
the chief engineer had to know that he
had to build a Bell Ustream new
manufacturing capability complete new
distribution system and a car and
synchronize it now one person didn't do
that all by themselves but they knew
that it had to happen and heads you know
plenty of help to make the things that
they didn't have expertise in happened
so that's the one person can't do it off
but in the end somebody ends up being
responsible and in Toyota and in 3m it
usually starts out anyway with new
products being a technical person that
has the vision of the technology in the
market as opposed to the other way
around so where do these people come
from pins on the company depends on if
your company values them they tend to
actually grow so in 3m we actually have
a lot of trouble finding product
champions because people love to be on
these teams it was the best job in the
company everybody aspired to be a
product champion you could watch them I
work for I would provide your apeldoorn
he invented the overhead projector and
he brought into the company billions of
dollars of micro structured surface
business was an amazing guy and you know
just to work for him was amazing and he
taught me a lot and I tried to pass it
on to other people you don't have a few
to seed and you don't respect the job
you won't have the people but it's
actually a really fun job and when it's
there people will find their way into it
that are good we had a talk two weeks
ago at the lean product and process
development conference in Denver and
this was a talk by somebody from the GE
medical imaging system and he was
talking about how they decided they were
going to have product managers wing to
wing responsibilities for a product and
they had
people like that so they did their best
shot of assigning them and then they
created training lots of help a product
leader council so they could get
together and help each other out plenty
of guidance but they first decided they
really had to have this wing to wing
ownership responsibilities so it's not
people happen by magic but you can if
you decide this is important find and
grow the people to make it happen but
you have to respect and honor them it
has to be a really the best well what I
think that's job in a company more
questions yeah service right so they
don't necessarily have a business
knowledge to represent a particular
business function and business unit
James potentially is market leader in
your engine right where I see you
technically helped well but go ahead
yeah go ahead go ahead
you're developing your technical group
may be an architect project manager or
business analyst please more of that
technical leader board mmm-hmm so when
you start saying you have a product
leader here and just best job it's out
there you see will see as that those
individuals from the
so IT is an interesting situation
because it's a service organization into
an organization then provides products
into the market so you're like a layer
removed from where the money is and I've
seen some interesting stuff from
McKinsey about how the best way to run
in a situation like that is to create a
product manager role inside of IT and
not believe everything that the business
does but actually figure out what they
help them to figure out what they really
need in order to be profitable because
you know in order to get productivity
out of your services because if you just
do everything they say and it's one
person but if they get it wrong and how
are you walking in their shoes and
really understanding how it works and so
if one model is to be actually a product
company and sell your products into the
rest of the company there are other
models too but it's a struggle in that
particular situation to figure out where
the real ownership is because you are
one level removed from where the real
value is and you need to get close to
the value in order to have the vision of
what you're trying to do you remember
that report it's about it's about banks
for example in Spain and in Europe and
it's about three or four years old and
if you check it out or give me an email
I can probably send you the reference so
if you're at McKenzie give it a give me
a bit that's only any mail anymore so
I'll just wrap up with my last story and
that is a story about a philosopher in
Italy that was strolling through a
quarry
some decades ago and he went up to some
stone cutters and he says so what are
you building I mean you know
philosophers do crazy things so the
first thing he said was to the first
fella he ran into so what are you doing
and he said yeah what do you think I'm
doing why does it look like I'm cutting
stones I don't
like this job I hate it I have to do it
because I can't get any other job and
it's really hot dirt going I'm gonna
talk to you whoo okay so being a you
know intrepid philosopher he goes on to
the next fella and he says what are you
doing and he says I'm earning a living
I'm putting food on the table house over
my family you know um earning a living
and well actually that wasn't such a bad
response he felt a little bit better but
you know we got to always check out
three different sources that's my theory
- you can't ask just can't read one book
on anything you can't talk to one people
or person everything yeah check out
three so it goes is there a person and
he says so what are you doing
and he said I'm building a cathedral
this is a book by Ricardo Semler which
is called maverick and he also wrote the
seven-day weekend and it's about the
company in Brazil that his he took it
over it as a very young age in his he
first ran it sort of like a gin show
company almost killed himself and then
he said something's wrong here and he
got a brilliant Personnel Manager and he
said what I really want is Cathedral
builders so he took this parable and he
said I want Cathedral builders what does
it take to have Cathedral builders and
he kind of changed the whole philosophy
of the company around I got to figure
out what it takes to have every single
person in my company be a cathedral
builder so there's a lot in these books
they're pretty radical actually about
how he has a very large engineering
organization with pretty much no rules
and and it works but um he's trying to
create an environment where what
ishikawa says everybody reaches their
full potential
they build cathedrals so what you're
trying to do this is what I remember
from my experience in the plants and
from other times that I was working in I
had this beaten into my head the idea is
to move responsibility and
decision-making to the lowest possible
level that's what you do when you're a
leader you don't make the decisions you
do the same thing that they figured out
in the art of war and you know the 1870s
and 19
30s moves it's the individual who counts
and it's the leader who makes that
individual feel valuable and take
initiative that's the good leader so if
you have people how do you know whether
you have stone cutters or cathedra
Willers do I have a test and you can all
take this test so say somebody shows up
at your company in the morning and they
get annoyed by their job something in
their job makes them annoyed I mean it
could happen to you right ever been
annoyed by something okay so let's just
pretend that happens now the question is
what would you expect them to do would
they complain would they ignore it or
would they fix it if you pretty much
expect everybody to complain and you
have cathedral stone cutters and if they
ignore it you have people who are
earning a living and if you basically
have the stuff in place that people are
expected to fix the stuff that annoys
them then you have Cathedral builders so
this concept of relentless improvement
means the structures are in place the
management encouragement is in place the
leadership is in place so that when
people are annoyed by something in their
job their boss's job is to help them fix
it not live with it not will story
that's regulations but okay how about we
figure out what the real problem is you
know maybe that's not the problem let's
get at the root cause how about you come
up with an idea about what make it might
make it better maybe we could do some
experiments to figure out whether or not
that really makes it better
that's the job of a manager in an
organization has cathedra builders and
really can do constant improvement all
the time for decades on end so if you
have Cathedral builders you have a
leadership culture which helps people
who are annoyed by their job use their
creativity not to drop a suggestion in
the suggestion box but to go out and
figure out how to solve the problem get
data try experiments prove that there's
a better way and make that better way
the way things are done so with that
it's time to go I
yes and thanks everybody
