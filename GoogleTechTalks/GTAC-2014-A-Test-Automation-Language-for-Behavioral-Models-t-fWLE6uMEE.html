PhD from Java Mason University this year
currently I'm a test engineer at
medidata solutions where I'm leading the
research in software testing and the
developing it has the frameworks today
I'm going to talk about model-based
testing and how to do tests on
automation in model-based testing in
model-based testing testers um tests
from behavioral models generally there
are two reasons for us to use
model-based testing first models are
widely used in industry to design
complicated software systems it's for
instance you are mostly machine diagrams
are used to describe behaviors of
software systems such as conclusive were
used at high speed trains cars and
planes so it's natural for us to adapt
designs models as test models second we
used models to decide what to test at
the international conference on software
testing verification and validation in
2014 the director from lockheed martin
time we think people give a keynote
speech in his speech he showed the house
upward system evolved for fighters
developed by Malakal Martin and we were
able to say software system currently
are very complicated with millions of a
line code with lots of complicated
software components so we cannot test
everything we have to decide what test
so we use models together at factors got
a fraction of the system as some level
in his conclusion he thinks model-based
testing is a future next I'm going to
show basic steps of model-based testing
in this model-based testing research I
generated cry
criteria based tests that means i use
coverage criteria to generate test
requirements coverage criteria are rules
about how you can replace requirements
test requirements or artifacts that have
to be covered in tests i use the UML
sitting between diagrams as models so
these diagrams are treated as general
graphs therefore apply the coverage
criteria coverage criteria to the models
to generate the test requirements which
are subtle paths on a graph test
requirements have to be covered in tests
especially in abstract test first a
breath tests are defined in terms of the
model which are tested paths that starts
from initial node and end with a final
note then astron tests cannot be
executed early directly because there
are no template has we have to be
converted into concrete as such as
chillin tests to transform from a
practice to concrete tests testers have
to provide additional information such
as my things and test values when we
have a concrete tests they can be
excluded and reported in this talk I'm
going to focus how to automate the
mapping process from attract tests to
comfort tests I'm going to show example
about how we do model-based testing this
is a financing for a simplified vending
machine system state one is the first
stage when benefit system starts and
state for is a final state there are
three basic actions service persons had
chocolates info vending machine
customers can insert points and then
pack chocolates there are some
constraints defining this van engine
system for instance instead of one quite
it has to be equal to zero and the
number of chocolates insult has to be
equal to zero we can apply
various coverage criteria to this model
forces if we use node coverage all
states have to be covered in tests if we
use ad coverage all transitions have to
be covered in tests if we use a more
complicated coverage criteria the tax
requirements may be a set of some tests
with various lenses so a problem is that
how should we generally test passes to
cover all the test requirements with a
minimum costs costs can be defined in
terms of the total number of the test
paths the total number nose in a test is
that well this problem is probably the
prove it to be a set of NP complete
problems if you have a more interest you
can read my ICSD 2012 paper and my
dissertation now effort tests have
actions for each action we have to find
a corresponding task hole for them in
the meanwhile constraints including
imitates have to be covered as well so
how to transform a dread has two
concrete s is called a mapping problem
in this test pass the test pad has a
decoction appeared twice coin action
pure price and petrol appear ones we
have a complete set of tests paths will
find out these three basic actions will
appear multiple times if we generated
concrete tests for this effort as
testers may write a lot of we done in
the tax code the reason is the test code
for the same action may be similar
similar so we want to automate this
mapping process the problem of the
previous research that they use a lot of
additional models such as object
diagrams cuz they're worms and use case
diagrams and these models have to be
highly consistent that means parameter
using my model
has to be identified in another model in
practice this is really hard for testers
who maintain the highly consistent of
relationships among them so my solution
is that the latter testers who use a
test automation language to train
mappings from the model to executable
tesco by use the only one behavioral
model such as a state machine diagram
for silly machine diagrams there are to
identify elements that are needed
mappings transitions and constraints
hazards concrete element mappings for
traditions and constraints if the test
code of 11 Taipings require objects
testers can create algorithms I things
to initialize objects next I'm going to
show you the definitions of 11 working
and object mapping each element working
has to have a unique mapping name
folding the keyboard mapping our
keywords are in red each eliminating can
be defined for a constraint or
exploration if the test code of element
mappings require objects and we can use
additional object object mappings we
initialize these objects square brackets
means this part is optional because it's
part is using only for element element
lacking support constraints constraints
can be used as preconditions post acute
conditions under steady invariants test
code is included in the curly bracket
similarly object mapping has to have a
unique mapping name and it also has to
specifying can of class and object name
if the test code for this object
initialization also require additional
parameters we can use additional of
genetics to initialize parameters
similarly test code is included in the
project records let's i'm going to
ensure a few example
about how we write elimina mappings and
ugly the mappings this is an example of
eliminating for translation coin in the
test code first we initialize the
vending machine system and then we
insert a dollar into the vending machine
system if the vending machine object
initialization is also used by other
element mappings we can accept this part
and put it into a separated object
mapping and we give a mapping name vm
unit then the previous item the marking
it becomes this and which requires the
ugly the mapping vm unit this is another
element mapping for a constraint which
will parse the project has to be greater
than zero this constraint is used as
civilian variant instead to and sit for
now that we have mappings for
constraints and transitions and then
concrete test automation a tells test
generation can be automated for the test
generation we have to select the proper
mappings for traditions so that
constraints can be satisfied one
constraints Institute's we are satisfied
we needed to select a mapping full point
so that constrains instead for are also
satisfied if the selected mapping cannot
satisfy the constraints instead for we
have to select another mapping if our
mappings cannot satisfy the constraints
testers will be notified and they need
to provide additional mappings if
testers are not able to provide any
mapping to satisfy the constraints that
means either the model what program has
something wrong or there is a mismatch
between the model and program in summary
testers can use the test automation
language to automate the mapping process
from abstract tests to compare tests by
using only one behavioral model
from the study of model-based testing
research I learned one lesson I was able
to do some test automation techniques
for mapping process and the test
generation and the basic see that
requirements are included in a format
that can be honest to the bike computers
in this case requirements are described
the incident machine dryer works so we
want to apply this idea to practice at
meta data at many data solutions we
processing m transforming paralyzed or
even paralyzed clinical trial data for
reporting purposes if the requirements
are written in plain English it's really
hard for us to do any test automation so
we plan to use a different entitlement
language or specification language to
transform original requirements in some
sort of format then our test with
framework can read this newly formatted
requirements and evaluative transform
data against original data and then the
whole value well validation process will
be automated thank you for your
listening
thank you very much done do we have any
questions on the moderator link now any
live questions all right so model-based
testing is interesting for small
applications with a small estate space
but as soon as you have a more complex
that at more complex application
modeling the application becomes much
more difficult and are you doing
anything different here to make that
easier yes you're absolutely right one
software systems are comp I've completed
we have to decide at which a fraction
level we generated models we will use
too many points in foo young we want to
create filling machine diagrams and we
use too many parameters it's really the
states is going to be exploring we
haven't will have the two men states and
it's hard for us to do tests so are you
doing anything differently are you doing
anything tools to make it simpler to
model more complex application because
otherwise you end up recreating the
entire application at in the model test
space yes so for my research my focus
was on a given model and how do we
derive test the former model so but next
you know I might be how we plan to do
some model-based testing for real that's
in practice we will figure out how we
generated models and that's going to be
our future research part thank you Dan
