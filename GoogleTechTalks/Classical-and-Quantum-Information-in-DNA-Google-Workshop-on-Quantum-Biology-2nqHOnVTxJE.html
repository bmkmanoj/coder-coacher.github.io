the only qualification I have for
chairing this session is I'm the only
one in the building with a tie on so
anyway I'd like to introduce this
afternoon
Elizabeth Reaper from National
University of Singapore sent to the
quantum technology she's going to talk
about classical and quantum information
in DNA thank you yeah hello everybody
first of all I would like to say in
Google for organizing this is really
cool workshop and yeah I will talk a lot
about information and go into Google and
talk about information fields fields are
very interesting but ok I think I know a
little bit about quantum mechanics so
first of all I will spend a couple of
slides to you to explain the title in
detail and then very briefly I will talk
about if you're humans then all those
concepts develop in the first section
will be applied to you to DNA and then
there's a really interesting part is
does quantum metal I can say it right
now I do not know but I will make some
some speculations and then finally I
will compare those so still in computing
structures like classical computers DNA
and quantum computers and show where
they are similar and where they differ
and quantum biology suffers from one
severe problem namely that biology is a
massively complex system whereas quantum
mechanics is massively deep so if you
change a little bit like we've we've
seen was a talk from Luca Chu mean
suddenly everything changes so combining
this complexity was a deepness it's a
challenge so for for combining quantum
information concepts with DNA I had to
do some simplifications and I apologize
to any biologist of those
simplifications turn out to be too
brutal details really matter so what is
DNA let's start with a Wikipedia
definition of that so it's a
deoxy people not cleared assets so it's
at the nucleate a set that contains the
genetic instructions used in the
development and functioning of all
living organisms the main well of DNA
molecules is a long-term storage of
information so the last sentence that
sounds was an innocent actually contains
two very interesting concepts so the
first concepts is information and the
other one is long-term storage so what
does it mean long-term storage it means
that we have some information whatever
information is in the past and we would
like to send this information into the
future that's long-term storage and the
way we send it from past to future can
be described by a channel and a channel
is a very general description of
whatever happens to your information so
and what is information well I already
asked this question to Google that was
an answer it came pretty quickly and
it's got a lot of results but I actually
did not bother to read all those results
so as a consequence I will give you a
couple of my my my own definitions what
I like to think about information and
first of all you can see it as negative
entropy so now I wanted to do into the
problems that I have to explain you what
is entropy and entropy in general
measures the ignorance you have about
the system if your system has zero
entropy you know everything about it you
have maximum information if your entropy
is large there are certain things you do
not know about it and you have few
information and entropy is a well
reschedule established concept in an
information theory so how do you use it
you choose an alphabet so it could be
communicational basis of 0 and 1 or
anything else then in the next step
according to that alphabet you can't
probabilities
and once you have that probability
distribution you can calculate the
entropy of your choice say also there
was a whole family of it q I've shown
you a Shannon entropy which is widely
used and very useful but I'm a physicist
and we can do the same in statistical
physics in that case we choose our
system of interest and then we count the
number of possible states and which is
denoted by capital amico and then we
take the logarithm of that number and KB
is a constant
don't don't care too much about the
meaning the massively interesting thing
is that once all events are equally
likely those two definitions of entropy
actually coincide and this is one of the
many links between information Co EE and
physics so it's one that combines
science and things and something
different and in physics we have says as
a well-established second law of
thermodynamics and that helps you that
in closed systems entropy does not
decrease so if we translate that said
argument to information CA we we
immediately know that in closed system
information cannot increase continuously
that's very important to know next thing
I would like to point out that
information is physical whenever you
have a piece of information it comes
together with a physical carrier that
can be is a piece of paper you are
writing now at the moment or it can be
you are you are your hard drive on the
computer and for for for classical
physics well for classical information
we know from everyday life I can I can
change that information career I can
write something on a piece of paper I
can scan it in my computer and I can
print it again and if I didn't do a few
years mistakes I didn't lose any
information
that's that's allowed by loss of
classical physics but as the information
comes comes along with a physical
carrier the way I process information is
found to the laws of physics so what
happens if I choose my physical carrier
to be smaller and smaller until I reach
the quantum limit zanza fascinating
thing is that's a way I process
information changes according to the
laws of quantum mechanics so so what
does it mean so one thing is that I
cannot copy quantum information I can
only copy classical information and
whereas classical information reliably
stores as the information and quantum
mechanics I always have to find equal
Hewitt's it's always getting lost so
coming back to the problem of DNA to you
to to use a long term storage what I
just told you those two points would
actually mean that quantum mechanics is
not any good for for DNA and if you
really want to store your genetic
information safely you should keep away
from quantum mechanics so what is a good
point of it and quantum mechanics allows
you to do more and classical mechanics
is a special case and only has a has a
certain set of manipulations and Contin
gives you more so now the question is
does nature exploit this this edge of
being able to do more and just a very
short reminder of the notation if you
have a classical bit that's usually
denoted by by zero one if you have a
quantum bit or a qubit you put zero and
one in zcc Square kids we recall some
caps and they have one interesting
feature is that say that they sorry that
I allow superposition so in the
classical case you have to decide
whether as a qubit is 0 or 1 but in the
quantum case you can combine it in a
superposition and then you have a
mixture where the bits the qubit it's
either 0 or 1
you just don't know which one it is
in a superposition it's both
simultaneously and in the mixture you
you don't know which one it is
and so I I told you that you cannot copy
quantum information so proof is a squeal
I know so let us suppose you could copy
quantum information then you would have
some some unitary acting on your
wavefunction side so it actually copies
an unknown stay to two to your template
and then I can can suppose that that
side spy is a superposition of 0 and 1
and I plug it into the formula and I get
that length the expression of the copied
state but the mathematical formalism of
quantum mechanics also allows me to feed
it in step by step so I can feed in
first as a beta ket 1 part which is copy
2 1 1 and then the alpha 0 part which is
copy to alpha 0 and that should be the
same but we can see clearly it's not the
same so our assumptions that we can copy
any quantum information was actually 1
and that's called a no cloning serum
actually there was one special case
where these two lines are the same
namely if either alpha or B tail are 0
and this tells you which would roughly
correspond to classical information so
that's something you can copy another
thing I would like to mention in my
introduction is conditional entropy so
the conditional entropy measures how
much uncertainty how much ignorance you
have about a combined system and
observer and given given that you have
all the observers knowledge and for for
anything that we encounter in the real
world that's a fair assumption that this
conditional entropy is bounded below by
0 so the idea is that if if my observer
has a certain ignorance about his own
state sends a combined
system and observer should have at least
this uncertainty so but if we if we are
now dealing with with this state as was
mentioned before this morning actually I
have full knowledge about the full
system I globally I do not have any
uncertainty but if I look at the stages
as a serve GZ observer himself has he
actually has uncertainty so this
quantity is educated for quantum systems
this conditional entropy can actually be
be smaller than zero and whenever
something like this happens we recall it
entanglement so whatever physical
meaning entanglement has you can take it
as very strange probability
distributions which allow you to achieve
correlations which are classically not
possible so so one application so let's
suppose you you have a system which is
in an in a mixture of 0 &amp;amp; 1 and you
would like to reset so could be for
example your memory and you would like
to reset it said 2 to 2 state 3 will and
what is usually called London was the
wager principle states that a classical
observer has to pay one unit of work to
extract or 2 to 2 e ways that
information is it is it any difference
if we are dealing with a quantum
observer yes it could be that the
quantum observer actually has the other
half of a maximally entangled state and
then the system hath has the same
correlations and as was shown recently
in that case you can actually extract
one unit of work and you AC information
to to reset it to to zero and now we are
talking about biology whatever small
enzymes molecules and other systems are
wiggling around in your biological
systems it could be that they are small
enough to be a quantum observer
and then suddenly there's a whole set of
changes instead of instead of me needing
to pay work you can actually extract
work and do the same so it might be that
for those small biological systems we
need to change the way we think about it
and yet another thing I would like to
mention is information is a subjective
quantity it depends on the knowledge you
can you can have and that might be
different for different observers so
this was their introductions which was a
lot of concepts and that's the only
slide I will mention about you coherence
you keep care and talk a lot about it
but I will abbreviate it to the time
assistant can maintain its quantum
coherence it's roughly inverse
proportionality and mass at the
temperature so why don't we see any any
quantum effect in the real life we are
massive we have a lot of mouse and the
second reason is we are hot we are at
300 Kelvin that's a lot of temperature
so whenever you have these two effects
you would believe that you don't have
quantum effects
so finally information in DNA so
probably most of you already know this
molecule let me just give you a brief
reminder so this is DNA is this is
really thin and long molecule and
outside you you have the phosphate
backbone and center sugar stabilizing
the DNA and but it's actually those
those four nucleic acids that contains
their genetic information and when I
first looked at it at those molecules I
thought well they are pretty small
compared to our computers what we encode
in a bit in a computer and because here
we are we have four different bases each
molecule and killed to bits yeah and
then these these two bits are arranged
in a linear way and so the two strands
have opposite information and now there
is an interesting question is how do you
actually access that information it's
not enough to
you actually have to be able to weed it
out how do you do that with with these
small systems so let's look at only only
one of them cytosine for example so
that's that's for you the white side
isn't it now that's why use the left
side so on the left side it's actually
bound to the phosphate backbone so you
you cannot access it and up and down of
the cytosine you have electron clouds
and other nucleate assets so you cannot
access that part either so the only part
where you can actually access that
molecules as on the white side and so
and this is actually what's what's
what's used in in biology and here we
have those atoms that nitrogen and
oxygen and single protons can can bind
to it so now the idea is to use the
position of those protons to to
encourage the identity of that molecule
another thing I should mention is this
aromatic ring you see zero that's
actually even though I consider it small
for quantum mechanics it's actually
quite large so this is something we can
safely assume to be classical
information whereas the position of a
single proton a single proton is due to
two laws of quantum mechanics let my
tunnel so and this leads me to two to
this notation it's a little bit sloppy
but it's good for 4:22 inspiring ideas
so the classical information that we are
dealing with the molecule scientist in
is something I wouldn't killed in in
this quantum state which means that si
si lo are two slots where the proton
could be are empty and the upper slot is
filled
so that's denoted by so see arrows and
once so other enzymes and how do you how
do you combine it cycles and always
pairs with with guanine and so guanine
has
the opposite slot so the lower two slots
are filled and the third one is empty
and then when you bring those two
molecules together you can form h-bonds
and you can only have have have one
proton in these H bonds so that's why
it's necessary to to have the sort of
matching proton distributions so here
it's really a lock-and-key mechanism
same holds for for timing and adenine so
that's this mechanism work perfectly
know what can happen is that your your
cytosine goes into its wave form which
means that it's proton tunneled to the
second slot that's allowed you to do
quantum mechanics but then when we go to
use a lookup table of the encoding so it
actually looks the same like like a like
a chiming and as a consequence because
there's a quantum information pretense
that this molecule is a time line the
adenine sings that it can bind to it and
that's one way how you can get mutations
to your system so once again you you
have you a classical bit with you and
killed in this quantum information and
epsilon is some sort of a tunnel
probability so epsilon is small so most
likely it stayed in this state you you
encoded it but there was a small
probability that your quantum
information was was destroyed and two
into a different state so this is
quantum information in the transversal
direction so let's let's make a little
jump to you to the longitudinal
direction all these nucleic acids say as
they are more or less plant molecules
being surrounded by electron clouds
these electron clouds because you're
dealing with aromatic wings are highly
delocalized so that's why I draw them in
such a sandwich notation so now it
happens that these electron clouds carry
negative charge
and we know that that adjacent negative
electron clouds will repel each other
the intriguing thing is that this this
actually leads to two correlated
excitations lowing the ground state
energies so different charge clouds kick
each other and then they redistribute as
either charge distributions and that can
actually lower the ground state energy
now the defect is called a van der Waals
interaction of unabelle's forces and he
actually needs is a coherence between
neighboring sites to to get the
attractive part of the force but now
this this also has non-trivial
implications so so first of all
neighboring sites are entangled due to
this is continues interactions and also
the electron cloud off of one side
carries information about the identity
of the other side so if I'm a time on
you and I'm a Jason to another night as
as other nine influences my own
electronic state ifs I would be a
cytosine next to me my own state would
look different and that's substantially
different from from classical computing
so my own identity is influenced by the
neighbors I have in in the DNA chain now
I just gave you two examples where you
can expect quantum information to be
present in DNA and maybe the one or
other just just was irritated because we
are will temperature systems so how does
it work together that I told you if you
have massive hot systems at room
temperatures you cannot have
entanglement well I didn't tell you
everything details matter so you can
analyze a very generic model of coupled
harmonic oscillators and then you
actually see that the absolute
temperature does not matter
it's a temperature so so KB T's is a
thermal energy compared to the
interaction energies at metals and if if
Z coefficient is small then you can
expect quantum effects to be present and
if you plug in all the numbers we have
for for this longitudinal and tango
meant you see that that thermal energy
is actually very small compared to the
interaction energy
so DNA has optical frequencies and this
main sets as a thermal noise cannot
cannot excite those optical frequencies
so this quantum information we are
talking about is basically in its ground
state even at 300 Kelvin and so he was a
screenshot from a computer program where
you do something with DNA you've seen it
many times before and to sum it all up
water water till here's our previously
slides and we think that you can see on
this picture is classical information
the black staff and the double helix
that you cannot see that's a quantum
information so sales
I haven't discovered any good way how to
how to picture correlations probably
there is no way so that's why nobody
ever to ask want to make formation but
the next time you see such a double
helix you know okay all the stuff I do
not see is that's a quantum information
so basically what happens so it's
classical information but which is
usually drawn you is embedded is
sandwiched into into quantum information
and most most likely since this
classical information is never accessed
you can only because because it's inside
all the quantum information you can only
access the quantum information or see
the electron clouds and enter protons so
mathematically you can describe that as
a quantum classical state so let's
suppose that X is a string of classical
symbols you would announce that the
state has two components
so the first one denotes the classical
information this is diagonal and its
basis has has no coherence but this
actually comes along with some sort of
quantum information and so X for example
could be could be the swing of your DNA
and then it is embedded in this in this
cloud of quantum information and Paul
Davis called this sort of quantum
information shadow information because
in this quantum information you have at
least one copy of the information in
your DNA if if not more copies and if
you want you to and it detailed your
classical information you measure the
quantum part but it can happen that the
quantum part of science is not fully
distinguishable and this gives
possibility for mistakes so I'm coming
to you to the most important question
does it matter at all well I I do not
know for certain but I think there are
many things quantum allows you to do and
if quantum gives you an advantage since
this four billion auntie project
probably discovered how to use it let me
come back to use a channel picture I
introduced in the beginning so you would
like to send some classical information
from the sender to the receiver we do it
every day we send text messages we send
email which Hawks there's also classical
information which uses classical
channels and the only problem is that
this probably doesn't take place in DNA
because the system you are talking about
is too small to really have a full
classical temp so it's more likely that
you're dealing with a quantum Channel
and you can send classical information
in a quantum Channel that's no problem
so you encode your classical information
on your quantum system you sent your
quantum system then you make a
measurement on it and decode the
information it carries and there are two
channels I would like to to compare so
as a normal quantum Channel and
entanglement
the quantum channel where actually the
sender and receiver initially share
entanglement and then I will talk about
the capacity of channels and this
roughly measures how much information
can be transmitted in this channel so
that's a number between 0 and 1 if it's
1 you can fully transmit all the
information you send in and if it's 0
your channel is useless and you cannot
send any information
calculating channel capacities is is
very very difficult and those capacities
are not known but for for some simple
channels they are known and one of them
is called Cuba depolarizing channel so
what happens here you take your your
wave function Phi of X and you sent it
to the channel but it can actually
happen that in this channel it suffers
from some sort of noise as we can expect
it with with biological systems and then
with with probability 1 minus epsilon
this channel gives you original wave
function and was probability Epsilon it
senses something completely random so
that's that's a qubit e polarizing
channel and and now if you would like to
to to encourage a classical information
X so X could be adding into you mean or
whatever and UN killed that in a certain
wave function and you send it to your
noisy channel and with some probability
you recover X but in some cases you
guess incorrectly and you recover Y so
how often you you guess correctly and
how often you guess incorrectly is
characterized by the channel capacity k1
and now you can you can use the same
channel the only difference is that now
sender and receiver initially share
maximally entangled states and then you
have the capacity ke e for for
entanglement and the beautiful thing is
if you use entanglement you can double
your channel capacity so we have a
system where you would like to transmit
classical and from
nation it is reasonable to assume that
you can create this entanglement
resources and this entanglement would
allow you to to double the capacity of
your noisy Channel
so that's something we're thinking about
something completely different how you
might use entanglement in DNA is is for
communication along the chain when I
read up on the literature on how little
motors go along the DNA and achieves
links I always wonder but how does it
work how do these motors actually know
what they are supposed to do so let let
us suppose that each of these balls we
present say aside in your DNA and what I
do is I I wiggle the one end of it and
then you can can calculate what happens
to is actually after some time you will
get entanglement between the first side
where you you you shake you end and the
ants sign could be the tens or twenties
or thirties site along the chain and
suddenly these to fall apart site show
and hingleman and entanglement means
that they have correlations so the
question is can you use those
correlations for for communicating along
this one-dimensional chain and the next
thing is is something where where my own
ignorance comes up I I do not know too
much about protein folding but I have a
background in information science so I
would like to ask a question to two
people who know more about biology so
one I would like to you two to fold a
protein I I start with my DNA which is a
one-dimensional sequence of information
so in order to fully describe my it's a
classical information in DNA I only need
to know this one-dimensional sequence
then I make a copy to ona and the
information content did not change in
the next step I translate pairs of sweet
of my ona into an amino acid now there
are some sort of codon code you might
argue that you you lost some information
and I'll ignore that effect for the
moment
and then it's a false step this is one
dimensional chain of amino acid actually
folds into a three-dimensional structure
so let's look at it again you start with
DNA messenger RNA and this chain of
amino acids and because they are all
linear arrangements I would argue that
well flee up to small errors that carry
the same amount of classical information
and thank you for the protein and it's
getting a sweet dimensional structure
and the shape is vital to its
functioning but now you need to store
more information in addition to the
sequence you have so position
information and in my opinion that
that's actually an increase of
information but we also know from the
second law that in closed systems
information cannot increase continuously
now I know that creating a protein is
far away from being a closed systems but
my question to the biologists is
actually where does this additional
information come from if you think about
it in detail that's actually not said
that trivial does it come from the time
sequence in which you assemble the
protein does it come from some sort of
laws of quantum mechanics do you have
some sort of quantum information
actually also taking place if anybody
can tell me I'd be very happy
so a great question that that's actually
taking from a German piece of literature
screw mm nice book I can only recommend
reading it and so it's it's sort of an
important question so the important
question is does quantum information
metal and they also one way to test it
so you take two identical strings of
classical information and by some means
and once doing you change the cluster as
a quantum information there they are
some ways to destroy a quantum
information and then you actually look
does it fold in the same configuration
or does it fall differently if two
strings with the same amount of
classical information but different
quantum information
into different chain into different
configurations different shapes that
would actually be a good argument that
quantum information matters and this
argument is this this line of sort
generalizes to two other situations when
you wander tasks run to metal well
disturb it shake it destroy it and see
if it makes a change and then you know
if quantum matters so last point
comparing those different platforms
which all have to do with information
flow if I have a classical computer I
would initialize it in either 0 or 1 or
any other computational basis and when
the for DNA I argued that you use
quantum classical States and for quantum
computing I didn't talk too much about
quantum computing so if you are
unfamiliar with the subject you can just
ignore the last column here you you have
whatever space your quantum computing is
assigned to with its hilbert space then
you you you let sales those bits
interact and for classical computers
that should be fairly independent if I
if I store a value of 0 here and this is
independent if next to it is a 0 over 1
for DNA the value is a quantum
information of a single site strongly
depends on the quantum information on
the next side and for for quantum
computing and tangle mine seems to be
the crucial quantity so then your full
exploits as a non-local correlations
with with classical computation you do
gates like and or not and many more in
quantum computing you have a universal
set of unitary gates and I have to say
that in DNA I have no idea what sort of
gates are possible so it would be also
interesting if to work together with
someone and biology to actually classify
Zizi allowed operations on DNA when it
comes to cutting DNA and resembling
that's getting pretty well
and also non-equilibrium will be the
most interesting case what I said about
shaking one end and seeing how the
correlation squared along the chain that
sets non equilibrium the gay time will
be short for for classical and quantum
computing in classical computing is a
shorter today gate times the faster your
processor works for quantum computing
you always need to find city coherence
so that's why you have to make it short
DNA will be a little bit different
because you have a sort of continuous
interaction and then finally there's a
weed out for classical computers that's
fully deterministic and you make only
few errors with quantum computing that's
actually statistical you need to repeat
the same experiment many times before
you can actually have a weed out and DNA
is again somewhere in the middle so if
you want you to weed out DNA information
you'll you have a single shot you have
have one try to do it and so given all
the quantum that's involved so I would
actually like to know Z Z accuracy of
that weed out so so as there are many
many more things you could compare but
what you see already is that DNA seems
to sit somewhere in the middle between
classical and quantum computing so the
conclusions of this talk is that both
classical and quantum information should
be considered for full understanding of
DNA
even if DNA is probably not a for
quantum computer and there are many
people I would like to thank for for for
helpful discussions for preparing this
talk so
milah goo Oscar Dalston Kevin moody
Giovanni back on th and unders my
supervisor Vukovich well and they are
probably many more and yeah thank you
for you
I would like to solve your father's
actually there's no information gained
because you have to look at the entire
environment which includes water and
this is a difficult problem in protein
folding when you include what there is
it's an entropic force so you calculate
all the energy and you minimize free
energy of the entire system which is DNA
with water or protein or peptides with
water and you end up with the equity
will confirm a conformation which is the
folded state and that corresponds to the
minimum energy or maximum entropy so I
mean of course we have to do detailed
calculations that I maintain that when
you do that you will end up with
possibly lots of information not gaining
information of course when you consider
the whole box and then of course you
cannot gain information but still I
would like to understand how this
information from the water molecules
actually it's very simple because water
molecules attached to two peptides or
amino acids and by doing so they lose
information about their conformational
freedom of movement so free water
molecule has rotational degrees and
translational when it's bound it loses
this freedom and that can be quickly
calculated to entropy gain or
information loss and the idea of the
superposition of quantum and classical
wave function for the DNA I think it's a
great one and and I think you call the
shadow information or something but
actually it can be that made very
concrete we think about DNA as the
sequence of nucleotides you know the
code but actually start letters he said
molecules that they're vibrating so the
vibrating vibrations and they around the
bonds to me our like wave function so
this is really quantum mechanical
oscillations and and that can be your
your shadow if you will because if you
talk about just a sequence yet and these
vibrations actually reflect this the
neighborhood so what you talked about
the importance of the neighborhood
preserved by the by the nature of the
vibrations and finally very quick the
gates and the the readout reading I
think there's a whole slew of proteins
like transcription factors and and DNA
polymerases enzymes that participate in
this and these are the the readers and
the writers and the gates and all this
anyway
sweet
so did you mention at all why the
quantum coconuts could survive at room
temperature for these DNA molecules yes
so one part of the quantum information
is encoded in this electron a degree of
freedom and it just happens that you
have optical frequencies for this system
and your room temperature cannot excite
those optical frequencies so that's why
you are basically in the ground state
another thing is that you have this
double helix and that's actually shield
to very well and any any noise from it
so you are saying this is this has
nothing to do with a non-equilibrium set
of this DNA vibrational mode so you are
saying even in a static poem yes so so
far my calculations are only static and
then the next step I will look at non
equilibrium but even even in static you
have a massively stable system you
massively stable in the sense of
maintaining quantum information because
of those optical frequencies yeah
well wizard what's the problem handling
it's more delicate because you can only
measure in one basis and then it's
actually undistinguishable whether you
have a coherent superposition or a
mixture but for poor channeling to take
place at some point it needed to be a
superposition that's why why you denoted
here I'm unfortunately a physicist I
hope that some biologists and the
audience can can answer yeah because it
this goes to the comparison at the end
that you did at the table that you
compare your classic called
competing DNA in quantum computing I
mean I don't see any any discussions of
the coherence time scales here so I
think we can add it and index copyboy
okay I think it's I mean there are lots
of experiments we know about that we
show entanglement over space
I wonder if you're suggesting that
there's entanglement over time with a
DNA sort of being the string between and
so that's a slight misunderstanding foam
from the notation I used and you can't
have untangle mind over time here I I do
not propose it it said here you have the
classical information in the past which
you want to send into the future and
each step might use quantum mechanics
but that's different problem</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
