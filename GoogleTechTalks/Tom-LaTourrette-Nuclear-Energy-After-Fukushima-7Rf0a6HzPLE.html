Faye and i'm a member of the talks at
Google program we're very proud to
introduce Tom LaTourette he is a senior
physical scientist at Rand our neighbors
just down the street and he specializes
in energy public policy and homeland
security policy and he's here today to
talk about nuclear power in a
post-fukushima world give the floor to
Tom thank you thank you very much I'm
going to cover a lot of ground so pardon
me if I look down to my notes once in a
while but I want to I want to talk about
a lot of different aspects of nuclear
power it's a very general presentation
and will include some of the results of
some of the work we've done but it's
going to go well beyond that and you're
welcome to ask questions I'll I should
have plenty of time at the end for
questions as well so a nuclear power it
accounts for about fourteen percent of
our electricity consumed here in
California about twenty percent in the
United States and then fourteen percent
worldwide the bulk of the remainder
around the world is coal natural gas
hydropower and a few percent from
petroleum and renewables each of these
sources have strengths and weaknesses
but among them nuclear stands out is
probably being subject to the most
ambivalence and we see this ambivalence
manifest in really the wide range of
attitudes about nuclear power around the
world ranging from complete intolerance
to ardent support and grow and so as is
the nature of ambivalence it varies from
place to place and time to time and
certainly one of the things that
strongly affects our attitudes about
nuclear power is major accidents of
which there have been really just 33
Mile Island Chernobyl and then just over
a year ago Fukushima and so just a
little more than a year after the
Fukushima accident seems like a good
time to sort of examine the status of
nuclear power and where it might be
headed so today I'm going to explore
several of the characteristics of
nuclear
our explore some of the the various
characteristics both favorable and
worrisome about nuclear power and I'll
spend a little more time on one in
particular that is waste management what
to do with the spent nuclear fuel
there's a variety of reasons I'll get to
why that's a particular interest right
now and then I'll finish up by
discussing what's happened around the
world and in the United States and the
aftermath of Fukushima and what that
might mean for nuclear power going
forward so among the considerations
about nuclear power I'll start out with
probably the most worrisome one nuclear
proliferation at the fact that nuclear
power is born essentially as a spin-off
of nuclear weapons looms pretty large in
most people's perceptions of nuclear
power for all the problems with coal or
natural gas no one's ever been
annihilated with them so this is a very
in the threat of nuclear weapons and
nuclear proliferation is a very real and
very serious concern the way we deal
with this is with the nuclear
non-proliferation treaty and this is
very complicated issue that I don't have
time to go into but it basically
consists of a series of safeguards and
rules that are intended to prevent
countries with nuclear power making the
jump to nuclear energy and I'll just
point out one interesting fact about
this about this risk it turns out that
having a nuclear power plant itself is a
very little interest or value if you
want to make nuclear weapons there's not
much you can do with a nuclear power
plant the real the real threat or the
real score for somebody who wants to
make nuclear weapons is the enrichment
plant where you make the fuel for
nuclear power and that's because both
the fuel for nuclear reactors and bombs
both require specialized techniques and
materials to enrich uranium in its I so
tell uranium-235 official isotope so
although there's a lot of different
things we do to help limit the spread of
nuclear weapons one thing we could do
which isn't really always acceptable but
some countries do is that is limit the
ability to enrich fuel so you can have a
nuclear power plant but limit the
ability to enrich fuel to a few trusted
States and they can supply fuel to
anybody who wants to buy and that way
any country can have nuclear power but
without posing without having the
enrichment capabilities and without
posing the risk of making the jump to
nuclear weapons another very interesting
and important aspect of nuclear powers
costs when it was first being developed
we were told that it will be too cheap
to meter I don't know if any of you have
ever heard this if so the mantra at the
time too cheap to meter well of course
it hasn't turned out to be that way
although it's it's not obvious why
strictly speaking when you look at
running a nuclear power plant and
fueling it it is the cheapest way to
make electricity it's incredibly too but
what those early estimates didn't
account for was the fact that it's very
expensive to build a nuclear power plant
the infrastructure involved in putting
together a nuclear power plant is quite
involved and that adds a lot of the cost
and so when you do what's known as a
levelized cost analysis which allows you
to compare apples to apples you include
the cost of building the infrastructure
financing running the plant fueling the
plant disposing of the waste
decommissioning the plan then nuclear
does come out to be more expensive than
natural gas and much more expensive than
coal but hold that thought i'll return
to cost in just a minute and it starts
to look a little bit better another
concern related to nuclear power is
health and safety risk and this stems
primarily from the risk of a release of
radioactivity from an accident at a
nuclear power plant there have been in
the history of nuclear power around 50
confirmed deaths related to radiation
from a nuclear power plant accident all
of those at chernobyl of course there
are many many more deaths expected from
chernobyl from latent cancers that are
expected to turn up have been turning up
and expected to continue to turn up over
the long term and estimates credible
estimates for that range in the
neighborhood of five thousand to ten
thousand by comparison in the case of
Fukushima there were two confirmed
deaths neither of which were related to
radiation those are blunt force trauma
and similarly they're expected to be
some long-term
cancer deaths no one really has any good
estimates right now but they range from
very low to possibly as high as a tenth
of Chernobyl so maybe up to a thousand
but of course it's way too early to say
with any confidence so these numbers are
not trivial but is as with everything in
energy it's useful to compare it to
alternatives and when you look at coal
for example there are at least five
thousand deaths from coal mining
accidents around the world every year so
we're talking about well over an order
magnitude greater safety and health risk
just from coal and that is by far the
number one electricity source around the
world so so and this doesn't even
account for for the other kinds of
health issues mostly respiratory related
coming from both coal mining as well as
just breathing coal-fired power plant
emissions so the difference is pretty
big but of course people people view
different risks differently even though
the outcome we expect over the long term
is that nuclear is in fact far safer
than coal the outcome of an single a
worst-case scenario for a single
incident nuclear can be far far less
safe than coal and so it's this sort of
dichotomy of different types of risks
that really is part of what feeds into
the ambivalence about nuclear power and
it's it's really hard to compare those
two risks one of the great advantages of
nuclear power of course is it produces
very few greenhouse gas emissions in
fact as running the plant itself
basically produces none essentially all
the emissions have to do with building
the plant and I'm partly also enriching
the fuel and when you do what's known as
a life cycle analysis which is analogous
to the levelized cost analysis it
accounts for the emissions from building
the plant running the plant fueling the
plant decommissioning waste disposal and
all of that nuclear compared all the
other electricity sources comes out
right at the bottom right there with
with wind and hydro powers having the
lowest greenhouse gas emissions so it's
a couple ways we can appreciate this
difference one is again to compare to
other sources we often hear about
clean-burning natural gas
because it and it's about half the
greenhouse gas emissions of coal one of
the factor of two is important but
that's really quite a different thing
compared to the fact that nuclear has
about 50 times less greenhouse gas
emissions than coal so it's really an
entirely different realm in terms of
climate change and solutions to reducing
greenhouse gas emissions another way to
appreciate the greenhouse gas emissions
of nuclear is to return to this question
of cost I said these these levelized
cost analyses try to take into account
all the costs so that you can truly
compare apples to apples but one of the
costs they don't include is what we call
the social cost of climate change that
is the cost of co2 emissions or
greenhouse gas emissions and the reason
they don't include those costs is
because we don't really we as a society
don't really have a good handle on what
those car those costs are yet so they're
just beginning to enter some scientific
estimates and they're nowhere in the
market really in the market prices but
as we learn more it seems inevitable
that they will start to enter the
marketplace and they will change the
cost of things and when when we start to
include the cost of greenhouse gas
emissions then nuclear will be probably
much more competitive than cold or
natural gas then the final aspect of
nuclear power wanna discuss is as I said
waste management amidst all the
controversy and ambivalence about
nuclear power probably the single aspect
that contributes most of this
controversy and ambivalence is what to
do with the nuclear waste the spent fuel
just so very briefly I want to just
explain what is nuclear fuel and span
fuel so fuel for most commercial nuclear
power plants around the world consists
of little thimble size uranium oxide
pellets and you take a few hundred of
these and stack them up into very very
long thin tubes about four meters long
you take about 250 of these tubes and
you cluster them together and what's
known as a fuel assembly and this is
sort of the fuel unit for nuclear power
plants and a typical nuclear power plant
will use a hundred two maybe 300 of
these fuel assemblies in its core and
anyone
and.and you change out portions of it
over time when it's new it's not very
radioactive and it's pretty safe to
handle and you'll see there's a person
holding you see people handling it the
but however once it gets into the
reactor and the uranium starts fishing
we're splitting into a whole slew of
so-called daughter products these
daughter products are very some of them
are very radioactive and very dangerous
and the real dilemma arises from the
fact that some of those dangerous
daughter products remain radioactive for
a long long time so you can't just dump
this stuff into a landfill when you're
done with it you have to actually
isolate it from human contact for tens
or even hundreds of thousands of years
so so therein lies the rub we recognized
early on that you know human
institutions really couldn't be relied
upon to manage something spent fuel or
anything for that matter for those kinds
of time scales and so really it was
early on recognized that the only
feasible solution is to bury this spent
fuel deep underground in such a way that
it isolates the waste from human contact
for the amount of time we need so since
the very beginning it's been a virtual
certainty that we would need what's
known as a permanent geological
repository and this is just a schematic
drawing of one showing the surface of
the earth and then a cutaway of
underground and conceptually this is
very simple it's it's just mine shafts
and tunnels underground you packaged up
the spent fuel you put it down there you
backfill it you seal it up and you walk
away and if you designed it right it
doesn't doesn't interact with the
biosphere for the amount of time you
need Nia to not react despite knowing we
would need something like this literally
for decades since the very beginning no
one no country has ever developed a
permanent geological repository so what
that means is that essentially all of
the fuel from nuclear power production
in the world that's ever been produced
is still in temporary storage in the
u.s. virtually all of that is
at the nuclear power plants where it was
originally produced it's essentially in
the backyards of these nuclear reactors
and you know part of the difficulty and
why we haven't ever produced one of
these things is because we really
continually under appreciated that both
the technical and and equally
importantly the social political
challenges of developing something like
this while conceptually it may be simple
the Devils in the details and not that
we haven't tried I don't have time to go
into the history but many of you may
know we've just finished watching a very
carefully crafted plan in this country
for a spent fuel underground repository
Yucca Mountain Nevada completely unravel
all right that plan was 30 years in the
making was very careful it's recently
been at a minimum mothballed and
probably completely scrapped so we're
back to square one we don't have a plan
we need to come up with one well so if
we agree that we do need to have nuclear
waste in a permanent geological
repository and yet we don't have one
clearly temporary storage is an
unsustainable position but you know you
could argue that well we'll get to when
we get to it it's okay it's working fine
but in fact there are some some more
pressing reasons why we might want to
make a change sooner rather than later
and I'll go through three of them I
think together they're pretty compelling
although you can poke holes in any one
of them taken together they do make a
pretty compelling case the first is
nuclear power plants are running out of
room to store this spent fuel some of
them have been running since the late
60s that's a lot of spent fuel piling up
what we do was spend fuel at a nuclear
reactor they all have what's known as a
spent fuel pool this is a pool of water
that's part of the reactor design and
it's there to move fuel around during
refueling and maintenance and other
things that's designed for temporary
storage of the spent fuel after you take
it out until you ship it off to a
repository well of course as the
repository repeated to not appear these
pools became de facto long-term storage
facilities something for which they were
never designed
and so they started to get full so the
first thing people did is reracked them
that is is they take took out the racks
that we're in there and put in a new
kind of rack that increases the density
to four to five times as dense as they
were originally designed so there's a
lot more spent fuel in these pools but
even then they're starting to fill out
so the next thing we did was develop
what's known as dry cask storage and
this is taking the spent fuel out of the
pools putting it in these enormous metal
and concrete canisters and setting them
out on a concrete pad or sometimes in a
concrete vault again at the site of the
reactor just just outside this works
pretty well we have about a quarter of
the spent fuel in the country is in
these right now and three quarters is in
the pools but even this is not good
enough for many cases where there's just
not room for something like this or more
poignant Lee some places where we have
what's known as stranded fuel and
stranded fuel is fuel and dry cask
storage like this at a site where the
reactor has been decommissioned and in
many places dismantled and gone and the
only thing left is the spent fuel and
yet it's still there we can't get rid of
it and its presence prevents
redevelopment of the site so there's a
real urgency there to get rid of it so
we're running out of space a second
reason we might want to move sooner
rather than later on spent fuel is you
often hear an ethical argument that says
you know we can't leave this stuff for
future generations to deal with it we
have a responsibility to deal with it
ourselves that's certainly a very valid
argument I agree with it and yet it
needs to be tempered with a couple of
observations first is we've already
passed this on to the next generation I
mean it's been around this is nuclear
power as my parents generation I wasn't
even born when it got started so it has
been passed on that horse is out of the
barn that doesn't necessarily make it
okay but it does demonstrate that it's
possible and we're still here the second
sort of caveat to this argument is is
the equivalent of the Carpenters motto
measure twice and cut once that meaning
dealing with nuclear power is is our
nuclear spent nuclear fuel is tricky
it's it's dangerous stuff it's a serious
problem you want to do it right and if
that means waiting until we're really
sure we've got a good solution and we're
able to do so then then perhaps it is
okay to wait a little while until we're
sure we've got a good solution then the
third the third argument that we might
want to move sooner rather than later
stems from the safety risk associated
with packing all this spent fuel into
these pools we saw this highlighted at
Fukushima this is we've all heard about
core meltdowns and that happened at
Fukushima as well but a lesser known
risk and yet not unknown is that is the
the risk of spent fuel in these pools
and and Fukushima is the first case I'm
aware of where there might have been
damaged two spent nuclear fuel that
wasn't in the reactor core at the time
and I'll just explain how this risk goes
is it's a potential risk nuclear fuels
as I said very radioactive that means
when you take it out of the reactor it's
thermally very very hot so you need
electricity to cool these spent fuel
pools if not the pool heats up the water
starts to evaporate the spent fuel is
exposed to air at which point the
reaction between the cladding and
hydrogen and just the heat can cause
what's paradoxically known is a pool
fire and at this the spent fuel catch
fire and at this point you can as you
can imagine you can have really
tremendous releases of radionuclides in
a fire plume spreading out past the
reactor and and as I actually dad often
as in the case of Fukushima there's a
lot more spent fuel in these spent fuel
pools than there is in the core itself
so it's a potentially very dangerous
situation now I say potentially because
we still don't give him 14 months later
know exactly what happened with the
spent fuel pools in Fukushima we do know
they lost power the earthquake knocked
out will cause the reactor itself to
shut down and also knocked out the grid
power so there was no electricity they
have backup generator
as those came on as designed 40 minutes
later we all know those were wiped out
by the tsunami and then there's backup
backup batteries that came on as
designed and lasted for a few hours as
designed and then they ran out and at
that point there was no power the water
started to heat up we also know that
there was an explosion that blew the
walls and the roof off the spent fuel
pool building we don't know if the
explosion was caused by the spent fuel
or some other source you may remember
there were a lot of initial reports that
said yeah there was spent fuel caught
fire the pools drained subsequent
analyses in videos seem to indicate that
that actually didn't happen that the
pools didn't drain and they're pierced
to be again uncertain but may have been
no damage to the spent fuel but in any
case it was at least a very close call I
think we can all agree on that so these
arguments combined together say we
really probably do need to move on
managing spent fuel sooner rather than
later it doesn't necessarily mean it's
an emergency and we've got to get this
stuff underground as quickly as possible
but it does mean we really do need to
have develop a plan an acceptable plan
for the for the completion the long-term
management and disposal of spent nuclear
fuel so a couple of years ago a group of
us here at Rand undertook a study to
look at different options and try and
see if one could decide how did how to
choose among them for how to manage
spent fuel given that the plan we had
was failing and being abandoned by the
by the government so we looked at four
strategies and these strategies as we've
defined and pretty much span the entire
range of feasible options for dealing
with spent fuel the first is to
reactivate the Yucca Mountain repository
that was recently abandoned the the
motivation that at least the argument
not necessarily my argument but the
argument in support of this says that
you know the site is good we've done a
lot of work invested a tremendous amount
of time money effort in designing this
site and getting everything ready and it
would be a shame and a great waste to
just walk away from it a second
alternative would be to
abandoned Yucca Mountain and find a new
site for a permanent geological
repository and in the meantime take all
the spent fuel from all the reactors and
move it to a centralized surface storage
facility some sort of consolidated
storage facility like that I spent fuel
farm and the rationale here would be
that the Yucca Mountain site is not okay
we don't want to proceed with that we
can do better but that's going to take
time finding a new site characterizing
it choosing it and saying okay that's
going to take decades in the meantime we
need to do something to demonstrate
progress towards towards moving the
spent fuel so the idea would be to get
it off to have the government take
possession of it get it off the utility
sites and and consolidate it and get it
ready to put underground a third option
is recycling and this picture doesn't
really do it justice but essentially the
message is even at the end of the cycle
when we take the spent fuel out of the
reactor there's still a tremendous
amount of energy potential there's it's
still 95% uranium there's a tremendous
energy resource there that could be
tapped and and recycled and used a new
fuel and in some future scenarios of
design it's possible that you could also
decrease the amount of space you need an
imprimatur geological repository you're
always going to have some ways no matter
what you recycle there's always some
waste and that waste is very very
radioactive but you could design this in
certain ways where you wouldn't need
quite as much space and then the fourth
option is wait and see do what we're
doing now just keep moving it out of the
pools into the dry storage casks and the
motivation for this is there's too much
uncertainty with any of these other
options we just it's too risky to move
now we're going to wait until we have
better knowledge better technology
better ideas something like that so we
looked at these four options in the
context of costs and safety security
technical feasibility and public
acceptance and it turns out that given
all the uncertainty and lack of
experience there's really it's hard to
make a compelling case for one option
over another
but one of the ways you can distinguish
these options is in terms of how they
address priorities we may have about
nuclear power and these are priorities
you often hear in debates about nuclear
power like we need to solve the the
nuclear waste issue right away or we
need to pave the way for new nuclear
power plants and right now the fact that
we can't get rid of the spent fuel is
really a problem for that or you know we
can't trust the government we don't
trust Yucca Mountain we don't think
they've done it right we need to build a
stronger sense of confidence and
consensus in the decision-making process
things like that and for each prior
priority we asked which which of these
strategies is most consistent with that
priority and the idea being that if we
have a common sense of priorities that
will help guide us in terms of what what
option we want to pursue for managing
expand fuel and when we looked at it
this way we can start to distinguish the
different strategies and based on a at
least current thinking and preferences
one strategy does seem to emerge as
being more preferable than the others
and that's the one in the upper right
that is abandoned Yucca Mountain restart
the site selection process for a new
repository but in the meantime have the
government make good on its promise take
possession of the spent fuel collect it
all in a consolidated storage site that
can happen quite quickly building one of
those is in theory pretty simple and so
that demonstrates good progress undoes a
lot of log jams and in the meantime
allows you time and flexibility to
really pick a site that everyone can
agree on and develop a process that
everyone is is happy with to come up
with a permanent geological repository
that everyone can get behind I just want
to finish my discussion of spent fuel by
noting that at the same time we were
doing our study the president directed
the Secretary of Energy to convene
what's known as Blue Ribbon Commission
on America's nuclear future and do you
this was a team of people charged with
with charting out a new course for
managing spent fuel now that the
existing policy has been all but
abandoned they covered a lot more and
their their report just came out a
couple of months ago their report
covered a lot more ground than ours but
where they did overlap the results are
actually quite consistent with ours they
pretty much went for that same same
recommendation oh yeah um go ahead it
seems to me that in this out of you
probably more information but it seems
to me that the primary reason Yucca
Mountain was abandoned was kind of a
NIMBYism and I do you think that you
know if we were to try to choose a new
site that we would ever overcome you
know do you ever think that the local
people would be okay with it anywhere
and and that same goes for like if you
have a temporary storage facility I mean
I I would imagine there would be the
same resistance from anybody nearby like
no don't bring that nuclear fuel here
even if it's temporarily right it's a
it's a very valid and very real concern
and I can't answer if it'll work but the
the problem was Yucca Mountain was was
multi-dimensional and NIMBYism even by
itself was not quite what it was it was
the state really fought it and the
locals they were actually able to get
behind it and that's happened in the
past and different incidences of citing
things it's often the state that's
really the impediment in any case the
process by which Yucca Mountain was
chosen and investigated was entirely
flawed there's no there's no
disagreement about that there's a
tremendous amount of effort going on
right now and we're working on this as
well with the Department of Energy to
build a new type of organization and a
new type of process that engages the
states and locals the way it was set up
the first time and that was set up in
1982 it was federal decision makers made
all the calls they rule they ruled
everything States and locals had you
know trivial sort of amount of power and
decision making in the process and
that's clearly a mistake and that's
gotta change but there was other issues
this site itself is not the best there
were serious honest-to-goodness
technical issues with a site that took
a lot of time and energy to overcome and
I think you know the process of doing
that sort of eat the way in the time it
took to do that you could weigh at
people's confidence and the regulatory
environment there were mistakes bad
mistakes made there between the EPA and
the nuclear regulatory commission that I
think won't happen again so there is an
opportunity to do a much better job
whether it will work remains to be seen
you're sort of you're getting ahead I'm
getting ahead of myself so so we have a
plan that's probably going to be
recommended in coming months it doesn't
necessarily mean it's right or it's
going to work there's a couple things we
know about nuclear waste disposal one is
nothing is ever completely new
everything up here you've I've showed
you has been discussed in some form or
another many times in the past and it
ain't over until it's over no matter how
beautiful the plan may look at the
beginning I mean in 1982 they were 87
they were toasting they were happy this
is we did it you know we worked so hard
well look where we are now so you know
they're there is a sense of deja vu all
over again we've had Commission's we've
had studies we've had working groups the
one advantage we have now is we got
pretty far along with the process we
know doesn't work so hopefully we can
leverage that experience and to develop
something something that will I'll just
finish up by talking about some of the
things that have happened in the
aftermath of Fukushima accident around
the world and in the United States and
perhaps the biggest response to
Fukushima is that several countries have
opted to eliminate slow down or stay out
of nuclear power Germany Belgium and
Switzerland all soon after the Fukushima
accident made official decisions to
phase out nuclear nuclear power one
hundred percent out in the next 10 to 20
years and in fact Germany in months
after Fukushima actually has shut down
half its nuclear power plants while this
is a pretty significant change
particularly in the case of Germany it's
not as profound
may at first appear and that by that I
mean that they had already made the
decision to get out of nuclear power
Germany and Belgium already had laws on
the books phasing out nuclear power in
fact they had made special efforts to
put those laws on hold when confronted
with the alternative greenhouse gas
emissions from coal costs it's really in
just the effort of building a bunch of
new plants though it's a pretty imposing
thing to face so they put those laws on
hold and so really the the decision
after Fukushima was not to cancel
nuclear power as much as it was to
return to the previous position that we
don't want nuclear power also not
terribly surprisingly Italy voted again
to not get involved in nuclear power
Venezuela chose not to get involved in
nuclear power one doubts they voted but
there was a decision they were
considering getting into nuclear power
they put the brakes on that perhaps more
meaningful as Japan itself they have
made mention where more than mentioned
they sort of said they're going to phase
out nuclear power over the next 40 years
and that's pretty significant because
they were at thirty percent nuclear
before Fukushima they had already put
into place big plans to ramp that up to
over fifty percent and so a decision to
instead go down to zero is really quite
significant and if they stick with that
that's by far the biggest fallout from
Fukushima yes there yeah it may be one
running but I think that was a few days
ago the last one went down so the way it
works is they shut down several for
risks and then they implemented a policy
that when reactors shut down for routine
maintenance there are very special
criteria by which you can start it up
again require local consent and nobody's
giving that consent right now so every
time one shuts down for maintenance it's
pretty much staying down so now they're
there at zero another significant
response is that China which is in the
middle of a nuclear construction frenzy
and they're really building a lot of
nuclear
has sort of put on the brakes on that
not completely they're scaling back
their their capacity targets for 2020 by
I think around ten to twenty percent but
they're still building a tremendous
amount of nuclear power capacity perhaps
equally meaningful is several major
nuclear countries the UK France the US
england ukraine russia canada have made
no mention south korea no mention of
changing their plans for nuclear power
in response to the Fukushima accident so
overall there are non-trivial planned
reductions in nuclear power but of
course there's a tremendous amount of
growth going on at the same time and we
should also keep in mind that these
these pledges to phase out nuclear power
you don't just turn it off overnight in
most cases usually the in the case of
Germany in Belgium it's 10 to 20 years
Japan's talking about 40 years these
things we've already seen them be put on
hold so it's entirely possible those
decisions can be put on hold or even
reversed in the future once the memories
of Fukushima fade and the realities of
you know what are we going to do instead
really sink in nonetheless I'm pretty
excited to see what Germany in
particular is going to be able to do to
replace that kind of capacity in the US
the response the impact in response to
the Fukushima accident has been pretty
modest overall the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission immediately put together a
task force to go gather lessons learned
from the Fukushima incident make
recommendations for what to do in the US
and response and their findings we're
pretty reassuring they call for some
clear actions but these are not you know
industry-changing or design changing
kinds of actions the first finding was
that there is no imminent risk and we
can go ahead continue generating nuclear
power the way we are there's no changes
needed no need to stop at the same time
they made several recommendations for
enhancing safety and not surprisingly
these focused on increasing the ability
to weather power outages for longer
durations and more back
and several issues related to the spent
fuel pools specifically increasing the
safety and redundancy of the cooling
systems of the makeup water systems and
of the monitoring systems to make sure
we know what's going on in these pools
and we can fix it quickly and there were
also several recommendations related to
more general emergency preparedness and
response and so while these
recommendations are certainly going to
lead to increased safety and they're not
likely to change the face of nuclear
power in any significant way in this
country my final observation about the
US response to Fukushima incident is
that after 35 years in this country
without a new start on a nuclear power
plant a less than a year after the the
Fukushima accident the second worst
nuclear power plant accident in the
world the Nuclear Regulatory Commission
issued new construction and operation
licenses to two new power plants nuclear
power plants in the US and Georgia and
so obviously these license applications
were in gear years before this and and
this is just the tail end happened to
coincide with this the fact that they
didn't put the brakes on it and I said
okay let's go ahead issue them it's hard
not to interpret that is a pretty strong
signal that the US has no intentions of
scaling back nuclear power and and that
we're going to continue to build and
grow as we as we had before so I just
want to finish up to repeat three
messages no electricity sources ideal
all right they all have strengths and
weaknesses and certainly nuclear is
chief among those it's hard to
unequivocally condemn or endorse anyone
and as a result preference is vary from
place to place in time to time and we
end up with a diverse mix of energy
electricity generation sources and I
think that's a good thing both for a
variety to appease different people's
preferences but also for flexibility it
takes a long time to build electricity
infrastructure and sometimes conditions
preferences can change a lot more
quickly than the infrastructure can
respond so by already having the base
infrastructure for a variety of
defending
perience base and then in the technology
base for a wide variety of electricity
sources the easier it is to shift among
them as oil prices go up or whatever may
happen those those things can happen
quite quickly and we want to be able to
shift our energy production in response
a second is we appear to be at a real
turning point with regards to managing
spent nuclear fuel for forever we have
just been sitting on it leaving it at
nuclear power plant sites the plan we
had in place has imploded sort of the
sort of the one-two punch of the of the
existing policy imploding and then the
safety risks being identified or
highlighted by the Fukushima accident
really leads us to the point where I
think we've got to make a change and the
Blue Ribbon Commission recommendations
are probably the direction we're going
to go and there's still a lot of details
to be worked out but I suspect you will
see some movement in that area pretty
soon in the near future and then finally
the response to the Fukushima accident
has been pronounced in a few ways but
overall you know relatively modest and
not terribly surprising some countries
that had previously decided to abandon
nuclear power sort of return to that
position some countries that never
wanted nuclear power reaffirm that
position some countries have slowed
growth a little Japan maybe will be if
they if they stick with it the biggest
change for sure going to no nuclear
power but in many other countries as I
said there's been no change and so
overall perhaps the biggest surprise is
that is that as horrible as an accident
like this may seem it hasn't really
affected the industry that much around
the world and we should expect to see
nuclear power continue pretty much along
the path we've seen before hi I wanted
to ask about two things not directly
related to nuclear power but to where we
should where we should spend in order to
get the energy we need so one thing is
just to spend to produce more energy and
there's also spending in order to reduce
the amount of energy we need so
I saw a talk last night the TED talk was
talking about some of the chief
scientist of I don't remember the name
of the company Rocky Mountain industry
something like that but there he was
talking about Empire State Building and
how they're doing this retrofit and
we're going to recoup the costs in three
years by making more efficient more
efficient cooling system more efficient
windows so forth but he was basically
kind of extrapolating from this that
there's lots of opportunities for things
that are inefficient right now in terms
of their use of energy and that market
the market will do it won't even need to
be just because it's greener but that
people can save real money by making
these things more efficient he also
talked about smart grid and energy
storage either through if electric cars
become a lot more common they could be
form of storage and then there's this
guy from MIT you came up with this
system for storing energy that is
similar to how aluminum is so anyway
this what he taken all together this
guy's argument was that actually will
need as much energy as we think based on
the extrapolation just on the growth of
introduced energy usage now and then
maybe we won't actually need nuclear
power coal power by 2050 because of all
these other things that are transpiring
so this one curious for your thoughts on
that we'll just all bs or is this no no
not not in the least that's all
incredibly important and it's getting a
little outside my area of expertise but
for example the building stock the case
you raise first there's there's
tremendous low-hanging fruit there
however it's not only expensive to
retrofit and it's it's oftentimes very
very slow to make
these changes and I think part of the
challenge there and I could I'm not
certain about this is is that it's sort
of at an individual not quite an
individual user but very very
distributed level these decisions need
to be made and there's as you're
probably aware state and federal
agencies go to great efforts to develop
programs to increase awareness rebates
all kinds of incentives to get people to
do the kinds of things you're talking
about and and the savings particularly
in the building stock are potentially
tremendous I I agree but you know I
don't know enough about the numbers to
sort of say what we really could
realistically envision saving and what
that means for power production capacity
development in the future but absolutely
that's a that's an integral part of our
energy policy particularly in the state
but even in the nation and Ayn Rand is
now and in the past working on analyzing
and evaluating different programs like
this both direct to consumer as well as
to industry to increase efficiency
whether or not the cost argument really
you know it's a funny thing because you
can ask yourself why don't I put solar
panels on my roof you know there's
tremendous and nurse against these sort
of things I don't clearly understand the
behavioral aspects of it but I think
part of it being distributed amongst so
many individuals has it once great
strength but it perhaps is it is one of
the impediments to again I'm not really
certain about the numbers so you only
talked about conventional nuclear maybe
are we going to be saved by maybe new
technologies new here well you know I
didn't I didn't talk about that it's a
good point and I frankly I don't know a
tremendous amount the new about the new
nuclear technologies they're always
getting new every new generation is much
much safer and you know to some extent
more efficient for example the new new
reactors going up in Georgia are going
to have inherent safety system on the
cooling pools that supposedly you won't
need active cooling
to be designed in such a way the passive
cooling will keep the spent fuel cool
enough or keep the water from
evaporating things like that are
happening all the time what this mean
you know we hear a lot about a bunch of
experimental nuclear reactor types and
there's been a tremendous amount of
research and there will continue to be
in the Department of Energy whether and
how that change is a fundamental
question of how much nuclear versus
other sources I'm not sure about I think
there's some sort of more global view of
nuclear that sort of regardless of the
particular technology so you talked
about a plan to centralize where they're
going to store the nuclear waste are
there any security risks surrounding
that like terrorism for example that's a
very valid question I think the
consensus we came to is that it's not
particularly better or worse than having
it distributed around at different
locations around the country you know
there are advantages to centralizing the
security force and building it the best
way possible once or maybe twat you know
one or two of these places so you can
you know concentrate more effort on it I
think some of these plants it's a real
burden keeping this stuff secure and I
don't know the track record of how well
it's done so I don't think there's you
know our conclusion was there's not a
big difference it's it's it's in the
wash you mentioned now to nearby reactor
locations north and south of here both
in terms of public reaction and the way
the plants are managed they seem very
different obviously the currently
operated by the same company but the
designs are very different one of the
things that recently down in sudden off
ray they've mentioned is surprising
about dia the damage on the tubing are
there any other plants that inherited
the same design assumptions that you
know elsewhere in the u.s. that might
inherit excitement that coming out of
San Onofre because presumably the fact
that nobody's talking about it for
diablo mean implies that the Diablo
zions artifact by the unexpected
findings you know that's a great
question I haven't heard anything and I
don't know enough about the designs of
the plants around the country to answer
that I think there are there are many
different designs out there and and
they're individually tailored for the
site of the seismic risk here in west
west coast of California is different
than other places so my suspicion is
that there are a tremendous wide range
of designs out there and I just don't
know about which might be closely linked
to San Onofre is one of the things that
I surprise us is just how fast Japan
ramp down there online nuclear
generation recently has have you seen
whether they've got enough capacity to
make it through the next year with that
effectively happen to take brownouts
how's it looking I don't know that's
another great question this is now what
it's May it's getting hot and you you
all may remember last summer anyone in
Tokyo didn't wasn't allowed to wear a
tie they had metal jackets they had no
lights and they had all these are
essentially sort of austerity
temperature austerity policies and they
made it but it was a struggle and I
think they had some nuclear running last
summer go ahead a fair amount so I i
would love to look into that i haven't
had a chance to go sort of talk to my
colleagues and look in the newspaper
articles about what those what those
plans are but I imagine it's going to be
very tough because unlike Germany which
you know they can kind of just
effectively run wires from their
neighbors in a sentence use the coal
from somewhere else Japan can't really
do that they're an island and set of
islands and and without those nuclear
power plants I'm not sure how they're
going to make ends meet thank you very
much
it's a pleasure to be
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
