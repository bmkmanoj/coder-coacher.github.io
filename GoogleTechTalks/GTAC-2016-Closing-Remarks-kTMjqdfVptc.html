closing remarks I know picking up from
this year one of the themes I saw was
that we have so many testing tools
available to us now that the big problem
is how do we run so many tests that
we've written what a time to be alive
what a difference from gtech ten years
ago where the main focus of testing are
talking was what tools can we use to
actually do automated testing so we've
come a long way it will be interesting
to see where we go ten years from now
will it be how do i test however how do
I slim down all these hundreds of
thousands of tests I'm running on my
devices that was my take away from it
and I'm sure you have your takeaways as
well you can keep the discussion live on
the attendee mailing list that we have
going around I hope you all make good
connections here it with all your fellow
attendees so keep the discussion going
that's a big part of what this
conference is all about let's give a big
round of applause for all the speakers
we had this year
I think we had a excellent agenda and
all the talks were outstanding so thank
you speakers for donating your time to
contribute to this I give yourselves all
a round of applause for attending it's a
real thing you can applaud yourselves
you donating your time to come here and
be a part of the discussion in the
community to further these ideas it's an
important part of what keeps this
conference alive but let's keep the
applause going I want to shout out to
all the organizing committee members who
put this on most of them are here and
you've seen scurrying around the room
but yes as I mentioned at the beginning
this is all volunteer time for all of us
we do it because we feel this is a
really important conference to have and
we really enjoy seeing the talks and
ideas that come out of it and once again
let's thank our AV team who did a great
job all the two days thank you all and
again for Lauren Terry our real-time
captioning who furiously kept up with
the entire conference hall all two days
it's really amazing every time I see it
to give them a round of applause
and there's probably more people to
thank but you're probably all clapped
out and you're probably interested in
knowing about 2017 as well anyone
interested anyone anyone willing to take
a guess where gtech 2017 might be next
year Mars good guess that all account on
SpaceX how fast they can develop if we
can have it on Mars all right enough of
the suspense London back to London 2017
so yes we will come full circle and we
hope to see most of you there again next
year we will be announcing call for
speaker proposals and invitations to
attend on our testing blog so be sure to
subscribe follow the testing blog and
all announcements will be made there
once again thanks everyone for coming
don't forget any of your purses luggage
anything as you leave and hope you had a
great time have a great trip back from
wherever you are</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
