showing up today it listen I like to
ride my bike around the city I mean
that's I prefer to commute that way and
you know it's not always the easiest
thing to do which is why the bike
coalition is here to help us out and I'm
really excited the bike coalition
doesn't stop with bikes they think about
des treants they think about transit to
and how we can all work together so it
gives me on that note great pleasure
introduced kip hodge today she's going
to talk about the great streets project
which is looking to make streets better
for bikes pedestrians transit and in
general communities yeah thank you thank
you tougher hi everyone as Topher said
I'm kit Hodge I'm the director of the by
collisions great streets project it is a
campaign at the bike coalition and
partnership with spur another local
nonprofit of the support project for
public spaces which is an international
placemaking organization and liberal
streets initiative which among other
things publishes streets log who among
here read Streetsblog just curious one
really ok so our missions is pretty much
the only slide with text on it so don't
worry about that especially to return
our streets to be in great places and
doing it fast sort of more of this
startup mentality no longer waiting for
create great plans that never get
implemented sort of a Santa cool
affliction is to spend a long time
making plans that never go anywhere they
collect dust they feed worms etc I never
actually end up on the street so how do
we do that well let's take a lesson from
the phone world on the technology world
if you will back in the day when phones
were invented they were seen as a way to
democratize the world in part to connect
people the idea was that some people
might pick up the phone and call
anywhere and meet some new people and
similarly when highways were first
invented back in the early part of the
20th century but the idea was that
there's some kind of democratize the
world the country by opening up the the
country to people to go across
experience new things etc etc so what
has happened well in neither case did
that really happen and both happened and
didn't
them in the case of phones people tended
to more call their peers we're often
than not there's totally expand the
world that they interact with in case of
highways it's probably you guys all know
yes there is a lot more mobility the
same time we actually are just doing the
same stuff but further out now so
interestingly though the phone world and
this is sort of where we are right now
of course in terms of the idea of
highways taken to the extreme kind of
going nowhere in the phone world we've
adapted the companies got smart like
yourself and said well hey people don't
just want to do one thing make a
telephone call they don't do a lot of
things with their phones they want to do
email they want to do you know games etc
I mean how many apps are there right now
for the Android a lot right so the idea
being that when you have more options
for this particular device people can
use them in different ways it's not just
one thing or bust so how can we apply
that mentality of sort of a diverse set
of opportunities over the same platform
to streets rather than just having the
this kind of situation where you only
have one thing going on it may serve
some purpose but isn't kind of be out be
all end all for most people so this is a
tiny graphic and what it shows is a
range of things that you could do with
your streets it's everything from having
street trees to block parties and play
streets and I want to go through some of
these ideas and talk about how can we
use our streets to be more flexible take
advantage them so they're not just sort
of a monoculture but they reflect all
the different ways that we all want to
use our streets so backing up a step we
base all of our work on the idea of a
great place there are four aspects to a
great place one will be sociability uses
and activities axis and linkages and
comfort and images and around this green
area are some adjectives to describe
these different qualities and then I
know since you guys are poor data
focused the blue area is actually ways
that you can measure these qualities so
if you look at a great place they should
reflect all four quadrants and not just
be one thing or another
and we go to our streets right now they
may sort of dominate in one area but
don't tend to encompass the full range
here so how can we get I don't know
perfect bullseye for lack of a better
phrase and get the full experience well
here's a few different ideas so this is
strange and i can't speak Danish to
apologize if any of you are native
speakers and our horrified by my
pronunciation strut Jetstream Copenhagen
it used to be a regular street with cars
going through it pedestrians cried into
the sidewalks one bike straight trains
etc and now it was converted to a
pedestrian Plaza so the very typical of
European intervention and crucially
actually in Asia as well just sort of
taking on the street and turning it into
a fully pedestrian area with all kinds
of interesting stuff a fountain lots of
retail other sort of points of interest
tables and chairs etc so this is a sort
of a traditional European model this is
one of my favorite things in the world
actually this is a paris plage has I've
never been there of curiosity this is an
excellent example of sort of an
adaptable street it's normally a highway
georges pompidou highway along the sun
and a few years ago the government said
how can we increase happiness for
everyone in the city in gallatin way
well why don't we bring gallons of sand
and beach umbrellas and put them on the
highway and turn into a beach during the
summer sure why not so suddenly you have
this amazing beach it's incredibly well
used for a large portion of this highway
and there was trial there were a few
different summers in the Sun and now
it's been turned permanently into sort
of a promenade with all kinds of
different uses and one side and then on
the other side it's turning to calming a
highway into more of a Boulevard feeling
so again the idea of experimenting with
streets taking into a logical MF assist
Trafalgar Square in London anyone ever
been here well if you have you might
have been there before it was turned
this area didn't exist it was a big
traffic rotary and they took it over and
turned into this amazing pedestrian
Plaza very similar to what happens in
Copenhagen but again thinking big about
how do we actually get people to be able
to get to that monument in the middle of
the street because right now before this
was turned over
couldn't really get there without
risking your life this is also one of my
favorite images this is a street in
Barcelona and you'll notice that yes it
has all kinds of great things going on
seating facing the right way protected
bike lane you know various parking
facilities planters and a car path and
green arif now look at these materials
these are in our expensive materials by
and large these are relatively cheap
materials you have paint a little bit of
plastic planter and sort of well-placed
benches and poles and there you have it
you have and you know sort of a modern
Street with all kinds of different uses
is again taking in sort of the base form
of the street and rethinking it adapting
it to modern desires so New York got
wise to his European examples a few
years ago and said hey what can we do in
the US and particularly in New York to
emulate some of this stuff we can't
afford to do sort of a european-style
big Plaza what can we do well so they
looked at a street near downtown
Brooklyn sans street near the courthouse
one of the traffic engineers at the
department of transportation there was
having lunch during a jury duty break
and said hey there's nowhere to sit so
he went out and said well why don't we
put down some planters some tables and
chairs and turn it into a little plaza
so it's a super cheap intervention that
as you can see is very well used you
know not the most lovely thing but it's
incredibly effective it's the least sort
of least effort you can make to have a
good result come out and that was from
people a guy who is really he had a
driving love he had driving shoes really
into his car so instead of an antique
our statement at all so saying we want
to have other things going on in our
streets so they began to scale that idea
up this is Madison Square in midtown
Manhattan before and after before you
can see it's sort of a very dangerous
crossing but after and you have a
separated bike lane that's green
expanded pedestrian area tables and
chairs and you'll see it goes all the
way up here again very well used managed
by the local business improvement
district and then they said hey let's go
further why not turn Times Square into a
pedestrian Plaza too so this is the day
after
and this is sort of what looked like
before if you were trying to take a
photo of yourself and Times Square a
while ago you would have to huddle and
be lucky that you can get hit by a car
in the middle of the street so they put
down you know blocked it off some orange
cones and they forgot to order chairs so
the day before they went into a local
hardware store and bought some lawn
chairs before they put them down people
were already in them so you know very
cheap intervention that since become
I'll show you a more permanent version
again both of these in a trial basis to
see if they worked and to collect data
around them so Sam Scott has been taking
that same idea and applying it here this
is a portion of the seventeenth Street
Plaza over in the castro is that Castro
17th and market zuman been there great
okay so as you know when it was first in
not really the most lovely place but
very effective we've actually clicked
collected data about it studied how is
being used and not only of course did it
drive more people to be there and to use
it more often but also increase the
sense of community character which i
think is a very important change and
impact of these kinds of interventions
so the city is through its payment to
parks program been looking for other
opportunities to be doing this and
there's a few examples throughout the
city now roughly three and looking for
more some on their way very exciting and
in the micro it's also been adapting
something that's very exciting which is
sort of taking parking day if you're
familiar with that to an official level
this what's called a parklet it's a
divisadero it's a raised platform let's
flush with the curve and then has
planters seating tables and chairs and
there's bike parking at the other end if
you've ever been there it's packed
almost twenty-four seven which is great
it's an area that has relatively narrow
sidewalks and for those of you are like
well why don't they just build with
sidewalks begin with so it's very
expensive here in the city to build out
sidewalk so for many years areas that
could really use it let the castro like
north beach etc there's been a real
struggle about how do we do that when
it's so expensive influence desired so
this is a really fascinating way of
taking that problem on again on a trial
basis in partnership with the business
their mojo cafe which everyone should go
patreon is i hope by
sandwich good sandwiches there and
they're going to see how this works it's
about a six month intervention they'll
see how it works we're doing data
collection around it looking at the
impact to other businesses and there's
more coming online there's one already
at twenty-second street in the mission
which is slightly different design I'll
be ones in north beach in the inner
richmond and they'll be lots lots more
coming soon the city is working on a
permit to make this successful to almost
anyone this is very exciting so the next
level up would be as sunday streets this
is a sunday streets from last year in
the mission by the way it's happening
again this sunday in the mission i
encourage you all the tents a lot of fun
it's more of a recreational ideas based
em came out of bogota colombia where
they closed down you know really huge
number of streets every sunday in the
city and you can bike or walk or run or
hula hoop or i don't know i guess you
could crawl if you really wanted to or
scuba dive through this huge course and
it's a way to have some healthy activity
and throughout the city that's a bit
available to everyone and that connects
different neighborhoods it's also just a
lot of fun anyone ever been to sunday
streets yeah yeah so you guys like it
have fun yeah and often it happens out
here in embarcadero this is another idea
from New York sort of taking the idea of
Sunday's streets and thinking can we do
it more often and instead of a smaller
scale area that impacts other
neighborhoods this is a street in the
downtown Brooklyn area broadly speaking
it's called weekend walks and it's
taking sort of a mini area of a
commercial corridor and turning it into
sort of a block party atmosphere minus
the tube socks minus the funnel cakes
minus sort of the more raucous
programming it's really bad just
bringing people out to enjoy the street
and taking a second look at the
businesses around there on a Sunday and
that's growing and growing similarly
there's a sort of phenomenon called play
streets which is very specifically
tailored to having more space for kids
to play and if you live in a
neighborhood where there aren't
accessible parks or for whatever reason
it's hard for your child to play safely
without supervision this is often a good
solution to that where you open up the
street the people the families to have
organized activities for playing this is
one in queens and jackson heights in new
york city they also exist in chicago and
though there's a great a new thing
called the mission community market here
in san fran off this saturday from 11 to
three on twenty-second street off of
mission that's going to be a hybrid of a
market in a play street as well so i
encourage you to take that take a look
at that especially if you have kids or
known people who do so this is actually
a block party from in san fran the dopa
area from last year instead of the other
almost most basic opportunity to sort of
do your streets a little differently
taking advantage of a different way
adapt them the most you know American of
things the block party the summer block
party a lot of fun just go to permit you
out you have some very informal activity
and you enjoy your streets and you meet
your neighbors but not too much
hopefully for those of you who have
concerns about knowing your neighbors
too well so just come back for a second
all these ideas are ways that again
they're kind of like applications on a
phone right their applications for a
street and the idea that from the great
streets project is to make all these
easier for anyone to try you know they
may not be appropriate for every street
they certainly aren't but if you have a
desire to do a play street you know
sunday streets would have you you should
have the tools pill to do that yourself
or work with community groups etc to
make that happen so we're trying to make
those more accessible to everyone and
have streets be more flexible and
reflect for many different desires of
people to use them differently so
turning to the most iconic street in san
fran archit street you guys aren't it's
not quite your backyard here but it's i
don't know what would you call a
neighborhood park if you will not too
far away and so the city is been working
on something called the better market
street project and it encompassed this
lower market street so roughly from
octavia which is sort of down there and
all the way to the Embarcadero here and
the idea is to take market street and
make it into a great place so using a
variety of methods to go beyond kind of
its its nature as not the friendliest
sort of not quite there kind of
place in spin spurred in part by yes you
know very basic need to repay the street
if you've been on a recently it's very
bumpy it's socially because you have all
those buses going through it's just not
very stable there's also Bentonville
worldwide movement to refresh main
streets and major cities often driven by
business interests but you know
widespread interest in making this
happen this is a rendering of Oxford
Circle in London I don't know if anyone
has ever been there before but a few
years ago the Business Improvement
District there got together and said you
know we can do better what we have is
not quite competing well with you know
out-of-state malls things that are
attracting people so what can we do to
spruce this up and make it a more
appealing place for people to come so
you know why not put a floating ring in
the sky why not why not sort of you know
add some more interesting lighting some
new sort of pillars here and some other
pavement improvements this is what the
overview from the nighttime perspective
was supposed to look like with some new
lighting improved payment rationalized
transit etc and then the daytime version
too so political realities have this way
and it still looks like this a couple
years ago because the political class
did not agree with the Business
Improvement District there so you know
not too dissimilar from Market Street
you have the boarding Islands you have
transit you have boarded off pedestrian
areas big transit portals and tons and
tons of people and lots of buses so they
couldn't do the full plan but what they
did do was take a cue from Tokyo and try
to do something a little bit better this
is a diagonal crosswalk so you can see
people crossing different ways and if
you look back to the previous photo
these are blocked off so you couldn't do
that moving before so if you wanted to
get from here to there or here today are
you had to go a long way around so what
they've done there is knock those down
open it up add some programming above
add little sort of bumps here to protect
pedestrians from people turning and what
else do they do they improve the
boarding islands here by narrowing them
a tiny but actually and they altered
some of the pavement and this isn't a
very expensive intervention it's a
relatively cheap you know intervention
but what a difference that makes this is
22 again because I really like this boom
boom you know much nicer mr. New York
not just it somewhere has been doing the
same kind of approach to Broadway what
can we do is sort of short of a huge
master plan that may never get rebuilt
you know what coming to you immediately
that makes a huge impact so they've been
trying a few different things this is by
Columbus Circle coming down Broadway so
I'm going to give a whole panorama you
can see they've added a green separated
bike lane here tifton bike lane
conceding with tables and chairs and
greenery I apologize for the resolution
it's really terrible but it's the best
photos there are then Goethe scope scale
sensitive scope you see it's all up and
down the street there similarly and this
is so that the bird's eye view or the
street-level view and what that feels
like and I had you guys come over to me
who I'm a couple days ago who had been
there and who had never really biked
before and I said you know we never bike
before but lo and behold we found
ourselves biking through midtown
Manhattan saying hey look at us we're
riding bikes in midtown Manhattan how
the heck did that happen it's because
you suddenly have this protected bike
way that's a lot more safe feeling for
people who are not as comfortable on a
bike so this is the Times Square view
you can see it's turned into a
pedestrian Plaza so the next iteration
of it and it continues to be improved
from you can see that the scope of it
it's now turned into a it's going to be
turned into sort of a an artistic
statement of sort of a look of a river
actually hasn't been built yet herald
square a few blocks down used to also be
a very scary place to walk or to do
pretty much anything else also very
crowded now again a pedestrian Plaza and
then I want to turn to Taiwan because
you know it's not just about sort of
formal interventions you can also have
sort of streets that are really
ephemeral so this is a the Taiwan
tourist night market so during the day
is just a straight but at night it's
opened up for this incredible bustling
night market I know
actually been there myself anyone been
there no okay but looks like a lot of
fun it's another sort of rethinking of
the street of a major stream back in the
good old USA this is on Denver sixteenth
Street Mall the transit mall with the
separated by a bus way huge pedestrian
areas and a lot of things going on there
and if they can do it instead of good
old Denver we can certainly do it here
and then even in Bogota Colombia they
thought big about their main streets
this is downtown Bogota again not to do
some of a market street and you know
sort of a superficial way you have the
bus ways you have huge sidewalks with
all kinds of things going on biking
vendors trees etc it's very exciting
image and they can do it in a developing
country certainly we should be able to
do it here and then our favorite example
the champs-elysees ten lanes of traffic
usually and oftentimes will point to the
champs elysee of the grand boulevard the
world why can't we be like this straight
well even the Parisians are saying you
know it's not quite good enough so why
not turn it into a farm so for a few
days a couple weeks ago the young
farmers of France took over the sean
phillies a four part of it and turn it
into a massive farm complete with a
petting zoo and everything it's a huge
change you look at that too that it's
really really thinking the street
overall so here in Market Street this is
Market Street of your it's been through
many different iterations of course the
roar of the floor was the name for this
because you had four lanes of trolley
traffic and if you can imagine what it's
like now the noise managing back then
with that many trolleys very loud and
here we are today we're kind of in this
weird place right where we're not quite
comfortable we have it's not terrible
it's not great we're kind of waiting to
see where it's going to go this kind of
this middle ground right now so I think
this is a great representation of that
the city recognizes that so this is a
little bit cut off but so they've
launched this but our market street
project and the goal of it is again to
turn Market Street into a great place
they can be reconstructing the street
beginning in 2013 2014 and so they've
set some goals for what that process
will look like
it includes prioritizing the needs of
pedestrians transit users and cyclists
while comedy sorry vehicle traffic and
then also improving the public spaces on
Market Street to name a few different
items here so what they've done is
really interesting it's kind of
incorporating this new more flexible
view of streets into a traditional
process so what you have the usual sort
of public visioning with concepts
designs and engineering designs going to
actual implementation beginning in 2013
they've also added this which is cut off
startup phase where they've been
trialing and also different ideas and
introducing things right away to see how
they work and to inform the longer term
process very exciting it's kind of
taking the startup model implying it to
streets for a change and this is kind of
a huge deal for a city that's very
sclerotic like most cities so a lot of
work is based around this again this
place diagram so if in this initial
startup phase been doing a few different
things around in them very quickly on
the sociability phase they've been doing
this peoples and plazas concerts and in
public spaces along Market Street in the
use of some activities category just
some of the public art that's important
shuttered store fronts on the mid-market
area and then in the access and linkages
section there's now required right turns
or people who are driving alone on
Market Street it was at six and eight
Street initially and now it's at six and
tenth Street and this idea there is to
open up the street for transit to runs
more smoothly and also to improve safety
for bicycling and for walking not to say
taxi drivers love it too not
surprisingly another really fun thing
that's been happening and much more
pleasure is these new separated green
lanes on Market Street and this kind of
the very temporary version sort of just
get it out there of what you know Market
Street could like for look like for
bicycling you have these very basic
soffit posts they're just plastic posts
you know every few feet and then some
temporary green paint that's out there
just so you know how does this work does
it work is it making people safer our
more people bicycling and the responses
that we've gotten so far have been
overwhelmingly positive
mrs. supervisor Eric Mar with one of the
SF bike board members riding on it on
back to work day last but not least and
Powell Street last December there was a
trial to open up more pedestrian space
on that very crowded Street probably
many of you avoid Powell Street I'm
guessing because it's so crowded yes
okay I don't know anyone who tends to go
there if you live here because you love
to get jostle around by everyone so they
recognize that and working with a
business improvement district they took
barricades and just put them where the
parking lane would normally be it was a
little confusing and arraigned the whole
weekend so the trial wasn't very
informative however the city is now
working on with a bid I'm looking at
another more robust trial that would be
at level and much nicer potentially with
seating and other sort of programming
for the length of powell street between
ellis and geary street so if you can
imagine suddenly having a much you know
bigger pedestrian space with all kinds
of programming there could be very very
exciting social if you can do it fast
parklets style sorry last but not least
green pod and comfort in image section
this is that market street and if your
hotel but come often if you bike you
probably know it as a place where all
the tour buses back up but if you also
look there there's this sort of public
seating area and weiss is important is
that public seating was deliberately
removed from Market Street for many
years so there's actually no public
seating except for mechanics plaza near
new montgomery this is the first time
that public seeing has been added back i
think of ambiguity with this location
people don't recognize it as public
seating because it's sort of managed by
the private entity and that's a work in
progress but it's a nice step in the
this new direction of adding things back
so that can be a place where you can sit
down and cool your heels besides the
fire hydrant so this is the web page and
I apologize the URL is getting cut off
on the screen for the city's better
market street project and encourage you
to go there to give feedback there's a
whole feedback section here we can do
different ways Twitter or Facebook 31
etc and also keep abreast of what's
going on and then we also because people
don't usually like to do that
come to our we have a Facebook page
dedicated just to the better market
street project itself so encourage you
to become a fan of that and keep abreast
of what's going on there and so that's
Margaret Street project and that's all I
have so I guess the takeaway really is
that there's lots of different ways to
use our streets from small the large and
the city has been embracing a lot of
these right now and right now it's a
pretty exciting time and hopefully all
of you can get involved when taking
advantage of this new momentum and
applying them to your streets that I
happy to take any questions or comments
yeah yeah so there's an injunction by
the court that prohibited any kinds of
bicycling improvements for three years
for the last three years the injunction
was partially lifted and I should say it
was brought by a one guy one blogger and
one lawyer the Joshua is partially
lifted last November around Thanksgiving
so a few projects have been will go for
that have more of a temporary nature
things like she rose and very small bike
lanes and one green bike box on Scott
Street in the lower haight there's
actually hearing next week at the
judge's office to see whether he's here
the case again decide whether to lift
injunction completely and once that's
lifted then you know all the things have
been pent up for so long can be finally
implemented which is very exciting so
knock on wood they'll be fast to come
I
what can the same thing about the other
politics behind us you lose
supporting 33 mr. Lawson
you know I think what's really great is
that it's it's an unlikely set of
supporters happening right now you have
an incredible convergence of all kinds
of people who in the past we're very
skeptical of any sort of changes to
streets I think partly because it sort
of phrases like the are you a mac or pc
kind of you know version which is I mean
who cares right so right now I think you
have business folks who are behind the
stuff we're clamoring for it in fact you
have the mayor's office is very
supportive of many of these initiatives
you have all kinds of the agencies
supportive of it of course community
groups you're always going to have
people in temperature go or any city for
that matter opposed to any project if
you have to offer people apple pie then
probably say how dare you use X apples
or you know offer me on Monday as
opposed to Tuesday but it actually has
been incredibly supported and which is
very encouraging I think it speaks to
the pent-up demand for the sort of fresh
way of looking at streets is not just an
either or either all cars or all
something else that no one can think of
but it's kind of a more flexible space
where there's room for all kinds of
different stuff
other questions yeah
yeah so the cities aren't working on
that right now and helping them with
that and an idea is to have you know
people who have a certain set of
qualifications in terms of management
abilities because the house people
managed failed to do that and so
hopefully in the next few months will be
a version of that out there it'll be
continued to be trialed and proved as we
go along but it's a very exciting
opportunity so if you know businesses in
particular or nonprofits or other
entities who have you know management
capabilities who'd be interested in this
definitely let them know because this
will be coming down the pipeline and we
want to get as many into the ground as
possible yeah really great i always
wonder
you got a bit too clearly
so first of all there it's a public
space and I think it's a sort of ongoing
effort to make sure that's clear to
people and that people don't feel like
they have to go buy something from mojo
in order to use it and for any of the
park lights that's a very important
thing so that's a design issue that's
still in the works and we've gotten
feedback lots of different ways of
course I feel comfortable or no way do I
feel like I can do this so it's sort of
in the review process at this point that
said in terms of mojo's use actually i
called them let them know that there's
this coming down the pipeline and as I
knew that they were interested in doing
more bike parking because they have a
crash in particular and so they said hey
this sounds really interesting to you
have would be open to it the city was
looking for locations that would be open
for a demonstration project and so we're
looking for people who are ready to go
right away yeah yeah
yep so actually there's been a lady
who's been trying to do that there so
I'm happy if you give me your email
address i can connect you with her
because I think she's trying to when the
bureaucracy there to make sure it can
happen so yeah I think that's great is
that there's the city's gotten and I've
gotten a billion calls while a billion
exaggeration forgive me many calls ever
since you know these first one in saying
hey how can I get one and from unlikely
places to at way out in the western part
of the city as well as usual places like
you know south park that be kind of very
obvious kind of places for these which
is great do you have any feedback on
kind of what you guys would like to see
a market street it's kind of curious for
those of you especially who commuted on
Market Street whether it be surfers
below would have you yeah I find it a
hassle leapfrog with buses yes uh-huh
the general consensus yeah yeah I think
one of the challenges has been and will
be to figure out a way to I assume you
mean when you're on your bike right yeah
to make sure that the the bikeway is
continuous separated the whole way and
that you're not doing bus tag because
the vision is to have Market Street be a
place where you can have your young
child as well as your you know your
grandmother bike with you and feel very
safe the hallway if you have buses
coming in now that's not going to work
so there needs to be some sort of you
know algorithm that will speak to how to
do that will hopefully come out of this
planning process yeah any other thoughts
about market street that you guys are
especially eager to see or you're not to
see if that matter
era huh
yeah it's good to know I hadn't been
watered that cool and me I'm you just a
that back up basically it's um oops well
it's going to take forever and so it's
the visioning process should be kicking
off you know within the next few months
and then it'll be about a year or two up
to that process which will be public
meetings and other outreach things you
know usual kind of fun and then it'll
have to go to bond scenes engineering
and then get built out hopefully
beginning in 2013 the potentially 2014
yeah so unlike the private world you
know if you're in a public process
public project things take a long time
but actually for the cities is quite
fast so that's encouraging
I'm sick
right right so that it means a great
question and that planning process
there's a whole separate planning
process for that so that will you know
be an opportunity waiting for all kinds
of improvements there there's a newly
formed community benefits district there
which I think has a potential have a
strong voice in that process in terms of
saying you know what's do better than
what we have now which is pretty much a
traffic sewer right what can we do so
there's a lot of needs there certainly
but the Michael oceans vision is
definitely to have separated back ways
all over this city kind of like an
interstate but back ways and not going
too fast of course okay pull it sounds
like there's more questions so thank you
very much for your time tell everyone
you know</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
