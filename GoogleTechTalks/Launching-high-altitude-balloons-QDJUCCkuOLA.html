high-altitude balloons it's a new hobby
well not that new but first i'm going to
introduce myself is i'm a student at
university of waterloo in CS i'm
finishing my bachelor's this term and
this is just my hobby so I'm going ok
sure and so this is my hobby and this is
one of the picture taken from altitude
of about 30 kilometers so you can see
the curvature of the world you can see
the blackness of space so we refer to
this this altitude as near space because
space is defined at the altitude of
about 100 kilometers so this is about
one third of the way to space so we call
it neo space so
so why do it because bout balloon sir
it's a lot of fun when you launch
balloon to go that high and you can see
the curvature of the earth and you can
look
you
you
which was the case in my at my project
and you can use also cellular module or
a cell phone and basically it cell
phones don't work about 1 kilometer
altitude so you can only use it to
fatigue the position when it landed you
can't really check use cell phone to
track the whole flight up to 30
kilometers that that's what you need to
read you for if you like to track it all
the time which is fun so of course you
have Cameron sensors you can use sensors
like grabs your sensor temperature
sensors all kinds of sensors and of
course you have your antennas for gps
and then radio antenna and the cell
phone antenna so basically you can those
are the basic modules that you can use
but of course you can add actuators and
so on
so the ground system this is what I used
for my flight it consists of an antenna
so there's antenna on top of the car so
if you see some weird guys dying with
car in the weird antenna that's Joey
balloonists so and of course you have
cell phone to receive the final landing
position of your payload once its lands
and you have a gps receiver ideally to
get also in the position of your car so
you can compare where you are right now
and they will wear the balloon is so it
just gives you better overview of the
situation and laptop of course and car
because the distance involved there can
be one honey kilometers so it's not just
up and down it's also quite a way for
example e so this is here in this
picture this is the radio modem that I
used its 900 megahertz a modem which
does require license it has a range of
64 kilometers line of sight so if your
balloon lands far away from you it can
be can be assumed by he also treats and
then you don't get line of sight and
then you don't have any contact so this
is why cell cellular modules very useful
because you can cell phone coverage is
very good here and southern Ontario so
you can get the final landing position
without otherwise if you just use the
radio you might have a position at
certain certain altitude before it lands
and then you need to calculate where it
actually lands but it's all supposed to
the developed our module
so the first flight so I read about a
few some projects on the internet and
this is interested me a lot so I decided
to do it and it's just I'll just talk
briefly about well for the rest of the
talk basically about my took to flight
they made so I learned a lot and the
first flight didn't go so perfect but
sort of the components that I used was
the camera would USB connection so my
idea was to use the cameras which can
take pictures a high quality camera not
just the webcam but you can use the
webcam too so take the pictures and you
can reply computer scales the picture
down so that you can download it to the
ground while being in flight so that if
you lose the payload it's not it's it's
not so bad because you at least got some
data back some pictures back so to do
that I need a USB connection and I
needed a small computer which has a USB
host functionality so this is why i use
the gumstix is computer single board
computer called gumstix it's a very nice
very small it's like a stick of gum or a
small computer so it has USB host
functionality and it can run linux it's
600 megahertz and processor and so you
can you can run your scripts to control
basically the system using the gumstix
it's all red parrot actually for this
project but what I needed is a host USB
functionality and you can't get that
with simple microcontrollers otherwise
if you don't need that you can just use
a hot mega or a pic microcontroller
without if you don't need host
and I used the 900 megahertz radio modem
by extent and basically can transmit at
night 9600 mr. second which is done for
just to transmit little thumbnails
pictures but technically you can make
the system so that you can once you
receive the thumbnails you can select
which one you would like in high
resolution and you send the command to
the payload and ask it to send you back
a high-resolution picture basically what
you have is you have to remote formed
command prompt or the radio link so you
can actually send any command with my
first flight actually I needed to reboot
the computer because it crashed for some
reason so I send connector boot and came
back up so that was way cool so and what
I used the cellular module which
contains the GPS modules well it's the
GM 862 GPS and you can get it from
sparkfun for example so basically it has
the Python interpreter on the module
itself so it's a little GPS module let's
buy ten top interpreter and basically it
has also general-purpose input output
lines so you can actually use the module
as a center here for your payload and
just use this module to an OLAP your
payload but it doesn't have USB host
functionality so you can't use the
camera if you go with this much module
and that's good because it's good to
have two systems in case one fails which
actually happened in my flight so so
stellar module basically receives
commands using SMS messages and it can
it sends back the positions back using
also SMS messages so if your computer
crashed you can always get the GPS
position from the of the cellular module
and so basically have a backup system
which is very good to have but
so I also had the microcontroller board
which use it an atmel AVR
microcontroller and it was basically
used because i had the server to tilt
the camera up or down or all the way
down so and the arm come the Atma my
controller was used to send commands to
to control the server as what was used
to control the relays to cut down the
payload for example and it also was
connected to a pressure sensor and
temperature sensor so the pressure
sensor could be used to determine the
altitude because as you go up higher the
pressure decreases and decreases and
actually once you get to so the balloon
is very small the beginning of the
flight and it expands as it goes higher
because the pressure outside decreases
and eventually the balloon expands so
much that it the envelope cannot support
this expansion anymore and it just
bursts so after its own height it will
just the balloon will distend because
the believe the balloon has burst and
then and then it will just start the
standing so and then parachute hopefully
it will work and because you don't want
to crash into the ground at high speed
at 1am a spare power because then you
probably to break a lot of things but
it's good to have a payload that is that
can also withstand high crashes if in
case the parachute doesn't perform well
so it have you you should just what you
do is you add padding to the capsule and
hope that it helps ok so here we have
the see the components of a slide system
what we have here is the camera it's a
canon camera which supports the capture
of pictures using USB we have this servo
which can tilt the camera sideways down
or up or anything in between it really
it has this is the radio modem it it's
used to downlink pictures as well as
send positions and you get also the
command prompt using that it's connected
to the gumstix world x computing single
board computer here and you have the
this is the cellular module which
contains GPS so it's connected to two
antennas one is GPS antenna and what's
around there and there are sort of
things like relays and the voltage
regulation there's also memory key to
store the pictures and it was the flight
log of the positions so it when you
receive it you can actually get the all
the positions that it recorded not just
wants you to happen to catch using the
radio so this is what was used for first
slide okay power supply power supplies
lithium batteries those are very good
for because they can low work at low
temperature and the temperature can drop
down to minus 55 degrees Celsius so not
all the components are hated for that
temperature but you just hope that they
will work and mostly solid state
electronics should work at low
temperatures the problematic components
are usually the allocated electrolytic
capacitors for example so but you
definitely want to have a battery that
works at the long temperature because
that is away temperature sensitive so
some people so use energizer lithium
batteries those are very good for cold
cold as well by the way keep keep feel
free to interrupt me if you have any
questions
so this is the box when is packed up and
the first slide had the camera below the
payload and the phone was dead that it
couldn't sugar shoot up could only shoot
horizontally and down so and here at the
battery section so you can this rose the
bed is they actually still blood made
their batteries about 20 years old and
surprising that they worked very well
and very reliable too and there are 15
volts because they use five each one is
three volts and the power converter was
used to convert it down to 5 volts which
everything else works in five volts and
also the antennas this is the radio
antenna 900 megahertz and this is the
cell phone antenna you can use a small
step 110 but if you lend our in the
field it's better to have a good one so
it's a high-gain cell phone antenna and
here you can see the cellular in gps
module
so the first flight first mpm didn't go
so well because first of all I used
surplus military balloons which were
about 20 years old and would took a
while to to inflate the balloons so one
side of the balloon got heated and dicks
by the Sun and it expanded isometrically
so this you can see big heart I have
something I don't know and the next we
had two balloons actually and then the
next balloon that we had there wasn't
enough helium for that so the first
flight failed and way to go and try it
another day so waste can mega fail but
so basically I wanted to do another
flight as soon as possible after that so
i overnighted the couple of brand-new
balloons like latex balloons so in the
second attempt went very well but the
problem was that the camera stopped
working at the Pattillo at altitude I
didn't go didn't the camera didn't work
up to 30 kilometers as I would like it
to work but and but it had it tested the
down downlink of thumbnails so that
worked white well we could actually see
the thumbnails on the next page actually
and the radio signal was lost at six
kilometers and the problem was that on
the ground we used the hike
omnidirectional antenna so because of
that it wasn't it wasn't very
directional it didn't have high gain in
in one particular direction so it's
better to use a directional antenna like
a yagi antenna which is which basically
looks like a ladder with bars across it
so I think if we we use the yagi antenna
it would have worked to the to the
altitude completely so and also the
another poem was the GPS chips that
failed at 24 kilometres and it never
came back so how do you get the payload
bag if you
don't know the position even though it
is bonded to the SMS commands the GPS
mode the seller module we couldn't get
back the position so that was bad but
luckily Italy we got the Cobra also at
the back-up plan which is basically just
phone number on the capsule so that's
the third method to repeat the capsule
if you lose everything here so this like
an actual ok so there's also a light
label on the cap on the payload it says
that is harmless experiment because you
never know what if somebody finds it and
then they made panic you know like with
those flashing LED signs right yes
exactly and I actually it was very funny
story I'll show you this is the show the
launch of the balloon we launched about
100 objects from Waterloo because jess
team wind at the altitude of 10
kilometers so it blows one direction
well it changes a little bit so you need
to select the location so that such that
you don't land in the lake and we here
in southern Ontario surrounded by all
the lakes right so this is one of the
problems so we selected a location about
100 kilometers from here it's a town
called luck now so with a name like that
you want to succeed it so those are the
thumbnails that it downloaded in flight
some of them so they are there more so
this is the quality that the thumbnail
size is pretty decent you can see the
fields and the peace and clouds
so we launched in lucknow and it landed
straight in kitchener hahaha and
actually so it barreled 21 honey
kilometers and blended right in the town
it's what what are the odds so exactly
and that is this is where it landed yeah
yeah it's so it's one guy saw it land
actually and he called us and we went
there and got the payload he was of
course surprised to see land so we
actually interview team also well I have
a video of that but I didn't prepared
for them today so so yeah what are the
odds so this is it tour is the jet
stream sufficiently predictable die
rough is this cone in a way yes you can
there's their programs that can predict
and they actually used one program like
that but it does usually it doesn't
estimate everything correctly because
you never know what does the actual
accent rate of the balloon is and what
does it is tender it is so yeah
yeah you do past a certain volume of
helium so you should usually the law
definitely and get the permission from
transportation of Canada before you
launch but I'm not lower so I can I
can't tell you exactly what what you
can't what you can't do so so the what
we learn from the flight is that you
should insulate the camera because the
camera stopped working it may have been
a temperature related problem so the
camera was open actually it was not
there was no styrofoam nothing so it's
bad to insulate the camera just for
security and also USB cable might have
been detached in flight because the
capsule moves a lot so and USB cable you
never know is this this interface is
very complex compared to other interface
Luxio so so it definitely should solder
it instead of just using connectors and
select a better gps module one that
doesn't fail above twenty four
kilometers because actually there's the
requirement that gps modules should
because the US government doesn't want
to use them as for missiles so for
consumer gps they're set some
requirements above certain height if a
certain height is reached and the gps
modules traveling at certain speed then
it's supposed to stop this requirement
by the US government but a lot of
manufacturers don't implement correctly
so even if you break one condition it
stops working and this was actually cf3
gps module which is supposed to be very
good we since that sensitive but it
doesn't work at altitude so and it's
better to choose a day so the wind case
is the way from towns because yeah even
though it's good to retrieve it if
everything is broken you don't want to
land on somebody better even though this
I'll talk about risks later but its belt
reduces
okay second flight because the first
flight would kind of disappointing even
though we get the capsule back and if
you get the capsule back it's a good day
but the disappointing because we didn't
see the curvature of the earth but
instead the blackness of space so we
went for the second flight they actually
it was linked just one week after and it
actually was in october eight so it's
about one year ago so it was the same as
first by payload but what i did is
instead of using USB this time i
soldered directly to the camera buttons
so you can use the you can just control
the buttons of the camera using the
microcontroller and this is has this has
advantage that you can switch it the
camera to video mode so you can also
take videos but the disadvantage is that
you don't cannot down like thumbnails
susu tato so but for this for this slide
a I wanted to get the pictures back and
I didn't want to risk that the camera
system breaks again because use these
complex protocol you know you know know
what's going to happen it's well it
wasn't very reliable and tests on the
ground so I decided to do it with the
buttons so this is how it looked and now
I attach the camera site on the side
this has the advantage editing can shoot
up as well as down in sideways so
basically you get all all angles you can
see the balloon you can see the
parachute and also you can see the
ground you can also see the horizon and
to my knowledge this was the first
flight that use a tool to the camera
system and amateur ballooning so
so this is the video of the launch it's
about 1 minute long so here we're just
close the payload and seal it using glue
gun and this is the helium tank we're
inflating the balloon now you have to be
careful and you don't use your hands
because the sweat can influence the
envelope adversely
so what you need is you need to have a
certain need to have a certain mass of
helium and to do that we just use wait
to get the correct weight because you
want to pull it with a certain certain
number of kilograms so that sense it
correct rate you don't want it to ascend
too fast because it will burst quickly
or you don't want to go to a sense to
slowly because it will take a long time
to get get up to altitude so here we are
launching and you can see the parachute
as well
we'll go no
and it's the rise is pretty quickly so
you can see on good days you can see it
up to the maximum altitude but this was
very very warm day it was a lot of a lot
of moisture in the air so that produce
very nice clouds but it wasn't so much
visible from the gowns but it also
visible up to very high altitudes still
and this is we go to retrieve it we
found the location of the balloon and
we'll use google earth so this program
is actually receives messages using SMS
automatically as well as using the head
you and it connects to google earth
using kml which i refresh periodically
so this is how you get the positions
galore i still need to work out on a
model for the balloon 3d model for
google earth so the actual landed on the
farm is time so away from people which
is good so of course we asked for
permission to to get on the farm and to
get the poet payload from the farmer and
there it is it didn't parachute failed
mostly so cash pretty badly but we step
out the position back so that was good
actually the gum stick computer stopped
working so it's good to do it back up
for the Pearl the python module
again with a little bit dirty but still
works and here we see the flight path in
Google Earth you can download it from
the USB key that we used in the payload
so it when they landed here
so I'm getting the memory card from from
the camera to get the pictures back and
videos and here we see the videos for
the first time I was way cool haha so
that was vehicle that's what you do it
for this is I'll show the videos later
it was about 30 kilometers this one
particular so those are the videos from
the flight this is it rising still about
10 kilometers altitude so you see the
balloon is actually quite small right
now if you remember the size of the
balloon is about one half of the of the
screen and if you look at later videos
you'll see that it's almost the whole
screen so this is 14 kilometers it's
also already above altitude that most
commercial airlines fly this is 22
kilometers see it's less less win now it
doesn't rotate that quickly anymore
so I we expected the capsule to vote it
because of the mainland you can never
predict what the shape will do with the
capsule yes the USB memory key was 4
gigabytes and the SD card for the camera
was also 4 gigabytes it was more than
enough actually so this here you see the
balloon is way too big now there's still
a little bit of wind at that altitude 30
kilometers almost so so that's I think
the maximum were almost the maximum
altitude just 100,000 feet and it's way
slow now almost no wind compared to the
previous videos the pressure is way
along here so it's where your peaceful
so a delta to de belem expands too much
and bursts and then everything comes
down and you hope that the worst is
clean so there's not a lot of bits of
the the balloon still remaining but here
you see the bits of the balloon in the
wind and there the tangling with the
parachute so that's why it landed so
hard the parachute was see the parachute
is closing and opening again and then
closing and opening again it's tangling
it still had uses the speed but not as
much as you wanted to so that's the
problem very hectic compared to so it's
already four kilometers and you'll see
that the camera will they will form
condensate on the camera because it went
from cold to warm very quickly and you
can see the content state on the camera
from the air
after that it did this the last video
actually where it landed
and some pictures from the slides as
well as this is just less than one
kilometer and the balloon is the site of
the balloon is very small if you see
it's less than half of the width of the
picture so you'll see that the balloon
will be much bigger okay just looking
down it's just some PA launched just
about the farming fields where we
launched so you can see that this is one
kilometer almost and you can see the
moisture the day was weighing there's a
lot of moisture in the air and what were
you warm but also very moist you can see
that this picture so it's already eight
kilometers it's looking down you can see
towns and you can see rolls so the boom
poor man's satellite and this is
interesting the camera actually had a
orientation sensor of course you never
know where the dome entation sends it
works well on the vibration so what this
still was waiting text because the
camera sometimes goes to the side and
tools where you in funny ways so this is
eighteen kilometers that's already
higher than help airplanes fly airliners
so spy planes and you can see the lake
huron here it's the coast it's 21
kilometers
that's so early 25 200 very nice Club
Pony formations so this is how the
balloon looked like a 27 about 28
kilometers so you can see it's much much
larger than it was in the beginning and
that's because of the pair of pressure
low pressure and the balloon expanded
okay that's 27 kilometers
looking down conceit clouds a lot of
clouds between ice formation
so you can see the curvature of the
earth you can see this the space above
is almost black so it just shows you how
how thin atmosphere is you can actually
get get there with just very primitive
tools you don't need to be in space
agency to this to get above the
atmosphere about most of the atmosphere
question yep so from the peak altitude
what's roughly the same time touchdown
the same time is about 20 minutes total
flight is about 20 or 30 minutes total
fight is about two hours told depends on
ideally you want to select ascent rate
which which is as low as possible but
you don't want it to ascend for five
hours because then it will drift too far
away so you always it's a balance
between us and 28 and how far you want
to get up because if you choose the
lower center eight then you can get
higher up actually yes sir and it's
actually the program that you use to
calculate the trajectory sexual has some
values those values you can input or
it's hard coded depending on which
program you use so it's not always
correct because you usually you can't
estimate it especially when the
parachute is the parachute is opening
and closing keep it's basically
impossible to dig that so this is the
first image of the parachute at 27
kilometers it looks nice but tangling as
we've seen the videos so now it's
getting down still get the views along
long day so that's about the altitude
that airlines fly so
so six kilometers and this arrow shows
where it landed so it took a picture of
the landing location so I correlated
with the GPS location and Google Maps
that's how i've got the arrow okay and
yeah get a question so because you have
spinning it's actually not not that bad
in the because you get many angles and
you can actually create panoramas and
Aramis so you can do that this is made
for my video because my camera actually
took videos horizontally just a few
times not every every fourth fifth image
was taken horizontally so that's not not
a good trait to take holy panoramas next
slide maybe i'll use take pictures more
often or horizontal because they look
nice action so this was made from video
just getting the frames out of the
videos and then using an outer stitching
program it's out colorado plan a pro so
you don't have to do any work in program
just uses sift features i believe to
correlate images between and assemble
them so once you have that you can also
know cause do that which is just a polar
for mapping of the panorama so you can
see the all of the horizon certainly
very nice view but of course that's not
really what you would see if you were
that altitude but it still gives a nice
representation so there also some data
besides pictures on the flight so
because pictures I look nice and so on
but data is also important so I had
their first reform
okay so it took 20 69 pictures and 58
videos each video over 30 seconds long
and flight duration was two hours like I
said payload mass with 1.5 kilograms it
can be lower if you if you use a
different components I didn't try to go
as low as possible but if you want to
get get way high you want to keep the
mast down so you can get up higher and I
can show you kml files of the flight
this was actually featured on the
unofficial google earth blog the KML
files loaded so that's the tragic story
this is where we launched and you can
this is the very typical profile if you
look like this it's very typical first
third a sense quite slowly and then here
just shoots up and then once it bursts
it goes down this is way too just the
pressure the pressure graph that's all
of course you can click on the pictures
and see the pictures then you point to
the flight haha i think the condensate
on the camera was way off so you don't
see much yeah see it's nothing so here
you can see something yeah unfortunately
so because the gum stick broke on
landing it stop taking pictures after it
landed so because the crash was played a
violin so you don't see any pictures
taking wild was waiting for us to get it
yes it's most 60 km/h about it wasn't
too bad the person still worked a little
bit but not as well as you expected so
you know I have the same a KML file only
with videos so you can actually there
are 58 videos it was fewer than pictures
but it's still way interesting because
then it's nice that the Google Earth
allows you to embed videos because then
you can use this if it works play it
see it's rotating the low altitudes it
was voting pretty very fast the sound is
actually the server it was it wasn't
calibrated very well so the server was
shaking the rivet just the same thing
again so this time it landed here and
we're here kitchen is here so it didn't
run kitchen this time which is good okay
so so this shows the graph of the
altitude versus time so basically in
this case the GPS module used was the
same so it bloke at 24 kilometres again
but this time i had the functionality to
reset the module once it doesn't send
GPS updates for a certain length of time
so it wants it to went past this
altitude reset itself correctly and now
and the GPS positions were back so how
so how did I get the this part of the
graph it's basically what i did is i
also had the pressure sensor so there's
a formula to get pressure from altitude
from pressure and you can you can match
those two graphs so this is bear ematic
altitude versus time is this graph here
gps LG G versus time is this guy so here
you can see the adjust you can adjust
this this this square graph of the
pressure you can adjust it and that way
you get the altitude from the pressure
sensor so it's basically an estimate but
it should be pretty close to what
actually happened ideally you want to
select a different GPS module which
works at altitude but
this shows barometric pressure versus
time so this is pressured our worth
about 300 meters above sea level this is
got hiring the pressure decreased the
way way low pressures and then this is
when it came back so you can see that
it's petty dramatic change of pressure
and it's very nice new station this
temperature versus time so I see we
started from about twenty thirty it was
way hot that it was about thirty
actually with the temperature and
decrease decrease it decreases and
instead something strange happens here
the temperature starts going up again
this is this is about 40-45 I think and
here the temperature goes back this is
actually supposed to happen this is the
trouble pause and this happens because
the atmosphere is way it's really
diluted so the pressure outside is very
low and when the Sun heats up the
capsule it the heat cannot dissipate
into the atmosphere so the Sun actually
heats up the capsule that's why the
pressure goes up so this is very well
known fact factor in the top o post and
this gas shows us very nicely and of
course once you start the standing and
gather to the dense atmosphere the
pressure the temperature goes up again
so this gas
yeah this was actually a freak day just
between storm and different storms so it
was I don't know haha hot so yeah it was
actually one day I didn't know so yeah
yeah yes so it's like it was actually I
wasn't sure on that day if I wanted to
launch or not because I trained before
so I didn't know how the weather would
be but this day it was started out
nicely but it was very worn Canada so
general comments so first I'll talk
about some risks associated with
ballooning because people often ask me
well don't you think it's there's a lot
of danger to that the balloon crashes
into an airliner for example or if it
hit somebody on the ground and actually
there are way many launches balloon
launches every day in canada in the
united states about 150 launch sites and
each one launches twice in a day for
example and weather services launched
balloons for decades already so and they
had never any cash with millions of
launches nagano ground nothing recorded
so it certainly seems that because space
is big so what are the chances very low
actually some calculations were made and
you can see this link and the risk of
hitting somebody on the ground is very
negligible it's about 1 in 5 million
flights you'll hit somebody on the
ground but the risk that it will be near
somebody it's actually quite high
because you still have people everyone
but so this deviation is also negligible
if you launch away from Arab major
airports if you even if you launch near
airports which you shouldn't do and
which transportation Canada would not
like and if you launch away from
airports if you launch near airports the
collision chance is still only one and
six hundred thousand so it's still way
too long and you can see the side
well I mean the mass is not similar of
the payload to say yes and the idea that
they also see it on the radar because
first of all the balloon is in the air
space where the airline is fly very
short amount of time it's not a UAV it's
not a flying UAB right so it just passes
through quickly yes yes those
calculations were actually made for you
a DS which we spend most of their time
in air space where airlines fly so it's
actually lower than that for balloons so
and it descends when it descends it's
also very quick it's actually quicker
than the ascent so it's way negligible
okay so this was the pretty simple
mission i'm sure most most of you will
be able to do to start doing it if you
want it so but this is a good a good
start because once you have basic flight
you can do more complicated missions and
one idea is to launch a transatlantic
mission from where I'm from Canada or
United States to Europe and here you
would use the zero pressure balloon
basically it's a balloon which doesn't
have a stretchable envelope like it has
a plastic or a similar material to
shopping bags so you can keep altitude
you can keep an inkjet theme which which
can bring you to Europe and you can all
you have also to calculate the of course
it's adjective before you do the launch
so it actually gets you to Europe so you
want to keep in Jets team so the way you
do it you once you get way low because
at night the balloon G stands to lower
altitudes and you don't want that so you
drop dropper wait so you can drop
liquids so that you can keep the
altitude and the helium is leaking all
the time out of the balloon because
kiram has very small molecules atoms so
it will leaks to the envelope all the
time
so you need some kind of ballast doping
mechanism in place to keep the altitude
and basically the idea of the mission is
survived also survived if you land in
the water for one month by conserving
power and having a waterproof package
and it's saltwater its way bad to
electronics so you definitely want to so
the idea is to have a satellite phone
because you need long-range
communication and you will communicate
using fegm satellites and you can send a
position as well as pictures and people
have also done missions one one group in
particular spirit of knocks wheel from
Knoxville university they have they came
500 kilometers to know to iron ireland
so from yes so they were quite
successful already but they didn't
manage to do completely to Europe yet so
this challenge is still open and they
used amateur radio hf radio which uses
Diane's here to bounce radio waves so it
can achieve very long long ranges and
it's cheaper cheaper radio than using a
satellite phone if you lose a satellite
phone you lose $2,000 example because
that's how much they are so if you keep
it cheap then you can do many launches
because many of them might not going to
succeed probably it's very complicated
complex so another another idea would be
to launched gliders so do you drop blood
there and try to land where where you
want to forget Paul in the landing field
that you determine and those launches
were also made by some people so but you
can always try new ideas so okay and so
if you if you want more information by
my pages here at the ball at the top
also there's a way you're good I receipt
channel on
we know this high altitude on freenode
and if you have any questions whatsoever
you wanted you want to do launch like
that so there's a lot of people who know
who have launched many times they have a
lot of experience so you can always ask
and another website is see you space
flight so also they made very nice
pictures in path slides way nice
panorama high resolution and there's
also wiki page it says a lot of useful
information you're interested in that
camp thanks okay so do you have any
questions this was the cost of the first
flight was about two thousand dollars
but it was over engineer and you can
certainly do it for much cheaper I think
you can do it for five hundred dollars
if you real dry so but at least 1,000 oh
if you have many tools for example you
have stalling station you have you have
the tools then it shouldn't be that that
expensive
and my question
okay thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
