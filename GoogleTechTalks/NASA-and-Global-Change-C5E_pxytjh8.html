you who don't know me I manage some of
Google's space initiatives which include
of course our relationship with NASA and
Google Lunar XPrize it is a great
pleasure that I can welcome my dear
friend and mentor Pete worden dr. Pete
worden here today as our guest speaker
Pete's had a great career in both the
Air Force where we met former Brigadier
General and now at NASA he is a
recognized authority on space to issues
and planetary defense and many would say
a space visionary on a personal note
pete has been a great friend he has been
a fantastic mentor through my Air Force
career he pinned on my captain's bars he
eats bugs with me solely for bragging
rights and i fondly remember Pete as
being the only person to have screamed
his lungs at me through a satellite
phone as I sat in a yurt in Mongolia
somewhere in the Gobi Desert without
further ado my dear friend Pete worden
thanks Stephanie by the way I have to
point out that Tiffany won the bug
eating contest with the snake blood and
whiskey drinking the previous winner was
me with the fried bat and Philippine so
we're working on some other things
that's why we're hoping to find alien
life on Mars but anyhow I am really
delighted to be here at Google to talk
to you about a very important topic and
I'd also like to say hello to everybody
in the cyberspace who I in the YouTube
world but what I'd like to talk about is
is an area that I think gets far too a
little attention it's the role that NASA
plays and has played in will play in the
environmental issues and problems and
solutions that face us and this is a
course a very very topical issue
it kind of got started a few years ago a
long time ago i would say before i was
born but I was about 18 when this
happened the United States used to go
deep into space this was Apollo 8 in
December of 1968 it was on the pad a few
days from from this date it launched and
it went to the moon this was probably
next to Apollo 11 the most significant
human mission that that we ever we ever
took is hundreds of millions of people
follow this around the world and as the
astronauts showed up in lunar orbit but
the reason I put this up here is that
not so much what they did in the moon or
what they saw on the moon but what they
saw from the moon this picture I think
maybe the most important picture ever
taken at least from space and maybe ever
take in period because for the first
time humans saw the Earth rising over an
alien planet that really started us
thinking about we're all in this little
blue spaceship and it looks awfully
small and awfully fragile and it was the
I think the beginning of a lot of the
the movement and understanding of what's
going on on the earth and focus on the
earth and this is a effort that is
really beginning to pay major dividends
but again i'm i'm not sure how much the
public or even the professional
community understands the degree to
which nasa has started this this
understanding of the of the
the real role that that we're going to
play so let's move ahead to today and
kind of ask the question is what is NASA
done to build on this legacy that we
begin a 40 some years ago well I think
we've done a lot we spent over 25
billion dollars on earth science in the
last 20 years and we manage a
constellation of spacecraft that
consists of 14 operational satellites
seven missions and development in over
1,700 research grants in fact nasa's
earth science program exceeds the
combined efforts of all other Sciences
programs in the world we observed or we
observe earth systems from the land and
ecosystem processes to the oceans and
atmosphere and all of these are the
systems that determine the Earth's
climate and this is one of I think what
what our head of science few years ago
called one of the government's best-kept
secrets and so when people say what is
the US government doing on this the fact
is quite a little bit and in fact we're
going to do a lot more and I'll talk a
little bit about what we're doing and
what more we're going to do now probably
the most significant set of spacecraft
is what an typical imaginative NASA
speak is called the a-train we followed
by the b train but it consists of a
series of satellites that are in the
same orbit that follow each other by a
few minutes and in some cases 12 hours
out of phase so we can observe day-night
cycles the first satellite is aqua it's
a great big satellite it's got multiple
instruments but it measures
precipitation rates humidity profiles
temper temperature profiles sea surface
winds and surface temperatures ice
temperatures snow soil moisture and so
forth on on it it has an instrument
called modis which may be our most
important earth imaging system that
images the entire Earth and 36 spectral
bands with about 250 meters per pixel
solution there's a twin modus on another
satellite called Terra which I'll show
you in a second and I want to emphasize
that some of these satellites are built
by our colleagues and partners around
the world or as an upper atmosphere
satellite that measures the troposphere
of the stratosphere and mesosphere
measures temperature dust ozone and
essentially all the reactive chemical
species so this is the one where we
study items like the well-known ozone
hole over the Arctic and Antarctic
regions another satellite is the French
knez satellite parasol which is a kind
of a first of a new series of technology
satellites called a microsatellite this
is an area that that we're really
focusing on at NASA and particularly at
NASA Ames these are things that rather
than weighing thousands of kilograms
they weigh tens to hundreds of kilograms
and can do a lot of really interesting
work this is this microsatellite studies
the details of cloud aerosol including
droplet size shape density and turbidity
so this is a way to measure what's the
effect of pollutants in the atmosphere
on on cloud formation and in water
processes cloud sat is a cloud profiling
millimeter wave radar that's a thousand
times more sensitive than typical
centimeter wave radar and it can
distinguish between cloud particles and
precipitation the orbiting carbon
Observatory is is is the next one that's
going to go up it's a mission being
developed by our colleagues the South
the Jet Propulsion Laboratory and it's
the first ever space-based measurement
of atmospheric carbon dioxide and this
really should put to rest any residual
discussion about you know what's going
on in the atmosphere in terms of carbon
dioxide because it makes coincident co
registered in nearly simultaneous
science measurements from a whole range
of instruments now each of these
satellites are aligned
in orbital positions so the instrument
fields of view overlap and from one
satellite can be correlated to the
others and with data from each other's
so the whole some of these is greater
than the sum of its parts now i'm
particularly personally gratified by
this capability because about 15 years
ago I I had a job in Washington at some
place called the White House you might
have heard of it I think there's a new
occupant moving in in a month or two but
I was on something called the National
Space console and we were there to
coordinate all of the civilian and
military space programs and at that time
NASA wanted to build a giant 40 50
thousand pound satellite was going to
hang all these instruments on it sort of
a Christmas tree decorated with with
with dozens if not hundreds of
instruments and I and a few other
colleagues fought very hard to break
this thing up now the earth science
community thought we were all evil that
we just wanted to steal the money to go
spend it on space exploration which we
did but the but the key thing was that
by forcing these guys to go to small
satellites and smaller satellites we've
now made this a much more flexible
system that can be easily upgraded as we
develop new instruments new technology
and bring in new international partners
again as I mentioned there's not much in
the way of foreign satellite data yet
and when and whenever I go to an
international meeting and get beaten up
a how come the US government's not doing
more on earth science my first point is
okay when you folks start to match us
then then we'll be we'll talk about what
more we can do although I do want to
emphasize we are going to do a lot more
here in the next few years let me kind
of turn to a very interesting immediate
topic and this is one that that probably
was ignored until a few years ago and
that's the ice balance in the Arctic and
Antarctic to a few years ago this was
sort of a minor issue we didn't think
that we really could measure very much
and it wasn't very important but for the
last four or five years this satellite
called i sat for the another imaginative
NASA name
measures the ice levels an altitude of
ice to typically a few centimeters to a
few tens of centimeters so it can
measure the ice balance throughout the
world with a laser altimeter and get
these very very high accuracies now this
is what we begin to discover and this is
actually quite a quite concerning this
is you probably read about some of this
but we're continuing to do this and this
depicts the changes in elevation of the
Greenland ice sheet derived from the ice
at one between 2003 and 2006 the pink
and red regions indicate a slight
thickening while the blue and purple
shades indicate thinning of the ice
sheets in the current estimates say that
the complete loss of the Greenland ice
sheet would result and roughly a 6-meter
about 20 feet to sea level rise in which
case this location as well as my fine
Center next door would be underwater or
at least be operated like Leah like we
were in the Netherlands and most recent
satellite measurements from this and
other satellites indicate that the ice
sheet movement along the coast has
actually accelerated it is estimated
that there's the the net ice mass loss
of 120 to 130 to 200 to become as a year
is underway which translates to a
considerable sea level rise now let's
hit this right in the next in the next
decade we've got a number more
satellites that are in development I
won't go into details about these but
but these are very exciting these were
recommended by the US climate community
and they're designed to really nail the
details of of climate change so we can
begin to actually devise various
counters again I won't go into a lot of
detail but there's the open ocean
surface topography mission which
actually gives you really accurate
measurements of the of the of the
surface that's what we're going to use
to measure real sea level change gozo is
a is a new weather satellite and it
provides images seen on your weather
local weather forecast and the orbiting
carbon Observatory is the first ever
ever as I mentioned measurement of the
atmospheric carbon dioxide now this is
an example of the kind of data we take
this is real data it was taken from two
satellites and two instruments and
thousands of orbits and this is a time
lapse over a complete season where one
second represents one day so this is a
five-minute long movie so as it goes
through i'll talk a little bit about
what it's showing white is the clouds
and you'll note the daily pulsing as
they is clouds form with with solar
energy and then dissipate at night the
the color is the sea surface temperature
which slowly varies throughout the
season and the interesting thing here is
that you can see the hurricanes these
are you can see some of the tracks on
here of the named hurricanes and if you
watch carefully as you see the as you
see that they is they go along there's a
a blue path behind each of them this is
really showing how they pull energy from
the ocean leave behind a cool water and
now this season is the one that was of
great concern because it's where
Hurricane Katrina which i think is
coming up here pretty soon arose but
this is the kind of data that NASA
increasingly is getting and it also
begins to help us measure are we seeing
an increase in hurricane activity and
when you see some of this data you begin
to to be quite there there's Katrina you
begin to see quite a lot of the concern
that if we get a lot more hurricanes the
impact of a lot of climate change when
you look at this it kind of looks pretty
scary and you don't really want to live
in the southeastern part of the US
that I use this with the agency to say
that we don't really want to have those
three centers in the southeastern part
of the country if you want to build
things up put it at Ames although they
remind me there's some phenomenon called
earthquakes that that might not be a
such a great idea now this is example of
observational data that is taken the the
next one is a combination of
observational data in theoretical
calculations and this is a
high-resolution three dimensional
atmospheric simulation using the
Columbia supercomputer this is a
computer that we we brought up in 2004
at the time it was the world's second
fastest computer it is now probably you
know two or three hundredth although
just today we dedicated its successor
computer the Pleiades a computer which
in the benchmarking done a few weeks ago
is the world's third third fastest
computer I like to call it the world's
largest not not a computer because the
only ones that beat it or do we bomb
bank English machines but again these
are the kind of analyses that we can do
to measure the precipitable water and
the clouds and we match that with the
models to be able to move those things
forward now the next thing of course we
can do fully theoretical analyses and
this is a simulation that shows us
things that are impossible to observe by
satellite in this case it is deep ocean
currents and this is a high fidelity
supercomputer simulation that shows the
currents 15 meters below the surface and
this has a lot of significant
implications for thermal balance in the
oceans the oceans have orders of
magnitude more thermal energy than the
atmosphere does so understanding what's
going on in the temperature in the
especially in the top regions of the
ocean really is one of the key drivers
to global climate and again this is a
longer set of simulations in its one
second equals one months now the
interesting thing these little flickers
you can see those are storms
have been artificially input into here
and you can kind of see how their
impacts they have on on heating and
cooling the the the surface the ocean
they quickly pump energy into the ocean
and then it's quickly dissipated the
share products in the ocean are
producing these little vortices or
sometimes called gyres these can persist
for years you see them off the
continents and these are things that
have major impact on continental
climates in climate trends areas like
Australia that have very very radically
changing climates it's these sort of
gyres can have a huge huge impact now
one of the other features on this is is
these huge permanent polar vortices and
this is a connection between what we
observe on the earth and what we all we
now see deep in space when we look at
Jupiter and Saturn and we also see polar
vortices so we're beginning to take be
able to take data not only from from the
planets and apply it to earth but the
other way around as well now none of
this really means a lot if you can't to
get move the data around this is a the
internet in 1973 and just to kind of go
back to history when I was only about 60
years old but in 1973 Ames became the
14th node and the first NASA Center in
the internet we had the iliac for which
was was our first supercomputer and it
was the first supercomputer on the
internet and the the interesting thing
is that we begin to develop a the West
Coast backbone that that eventually
developed into the into the internet and
it's kind of like a developing organism
or organism the next step was we had the
first trans-pacific internet connection
between what's aims in Hawaii and so
this grew and so NASA is really proud of
our role in the past of
of of where we're going now as I
mentioned this is the this is the our
newest entry into the high high-end
computing this is a 487 teraflop machine
that just started operating here this
last week and as I said it was the
number three spot in the world and it's
in the top 500 list of the world's
fastest computers and we expect to sue
early next year to up this to a petaflop
machine so again in it and it is the the
largest machine in the world that's
really devoted to things such as climate
science and in other civilian modeling
applications now as we all know the West
Coast backbone evolved with the with the
dominance of Silicon Valley in high-tech
major universities and laboratories and
eventually industry such as you folks
developed and the and the hardware along
with it so this is kind of a natural
place for for NASA to to place its IT
focus which is what we've done the next
major effort of course is that that were
deeply involved with how to display this
data we have just established a new
hyper wall which was the world's largest
display in terms of number of pixels
until our colleagues at Cal at two in
Southern California added one more row
of monitors to beat us but don't worry
we're developing a long-range missile
well that was a previous job I used to
have but at any rate a lot of the work
over at Ames is how do we take
particularly climate data and display it
and what you saw was some of the some of
the efforts that that NASA did to
display data now the next step is what
does one do with all this data and and
how does one handle it there was another
thing developed in the 1960s which was
the Operations Center that was based on
digital displays of data digital data
these are now used everywhere everywhere
from police dispatched to Wall Street to
two operations in a particular area but
again I think NASA can take credit for
inventing this this architecture which
is which is known as Mission Control
developed for Apollo this by the way was
the apollo 17 photograph you can see our
one of our very famous operators gene
Krantz there in the in the lower right
and this is now being used everywhere
and this was an example of Mission
Control architecture being used locally
this is the San Diego emergency
operation centers stud up in october two
thousand seven two to fight wildfires in
southern california on the left is a
display of nasa collaborating decision
collaborative decision environment
showing fused UAV d data with satellite
data in real-time and i might add that
we use to google platforms for this so
thank you but this is the kind of data
that that we received from the
satellites this shows the visible smoke
and infrared in the fires from the modis
imaging spectrometer on the Aqua
satellite that i mentioned earlier in
the a train we did the same thing again
this year with expanded data we also use
the nasa unmanned aerial vehicle econo
which i'll show you in a second to get
more detailed data the interesting thing
is this was the only way to really see
through the the smoke over the fires to
really plot the development of the fires
and help the firefighters do there
work this is the econo air craft which
is a the DoD call this the predator but
that's not a very nice name so we use
the Native American Choctaw word which
means intelligence and we painted it
white rather than black because were the
good guys but this had a Ames developed
multispectral imaging pod on it and it
was the first use of an unmanned aerial
vehicle in national airspace so it's
kind of a neat effort but what we were
doing was actually taking these images
rectifying them putting them on on the
platforms that that you folks had
developed and putting other data on it
and it was sent to a via satellite to a
website hosted it aims and we created
files for Google Earth and then put
those on servers and that allow the
firefighters then to use this to to
vector in their efforts and to
understand whether where the actual fire
front was this last year we were
credited with saving the lives of
several dozen firefighters with this
data because it enabled them to know
they were about to be surrounded so they
could actually leave the area so this is
another example where NASA's earth
science data coupled with our
methodology that we developed for Space
Exploration could be applied to solving
terrestrial problems now let me bring
something much closer to home those of
you that normally know that I'm a wine
enthusiast some would say lush but over
the last few years we've begun a
collaboration with the California
vintners to begin to manage the impacts
of seasonal weather and provide
irrigation forecasts and this is really
where we're going in the future one of
the key questions that somebody has if I
tell you the climate is going to change
by eight degrees over the next 50 or 60
years you say okay that's nice what I
really want to know is what's this mean
for me does it mean that Google needs to
build all the buildings on stilts does
it mean that the the vintners need to
plant Cabernet rather than Chardonnay
probably cabernets better anyhow but so
this is a example of a product that
we've worked with the Robert Mondavi
vineyard that enables
to use NASA data to measure the water
soil content so they can use this to to
better meet her out the irrigation water
they use the next thing of course is you
know looking at at growing season
anomalies and making predictions into
the future so we're beginning to take
theoretical data to use their synthesis
of models as well as satellite data to
to to give these folks information now
the interesting thing on this is it the
climate varies incredibly as any farmer
could tell you but for the first time
they might actually be able to have some
data that is better than the Farmers
Almanac is to is to how to water what to
plant and how to plan for the next next
next decade so this is a product I think
you're going to see a lot of work on I
was at a meeting a few weeks ago
sponsored by the lieutenant governor
Garamendi the state of California even
in its budget crisis is intending to set
up a detailed Climate Prediction Center
we expect within a few years that in
addition to the weather forecast you get
you'll get a climate forecast so you can
begin to understand what does it mean
for long-range planning let me turn to
another topic this is Chicago at night
you can see money changing hands right
before your eyes this is from a current
satellite called the defense
meteorological satellite program and
it's a 30 year old technology however
this is an example of what you could get
you could actually see who is changing
money maybe this is a this is a image
from a handheld camera on the
International Space Station taken by Don
Pettit an expedition 6 and this begins
to give us the kind of data where you
can do urban planning you can understand
the end of the youth energy usage you
can help urban planners figure out where
lights being used and not used correctly
we've signed some agreements with the
city of San Francisco as well as the
beginning to work with the city of San
Jose to begin to use NASA data to do
detailed urban planning so that we would
eventually be able to take data like
this from something called a nights at
that would enable them to tell in real
time what's being used and what's not in
fact it's interesting in the area on the
right is an area where the corruption
hasn't completely been rooted out either
yet but you can see a major major impact
there in the Washington DC vs the
suburban areas you can see the square of
washington d.c the light usage policies
have considerably different light usage
than in the suburbs right outside them
so this enables city planners to begin
to look at this on the on the left you
can see the San Francisco Bay Area and
you can see the effect of the urban
planning and keeping the the forest
areas in the Berkeley mountains as well
as Santa Cruz Mountains free of urban
regions so this kind of study in
analysis really I think it's going to be
a major input into future city planning
and I think we're going to have a lot of
a lot of efforts now NASA is doing a lot
we're interested in deserts and this is
a painting of one of our satellites
because we couldn't get a picture like
that is it would peer in space above a
desert but the interesting about this
desert it's on Mars and this is one of
the many images that we've gotten from a
lot of our satellites over Mars this is
telling us a lot of the typical desert
features that we see on the earth
mountains erosion in weathering but Mars
is an interesting planet it's one of the
most earth-like planets in our solar
system its 24-hour day it's got an
atmosphere of polar caps seasons you
have snow as we found from our Phoenix
lander and almost certainly had oceans
but it's a desert planet now and
understanding the processes that
occurred on Mars will better help us
understand a lot of the desert ification
processes on earth so as we embark into
the solar system a lot of these programs
have direct feedback to earth now
this is a different planet this is Venus
it's relatively earth-like planet in
some senses but it's almost the opposite
of Mars it had a runaway greenhouse
effect but it's very similar as far as
we can tell to the early earth before
life evolved so one of our key points
here is by studying these planets we can
begin to understand these processes
better that we're trying to steer a
course between a Mars future in a in a
Venusian future on either which is a
very desirable no this is a another area
that NASA is looking at which is I think
very exciting this is cyanobacteria now
I'm a astronomer by background and so
the biologists told me that I said well
what is cyanobacteria really it sounds a
little complicated they said well you
know it is pond scum and this this
arguably was the first life on Earth
it's it's the first life that we have
fossils from it emerged over three
billion years ago and there are some
that believe that it might have emerged
on Mars first in migrated earth through
asteroid impacts but why this is such an
interesting organism and in why should I
put it up here is cyanobacteria
transformed the Earth's atmosphere from
a carbon dioxide methane methane mix
toxic to all higher forms of life and
probably similar to what the current
Venusian atmosphere is to our present
nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere and so this
is really what what made this planet
capable of supporting life and all its
diversity and we've built a lot of these
planetary monitoring systems to figure
out how we can survive outside the earth
we're doing a lot of things like
developing solar panel technology
photovoltaics and other things that look
like they have a considerable impact on
terrestrial life one of the other things
we are doing is is looking at at some of
these life processes this is a membrane
technology for water treatment this was
work by the way funded by by Google of
which we thank you for and these are
forward osmosis membrane elements each
approximately a meter squared
and we can filter out water but also
with a lot of ions in it you could
actually pull energy out of it I'm
reminded that there appeared on YouTube
here a day or two ago a rather humorous
discussion of drinking urine that was
sort of taken off of one of our one of
our researchers showing that you could
process urine through one of these kind
of things and actually drink it so if
you haven't seen it I would commend it
to you it's quite amusing I'm going to
have some of our staff practice that but
one of the other things we're trying to
do is to look at how we can we can
extract biological molecules this is a
self-assembling synthetic moldy enzyme
complex for bioremediation that we
actually extracted from extremal file
proteins this is work that and by the
way it says do not post but I posted
anyhow so the Jonathan Trent will be
quite happy because he wants people to
call him but this can transform
cellulose biomass into usable fuels like
green aviation fuel from green algae we
are also looking at using cyanobacteria
which is blue-green algae and green
algae is a way to produce biofuels so
all of the work that I think you're
going to see out or much of the work out
of NASA in the next and the next decade
is going to be focused very much on some
of these biological processes so really
in conclusion why are we doing all this
and I think it's really in summary it's
fun it's profound but I think it's
really important that this all comes
back home is that NASA's work is
designed to make life better on earth
and I really would invite all the folks
at Google and elsewhere to join us
collaborate with us and we invite you to
come and work with us we've been at this
for 50 years this is our 50th
anniversary this year and all I've
really got to say is you ain't seen
nothing yet let me stop there and be
happy to answer
questions but again the earth part of
what we do is is going to be a big thing
in the future and we look forward to
working with everybody thank you if
there if there are any questions for dr.
warden please come up to the microphone
so when you've got large-scale imagery
like this showing the planetary
atmosphere it's almost like you can have
a thousand laboratories at once you can
see the impact of certain you know
volcanic emissions on the atmosphere and
their thermal properties you can see the
impact of urban areas etc I was
wondering are you starting to look at
those to help validate models for global
warming to see for example it's like
doing experiment you're injecting more
methane here you're injecting more co2
there to actually see if the models
really make sense testing it
experimentally as opposed to a
regressive type of model absolutely and
that's really where most of the research
is is now is to begin to actually take
real data and connect it with the models
and we've sort of begun to do that and
some of the data i showed you looking at
at natural inputs to the such as storms
and and so forth the next step or than
what we're beginning to is is to make
experiments like you say with volcanic
eruptions to try to see if we can see
those those impacts pollution from
cities and so forth and so that's the
that's you know that's your kind of a
good straight man because that's where
the the next bit of work is in its we're
just now beginning to get enough
accuracy out of the space data and also
airborne date I want to emphasize
airborne data is really critical because
satellite only comes over a couple times
a day when you find something
interesting you put an airplane over it
for for a long period of time we're very
interested in that and indeed a couple
of things that that we're doing is
looking at UAVs and you might notice
there's an airship flying over it too at
at Moffett Field and we made a deal with
the airship ventures guys we're going to
put some sensors to start doing some of
that but the hard part is getting that
model with enough fidelity so that you
can begin to actually see that what
those micro inputs are and how they
impact and begin to make micro
predictions to say that what the climate
is and I I would judge in the next year
or two that we're going to begin to get
some real results on that where we can
say the city of San Francisco did this
policy and that had this impact on the
regional climate you know some other
city changed like
efforts and energy usage patterns and
begin to see some climate changes but
that's where it really begins to get
exciting because now it's a tool for
management that you know you might say
alright somebody decided to change water
usage what did that do did that help or
hurt in certain areas so so that's
that's kind of where we're going and I'm
really looking forward to some of the
first results
welcome to google and thank you for
sharing this presentation with us I've
heard a lot about you from your NASA
colleagues they've been very very
positive and excited about you and I
wanted my question to be a little bit
more strategic in nature because you're
a person in a very strategic position
right now I mean I can get all the
details about this great earth science
like from the web and from NASA's great
websites but without really interested
in and I'm following on the presentation
given on the 50th anniversary of me of
NASA by by physicist Stephen Hawking who
said that we are not investing enough I
mean the the amount of money and we are
talking about money these days even
colleagues of yours Alan Stern in in the
New York Times whoo-hoo views you like
some of this as a waste of money whereas
we know we who follow space science that
it's actually less than 1% of the of the
US budget that is spent on space
exploration and following on what
Stephen Hawking said that you know we
should be really increasing because this
money invested in space exploration is
investing in our future and inspiring
inspiring future generations so that
plus saving the earth from ourselves so
with that in mind I have a very simple
question when are we going to see humans
on Mars
interesting interesting question I
certainly love to see us spend more
money i hope we spend more money but is
i used to say when i used to say when i
was the military that's above my pay
grade but let me kind of answer your
question it's a fairly if you'll pardon
me for being a little long-winded here
there's kind of three things that NASA
does and the first one is science and
let me put oath science in a separate
category I mean not that it's not
science it's very important science but
in the basic sciences NASA is in its
colleagues around the world but mostly
nASA has revolutionized physics in the
last decade we now know that what we are
and what the matter we see is almost
nothing less than a percent of the what
the universe is and this is a this is
the most exciting time in physics for a
century since quantum mechanics and in
general it may be more exciting and
because it's interesting because every
new discovery tells us we know less
about the universe and that's exciting
for scientists it says there's an
unlimited set of things to do the next
decade is going to be I think the decade
of fundamental biology discoveries by
NASA and of course you might know the
astrobiology institute suit NASA Ames
that we are going to I think answer the
question where else is there life in the
universe is it in the solar system is it
in other other planets around nearby
stars missions that that are being
worked like right here are going to
launch here in a couple months something
called Kepler it will be the first
mission to discover or see if there are
like planets around other stars so we're
going to and I think within a few years
later we'll see whether the life bearing
so this is a very interesting effort but
that's the first thing we do and that's
very exciting this is the most exciting
time to be in science and at NASA
because we're changing the whole field
we're upsetting lots of Apple carts and
as a scientist I love that the next
thing of course we're doing is the
question that you that you raised is
exploration let me come back to that in
a second the third thing we're doing is
to help people on earth and I talked
about earth science specifically kind of
site specific predictions we're also we
do the first day in NASA is aviation and
it's the Aeronautics administration I
think that one of the major things we're
going to do in the next decade is
revolutionize air travel we're going to
have to build carbon-free systems
eventually at least starting with carbon
neutral that's going to be a major job
for NASA but the third thing and that we
do is really beginning the settlement of
the solar system and all these are
pretty exciting and I didn't I didn't
talk about the settlement of the solar
system but probably about to you know
well over half of what NASA does is to
do that we're in the process of building
the basic systems today of course
there's a lot of controversy is this the
right rocket or isn't it I'm not going
to get into that I mean those are
discussions over many beers other than
to say that i was on the study teams
that validated those and initially was a
skeptic and mike griffin put me on the
study team and he said your job is to be
where they used the word begin with a
and and after a few weeks he said you're
doing your job extremely well but again
I think we're making that progress but
the question is okay where we go on and
when you say settle the solar system
what is the target and I'm convinced
that Mars is clearly the the location
that could support large scale human
settlement so Mars has to be regarded
today is is the target for settling now
there's a lot of steps to get there i
think the moon is is is an initial step
the next one or maybe even
simultaneously with the moon or
near-earth asteroids that where you can
because they're stepping stones to mars
in fact i think eventually a human
mission by 2030 to Phobos could be done
using the hardware that we're building
today so that's the that becomes a
significant step now what NASA and our
partners around the world need to do
with Mars is find the resources figure
out is there life there in fact if we
find extant life that's going to change
a lot of things are we compatible with
it or not you know if we interfere with
it is that is that appropriate or not I
mean these are
going to be fundamental philosophical
issues but let's assume that you know
whatever we find is reasonable for us to
settle there I believe that sometime
after 2030 after NASA in its colleagues
mount human missions probably not to the
surface but to to some place like Phobos
in coupled with a robotic colony of some
form on the surface that we will enable
private sector settlement of Mars a
one-way mission to Mars is is a quite
feasible thing to do if the government
didn't do it and in fact I've had
discussions with some senior officials
here at Google that are very interested
in that and I fully support them and I
suggest that they invest their money in
that but the but I think that we will
see private sector missions I think that
they could be done in the order of you
know a billion or two which is kind of
money that can be raised privately for
these kind of things so and I think that
what the government's job to do is is to
path find what's there what are the
resources in fact I think probably
they'll end up sealing a cave and living
in that for a while what's the
technology the communication systems the
power systems and do that basic
technology development in demonstration
so I'm so I'm pretty optimistic that
that sometime post 2030 we will see real
human settlement on Mars but funded not
by governments but funded by private
individuals and that's sort of what I
the vision that I would see for the
future
can you tell our audience what does the
preeminent space agency in the world
think of things like the google lunar
xprize and what specifically do you
think NASA might get out of the
competition it's kind of a good straight
person i think the google lunar xprize
is shit-hot to use the current word it
is exactly what we ought to be doing and
and you know I am delighted that the
Google leadership stepped up to that
because I think that's going to make
that first step is to have private
sector folks go to the moon and in
demonstrate a robot on the moon in fact
we have just submitted a proposal at
NASA Ames in conjunction with one of the
teams that we said that you know they
promised when they went there they would
carry along a five kilogram payload that
nASA has to measure the toxicity of the
lunar dust and we will see how our
proposal fares but this partnership
again between the public and private
sector where and I and where Google has
kicked off this this interest and I'm
convinced there's at least three or four
of these proposals that are that ever
incredible this one was particularly
credible because he used some designs
that we had done but but there are and I
want advertise the which one which you
can probably find on the web which one
but we're also in discussions with some
of the other teams and but where NASA
could be a customer is what we want to
do and that's one of the steps that
we're starting to do our preferred
approach is to is to have the space
station serviced and in passengers taken
to and from it commercially and I'm
convinced that's going to happen
probably a lot sooner than people think
the next step is to have commercial
entities fly you know fly me to the moon
and fly initially robots and
capabilities that I think will begin
this effort that will lead to lead to
private settlement of other planets and
at that point the government has done
its job we've done in space what we did
in aeronautics and the end
in the middle of the 20th century very
few people in our predecessor agency
nakka the National Advisory Committee in
aeronautics was indeed the key thing
that allowed America to build it sits
preeminent aviation industry by
assisting it and we didn't do the work
but we help them we had laboratories we
could do keep testing developed
technologies and work with the company
so it's a so this is very exciting and I
really thank Google being you know one
of the first partners that's willing to
kind of step forward and say okay if
they can get to the moon will we'll give
him a prize so my thanks to to the our
host today for for doing that and it's I
think is going to pay huge dividends for
everybody
you
