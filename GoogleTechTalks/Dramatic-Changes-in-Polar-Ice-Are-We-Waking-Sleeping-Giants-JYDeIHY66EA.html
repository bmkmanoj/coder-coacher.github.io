Waleed abdalati
director of the Earth Science Center at
the University of Colorado has a long
career in earth science he was
responsible for NASA's first program to
map the ice sheets and you know I think
of him as being an advocate for
reconciliation in the War of the Worlds
which within NASA there are these
warring factions of Mars versus Earth
and they tend to attack each other more
than work together but he's he's one of
the few who has been able to bring them
together and today he's gonna tell us
about changes in the polar ice well
thank you I appreciate the opportunity
to be here and you know as Peter said I
I spent my share a time at NASA both as
a bureaucrat trying to manage a program
and as a scientist doing research as a
manager and I kind of saw the spectrum
and I think I'd like to say I've seen
the good the bad and the ugly at NASA
and what I want to focus on today is
some of the not just good but some of
the great and you know working for NASA
I used to always I mean you guys can
appreciate what NASA's done in earth
science but I always had to explain to
people you know it's yeah I I've never
been to the moon
I've never been to Mars you know I I do
earth and they're like earth NASA does
Earth and you know NASA has a huge role
in understanding air system and it
really comes down to this view this
perspective of the Earth System has been
hugely informative and what I'm going to
talk about today is one aspect of the
Earth's system kind of tell you a little
story about the Earth's ice covered
regions how they're changing what that
means for life on Earth and the role
that the satellites and NASA assets have
played in that so it isn't just about
the astronauts or the Hubble Space
Telescope but I think some of the most
important work NASA
has done has been focused right here at
home on the earth system so I'm gonna
talk about the polar regions and and I
love the polar regions for a lot of
reasons but if I were to try and
characterize them in a few words one
certainly would be pristine really pure
and untouched this is us an area in the
Antarctic Peninsula and when you go to a
place that really nobody's ever been
before certainly very few people and you
see the few parts of the earth that are
untouched by human influence so to speak
I'll get to that in a little bit it's
really it's really quite remarkable and
there the rugged their raw their their
nature in its most basic primitive
rugged form this is an area from the
Canadian Arctic fjord flowing out to the
sea from the Barnes ice cap on Baffin
Island and Canada
they're huge you know you get yourself
in the middle of an ice sheet or in the
middle of the sea ice and you know
thousands of miles in any direction is
the nearest land it's absolutely
incredible and you can't really
appreciate it till you've fly in and
it's all white and you stand there and
everywhere you look it's white this is
this is camp this is my our little town
on the Petermann Glacier in North
Greenland and I guess all the way to the
left is the work tent the next one is
the kitchen tent the community tent
where we ate and then the sleep tents
and the guy all the way to the right you
may tell from the situation of the tents
he snored he snored he snored kind of
loudly if you look at this picture a
week later he was he was out of the
picture something you can appreciate in
this environment the commute was better
than any and any job I've ever had
before as well even with traffic wasn't
bad at all
there humbling I mean you can't go to a
place like this and not be humbled by
what you see by what you experience it's
really really it's quite remarkable
there beautiful
you know the way the light plays off of
the ice and the fact that you're at high
latitudes the Sun is low
the red colors getting through more than
the blue colors but then the ice
preferentially reflecting the blue its
scenery really unlike anything I've ever
seen anywhere else and I imagine most of
you as well and they're changing this is
an area called the Jakob Saba nice
stream this is the calving front of the
Jakob stove and ice stream and also so
this is the calving front the ice stream
is up in this vicinity the floating ice
is in this vicinity big fjords and just
- sorry big icebergs and just to give
you a sense of the scale what you're
looking at in the calving front is about
the size of a football field the height
of this calving face is about a hundred
meters and literally this is just the
tip of the iceberg we have about close
to nine times as much ice below the
below the surface as well so really
enormous this is the calving front up
close the same area but a different
perspective you can see where the ice is
starting to crack where the icebergs are
about to fall into sea and these areas
are changing and they're changing
profoundly in ways that really matter to
people all over the world and when I say
that a lot of times people think well
you know what's you know what how is
what's happening so far away from me in
an area that I'll probably never see
supposed to be important to me I just
can't get my head around it well it
turns out to matter for a lot of reasons
and what you're looking at this is just
the Arctic Ocean and you're looking at
Arctic sea ice here in the middle of the
Greenland ice sheet which can't contains
the equivalent of about 23 feet of sea
level rise if we're all to disappear
that that's not going to happen anytime
soon but there are big questions about
what's coming in the next decades or
century the sea ice blankets the Arctic
Ocean insulates it from the atmosphere
controls the exchange of energy and
moisture between the atmosphere and the
ocean a hugely important barrier to
energy and mass exchange very important
for global climate as we've come to
know it and love it or hate it depending
on your view and weather as well and one
reason these areas are especially
important is because they help keep the
planet cool they have what's called a
positive the high albedo highly
reflective where most of the sun's
incoming energies reflected off the
surface back to space as that ice starts
to melt the Sun is absorbed by the
darker ocean rather than reflected this
is what's called a positive feedback
mechanism the melting snow and ice
exposes a darker surface beneath that
absorbs more energy that takes in more
heat or makes the area warmer causes
more ice to melt and so on it's a self
compounding effect and as a result when
it starts to melt it wants to keep
melting now fortunately every winter the
nature comes along and presses a reset
button and blankets the Arctic with ice
and snow cover again but it's not quite
the same and I'll get to that a little
bit most of you are probably aware that
sea level rise is a tremendously
important sociological economic and
political issue and these areas here
shown in red are areas that are expected
to be influenced by 1 meter of sea level
rise which is not that far out the out
of the range for the predictions for the
coming century in fact as science has
gone on and we've learned more it
actually seems quite feasible that we
could see that by the end of this
century so 1 meter of sea level rise if
you do the numbers can affect up to a
hundred and forty five million people
worldwide and by effect I mean adversely
I don't mean good things come of that I
mean bad things at a cost globally of
about a trillion dollars according to
the most recent UN estimates so what
happens to this ice particularly
Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets in
their vast stores of water is of
tremendous importance worldwide so let's
look at the history of sea level rise if
we just look at the last 15 years it's
gone up about
three and a half millimeters a year
doesn't sound like much until you stack
it up over a century and you consider
most coastal areas tend to be shallow
and sloped there's coastal erosion
significant effects of three and a half
millimeters a year if we look at the
last century was actually about half of
that okay so it appears the last decade
and a half is seas are rising twice as
fast as the century before and the
century before that was only about a
third as much about 0.6 millimeters a
year so it seems that sea levels rising
at an increasing rate the source of this
increased rise is most likely land ice
glaciers and ice sheets but if we look
back in our planets past
oceans have actually risen by about five
centimeters a year if you look in this
area here and this area in here it's
about a meter in twenty years much less
one century now this is when large ice
sheets blanketed most of North America
and they decayed very rapidly through
meltwater pulses and caused rapid
increases in sea level rise we're not
there now but we're in some situation
where obviously there's some concern
some interest in knowing what is coming
so this figure is what I like to call
ice sheets 101 it explains how ice
sheets grow and shrink now ice sheets
grow primarily through the accumulation
of snow it snows on top of the ice sheet
it grows and grows in the middle starts
to spread outward under its own weight
it's kind of like when you pour a really
thick pancake batter onto a griddle you
know globs up in the middle and the
edges get thinner and spread outward at
those edges it can melt see if I gonna
find my mouse it can melt and run off
the surface as water it can flow into
the sea where it floats and can melt
from underneath from the warm seawater
it can break off as icebergs so it grows
in the middle spreads under its own
weight melts at the edges calves at the
edges icebergs break off what we
all iceberg calving now the kicker is
that as climate warms which it has been
doing melt goes up the flow rates go up
and the accumulation goes up so there's
sort of in this race this battle is
tension between ice sheet growth and ice
sheet shrinkage and it turns out you
know no surprise well it's a surprise to
some but ice sheets the loss mechanisms
are increasing more rapidly than the
gain mechanisms and the ice sheets are
shrinking contributing to sea level now
I show this picture a lot this is two
friends of mine you may have recognized
right off the bat that they're graduate
students by nature of the work that
they're doing and I show this to people
and I say this is why NASA does this
kind of thing this is why we need
satellites and aircraft this explains
the difficulties of making these kinds
of measurements and they look at that
and they say yeah I get that and it
looks cold it looks hard to get too
looks dangerous the clothes are ugly
some people say and that's all true but
that's not what I see when I look at it
I see issues of scale of measurement
perspective context how do you turn
which you observe into this little area
into something meaningful about an
entire ice sheet all of Antarctica those
guys were just a little speck in this
section of Antarctica smaller than the
tip of that arrow if you can imagine
that and what you're looking at here is
this figure is the last 25 years of
temperature change from satellites over
Antarctica so a lot of Antarctica has
actually been cooling but in the West on
the on the left side of the image as
you're looking at it it's been warming
significantly and the peninsula has been
warming significantly and that's
important so contact scale and
perspective of observation it's very
difficult to turn that one little
measurement into something meaningful
about a continent like all of Antar
so the satellites come into play and
this is just sort of a hit list of all
the the main satellite observations that
are helping us understand how the ice is
changing and why we can look at the
reflectance how well it reflects energy
the temperature of the ice the melt of
the ice the snowfall in the ice where
and how it's growing and shrinking the
flow rates of the ice all from space now
not just from space we have to integrate
this with models we have to integrate
this with field observations which is
why these two guys were doing the work
that they were doing but I want to call
your attention to three things in
particular kind of the biggest advances
in understanding how the ice is changing
the first is out imagery laser altimetry
from the ice at mission satellite flies
long times the travel time of a laser
pulse or measures the travel time to the
surface gets the range to the surface
from that we can back out the elevation
when we know the position of the
satellite and we stack these up flight
after flight after flight over Greenland
and Antarctica about fourteen times a
day day after day month after month year
after year and so that we get some
picture of the elevation of the ice and
how it's changing and that's hugely
important because the tope the nature of
the change has a topographic signature
if ice is speeding up the elevation
changes one way it's it slumps one way
the ice is melting the elevation kind of
all lowers uniformly if the ice is
changing because of changes in snowfall
it grows or it shrinks and in a somewhat
different way so we don't just watch the
ice grow and shrink over time we look at
how it's doing that and from that we can
infer why it's doing that and ultimately
what the future may hold another really
remarkable mission is called the grace
mission Gravity Recovery and climate
experiment experiment experience for
those of us who've worked with it grace
is a pretty fascinating mission well the
way it works you have
satellites separated by a certain
distance and if you imagine this podium
is an ice sheet the satellites are
flying along at some separation when the
first one gets into the gravitational
field of the ice sheet it accelerates it
increases the distance between it and
the one behind it till it leaves the ice
sheet now this one is accelerated this
one has slowed down and the spacing here
is about the same as the spacing here
and the amount of separation between the
two tells us something about how much
the ice sheet weighs how much mass is on
the ice sheet we watch that over time
and as time goes on if the satellites
separate by less and less and less that
means the ice sheet underneath it is
shrinking they separate by more and more
and more it's growing and then the third
approach is what we call the flux based
method you just take the difference
between what goes in the accumulation
and what comes out the ablation the
melting plus the discharge
okay so we have melting at the surface
plus the calving is the loss the
accumulation at the surface is the gain
we take the difference between the two
and we figure out what the mass balance
of the ice sheet is well the key tool in
getting at the loss the discharge the
flow has been SAR interferometry and the
way that works for those who aren't
familiar is we have a we measure the
wavelength though phase of the wave
returning from a surface in relation to
another location so we get a phase
I lost my pointer here's my daughter a
phase return from here and a phase
return from here and there's some
difference in phase but if one surface
moves like this the relative difference
in phase changes and the amount of that
phase change tells us how much that
surface has moved the time separation
between the two measurements allows us
to figure out how fast it's moving and
in this way we very accurately very
precisely get glacier and ice sheet flow
rates
so I'm gonna put those into a story for
you in a little bit but I want to call
your attention now to Antarctica the
Antarctic Ice Sheet and actually I'll
give you this we break it into the West
and East Antarctic the West if you look
at this figure over here the blue shows
us areas where the bed the bottom of the
ice rests below sea level on a soft bed
till it's very deformable the West holds
the equivalent of about 3.3 meters of
sea level five meters depending on which
which estimates you look at so I I don't
know if I said it but the rate is if you
were to remove the ice off of the ice
sheet entirely this is what you'd be
left with although I don't think it's
red and white but but you get the idea
with the topography so the West
Antarctic is kind of ready to spill into
the ocean when it starts to retreat at
the margins at the tip of where I
labeled the weak underbelly this is a
term coined by Terry Hughes a couple
decades ago when it starts to retreat
the warm meltwater the warm water starts
to erode the the floating ice that's at
the end of this this arrow here there's
nothing really to stop it as the as the
ice caves into the sea the warm water
can keep eroding from underneath can
keep melting can keep weakening this
floating ice and it can continue to
retreat all the way to the trans
Antarctic range ok this there it is this
boundary in here shown by the mountains
in here so this is potentially unstable
well what does instability look like
well the ice speeds up the grounding
line where the ice becomes afloat flows
off the land and the sea retreats the
calving front retreats and the elevation
slumps starts to get thin in these
regions and lose mass all of these
things are happening we can detect all
of these from space from satellites in
the way I showed you on previous slides
and we're starting to see the weak
underbelly in retreat it's starting to
slump it's losing a lot of mass the
grounding line is retreating we can't
say at this point that collapse is
underway by the way collapse and these
terms means we lose all that ice in a
couple hundred years I don't want anyone
leaving this room thinking you know
everything's fine and tomorrow all the
ice spills into the sea and many people
get wet but we're seeing behavior that
is certainly indicative of collapse we
just haven't observed it long enough to
know if that's what's underway
another area the Antarctic Peninsula
many of you may have seen this but if
you look at the satellite imagery in
2002 in January 31st it looked like this
about six weeks later it looked like
this and the area that's lost there's an
area about the size of the state of
Rhode Island if you look at this in my
discipline for whatever reason the
standard unit of measure seems to be
small New England states and this is
this is a Rhode Island collapse but the
more important aspect or feature of this
is not so much the size but the fact
that this ice was probably about 700
feet thick probably more than 10,000
years old and it disappeared in about a
month's time okay big changes that may
or may not have been going on over time
but we hadn't had the tools to look once
we started looking the things we were
seeing really changed the way we thought
about ice and how its behaving and if
you look at this glacier in particular
the crane glacier what happened in
response to the loss of that ice this
was floating ice so when it breaks up
and flows out to the sea its impact on
sea level is negligible but the glaciers
that were flowing into that ice all of a
sudden the barrier to flow was removed
and this particular great glacier the
crane sped up Eightfold it octuple dits
speed as that barrier was removed
flushing ice into the sea now the amount
of ice contain
in the clink rain glacier is not like
all of Antarctic are all of Greenland
but the mechanism the process really
changed the way we viewed the
interaction between the ice and the
ocean and the time scales on which
change could occur another interesting
thing we've learned from the satellites
is that there's a very comprehensive
complex sublation network of water of
lakes of rivers a hydrologic network
beneath about 2 kilometers of ice we
knew there was water down there we knew
it moved but we didn't really have any
idea how much and when we brought in the
elevation tools this was first
discovered with radar altimetry on some
european missions but when we brought in
the tools to look at the elevation we
could see the behavior of the ice and if
you just look at this area here in the
circle and what I'm going to show you
some figures there are four triangles
contained within that circle and I'm
going to show you a sequence going from
left to right this is the elevation the
scale on your left is a few meters
change in height so there was a big
slumping of a few meters in the left
over the leftmost lake the next one - it
went up a little the one next to that
went up a lot and the one next to that
went up about the same so what we have
is the movement of water from one
glacier from I'm sorry from one subway
shal melt lake to another that has the
an expression in its topography so if
you look that first Lake would be
represented by this we watched it go
down the other Lakes here here and this
Lake as well
we watched go up as the water was moving
around beneath two kilometers of ice all
of this obtained or understood from the
satellite imagery and we've been able to
this is work from Ben Smith
Ted's canvas and Helen fricker
colleagues of mine at various
universities to figure out how much
meltwater is in many of these lakes and
where the active ones are based on how
the ice is going up and down
and up and down so this is a remote view
through a mile and a half of ice just
based on what's happening at the surface
the surface expression of the change in
character so I'm gonna put all this into
a little bit of a story I should pause
it for a minute
remember the Jakob saw and ice stream
what I showed you in the beginning that
that calving front I told you was about
a hundred meters high well we're gonna
zoom into that it is located right here
and all the satellite imagery now we're
going to put together into a into a
story about how the ice is changing so
whoops maybe we will
there we go so we're zooming into the
Jakob Sava nice stream and you'll see it
in a minute it's right here and what you
see is the calving front right there
this is floating ice this is icebergs
this is the grounding line and over here
you see melt lakes and I'm gonna talk
about the melt lakes in a little bit but
right now just focus on the ice stream
itself as we zoom in you're gonna see
lines the faster the lines move the
longer the line that's the faster the
how the fastest ice so you see the main
ice stream here tributary here what we
call drawdown here all this derived from
satellite observations what we call
drawdown here and what happened is this
glacier moved about seven kilometers a
year and in 2001 the calving front was
here it had been stable for about 50
years and then in 2001 it began
retreating about a mile a year so that
by 2006 that had retreated about five
miles which was the equivalent of about
the previous 90 years in five years time
well remember the Antarctic Peninsula so
the removal of this ice this barrier to
flow got kind of cleaned out of the
pipeline allowed the glaciers this was
one of the fastest in the world to
double its speed to about five feet an
hour so it starts flushing its ice out
to the sea and what you're looking at
now the colors are elevation imagery
which I'll speak to in a minute start
flushing out its I started in training
the ice further upstream bringing that
out to the sea and increasing the ice
sheet contribution to sea level rise so
what you're looking at is results from
ice at the altimeter II data that shows
a slumping remember I mentioned there's
a signature to change well an
accelerated flow has sort of this dimple
here that will radiate outward with time
and work its way further and further
into the ice sheet it's not just there
though we're seeing the same phenomenon
Southeast Greenland in Northwest
Greenland and it appears to be working
its way up the coat up northward as
temperatures are increasing the Reds are
actually slight growth because while
this has happened snowfall has been
increasing in the middle of the ice
sheet has been growing so remember I
mentioned this this battle this struggle
going on between the two well you're
seeing it unfolded here
so the Jakub saw an ice stream turns out
to be a conduit okay if you look at this
again blue is below sea level the other
colors are above sea level so it is a
little channel that provides access to
the interior of the ice sheet all of
that ice we don't know what's gonna
happen is it gonna keep eroding is you
know are large portions of that ice
gonna flow through this little channel
we don't know at this point we're still
trying to watch is this an area of
instability the Humboldt glacier and the
Petermann Glacier in the North again
anywhere where you can draw a line you
know your eye can draw a line from the
blue in the middle out to the edge of
the ice there's an area of potentially
significant loss we have away from space
of looking at how much the ice is
melting as well and this was something I
did years ago back in graduate school
and other people have done it as well
but there's a signature to mount the
energy emission gets very efficient in
microwave wavelengths as snow starts to
melt and this is a time series the graph
on the left of melt over the last 30 30
years since 1979 and the ice sheet has
melted at a rate of about one percent
per year in that time well what happens
to all of that meltwater remember the
melt lakes like those blue lakes I
showed you what this is is meltwater
accumulating and undulations on the ice
sheet surface so there's topographic
variability there's basins on the
surface there are hundreds of these on
the ice sheet they could be kilometers
wide
that could be meters tens of meters in
some cases deep and they can train very
very rapidly this is a photograph from
Greenpeace actually of a melt Lake on
the surface crevasse is underneath and
this is say some photographs of a
crevasse on the left and a Moulin these
tunnels into the ice where the water can
flow and somehow make its way to the
bottom of the ice sheet in the case of a
crevasse the weight of the water can
actually pry open the crevasse so as
long as there's enough water it can
force the crevasse open more water fills
that have forces it open more and more
and in theory this can go on forever as
long as water is available so the water
can make it to the bottom of the ice in
the case of the right side this is water
flowing into a Moulin and I show this
image I say this is one of the most
famous images in Glaciology one of these
people is my Glaciology professor and
I'm I'm pretty sure it's the guy
furthest from the flowing water the
others are his students and I say this
is a lesson an academic hierarchy you
you've got professor graduate student an
undergraduate student with with his or
her back to the flowing water and then
the postdoc is off in the back you can
see kind of finding his or her own way
but the point here is you don't want to
get too close to these things and you
most certainly don't want to fall in
because the water flows into these
tunnels and can go down through a half
kilometer of ice to the bottom this is
what happens over time it can erode some
very large channels and this is an
animation that shows what goes on when
it flows to the bottom so you have your
melt lake in the topography of the ice
eventually the water finds its way to
the bed where it flows along the
interface between the ice and the
bedrock accelerates the flow so that in
a summer the ice can flow twice as fast
as it flows in the winter
now it turns out this is pretty
widespread over much of the ice sheet
not so much in the fast moving outlet
glaciers but large slabs of ice are
moving much faster in the summer than
they are in the winter so as melt
increases so too does this phenomenon
now I want to turn our attention to sea
ice now the thin veneer of frozen sea
water that blankets the surface of the
ocean you can't give a talk about the
Arctic without showing polar bears so
here they are enjoy we're gonna leave
them now similar to the ice sheets this
is what I this is these are the
capabilities that we have in space from
satellites again the reflectance the
temperature the motion in sort of a
different way the deformation
characteristics the extent of the ice
the area the concentration very very
powerful tools and I want to and
thickness as well I want to call your
attention to the concentration and
extent the passive microwave in
particular and then the thickness okay
the ice grows and strengths in the
summer and winter remember I talked
about that reset button so here it's at
its winter maximum right there and then
it melts melts melts - it's summer
minimum right there now watch it again
maximum and then minimum now that
minimum is the ice that survives the
summer melt okay it's thick its hearty
it's been around a long time and it
tells us something the state of that
minimum tells us something about the
state of the Arctic
now we track this over time with passive
microwave satellite data and and in the
70s NASA kind of figured out well in
kind of NASA figure out how to monitor
ice in this way did it with its
particular mission or instrument the
Simar sensor scanning multi-channel
microwave radiometer until 1987 and by
that time there were operational
capabilities that carry the measurement
forward so in a rare
occurrence in case of satellite
observations of the earth we actually
have about a 30 year record of data and
what that record shows is a steady or
not steady but but a persistent decline
in ice cover to about 2007 there it is
about 2007 where the ice was about 29
percent lower than the previous record
in the series and about 44 percent lower
than the average in the series but more
illustrative is the figure a in 2007 the
minimum was what's shown in white as
opposed to the 30-year in this case 28
year average 29 excuse me
shown in the yellow ok so note the
Canadian archipelago
okay this area was ice-free for the
first time since we had the satellites
to observe this and in fact there were
people sailing this there's a retired
hog farmer from Minnesota who sailed
this in the summer of 2007 on a boat
called the cloud 9 and when I that to
people usually someone will remind me
that in history this has been done and
it's no big deal they had heard
somewhere on the radio from their
favorite announcer that this was done in
1905 by a guy named Roald Amundsen and
that's true sort of it took Amundsen
three years 1903 four and five and there
were dozens of often tragically failed
attempts before that to navigate the
Northwest Passage so it's a slightly
different regime or in if you will and
normally I tell people don't worry a
whole lot about one year it really
doesn't mean much in the grand scheme of
things and it's too it's too easy to
point to something and say oh it means
this or that and you're usually you
don't have enough of a basis for such a
statement but if you look at the trend
which is shown in red and then you add
2007 to that in 2008 to that clearly the
ice is on a decline and if you compare
it to the models we use to project
future climate
the state of the ice is shown in blue
there the dotted line is the average the
the range is the shaded area shown in
blue and we're pretty well outside the
range we were in 2007 where the model
said we'd probably be in about 2050 so
the ice is declining its declining a lot
faster than we expect expected and many
people say yeah well you can't trust
climate models and we don't want to base
expensive policies on climate models
when we're not sure about them but they
may not only be wrong or miss estimates
something in one direction they can also
go in the other direction and sometimes
they're too conservative and in the case
of the ice that appears to be the case
so where are we are we gonna see an
ice-free Arctic this decade in five
decades in a century well certainly the
trajectory were on points to it being
sooner rather than later and much sooner
than many of us have thought as little
as just a few years ago well one of the
reasons the models I think are off you
know people work very hard put in the
best physics we have in them do their
best to represent the world as we
understand it but there's data missing
and one of the key variables is the
thickness data and this is where ice at
comes into play by firing down a laser
pulse let's see if I can get it to a
laser pulse on the surface of the ice
and over time it will hit leads openings
in the ice or the ice is separated we
can estimate the freeboard the height of
the top of the ice above the waterline
in which of the sea in which it rests
and that estimate with some adjustments
and assumptions about snow accumulation
and density helps us figure out how
thick the ice is and when we put that
into the equation we start to see not
just a shrinking Arctic ice cover but a
thinning Arctic ice cover
that's much weaker and more vulnerable
to change so what you see here this is
from a paper by a colleague of mine Ron
Kwak and others ron's at JPL is there
with it at the start of the ice SAP
mission in this area here over Greenland
and the Canadian archipelago the thick
ice that was there has become thinner
the thin ice that was there has
disappeared hey this is thickness
estimates based on ice at data and this
is supposed to help you help you see it
in case my arrows didn't work well
enough the point here is that as the ice
shrinks as the summer ice starts to
disappear it's replaced with winter ice
that's fine that's great but it's a
thinner ice cover it's a more vulnerable
ice cover and when you put that together
with ice age data which is similar older
ice is generally thicker younger ice
it's thinner we start to see this is
from colleagues at the University of
Colorado we start to see first-year ice
cover this is in February now so this is
the winter ice second-year ice cover and
then older ice based on the satellite
data this is the average for 81 to 2000
this is 2009 a February 2009 it's all
new ice it's a younger thinner weaker
ice pack so we combine that with the
area change which is shown here the
thickness change the ice Sat data is the
red is the are the red points at the
right of the image or right of the graph
and submarine data where it's the
opposite measurement the submarines go
under the ice look up measure the draft
of the ice and estimate that thickness
across transaction in the inset figure
we see the thickness is on a decline as
well and because we're looking at volume
it's pretty simple math if the area is
shrinking and the thickness is shrinking
the volume is the the reduction in
volume is multiplicative it's the
product of the two so the ice is
actually shrinking much faster then the
area changes would somewhat subject
suggests excuse me
however if we turn our attention to
Antarctica the ice is actually growing
in Antarctica just a little bit about a
percent per decade as opposed to the
shrinking of the perennial ice cover in
the Arctic which is ten percent per
decade so lots of loss in the Arctic
slight growth in the Antarctic there are
reasons for this but the reason I like
to show this figure is because it
reminds us you know we don't have it all
figured out the world is a complex place
and what applies in one area does not
necessarily apply in another and we
should never lose sight of that we
shouldn't assume that we got things
figured out because we see something
happening in one place why is it
different well there's real valuable
Earth Science information into
understanding those differences I'm
gonna skip over that for okay
so when we put all this satellite
information together we've actually
really revolutionized our understanding
of the behavior of ice sheets and sea
ice in ways we never knew we've
literally rewritten text books and here
are some of what I call transform polar
paradigms that the satellites have have
shown us the ice sheets don't take
centuries or millennia to respond to
climate change as was once thought they
take days weeks it does not take long a
breakup at the calving front can have
impacts way far up into the ice sheet
some of the outlet glaciers have
accelerated faster than we really
thought they could I mean the Jakub
solvent is is one example it doubled its
speed it was one of the fastest glaciers
in the world it doubled its speed really
we I always thought it was close to some
sort of theoretical limit but it turns
out who knows what the limits are both
Antarctica and Greenland are expected to
lose mass as climate warms we used to
think Antarctica would probably grow it
was so far below melting that any
warming temperatures up to maybe five
degrees the increase in accumulation
would cause it to grow and reduce sea
level while Greenland shrunk slowly in
the north
turns out Greenland can shrink fast
Antarctica seems to be shrinking as well
the ice moves faster in the summer over
large areas and it does in the winter I
didn't talk much at all actually about
the rapid melting but under the floating
ice the ice can melt faster than we
thought there's an active sub glacial
hydrologic network that the satellites
have really provided insight to there's
a rapid decline of sea ice area in the
Arctic much more than certainly the
models had predicted there are other
critical observations we've seen the
Arctic is experiencing enhanced warming
but large parts of Antarctica
have actually cooled in the last 20
years anyway we've been able to map the
spatial character of the sea ice
thickness decline increases in ice
cover in Antarctica increase in
Greenland melts and we've actually
provided very very detailed maps of the
Antarctic Ice Sheet I didn't touch upon
those but because it's so hard to get to
and observe you know you guys in Google
Maps when you use ooh min to a certain
point you get to you know you don't have
the data well Antarctica was like that
for a long time but their sense has been
the development of data from the
satellites and I want to leave you with
a couple thoughts first of all from a
climatological perspective we're in
uncharted territory you know it used to
be temperature scale warm there was more
carbon dioxide put in the atmosphere as
a result and that would slow the rate at
which the atmosphere cooled over time
through the ice ages and the
interglacials now the carbon dioxide is
forcing the warm is causing the warming
it's it's a different regime and we're
at a carbon dioxide level that at least
human civilization hasn't experienced
before it's new territory now the
effectiveness of society's response to
these changes depends really on three
things it depends on how big the changes
are how fast they come and our ability
to anticipate them and this is where the
observations are key particularly in our
ability to anticipate what's coming this
the observations will help us and the
models figure out how big the changes
are you know and how fast they seem to
be coming but it's really the future it
takes models and observations to figure
out what's in store and I would argue
that the very success of society of
civilization depends on that I won't
talk about saving the planet or anything
like that I'm simply talking about our
success as a society call out what you
want survival capitalizing on the change
doesn't matter it depends on this and
there are various responses to that
challenge this is one of them this is
the glaciological equivalent of putting
your head in the sand or you can insert
your own political joke here I'd leave
that as an exercise to the audience
or you can observe hey this is the this
is a representation of the satellites
the science satellites that NASA now has
in orbit things that are pulling back
the curtains on changes in climate and
changes in our environment helping us
understand how the world works these are
the satellites this is my little soapbox
that are past their design life these
are the satellites that are living on
borrowed time so it's really only a
matter of time before we're left with
this now there are new satellites coming
in but about half as many over the
coming decade decade and a half who
knows and not all with quite the same
capability of what's currently in orbit
so I want to leave you with a final
quote and kind of my view of things this
is from Socrates way before his time way
before satellites man must rise above
the earth to the top of the atmosphere
and beyond for only thus will he fully
understand the world in which he lives
and I want to leave you with a thought I
think of the earth is kind of a mosaic
of stories you know a lot of little
stories two-on-one hugely important
story it's a story of the Ike's it's a
story the weather the story of
hurricanes a story of biology the story
of vegetation is hundreds and hundreds
of these but collectively they tell the
story of the earth and there's a lot of
us looking at the earth in this way
trying to understand that story and
trying to share that story so I
appreciate your letting me share that
story with you I appreciate your time
and with that I'm happy to take any
questions
thank you
yes
the question was when freshwater ice
from the Antarctic mixes with seawater
there's some energy exchange that goes
on there through the different densities
and thermal characteristics
I don't really know enough about that to
comment with what did surprise me though
that I learned is I mentioned when the
floating ice breaks up and flows away I
said its effect on sea levels and
negligible it turns out it I didn't used
to think it had an effect on sea level
because it was floating your old
experiments put your ice cube in the
glass it melts the water doesn't go up
but it turns out because of it it's
fresh and of lower fresh waters of lower
density than seawater it actually kind
of sits on top of the seawater I mean it
does mix but it the volume of fresh
water is greater than the volume of
saltwater that the ice displaced so it
turns out that there's about a two
percent two and a half percent increase
in sea level sorry an increase in sea
level equal to about two and a half
percent of the volume of ice that melted
but as far as the thermal impacts I
don't really know enough about that to
comment yes the differential ice loss or
ice gain in the North and South Poles if
we assume that the thermohaline bells in
the northern hemisphere are weaken and
the ones in the South are strengthened
to do this assume this the North
thermohaline circulation and this is
probably weakened okay the southern ones
remain the same or yeah yeah what does
it have near the near the equator that
differential well that's a good question
you're asking the oceanographic
questions and I'm not an oceanographer I
don't know the impact at the equator but
what I do know is that climate under
human civilization has functioned has
come to kind of rely on certain things
a certain robust thermohaline
circulation a certain amount of
reflectivity at both poles a certain
amount of exchange of energy between the
ocean and the atmosphere and we're
perturbing that pretty pretty
substantially and I don't think anyone
really reliably knows the global impact
of that change we're still struggling
with understanding even some of the
local impacts anything else any other
questions I can't answer
all right well I appreciate your time
and attention thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
