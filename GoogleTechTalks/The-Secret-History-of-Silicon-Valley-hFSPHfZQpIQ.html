introduce Steve Blank I'm Steve Steve
Blank is a serial entrepreneur is
lecturing at the at Stanford at the
engineering school at Stanford at
Berkeley at the business school at
Berkeley and the business school at
Columbia University he is a longtime
Silicon Valley Dennison he is into
computer history he was a marketing guru
that's how I met him
the previous company where I worked at
Epiphany and he is here to give a talk
which I think will tie nicely into Tom
Perkins's talk which was given a couple
of weeks ago and I didn't know whether
you have been to that one or not some
proteins of decay PCB fame and he talked
a lot about Bill and Dave Packard and
his relationship with them and then
being a mentor to him and he touched on
a lot of Silicon Valley history but I
thought Steve blanks talk will open this
a lot more I've seen this talk awhile
ago and I can tell you it's really
interesting Steve please please give
Steve a warm welcome
so I appreciate being here at the center
of the universe and as bars pointed out
I do drive-by teaching and a number of
universities which is what you do when
you actually cache your Google stock
when it crosses a thousand so the talk
today is hidden in plain sight
it's the secret history of Silicon
Valley and a few caveats about the talk
I'm not a professional historian some of
this hopefully not all of it is probably
wrong and all the secrets I'm going to
share with you are from open source
literature I find history particularly
history of the valley kind of
interesting because you could never tell
where you're going unless you know where
you've been and the valleys has several
waves of innovation the defense wave
integrated circuit wave personal
computer wave internet wave and it
doesn't mean that every one of these
waves meant everybody in the valley was
just doing this but it meant at that
period of time there was a core
concentration of expertise in Silicon
Valley in this local area on each one of
these domains and I want to talk about
today briefly is an area you probably
know very little about and that's the
area about defense Silicon Valley was
and in some cases still is the heart and
mind of NSA CIA innovation and I'm going
to illustrate this with five very short
stories the first story is about world
war ii and the surprise to me is the
title world war ii is the first
electronic war how many of you have ever
seen world war ii movies anyway okay
planes bombers anybody see you know
airforce movies in world war ii every
movie you've ever seen about world war
ii and involved bombers we're wrong
every one of them not because people
were lying
but simply that the directors and the
screenwriters don't know and still don't
know what I'm about to tell you today
just to set the scene in September 1939
world war ii started in europe by the
summer of 1940 the Germans had overrun
continental Europe they owned everything
from the English Channel and they're
moving turning in June 1941 into western
Russia Britain stood alone and by
December 1941 when Japanese attacked
Pearl Harbor the u.s. joined them but
the only way to affect German power in
Europe in 1941 to three and half of 1944
was to start a strategic bombing
campaign to destroy the industrial
capacity of Germany and this was called
the combined bomber it's offensive
British planes and then American planes
took off every day to fly from Britain
to industrial targets over Germany
the British bombed with four-engine
bombers called Winchester's and
Halifax's they bombed that night their
goal was what they called area bombing
or euphemistically 2d house the
population unfortunately if you were in
the house they also had some other
effects on you when since they couldn't
barely see what they were bombing at
this is carpet bombing of cities these
planes flew at 17 X is made at 7 to
17,000 feet carried up to 20,000 pounds
of bombs round-trip Germany from Britain
to Germany to bat and starting in late
1942 and really getting into it in 1943
the Americans started bombing and their
concept was or Americans
hey we could put these bombs down a
smokestack this is precision bombing
we're going to take out specific
industrial targets and we use b-17s
which you see here and b-24s these
bombers flew somewhere between 15 and 25
thousand feet these planes were
unpressurized by pilots and crew were on
oxygen for six to eight hours per
mission you'll see some pictures of that
in a second
the goal was to destroy the
transportation infrastructure the
petroleum oils infrastructure aircraft
infrastructure and anything else that
contributed to the German war economy
let me just put this in context about
the size of this air struck this wasn't
Moffett Field a couple planes a day the
size of the Allied air war in Europe was
a titanic struggle the likes of which
we'll never see again with manned
aircraft there were 20,000 to exceed me
28,000 Allied air planes at its peak
bombers and fighters 40,000 planes were
lost and destroyed 40,000 just in
context the entire jet fleet Boeing
Airbus smaller manufacturers today in
operation fifteen thousand planes
worldwide we lost 40,000 of them in
Europe and just for scale a hundred and
sixty thousand Airmen died over Europe
not got shot down just died half us half
British and by the way they were your
age they were all in their early 20s
that's who man these crews let me give
you an example
forget the audio navigator do you
estimate we've crossed the enemy coast
notice his oxygen mask for sure those
little black dots are not new clouds
those little black dots are something
called flak or anti-aircraft shells
bursting around the aircraft a couple of
things to note crew pilot copilot
navigator radio operator bomb adir and
lots of gunners who you'll meet in a
second as soon as they took off from
britain they were facing the german air
defense system and here's the stuff no
movie maker ever knew the Germans in
1940 set up the kalmyk cam you go Rhine
it was an integrated electronic air
defense Network
it stretched from northern France all
the way into Germany its job was to
defend Germany from British and US
bomber raids to warn and detect German
air defense to target and aim their
weapons and then destroy the Bombers
before they got to the targets the
Germans could see the British and
American planes forming up 200 miles
away these were the air defense radar
sites in occupied France and the air
defense radars had 200 mile ranges the
first phased array radar ever built was
the mammoth peak power 200 kilowatts a
hundred feet across but the backbone of
early warning radar for the Germans was
a steerable tower actually pivoted 190
feet high almost a megawatt we're
talking about 1942 150 of these spread
across occupied France
now once these bombers were detected in
formation and they started flying if you
remember that video have we crossed the
coast what they encountered was
something called the Himmel belt which
was the German air defense Network which
is local air defense organized by 30 by
20 mile boxes and each one of those
boxes had an integrated network of
radars flak which was a German name for
anti-aircraft guns fighters and for
nighttime searchlights and what happened
was as bombers started entering the
Himmel belt
they were detected by the Fria early
warning radars that provided warning
through a command center that started
vectoring or talking pilots of German
fighter planes into the bomber stream
and this ground control to intercept
technique was invented in Germany right
here and directed fighters right into
the Bombers and then the fighters
particularly at night for the first time
have their own onboard radar German
fighter planes had radar that when they
got into the vicinity could lock on to
the Bombers and target their weapons the
Fria which was this local defense radar
90 mile range giant wurtzburg 1,500 of
these were deployed in these him--oh
belt cells 45 mile range this thing is
25 feet across or 150 of these and all
this data for these him--oh belts were
pouring into air traffic control centers
they didn't call them that but that's
what you should think about them all the
radar data from these short-range radars
all the long-range radar data and they
even had their equivalent of the
National Security Agency was picking up
passive
detection of picking up all the radio
traffic from the Bombers as they formed
up all came in to these centers where
they integrated all this data and think
of a giant movie theater and you had
fighter controllers looking at a giant
map projected on a screen with the
controller is sitting in theater like
seats and then we talked the fighters
into the vicinity of the targets the
fighters would turn on their radar and
acquire and attack the target at night
when the British were bombing the German
night fighters would use their radar and
it looked like this hadn't figured out
this time in the war that gee you could
put a radome all right that is a
covering around these things that would
be transparent to radar so these things
look like deer and horns but they were
pretty effective but the weak link was
the ground controller communications
channel we'll talk later about what
could happen if you could shut that down
these were the planes that were used for
night attack during the day
ground control intercept just how to get
these fighters into the general range
then you could eyeball the Bombers dream
kind of hard to miss a thousand bombers
heading for Berlin once you got into the
general area again the weak weak link
was a controller communications channel
typical planes were the Messerschmitt Bf
109 and the focke-wulf 190 oh yes
great question so if you're a if you're
flying during the day you're vectored if
you were flying at night you used your
radar I'll show you some more another
example typically that's where the
Bombers would hide but eventually they
had to come out if they wanted to bomb
so I'll show you an example here's an
example of a fighter attack real footage
from World War two Lyman Baucom coming
up in the other side you animal a
specific how many we're 11 fw 3 o'clock
when it does I squadron most one until
they come a black eye watch it Kyle
they're heading for the last one
the Audion Texan these bombers have for
their important
box formation
they didn't have escorts too late in the
war when the p-51 which actually changed
the tide of the bombing war allowed the
Bombers to have sufficient range to take
them all all the way to the target in
1941 42 43 beginning of 44 there wasn't
adequate fighter protection and when
they started using fighters p-47 they
didn't have enough range to take them
all the way into Germany a couple things
to note about 60% of bomber losses were
to fighters about 40% were lost to
something called which I mentioned
earlier
and our aircraft or flak the Germans had
5,000 anti-aircraft radars if you ever
seen pictures of anti-aircraft guns
shooting you never once see the fact
that they were all radar directed holy
count and the guns they used think of
cannons pointing up in the air the
shells were fused for time there were
fragmentation rounds shell went off if
you were within 50 feet of that shell
your plane was peppered by shrapnel and
the odds are you're going to get
severely damaged or go down the good
thing for the Allied I'll take this as
questions if anybody's interested the
Germans never had proximity fuses could
have dramatically changed the result of
the air war also Germans had designed a
pretty effective prototype of a
surface-to-air missile called the
wasserfall but they also didn't do that
they put all their resources into the v2
which while great for rocket science was
her pretty ineffective as a strategic
weapon next thing was the bomb run they
fought their way over Europe they're
getting to the target and they're about
to line up to bomb run from Houston
acknowledged
Charlie dinner Lukie megalitre table
leader will be bombing in a bad
crosswind succeed all the flax pushing
it around the people evicted no ties the
primary painter new life he is how
stupid budget so okay they're about to
make their bomber on and somebody said
about clouds there's only four clear
days a month in fall and winter over
Europe great photos shows a nice day
how'd they see the target here's the
other piece you never saw in any war
movie about World War two
they show the bombing deer using an
optical bomb site it looks great it's
clear its optical I mean bombs through a
cloud on the doors open
great weather by the way that's black
dropping their bombs on a target
perfect name by the way only about 30%
of bombs you can at the end of the war
came within a half a mile of the party
precision bombing was an oxymoron so
what they finally decided to do and
invent it and installed by 1943 where's
air-to-ground radar by the end of the
war every US and a US and British bomber
had a bombing radar set it meant for the
first time they no longer needed to
cancel missions when it was overcast
over the target these were pretty
primitive and all they did was paint an
outline of kind of the major ground
features but it was good enough to
develop map overlays to say well if you
see a feature that looks like that it's
probably Hamburg and so targets could be
or Berlin or may be hopefully now London
targets could be seen under the cloud on
the rain the British installed this in
the mid 1943 the Americans took it and
improved it a bit and put in a mass
production on every British and American
bomber this will come back in another
story a little later on now supposedly
this story and this talk is about the
secret history of Silicon Valley well
this might be amusing where an
interesting what the heck does World War
two have to do with Silicon Valley so
let me just remind you about what's
going on here horrific casualties Google
math challenge for every hundred bombers
on a mission each mission four to 20
percent wouldn't return holy cow they're
your age and you had to fly 25 missions
to go home sobering
it was a priority to defeat German air
defense system air defense system at its
core was electronic so story two was the
development of an electronic shield in
the middle of World War two called
electronic warfare and it was run by the
most secret lab you probably never heard
of called the Harvard radio research lab
which was in Harvard but it was a
codename for the u.s. countermeasures
and its goal was to reduce losses to
fighters and flak and it did it with a
couple ways first the Germans didn't
publish any papers on their radar
there's no open source literature Google
wasn't around so the first one was we
needed to gather electronic intelligence
and signals intelligence about the
characteristics of these signals then we
needed to develop devices to jam and
confuse those radars this was a
top-secret 800 person liable the first
thing to find and understand German air
defense we took a couple of bombers and
stripped all the bombs and racks and
everything you could imagine out of them
and packed them full of radar receivers
developed special-purpose receivers that
could go from 50 megahertz to three
gigahertz
this is 1942 and flew these planes
unarmed over Germany and recorded radar
signals try to figure out frequency
power or pulse rate etc once we
understood that we came up with some
defenses and the first one believe it or
not was mechanical not electronic it
turns out if you cut pieces of
reflective material and I don't mean
optically reflective I mean radar
reflective to half the frequency of that
radar it would get false returns you
could Jam the radar by throwing tin foil
out the back of a plane the British
called it window we called the chaff
we use this to disrupt the German air
defense by jamming the wurtzburg
frequencies for both ground control
intercept and radar-guided and our
aircraft it was first used over a city
called Hamburg and the first time this
happened we completely shut down the
entire German air defense system and it
happened to be timed with a thousand
bomber raid which used incinerators for
the first time to try to destroy a
complete German city some of you might
know the results over Hamburg in this
first attempt the crews literally opened
the door and manually tossed out packets
of chaff automatic dispensers became
later this was so important during the
war it used 3/4 of all aluminum foil in
the United States disappeared no one
understand the stood why we're having an
aluminum drive for chaff
but then this Harvard radio research lab
started earning their money they
systematically said we're going to shut
down every electronic component of
German air defense we're going to start
by jamming the those early warning
radars and we're going to put jammers on
airplanes and blind the Wasserman's
mammoths and Freer's and they built
jammers to do that first on escort
fighters that flew along with the
Bombers and then when there were enough
of these devices it want to win on every
bomber next thing was let's jam the
German anti-aircraft Raider the worst
Berg's we're going to shut down the flak
we built 24,000 of these jammers put
them on all the Bombers and then for the
British at night
we need to jam the airborne radar on the
fighters and they built a set of devices
to do that not only Jam the fighter
radar but the jam the communications
link between that fighter and its
controller trying to vector them in now
this was great was on all British
bombers by the end of the war in 1944
1945 a bomber stream
and an integrated electronic defensive
system that flew along with it
it had chaff it had electronic its
intelligence planes making sure there
were no new German signals coming up or
other radars we were jamming the ground
control intercept signals and we were
doing jamming against the triple-a and
all this was integrated not only in the
planes itself but by this time there
were dedicated planes that had nothing
nothing no bombs but racks full of
jammers flying along with every bomber
mission now this is pretty important an
integral part of the world war two war
effort you never heard about it
so who ran the secret lab and became the
father of electronic warfare and what
the heck does this still have to do with
Silicon Valley because the Harvard radio
Research Lab which was the spin-out of
the MIT radiation lab had 800 people
wasn't like five guys that never heard
800 people guy who ran it was Fred
Terman
of Stanford many of you from Stanford
anyway and we ever see this Turman
engineering building it's where my
office's Fred Terman if you do know
about him it's known as the father of
Silicon Valley but not because of it was
the father of electronic warfare he was
known as the kindly professor who are
encouraged to students bill EULA and
David Packard to start a company that's
what Fred Terman is known for in valley
lore and for those of us in the black
world we kind of laugh because that's
not who Fred Terman really was Fred
Terman was the father of the
military-industrial complex in Silicon
Valley he was Dean of engineering in
1946 and he was crow vhost in 1955 I
want to talk about what happened in the
valley when Fred Terman came back from
World War two knowing what he knew and
knowing what he did just for some
history in World War two
the office of scientific research and
development in the listed university
research in helping win the war
it was the first time the military said
no no we're not going to use our own
labs to do an advanced R&amp;amp;D that we will
we're going to enlist all Society
including University labs and we're
going to give out serious bucks for the
first time to do this
four hundred and fifty million dollars
was spent on weapons R&amp;amp;D good chunk of
it with the universities MIT got 117
million Caltech 83 Harvard and Columbia
30 dramatically changed the direction of
velocity of those universities oh and by
the way Stanford got 50 grand 50 grand
terming was so pissed he packed up and
his old PhD advisor Vannevar Bush
recruited him to head up the Harvard
radio Research Lab Turman says when he
returns this will never happen to
Stanford again his post-war strategy is
to make Stanford a center of excellence
for microwaves and electronics klystrons
traveling-wave tubes etc and he's going
to build Stanford with the MIT not
Harvard model of military university
collaboration from day one not going to
be left out of the gravy train again so
to determine being smart said hey I had
the world's best people in high-power
microwaves radar advanced electronics
paid for by the military sitting at
Harvard how can I get them at Stanford
11 of them now become faculty members
pretty cute idea
he reassembles essentially the radio
research lab cream of the clock crop at
Stanford as faculty and he sets up the
electronic research laboratory ERL as
part of the engineering department and
for the first four years works on basic
and unclassified research very benign
great idea and got the first office of
naval research contract in 1946 onr was
the only part of the military even
interested in continuing
military R&amp;amp;D by 1950 Turman turns
Stanford's electronics department into
the MIT the West well-known really
impressive but the Korean War came I
don't know if any of you read history
but the Soviet Union was our ally in
World War two
and after the war ended things went bad
pretty quickly we thought we had a
nuclear monopoly the Soviet Union
detonated its first atomic weapon in
1949 they took over Eastern Europe and
the iron curtain came down pretty fast
and for what became our ally very
quickly became a not only threat but a
nuclear-armed threat looked like
communism was the winning bet and then
in 1951 North Korea invade South Korea
we join it yet again another war we saw
a communist conspiracy everywhere and
the Korean War truly changed the game
not only for the country's thinking but
for Terminus thinking as well spook work
comes to Stanford Turman sets up a
classified department at Stanford the
applied electronics lab and doubles the
size of the electronics program says no
no this will be separate from the
unclassified work but it made for the
first time the university a full partner
in this military-industrial complex we
were doing serious weapons research at
Stanford everything we knew in a world
war 2 we're doing but we're doing it
more just to give you a context this was
paranoia time and probably not
unrealistically the Cold War battlefield
moved from Germany to 500 miles to the
east somebody's probably pointing out
their home town next to the ICBM site
there was a real fear this time of a
nuclear Pearl Harbor because the Soviet
Union was a closed country
electronic countermeasures electronic
intelligence signal intelligence all
become critical and that's what
Stanford's expertise was known for for
its customers the National Security
Agency the Central Intelligence Agency
and the arms in the military this cold
war is an electronic war this Russian
air defense system that they set up is
Germany times ten because not only their
fighters and anti-aircraft guns but they
start building surface-to-air missiles
they started adding sophisticated radar
to not only their night fighters but
their day fighters so the big job was
how do you understand the radar order of
battle in the Soviet Union and now they
don't have v2 s they're starting to
build intercontinental ballistic
missiles how can we monitor the
telemetry that they put on all their
test missiles and figure out its
performance how do we do photo
reconnaissance to find out where the
missile silos are and how do we monitor
their growing Navy and even more so how
do we even identify where their
production facilities are and production
capabilities for their nuclear weapons
all this required not only photo
evidence but required electronic and
signals intelligence so Stanford throws
its hat in joins the black world termen
decides to take the electronics research
lab which did basic and unclassified
research and the Applied Laboratory
which did classified research and gave
up and merge them both Stanford in 1955
set up the systems engineering lab and
became the most advanced signals
intelligence telemetry intelligence
facility for its government customers
now
in the context of the time I'm not
making any moral or value judgments
about whether this is good or bad but I
will tell you the thing that Turman was
doing at the same time which changed all
your lives which is why you're here he
did something I don't think it gets any
credit for it at all and he changed the
rules and how startups and universities
work together
he was the first engineering Dean and
provost to encourage and almost throw
out graduate students to start companies
here in Silicon Valley he encouraged his
professors to consult for those
companies and he encouraged professors
to take board seats advisory board roles
anything you can to help new nascent
startups and he made it easy to walk out
of Stanford with all this technology
like some other companies we might know
with incredibly easy terms and in fact
it's Stanford getting out into the real
world was good for your academic career
rather than that contrast this to any
other environment in the mid-1950s now
back to the war the Cold War Stanford
was helping the military understand the
electronic order of battle we believed
our bombers we're going to have to one
day penetrate the Soviet Union and just
like everything we learned about doing
that over occupied Europe we're going to
have to relearn again where are the
radars the Strategic Air Command needed
to know and the CIA needed to know for a
reason I'll show you in a second what
were the technical details of those
radars the NSA and CIA needed to give
that detail to their contractors to
build jammers the periphery that is the
outside of the Soviet Union its radar
order of battle was somewhat known
because you could fly a plane right to
the Soviet border radars would turn on
fighters would come out and you would
know yep
there are radars there they're trying to
kill us but you had no idea what was
going on
inside the middle of the country this
wasn't an academic exercise over 23
planes were shot down in the middle of
the Cold War
all of them electronic intelligence
gathering planes that flew along the
periphery of the Soviet Union trying to
record and identify the early warning
radars that bombers would first see over
200 US citizens were shot down some of
them entered and never interned and
never released this is a hot cold war
now some of you might have heard of a
plane called the YouTube any may hear
that airplane now any time I heard of
the u2 I saw those great photos and the
u2 that was a photo plane turns out by
weight
most of the payload was electronic
intelligence gathering equipment but
till today you'll never read about that
about the YouTube payload being Eiland
it was all about cameras turns out yes
we were trying to take pictures but more
so we were trying to understand across
the interior of the Soviet Union what
was the electronic order of battle and
the equipment that did that was courtesy
of Stanford and Silicon Valley system
that went from 150 to 40 to 150
megahertz to 40 gigahertz Stanford to
electronics lab jammers to keep
surface-to-air missiles away Granger
Associates Watkins Johnsons etc the u2's
who were jammed packed with Eiland
receivers now what's interesting was the
innovation that came out of this just a
side story in 1960 at what was then Cape
Canaveral the Air Force was launching a
rocket and they noticed that radar
signals from a radar that had nothing to
do with this test somehow was bouncing
off this missile when it was in air and
was picked up by another radar to
separate Raiders
transmitter/receiver completely separate
happen to be bouncing off an ICBM as it
was being tested and was they said huh
this is kind of interesting and they
basically came up with the idea of a by
static intercept receiver it is let's
use a separate transmitter and receiver
and a non cooperating thing in the
middle and they said where on earth
could we actually use this to get some
more information about radars in the
middle of the Soviet Union so project
melody was born and it turns out the
Soviets were testing their ICBMs in the
southwest corner of Soviet Union so we
used their missiles as they were
launched to pick up the radar
transmissions of their radars inside the
Soviet Union and received them and our
receiving stations in Iran it produced
intercepts of all the Soviet
ground-based missile tracking radars
including ABM radars and a ballistic
missile radars
we had no idea existed some I got a
medal for this one the other thing we
were building at the time after the u2
was another Intelligence Platform
called the Ox Carter a12 was a u2
successor the public name for this was
the sr-71 now this was a CIA plane and
the CIA was really concerned about how
vulnerable this plane might be at high
altitude because it was designed to fly
it above 80,000 feet at Mach 3 and it
realized from the time it designed it to
the time it was thinking about flying it
over the Soviet Union that the Soviet
air defense system had gotten really
dense so the UN staff office of the CIA
said what's the radar environment like
inside the Soviet Union and they needed
to find information about a radar called
tall King who is the primary Soviet air
defense radar hundred feet wide range
375 miles and we were interested on
where they were located b-52 bombers
needed to know
this a12 oxcart plane needed to no
problem with signal intelligence of
course it's all line of sight the radar
was inside Soviet Union and none of our
Eiland aircraft could get high enough to
pick up the signals so what we decided
to do was to use the moon we're going to
use the moon as a by static reflector
and we're going to listen for talking
signals as the earth revolved and
rotated around and the alignment
happened like an hour or two a month but
if he had multiple big radar dishes you
actually could start plotting the
position of tall King radars and it
turns out this was tested in New Jersey
at Bell Labs and they said late 1950s
holy cow
this really works but we don't have
enough geographic separation we need
more big dishes big dish big dishes all
of a sudden get funded in the late 50s
pay for and develop the Stanford dish
hide the relationships through cover
agencies all you needed was access to
the dish about an hour or two a month oh
we have some researchers coming in don't
worry we they didn't they didn't take up
much time and this only lasted four or
five years until we put other systems in
place but all the dishes that happen to
get funded you think we were really
interested in radio astronomy in that
order of magnitude and we even built a
bigger one at Sugar Grove in Virginia a
steerable dish and the Dro Bank dish in
the UK all of a sudden got funded as
well so we finally figured out where the
tall kings were but one of the things we
were interested in was now that we know
where they are we need to know more
stuff about them for jamming and stealth
so the solution for this was to build a
fleet of electronic intelligence planes
that literally once an air unspooled
antennas that were miles long I'm
talking about miles
flew around the periphery of the Soviet
Union measured the Soviet air defense
and basically said holy cow these guys
are pretty good and it changed the
Strategic Air Command integrated
operating plan so b-52s which we had
been designed to fly in at you know high
altitudes now to go in at 200 feet
completely change the nature of one of
our strategic triads and finally there
was something called Project palladium
and said okay we know how good they're
all this other stuff is but we need to
know how sensitive the equipment is and
how good are their operators and so what
that we built was a system here in
Silicon Valley company to be unnamed
that electronically generated false
targets into the Soviet radars they saw
a ghost aircraft and we could simulate
any aircraft any speed and the trick
though is to know what were they seeing
so we trained a team with the National
Security Agency to listen to the
communications channels of the radar
operators while we were injecting false
signals and so we could decrypt them in
real time thank you
national semiconductor which will that's
another story and watch when they turned
on their tracking radars and we use
ground-based the ground bases naval
ships submarines and this lasted about
three years gathered enormous data on
the sensitivity of the Soviet air
defense system finally we had satellites
one of the first satellites we put in
space there's an electronic intelligence
satellite project grab all of a sudden
we no longer needed to use the moon we
can just now use a satellite going
around collect radar emissions from
Soviet air defense radars Mona got over
a ground station dump out position
latitude frequency etc built by the
naval research laboratory and used by
Strategic Air Command then the Navy put
some stuff in space except this time it
wasn't one satellite they put a whole
cloud of them up and allow them to
direction find on radio and radar
signals that Soviet ships were using in
the middle of the ocean now for the
first time you couldn't hide any
we're in the ocean clusters of
satellites triangulated and Direction
fine was this have to do with Silicon
Valley and as an example just of one of
the contractors many that exist in this
valley Sylvania who you might think of
as being a light bulb manufacturer was
the second largest employer in Silicon
Valley in the late 1950s they ran the
electronics defense laboratory which is
basically an electronic countermeasures
lab Turman was a consultant half the
professors in the electronic labs were
consultants 1,300 employees big deal but
the bigger deal is in 1964 their
director thought it was the world's
biggest bureaucracy and quit and founded
a company called the SL they may know
what happened to Bill Perry father of
stealth became the secretary of defense
biggest spook in Silicon Valley
father stealth direct descendant
determined in terms of
military-industrial relationships term
ins legacy is the father of the
relationship between the university in
the military began an institutionalized
black Silicon Valley ESL Lockheed GTL
Sylvania Argo the university is a
hand-in-hand collaborator a collaborator
with startups is probably his most
lasting legacy but the black version of
what he did is completely missing from
any of his histories or biographies
you'll never see anybody talk about what
Turman did at all
post-world War two at but the good stuff
the stuff that's last thing the stuff
that in fact makes us all here today is
he developed this model for University
and entrepreneurial partnerships
consulting patents intellectual property
this notion of equity all came from
Turman a really unique guy now normally
I would end this story right here but I
thought I'd tell you story five for two
minutes unintended consequences
University and Industry relationships of
the most visible part of his legacy and
the deep and pervasive University
Intelligence relationships are a secret
legacy but remember what did terman
think the valley was going to turn out
to be a may remember what he thought
said it was there is military klystrons
microwaves electronics
we're not the microwave Valley are we
how come
and here's why it's Silicon Valley on
the other side of town the head of radar
bombing training from the Air Force
starts a company remember these guys
before you now is the radar scope a
small circular screen giving x-ray like
vision to the mysterious 11th member of
the crew is a world war true the radar
bombing radar video until recently we've
known little of what he does and even
less about the instruments he uses
basically radar equipment consists of a
radio transmitter and receiver the
transmitter sends a radio beam earth
would if it strikes water the beam is
not reflected the receiver picks up
nothing and the scope appears dark as it
is now over the Pacific Ocean
but if the beam strikes a solid object
such as land its reflected and shows
light on the scope watch something's
coming in now at the upper-left
adjusting the receiver controls sharpens
the picture there they are
two islands both with mountains on that
should make them easy to identify so why
now
turns out that this was really hard to
do that is to pick up these signals and
figure out what land masses there were
it was so hard
the Air Force put their army airforce
put together a training group to build
map overlays and there was one guy who
was responsible for all this in World
War 2 this is the guy who started a
company at the same time
Germans working on all these black
projects he was also director of the
Navy anti-submarine warfare operations
at Columbia head of the radar bombing
training for the Air Force Amanda who
this guy is he was deputy director of
all weapons systems and valuation he was
helping us build ICBMs he was the deputy
director who's this guy it's a
co-inventor of the transistor and he
found his Shockley semiconductor so
William Shockley father Silicon Valley
William Shockley is the reason why we
have all these semiconductor companies
in Silicon Valley he was a great
researcher awesome talent spotter and
the worst manager probably on the planet
unintended consequences he hires the
world's best team and eight of them
leave two years later including Robert
Noyce and Gordon Moore this group of
eight found Fairchild Semiconductor
which then becomes the father of almost
every other chip company in Silicon
Valley by the way his beliefs about
eugenics just effectively end any type
of commercial career in 1963 but what he
did for semiconductors basically he's at
the root all flowed from him and Silicon
Valley became Silicon Valley because the
guy who did radar bombing training in
the World War
to the legacy military R&amp;amp;D put millions
of dollars into the valley to make
billions of dollars secrecy limited as
it does the diffusion of direct
technology breakthroughs but the biggest
benefit is the one we never would have
figured out it was the university
industry collaborations so it's most
lasting benefit so that's it thank you
for your time and hope it was
interesting I'll take any questions if
there is are any yes so it turns out
yeah thank you so the question was how
come during the Battle of Britain the
Germans weren't smart enough to shut
down the British air defense system
called chain home radar and it turns out
that's one of the ironies of the war
that the chain home radar sites were so
primitive they operated at a frequency
below what the German electronic
intelligence systems actually could
detect no no joke because the Germans
and in post-war we all asked her to hear
these guys understood all this stuff
turned out chained home was a variable
frequency radar system it barely worked
but it barely meant it worked so the
British were able to scramble fighters
rather than having them orbit all the
time in time to intercept the German
bombers during the Blitz and the Germans
never understood the purpose of those
tall towers in fact there's a long story
that there the German electronic
intelligence system used a zeppelin
pre-world war ii breakout to orbit
britain and the radio receiver they had
didn't go down that low question in the
Cold War we injected false planes into
the Soviet
air defense system how did he do that
without so the question was how did we
inject false signals into the Soviet and
East earn bloc radar systems how did we
do that
without planes and so I that falls under
the if I told you I'd have to kill you
but the technique is may or may not be
an open literature you can inject
signals the spoofing stuff was used
extensively even in the first or in the
tube Gulf Wars used in Vietnam etc other
questions yes why do you think both of
this to the position I so he defenses
why all the names I question comes out
so the question is the list of the
pilots who were shot down how come the
names were Russian sounding the pilots
on that list were the names of the
Russian pilots who shot down the planes
when I said this was open source that
list came from the ex-soviet Union just
fo just to continue that conversation
one of the things we also did which
almost started World War 3 as not only
did we probe the periphery pre you too
we flew electronic intelligence planes
all the way across the length and
breadth the Soviet Union just to get
gather electronic intelligence that's
how blind the Strategic Air Command was
and how desperate they were to gather
this this data other questions yes
EXO commented apart was how much of this
stuff fell into Soviets hands the Soviet
Union had a active very active espionage
ring in the United States and
particularly targeted one made branch of
it at Silicon Valley and while we all
think of the KGB and that's whose
records we actually got access to one of
the more effective groups for espionage
was of the GRU which was the Soviet
military intelligence so targeted almost
every defense contractor in Silicon
Valley and that role has now been passed
on to the Chinese other questions and
back you talked about gathering
intelligence cohesion where was the work
being done for protecting the US again I
guess so the question was where was the
war being yeah so one of the things we
built in the US was something called
sage and for those who haven't been to
the Computer History Museum it was good
for a semi-automated ground environment
but it was the first automated air
defense system which really was a
spectacular piece of hardware and
software in the late 50s I ran
operationally for about 20 plus years
probably one of the most sophisticated
pieces of integrated man-machine user
interface came out with the first light
guns and just worth walking next door
and taking a look at it in Mountain View
and there were other centers of
excellence in the u.s. around route 128
for those who haven't read Annalee
saxenian x' book called regional
advantage until the 70s it wasn't clear
that Silicon Valley or route 128 was
going to be the winner in the center of
u.s. innovation and she posited some
very interesting hypotheses about why it
happened here rather than there but
around 128 and around Washington DC
there were a lot of innovative
electronics military industrial
electronics companies other question
thank you very much and thanks for your
