hi everybody and welcome i'm here to
introduce dr. monica kress she is an
astrophysicist teaching at San Jose
State University and I originally met
her a couple years ago as she was
preparing for her trip to Antarctica so
I'm very excited to hear about this talk
and without further ado here's Monica
well thanks very much for having me
speak here it's really is quite fun I've
given this talk before as as a public
talk for you know retirement home and
for an elementary school and stuff and
and what I find is that people are just
really psyched about science and stuff
like that and then I would hazard a
guess that there are an awful lot of
people here who were probably dinosaur
geeks when they were this big and that
kind of thing anybody gonna fess up to
something like that okay I was too
except I never really quite got over it
and somehow wound up doing astrophysics
and getting into meteorites and that
kind of thing and so before I get too
far into this talk i have to thank all
the people at McMurdo Station which is
the main base down Antarctica that the
United States runs all its missions out
of and if it weren't for these hundreds
or thousands of people at McMurdo you
know washing our dishes and patching up
our tents and all that this mission and
all the other ones that go down to
Antarctica would never have happened so
definitely big thanks to all the people
down there that don't get the always
share in the glory of the science that
comes out of that amazing continent so
I'd also like to acknowledge some an
affiliation i have with the virtual
planetary lab which is one of the nasa
astrobiology institute teams who also
supports my research all right okay so
this is what makes me go forwards hello
hmm okay now what okay here we go so the
trip that I went down there on is called
the Antarctic search for meteorites or
ann's met and it's supported
historically by the National Science
Foundation although NASA had been
chipping in some money for the last few
years and the we all hear about these
sample return missions like the Stardust
mission that just brought back
samples of a comet and there's a
Japanese mission that's trying to bring
back pieces of an asteroid and so but
this really is the cheapest sample
return mission of all time except we
can't really be that picky about where
our bits of pieces of outer space come
from they might come from most of them
come from the asteroid belt but a lot of
them you know some of them come from the
moon and even a few come from Mars so um
what my mom wanted to know was well you
know I understand how meteorites can be
interesting and stuff but why do you
have to go to Antarctica why don't you
know why don't they fall in New Jersey
or something like that so I'm but it
turns out that Antarctica is one of the
best places to look for meteorites
because it's a polar desert environment
which means that rocks from space that
fall to earth these rocks have never
seen water and they've never seen oxygen
and those are the two things that eat
rocks and so once these things fall to
earth they're very susceptible to be
weathered except in Antarctica they get
preserved because there's no liquid
water down there they're not sitting in
puddles and but also the ice flow and
the wind patterns tend to concentrate
these meteorites in certain areas and
I'll talk a little bit more about that
and then of course it certainly helps
that ice is bright white and these rocks
are black that also kind of makes it
easy to find so it all starts in
Christchurch New Zealand and here we are
wearing our extreme cold weather gear in
sunny summer time Christchurch New
Zealand this is December or the end of
november getting ready to get on the
plane all the flights to McMurdo fly out
of Christchurch for the United States
missions so here's some of our team
members just baking in these horrifying
outfits that we had to wear and then the
luxurious first-class trip down to the
ice and so I have to point out here you
can probably find me and there I'm the
blonde one right there this is our PI
Ralph Harvey and a couple of my
teammates and we're basically stuffed in
there with all of our gear and
everything and back here this little
sheet here that's the bathroom so that
was kind of an interesting 8 hour long
flight and the plane that we flew down
on and it takes off with the wheels when
we're in Christchurch and then to land
on the ice down on via
on the ice sheet not even on land yeah
the runway is just basically flattened
out ice and snow and it puts down the
skis so that's also what makes this
airplane so slow too because it's got
this landing gear that's just hanging
out of it the whole way so the LC 1 30
hercules it's flown by the actually the
New York dare National Guard and here's
McMurdo lovely scenic McMurdo and here
is some of the dorms this is the ocean
coming in here frozen this breaks up
later in the summer and over here
somewhere he can't really see it but
there's a robert falcon scott hut at
that point so that's the discovery hut
from which he launched his 1902 mission
and that was really cool we got a chance
to go in there and walk around and look
at all the stuff in there and there's
some science labs here's the kerreri
science lab where we spent a lot of time
and over here somewhere as we're all of
our gear was we had to pick up all our
tents and everything all that stuff is
already down there waiting for us and of
course safety is a huge issue down here
not only because of the cold but because
of the hazards regarding crevasses and
other things that we might run into so
we had basic mountaineering training
which meant learning how to tie knots
basically and learning how to get
ourselves out of a jam we ever found
ourselves dangling into one of these
which was frowned upon but what they
tried to do was to teach us what to do
if we or one of our teammates fell into
a crevasse if we were ever in an area
like that we'd have to be roped up and
stuff and so after a couple days of
learning how to do stuff they don't
teach you in graduate school such as
driving a snowmobile up a 50-degree
slope and we did that for a few days
that was fun I have to say that was
quite fun mm-hmm we had to pack up our
supplies and take a closer look at what
some of our supplies were not just tents
and food and stuff like that but also we
had some goodies there there's the
Bombay Sapphire can't go in the field
without that a lot of people ask me
about the weather and anybody ever lived
back east we're like in Florida or
something like that and when they ask
you about the weather it's like it's not
the heat it's the humidity well in
Antarctica
it's not the cold it's the wind and it
doesn't even matter what the temperature
the air temperature is but if that wind
is blowing it's a very very unhappy
place to be and at the South Pole
Station this is the weather report for
the South Pole and wind blowing at nine
knots pretty standard they could blow up
to we had a couple days where we had 30
40 mile an hour wind and this past field
season I heard that they were having
gusts up to 50 miles an hour or even
more than that so it was pretty wicked
but the air temperature this is pretty
standard I guess somewhere a little
below zero that's pretty typical for the
places that we were okay let's talk a
little bit more about the science part
here so meteorites can actually get
preserved in the ice for thousands of
years and in some cases they found
meteorites that were actually entombed
in the ice for millions of years I think
that the oldest was two million years
residence time on the earth and so we're
not looking for meteorites that fell
yesterday because remember only one
meteorite for square kilometer for
10,000 years falls meteorite that you
can actually see there's lots of little
micro meteorites falling all the time
and so the average time on earth or what
we call the terrestrial age of the
meteorite is somewhere between 25 and
sixty five thousand years that's where
the age is cluster that's also that
25,000 year figure is also the amount of
time roughly since the end of the last
ice age so since then the ice sheets
have been shrinking away and as they do
so the meteorites that they were holding
gets stranded on the surface most
meteorites that we have in our
collections here on the earth are 4.5
billion years old they slightly exceed
the age of the earth and they're
essentially the same age as the Sun and
so when we find a meteorite that's
younger than that then that's what's
really exciting because that means it's
not just yet another piece of the rubble
left over from the formation of the
solar system although that stuff is
great it makes up most of the meteorites
that are falling
so have it worked back my my my
vocal-cord calluses since I started
teaching yesterday so this might be a
little bit scratchy but the meteorites
that fell over a large area actually get
concentrated by the not only the ice
sheets shrinking or deflating but also
the motion of the ice and there are
certain areas that the ice floe actually
kind of stagnates as it's flowing
through the the Transantarctic mountains
eventually to the sea so I'm back in the
day the Antarctic continent was explored
by a number of methods some more
successful than others and here I'm
showing some images from robert falcon
scott strip and Shackleton's trip to the
to the continent and the preferred
method by the english at least was man
hauling stuff and they also tried ponies
the ponies worked out better as food as
than they did as anything else and the
Norwegians of course he's skis and dogs
and it was slightly more successful way
we use snowmobiles and those work just
fine they're little they're a little
rough on the ice because we're not
driving on nice soft fluffy snow we're
driving on solid ice most of the time
and but our tents these yellow tents
here they are essentially the same
design as the tents that were used by
Scott Shackleton expeditions basically
nine foot by nine foot square double
walled canvas pretty windproof not
completely windproof but close to it and
you know they actually were pretty good
you know it's home sweet home for the
seven weeks that we spent in the field
we also have a solar panel so we can
charge up our computer we've got a radio
this is a radio tower so we could at
least talk to McMurdo we also had a Sat
phone so that everybody could talk to
their wives and girlfriends and
boyfriends and whatnot back home and so
here's the plane again and so this is
how we loaded it up when we were getting
out of the fields just kind of loaded up
our sleds and drove them into the plane
but in case you're ever wondering how to
put
snowmobile in a small aircraft you just
basically drive it in it's the only way
to do anything with these guys and I was
on a reconnaissance team so we actually
changed locations about once a week so
we'd have to rip down camp pack
everything up shove everything in these
little airplanes and then get slept on
to our next search location and so on it
took us four flights to relocate the
four team members to our new site and on
each flight we'd have a person a
snowmobile an oil drum and or you know a
fuel drum and an attempt and supplies
and stuff and by the way if you ever go
to Antarctica don't bother bringing Clif
bars because they turn to the
consistency of like a hockey puck and
they're completely inedible unless
they've been sitting in your armpit for
about three hours and it's very
uncomfortable having a frozen Clif Bar
in your armpit for three hours so here's
the Antarctic continent and the the
continent is bisected by this range of
mountains called the Transantarctic and
they're largely volcanic in origin so
they they basically were formed as I
don't know what the official geological
term is but this huge amount of
volcanism came in and basically built
this huge rift made out of basalt which
is a very heavy volcanic igneous rock
and so most of the Transantarctic SAT
least where we were what was made out of
this very dense kind of dark reddish
type of rock and that was very
interesting geology and also all the
geology is laid bare for you to see
there's no vegetation covering this or
anything really fascinating and we found
fossils tumbling out not in the basalt
but there's sedimentary rock down there
too we found fossilized wood we found
fossilized sea creatures and stuff like
that really interesting place for
geology and what's going on is that so
the South Pole is in here somewhere and
snow falls all the time it's actually
very little precipitation to officially
a desert one of the driest deserts in
the world and but the snow pile
up and eventually gets compressed to ice
and all that ice is gradually flowing to
lower elevation meaning towards the sea
and along the mountains here it has two
eyes has to get through the mountain
passes and these glaciers carry the ice
to the sea but in certain locations the
ice floe stagnates and it makes that ice
vulnerable to ablation by these cata bat
aquinnah char gravity-driven winds that
blow pretty much continuously all the
time they're there just the wind
direction is m speed is relatively
constant throughout the field season and
in these regions that are continuously
exposed how's that for a second these
regions that are continuously exposed to
the cata batiks eventually get all the
snow gets blown away whatever piddly
little snowfall like half a millimeter
of snow which might fall gets blown away
immediately so you're walking around
actually on snow that was compressed to
ice 25 you know or 45 thousand years ago
and and that was our drinking water to
that was this pretty good water I have
to say and so the ice flow is
relentlessly heading downhill and in
these areas where the where the ice flow
gets kind of halted that's where we find
the meteorites so these blue ice areas
and the reason that the ice is blue and
it really is blue that that's a close-up
of the ice and in fact I think my camera
didn't quite get the you know the real
impression of this it's this amazing
translucent just three dimensional blue
and it's because that's what color ice
really is the reason that our ice cubes
are white is that we're not looking
through enough of it and also there's a
lot of air bubbles and stuff in our ice
cubes in the fridge but if they were
compressed and you were looking through
100 feet of it that's what color it
would be and this is taken from a higher
elevation airplane and so I got this you
need us geological survey but you can
kind of see that we've got an ice floe
this looks like it's sort of oozing and
there's even like ripples and over here
to this really is ice all the dark gray
stuff is ice and the white stuff is snow
so the snow gets blown away and the ice
floe in the
wins sort of conspire to make certain
regions very rich in meteorites and
here's just an average day cruising
around driving these snowmobiles across
the across the ice so it's just loud I
mean it looks like this beautiful serene
picture but let me tell you you got this
two-stroke engine rattling across ice
it's like it's like it's awful but it
was this live actually huge amount of
fun and we were just drive the four of
us across in a row and when you saw rock
you drive up to it stop get off look at
it it was me right wave have everybody
come over and they'd laugh at you if it
wasn't a meteorite and if it was we'd
collect it and put it in a bag and stick
in the box and so I'm showing this this
is the most blatant example of a
meteorite this is actually rather large
most of the ones we found are probably
smaller than a golf ball somewhere
between golf ball and Hershey kiss sighs
the meteorite size range that we find
it's basically determined by the
resolution of the human of human vision
at you know a certain distance away so
you could probably see a Hershey's kiss
on this bright white ice from a distance
of at least 50 meters but this one is so
obviously a meteorite I'm sure you've
never seen a rock like this if you have
please let me know and it's all burnt
and kind of cracked on the outside here
so and it's all smoothed off too and
this is in a region where the rocks that
crumble out of the cliff just look like
somebody chisolm out with a hammer they
got all these jagged edges on and stuff
but this thing all the edges are birds
off they're all smoothed off and this
thin crust which kind of looks like
something I would have cooked in the you
know for dinner or something this burnt
crust has shipped off to reveal
something different underneath so that
was basically that our standard type of
rock that we found out there type of
meteorite that we found and so here's
what happens when we find one we want to
pick it up and collect it with as
sterile conditions as possible so yeah
okay it's been laying around out in
Antarctica for a while but there's
hardly any organic matter and almost no
detectable bacteria out there in the
ice it's all they can do to kind of
scavenge a few bacteria that probably
blew in from somewhere so we just got to
make sure that we don't this crack right
here it's actually crevasse and that
that's snow that you see on there is
probably just a few inches thick and so
we had to make sure not to step on those
things if you could really twist your
ankle and the big ones you can see the
big ones so it wasn't you know those are
easy to avoid you're not supposed to
touch it but you're also supposed to
make sure it's a meteorite sometimes
these two things are mutually exclusive
of each other because you stop and you
know for not seeing any meteorites for
hours and you'd stop you're like stupid
rock and pick it up and it's got fusion
crust on the other side and go Oh
mountain here's one um so then we take a
GPS position all these are recorded and
we stick a little flag in there and
where we found it it gets a field number
and a photograph for two or three and we
take the dimensions just roughly you
know this two inches by three inches by
5 inches or whatever and and then make
some just superficial comments about it
is it fifty percent covered by fusion
cross ninety percent a hundred percent
whatever and then it goes into sterile
sample bag and the next time it will see
the light of day as in Houston and in
Houston there's the Astro materials
curatorial facility at Johnson Space
Center and so they're going to follow
these things out under dry nitrogen and
and then put them in storage and send
half of the meteorite samples to the
Smithsonian Institution in Washington DC
so that's the procedure there and oh
here's what happens when you step on one
of those little curve haces so that's
just a close up of my footprints which
was like 50 feet deep and this is one of
the bigger crevices so if there were any
interesting looking rocks on here that
we wanted to investigate they just got
left there so all of this is a very thin
layer of snow that covers you know like
what we were just looking at here except
more like 10 feet wide so you just
couldn't drive on that any snow was
suspicious especially the stuff that had
that kind of frothy whipped appearance
to it so I developed this unnatural fear
of cool whip
I was down there as well and and this is
a cool shot this is the Antarctic Ice
Sheet where it meets the Transantarctic
mountains and we can see that the ice
sheet is not grinding right up against
the mountains but for my take on this it
looks like the mountain is actually
almost heating the ice sheet and causing
a lot of evaporation and ablation along
this leading edge just to give you an
idea of the height here this is one of
my teammates standing there so this
thing is I don't know like 30 feet high
or so and we also had to be very careful
in areas like this because we didn't
want to do any backwards downhill
snowmobiling which I've tried a couple
of times can't say I recommend it so you
don't know what you're going to wind up
at the bottom of and here's another
meteorite this is a carbonaceous
chondrite this is in the category of
meteorites that are common the
chondrites are the most common but among
those only about ten percent are of
these carbonaceous types and the
carbonaceous ones they're much more
friable they sometimes can have the
consistency of you know dried clay or
something and the reason they're so
interesting to to my field of research
which is like origin of life and origin
of the earth that kind of stuff is that
these meteorites are known to contain
amino acids and nucleic acid bases and
stuff like that and that's just really
interesting to try to investigate and
when people are thinking about the
origin of life what kind of materials
were actually falling on the earth we
assume that meteorites haven't really
been changing composition all these
billions of years so on so those are
very interesting types of meteorites to
study here's just a cool looking one the
chemistry of the meteorite itself is
pretty standard it's not an ordinary
chondrite so it's not as rich in carbon
as the other one but this particular
meteorite had a preferred orientation
when it came through the atmosphere
usually when meteorites come in they're
tumbling around and they get burned on
all sides nothing preferentially but
this one was took on the shape of a nose
cone of a rocket because it already kind
of was that shape when it hit the
atmosphere and you can even see here
there's like these streaky patterns
that's from one that outer shell or the
outer layer of the meteorite gets so hot
that it no
away and when it melts it leaves this
streaky pattern like that that was a
cool one that a couple other cool ones
here some things kind of gave us pause
this one we found just laying around out
there there's nothing else out there and
we picked it up and it didn't look
particularly like a meteorite it's not
black it doesn't have fusion crust but
there was nothing else out there this
one also this we found on on day three
and it looked totally different than
these you know then that kind of reddish
kind of hamburger he looking texture of
the ordinary chondrites so when we found
this we knew it must be a meteorite
because there was nothing else out there
and it had kind of this very glassy
black fusion crust on it so rocks don't
just burn especially when they were
laying around in Antarctica so we picked
that one up and whoops so my is my
little joke here was like how do we tell
if they're from Mars which is they come
conveniently wrapped in in a wrapper but
actually this one that I just showed you
this this one we found out what like in
July after I got back that this one
actually was a meteorite from Mars we
knew at the time it was something
special because it didn't look anything
like any of the other meteorites that we
found it was all real dark black and
sparkly and just totally different from
all the other meteorites and we knew for
sure it was something special and it
turns out that in fact it was the first
Martian meteorite that had been found in
Antarctica for the past nine years and
it was the first of Martian meteorites
called a knock light that was found in
Antarctica ever so that was a huge huge
discovery for us and so it's it takes
its place as one of the 30 known Martian
meteorites that we have in our
collections here on the earth today
surely more of them laying around out
there and here's another kind of
weird-looking meteorite this one
definitely is a meteorite it's got this
black kind of shiny fusion crust on it
but the inside looks totally different
than some of the others so this is who
knows what that one is it's um it could
be from an object or it definitely is
from an object that is differentiated
and by differentiated what
I mean is that it got big enough to melt
that all the iron felt you know sank to
the center of the object leaving the
lighter stony stuff on the outside and
so this is a stony meteorite it doesn't
have any of those little chondrules that
pace little they're like little glassy
beads about the size of BB shot or a
little bit bigger than that that that's
the hallmark characteristic of the
chondrites so when we see something that
does not have chondrules and we say oh
okay this is something different this is
something particularly interesting
here's another eight chondrite so
something without chondrules just cool
looking thing and it's white who knows
why okay Oh in this particular location
we actually found not just a few
unrelated meteorites but we found 80
something fragments of the same thing so
this original object came in and
shattered into a zillion pieces and we
found something like eighty four of the
larger fragments in this particular
location and here's where our flags
aren't know if you can see but there's a
flag here here here all along here look
look like a golf course actually and um
one of the one of the challenges about
identifying meteorites and that
sometimes they don't really look like
anything special and so what I did here
was put a meteorite next to just your
average rock that we were finding in the
in the Transantarctic so one of these is
that classic red basalt that is typical
of the Transantarctic mountains and the
other is a rock from outer space and
this in case you're wondering this is
the meteorite and this is the chunk of
assault but they were infuriatingly
similar looking so these are some of the
meteorites that we found in the outweigh
myseif area that strewn field that I was
talking about one of the reasons that we
had a hard time identifying the
meteorites at first is that they were
all they defied our usual our usual
picture of these things that have been
all burnt and had all the jagged edges
burned off of them these things were
nothing but rocks with jagged edges
hanging off that which indicated that it
broke up at a very low altitude and
relatively low speed and didn't get all
of their rough edges Bergdorf
that was the biggest fragment of the
otway Massif meteorites that we found
that thing weighed about probably 60
pounds and it only has a little tiny
piece of fusion crust on it the rest of
it's just a busted-up rock and there's a
Gretchen Benedict's and I my tent-mate
and i sitting next to that big fragment
okay so here's an interesting area we
were at we're at this place I think this
is called Roberts massif and there were
no rocks out here we drove around for
hours and hours and hours then we came
across this spot where every little rock
that had been scattered along out here
got dumped right here like everything
whatever tumbled out of the cliff
whatever meteorites there were anything
got put there for whatever little
conspiracy of physics we spent hours
going through this this a little hey
only in deposit of rocks and so if we
take a close up of some of these rocks
next to each other you can imagine in
fact I'm having a hard time looking at
this now wondering what's the meteorite
and what's the media wrong my guess is
the one that has not been disturbed as
the one that's the meteorite and when we
find something just laying around out in
the middle of nowhere like who know is
that that was just a regular rock but
there was nothing else out there so it
was really kind of strange and oh here's
the close-up of that little patch of
rocks that i just showed anybody want to
guess as to which object in here is the
meteorite i think the first thing that
jumps out is the pocketknife so the
first thing you notice is that
something's not like the others there we
go who's got the laser pointer right
here yeah so this little shiny burnt
thing and when you once you see is like
oh da yeah how could you miss that and
really that's what it was all about
there was no scientific training I mean
I have a PhD in astrophysics I was
absolutely worthless for this trip as
far as I could tell and so is basically
just look for rocks that look strange
and here's another where's waldo picture
there are actually two meteorites in
this in this picture one thing that
always jumps out at me is this weird
white thing like oh there's this white
rock and a picture but there are
actually two meteorites in this picture
want anybody else at the laser pointer
okay so we got this kind of burnt shiny
thing here no they're actually sitting
right next to each other you know there
we are this giant pile of rocks you know
like 50 feet long and 10 feet wide and
went to meteorites were sitting next to
each other this is actually interesting
because it was one of those carbonaceous
chondrites and I think from what I
recall it was also oriented so it's kind
of fried on one side and not on the
other but they're all about the same
size roughly and okay so the last couple
shots are just the gratuitous pretty
picture shots from Antarctica this is
our our camp manager and team leader
John Scott he's been doing the ants Matt
trip for the past 25 years pretty much
since it was invented back in the late
70s and so he's a very hardened
Antarctic type of person and also a
excellent geologist field geologist so
he's standing here and in the background
we have one of these glaciers just with
a blind end to it if you've ever been up
in the mountains here all of our
glaciers up in the mountains and stuff
have a river running off the end of it
here the ice just crumbles away and
evaporates there's no puddle it's too
cold for any liquid water to persist for
long and we could see evidence at at one
time the this entire bowl-shaped Valley
that this glacier looked like it was
flowing into we could see these bathtub
rings these lateral Marines and terminal
Marines up on the edges of the cliff
that you know told us about this history
of the deflation of the ice sheets for
the past you know twenty to thirty
thousand years and I don't know if this
came out oh yeah I kind of did um
Antarctica is famous for having really
amazing solar halo displays and on the
morning of what actually was the 41st
birthday of one of my ten nights or one
of my teammates and we woke up in the
morning to this incredible solar halo
display so we had the 22 degree halo and
we've also got Sun dogs they're also
called par Helia and the par helix
circle which kind of goes straight
through like this and then also get an
upper tangent arc and a whole bunch of
other arcs and these other things and it
just took up the entire sky your entire
field of view is just rainbow
are everywhere little weird shape
rainbows is just one of the most
incredible things I've ever seen and so
just to wrap up it's kind of hard to
summarize everything it's a no one
little blurb but my favorite quote is
from dr. Seuss if you want to catch
beasts you don't see every day you have
to go to places quite out of the way you
have to go places no others can get to
you have to get cold and you have to get
wet too and I just also want to thank a
couple of different entities up in the
Seattle area which is where i lived
before i came back down here the bay
area and so the Juan de Fuca festival of
the arts evergreen Elementary al McPhee
who is the patron saint of meteoritic as
far as I can tell a number isin house
and they all have made donations that
enabled me to buy some meteorites off
the internet I don't have any Antarctic
ones but i do have ones from ebay and
various other sources so if you'd like
to come up and take a look at these
afterwards you're more than welcome to
so well thank you very much questions
how do you know they are from Mars how
do we know they're from Mars okay I'm
glad you asked that because I meant to
talk about that and well when we're out
in the field we don't know all we have
is our eyes or hands and you know
sterile sample bags to put these things
in but so at first glance you just kind
of know that it's not a chondrite you
know that it's not one of the the usual
types once it gets back in the lab what
they do is to compare it to the other
Martian meteorites so mineralogical II
they took one look at under microscope
is that that's a mock light the way the
first Martian meteorite was confirmed
was that somebody extracted gases from
these little bubbles within the rocks
when they analyzed those gases they
found that those gases have the exact
same composition as the gases in Mars's
atmosphere that were determined by the
Viking missions and so the joke was okay
well if it doesn't come from Morris then
it comes from some other planet that
looks exactly like ours and has exactly
the same type of answer chemistry as
Mars house so the simpler explanation
being that it's from Mars but they were
originally misclassified as asteroid
differentiated asteroidal meteorites
initially yeah so how does it wrong just
take
how does it how they get knocked off the
surface well what happens is that every
you know a few tens of millions of years
or so or just millions of years a planet
can suffer an impact large enough that
it will you know make a pretty
decent-sized crater and mars has only a
tenth of the mass of the earth so it has
much lower gravity from Earth and it
also has only 1,000 for the atmosphere
so it's easier to get away from Mars if
Mars gets hit those rocks can escape you
know there's less drag and less gravity
to escape from it's harder to launch
rocks off the earth and near impossible
to launch rocks are from Venus in this
way but people have actually done
calculations where they slam cars with
something you know not unreasonable
sighs and not unreasonable ski and
figure out the trajectories so the
history of these Mars meteorites is that
there's a collision probably you know
tens of millions of years ago and the
rocks go everywhere some of them fall
back on the planet some of them leave
the solar system some of them take them
on trajectories that will eventually
lead up to earth and I think the number
is something like these things will be
out of space for I can't remember the
exact number but something like on the
order of millions of years and then land
on the earth the ones that do get here
take about that long
yeah I wonder what are you being all
know that this is good and when the rock
is out in space it's being irradiated by
cosmic rays which group shielded from
down here on the earth and when the
thing is out of space it's getting
bombarded by these cosmic rays which
actually create new nuclei in some cases
so through nuclear reactions you get
elements Nick Williams one of them
different isotopes of relatively
short-lived elements that undergo
radioactive decay and so they kind of
reach an equilibrium value when they're
out there in space once the rod gets to
the earth now they have no more
production rate and and they're just you
know tapering off over time so they look
for those elements that are produced by
cosmic rays out in space and then they
see how a little of that is left here on
the earth and they can actually get a
terrestrial age trivia with a bottom
earth
I can find out here
well Martian ones that's like you know
free trip Tamara's except you don't know
exactly where on the surface it came
from and one of the things that were
very interested in regarding Mars is the
history of water on Mars and you know
how long did liquid water persist we
know it must have been there but was it
a few hundred years was that hundreds of
thousands of years or de Mars have a
horn like grounded four billion years
and what we're hoping these rocks can
tell us is at least for the time of the
rock so some of the NOC lights are only
about a billion years old maybe of doing
point three or so and that can tell us
what you know what was going on on Mars
at that time with these rocks ever
exposed to with the water so that can
tell us you know did that Roxy liquid
water environments a billion years ago
on Mars so that those are the kind of
things that's always a Martian
meteorites go for the ordinary
chondrites those are relics left over
from the formation of our solar system
so they're telling us about what the
building materials preferred the other
inner planets was and what kind of
compounds were falling on the earth
time that life originated on earth yeah
huge
our fusion fire
oh yeah in fact lunar meteorites the
first meteorite that was recognized as a
lunar meteorite was one of the ones
found by ants met back in 1979 and so it
turns out that there were actually
meteorites in our collections got bandz
my collection but people had rocks that
they knew were meteorites but they
didn't know where they came from and
they turned out to complete her after
the fact so the way that you recognize a
lunar rock is that we've already got
rocks from the movies and what they're
picked up so that was easy things like
oh this looks exactly like that but we
don't have that full Mars and so that
was a slightly more roundabout way to
find out the Martian identity
yes oh good question Kevin I was in the
field for seven weeks living an attempt
and no and all the attempted things are
for the attempt for that one and we
found our reconnaissance team found 505
meteorites 1307 weeks and there was
another team of eight people down there
basically more people means more eyes
20t rights and the eight-person team
found eight hundred and something like
850 I think and so all together between
the 12 of us being down there we found
over 1,300 meteorites which was one of
the biggest hauls of ants met among the
bigger this year they had extremely bad
weather I was following our web blog and
they there was some seriously bad
weather including snowfall which did not
get blown away so they found fewer
rights but they still found a lot and
some potential danger supplies as well
and what was the other pressure to event
that was it okay
more I like a huge amount of chocolate
is there there wasn't really a lot of
time to actually be moving around a lot
I mean we move around when we chipped
holes in the ice to plant our little
flags but you know so somebody
understanding they're jumping around
drinking lots of warm liquids and you
know I mean wearing just a huge amount
of clothing and the battery operated
socks I have tear those which I used
sparingly because they go through t
cells like crazy but the boots I have to
say the foods that could get that the M
the clothing distribution center gave to
us there are these standard army-issue
polar exploration foods or bunny boots
as anybody that's been to Antarctica
recognized bunny boots and they're
horrible they don't keep your feet warm
they're they're awful and so I have
pretty bad circulation my feet for
months afterwards so this is going to be
broadcast on the web so do something
about that people down in Christchurch
got some decent boots please but nobody
I just eating a huge amount of calories
or not I mean I'm kind of a snack hound
and I could barely keep up you know I
mean it was like eating was almost like
a chore you know i'm just getting enough
calories in so yeah
the largest one was probably about that
big around and it weighed about probably
close to 70 pounds and it was an
ordinary chondrite so kind of
garden-variety meteorite and it was part
of a shrew field that we found like over
80 fragments of it and hundreds of
pounds worth of the same thing so the
people down in Johnson her probably
wouldn't it was gone Thanks yeah at
least it could have been something
interesting
well if there's no more questions I
invite everybody to come up and take a
look at these lovely rocks that i have
and i also have a couple of little tiny
ones too like these are the show and
tell pass them around types but feel
free to come on up and take a look
thanks again</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
