he's a very famous I guess I don't know
this world but this field cave Explorer
is being responsible for discovery and
exploration of mini caves which he'll
recover and he would have pictures much
better than what I can do
he's also as being involved a lot in
aerospace and underwater exploration as
well which ties into the cave and I'm
doing a terrible job of introduction so
I want to talk about this himself but
remember there is the 12:30 talk which
should be a super fascinating one thanks
ok I want to thank all of you for the
opportunity to come out here this is
this is for me a rather eye opening
experience to to see what Silicon Valley
King Valley has metamorphosed into over
the last 10 15 years or so I used to do
some research work in collaboration with
Ames met a few of the people who have
migrated here from there as the interest
in the space arena change over time I've
had the privilege over the past 25 years
of being involved not only with space
exploration related projects aerospace
vehicle design and things like that at a
National Lab but also of leading some
projects that deal with some of the last
untouched truly unexplored terrain that
exists on this planet if you try to ask
yourself where would you where would you
go if you were if you really wanted to
go someplace that was truly unexplored
you know you think about the mountains
right I've climbed some fairly high
altitude peaks you can get satellite
images of where you're going while
you're on the mountain you can call up
people through Sat phone you can get
weather forecasts for the next day to
try to plan your summit assault that's
how much the Alpine environment has
changed over the last 50 years
similarly with pretty much all of the
tropical rainforest the jungles and the
other places they are at deserts and
things like that as well as as
underwater some may argue that the ocean
is one of the least explored places at
least when you get down to talking about
touching every square metre that's quite
true but as far as knowledge
we have really detailed benthic maps of
the entire floor of the ocean we visited
the deepest spots and pretty much liked
the plans to return to the moon in 2020
you know people were talking still about
returning to the bottom of the Marianas
Trench as if it were a big deal we ought
to be able to do better than that
but in one particular area and and this
is something that's taken me a long time
to realize what constitutes a true
frontier right it's it's a place where
in my opinion the exploration consists
of a process and this is where many
people try to wiggle out of the
definition to me the the definition of
exploration is putting this in terra
incognita nothing short of that now you
can do it in many ways by gaining
scientific knowledge by using
intelligent mechanical surrogates now we
call these things robotic spacecraft for
example or robotic autonomous underwater
vehicles and the question then becomes a
philosophical one is it better to see a
raster line appear on a television
screen of the image of a place that no
one's seen before or is it better to be
there in person to be able to look at it
and interactively touch it feel it
experiment with it observe satisfy the
curiosity of the human species I tend to
fall into the latter category but there
are places where indeed it is too
dangerous too far simply because our
limited knowledge of propulsion has not
allowed us to get there more easily or
perhaps it is in fact a lethal
environment like for example the surface
of Europa is not a good place for humans
five minutes there and you would have a
lethal dose of radiation largely whipped
up by particles from the Sun going out
and being spun up in the gravitational
sphere of Jupiter so what I'm going to
talk about here now and I hope a couple
of you won't we'll find your way over to
the talk at 12:30 on on Europa because
there's a lot of cool stuff that's going
on in the robotic area as well as many
of those in California who have had any
association with JPL or Ames would know
but this is about what's left on earth
and it has to do with the
exploration of extraordinarily deep
caves everybody's probably at one time
or another visitor to commercial cave
what I'd like to show you today is a
very unknown world at least unknown to
almost everybody I know except for a
very small band of expeditionary groups
there around the world who do know
what's going on and realized that this
is in fact a finite dwindling frontier
and they're going for it now on
expeditions pretty much as much as two
to three or four months a year until
they run out of time so what I'm going
to show you is where things are
happening there are there are largely
three places in the world right now
where there is a competition going on
for lack of a better term between
goodwill groups Russians are leading one
in an area of Chechnya which is a bad
place for Americans to go unfortunately
the u.s. is leading a multinational team
of about ten countries to an area in
southern Mexico and there are pockets of
work that are taking place at high
altitude in Austria and the French
Spanish border in places like that but
largely it is shaking out now to what we
would call the 2,000 meter plush plus
game the deepest caves in the world for
the longest times were measured as a
crossing of a thousand meters much in
the same measure as you would consider a
high all dat peaked to be an 8,000 meter
peak and there was this gradual push to
where things slowly slowly grew towards
2,000 meters deep it was as much of a
physical barrier as a psychological
barrier to think about it end I hope
when you see these slides here you'll
get a feel for the fact that these are
not it's not like going to a national
park these are projects where to gear up
is equally or greater than the logistics
involved with the largest Everest
expeditions that were ever put together
typically you're looking at a 50 person
team on-site for four months it takes on
the order of two to three weeks to get
your team to base camp it takes several
weeks to initially begin to prepare a
place like this for travel and you'll
kind of see what that travel is like and
then there are a whole host of obstacles
at least three or four or five that I
would run into the category of extreme
situations
where we have had to invent technology
and we've been doing this now for over
25 years and you'll get to see some of
that here the place that we're working
with the US team is leading is in
southern Mexico if anybody's been down
there it's about 400 kilometers
southeast of Mexico City in the
northeastern tip of the state of Oaxaca
the the idea is that there is a large
entrance up there called cueva cheve a
which was discovered about 20 years ago
and at that time it was explored down
for a certain distance the water that
goes in these things
unlike a Jules Verne journey does not go
to the center of the earth they go
towards the center of the earth but
eventually with most of the deep cave
systems on the earth they have to find a
way for the water that creates and these
are created in the limestone there are
in fact lava type systems but they don't
go as deep at least not yet
most of them collapse because of the
hydrostatic pressure in this particular
case in cueva cheve a we have the
possibility of hitting over 2,600 meters
down over a distance of about 20
kilometers and the waters come out in a
spring down here in the depths of this
place called the Santo Domingo Canyon so
those are kind of the the topography on
and we have projects that are going up
and down this mountain range it's about
20 kilometers from left to right about
six kilometers across and 2,600 meters
deep the game then is what's in between
in the center of this mountain and how
deep can you go in it yeah it's the
vertical extent I'll show you here at
the end in order to determine that you
actually have to survey what you're
doing inside the mountain so we actually
have a three-dimensional computer model
of the inside of the mountain and then
I'll show you right at the end here that
shows where everything sits inside if
you go from point to point for example
if you go from the highest known point
and you pop out and the resurgence
Springs you can go down there with phase
differential GPS and within a centimeter
you know exactly what the vertical
differential is so when we talk about
depth it's the vertical differential
from the highest point to the lowest
point if you're talking about the length
of a system that's an entirely different
animal the the stuff that's being found
here will probably when it all winds up
be in excess of 150 or 200 kilometers
worth of passage
that weave their way in through the
interior of this mountain to do that
however is is going to be a logistical
challenge the likes of which we've
really not dealt with yet here on earth
and I'll tell you why it's it's kind of
a it's kind of a dramatic statement to
wait but when you see what we've gone
through to get the knowledge that we
have and what what remains you'll see
that it is in fact logistics that
control the entire thing so basically
you can start many many projects here by
trying to choose a target point to find
your way inside the mine this one here
is at the bottom of a canyon that is
deeper than the Grand Canyon it's called
the Santo Domingo that's just a part of
the the ramparts of the plateaus
surrounding each side they go up over
3,000 meters in each direction this is a
typical type of morphology that you find
down there you're going in through
fairly dry type stuff because you're at
a resurgent spring you're working
upwards through the mountain these are
some local Mexicans from on the village
just like in the US you might have
farmers that would own a cave down here
they're Mexican Ranchers these are the
kinds of things that people typically
think about when they think about caves
they're relatively small they have
formations in them this is what you
would find if you went to a typical
tourist type cavern when you get further
in you find out that that you're dealing
with places that are flushed by seasonal
rains and this is one of the controlling
factors in southern Mexico is that you
really only have about a four month
window between the beginning of February
and the end of May when you can conduct
any type of research here after that
point these things will flood right to
the roof and flush out and so you're
getting this nice polished scalping
going on here
however invariably in these things you
find yourself confronted with obstacles
that are a grade up okay and there were
several of them that I'll point out to
you here one is that the strata that
you're following can take a minor hiccup
it can just be a concave Bend that goes
downward be the Cape is not n these are
carved out by water moving through them
and the water that's moving through them
then collects you have the equivalent
some trap in a sink in your bathroom or
something like that and the question is
how long are those things well in this
particular case we've been in this 450
meters so far 30 meters depth and the
little sketch on the lower right was
taken from the expedition Basecamp log
that showed this guy had gone in with
two tanks and a rebreather took the
rebreather off took one of the tanks off
and was pushing the other tank ahead of
him with a hammer trying to knock rocks
out of the way that's the kind of
mentality that you have going on to to
explore these things at the same time
that was going on there was another team
that was saying well you know if it
stopped here going down there's still a
possibility that there can be multi
levels these things are labyrinthine in
nature the rivers find their courses
from higher levels to lower levels over
time and so this crew here on the all
these slides started climbing above that
underwater tunnel and in fact scaled a
hundred meters straight up using rock
drills and you have somebody type
climbing techniques to where they got to
a point where the the path onward was
blocked with boulders in the ceiling and
the curious thing was that there was a
lot of air coming out of these boulders
now you had a choice there you're
hanging off 100 meters worth of rope
over an underwater tunnel and if you
decide to pull one of these boulders out
so that you can go past it it may
initiate a landslide which then comes
down cuts all your ropes and might hurt
you a while or at the very least leave
you stranded hanging on the wall up
there so we decided it was prudent at
that point not to go any further and so
here was kind of a cross-section of
what's going on in the bottom it's a
section view and on the top is the plan
view there's about 12 kilometers of
caves there the parts that are blue in
red or underwater and that is not
uncommon in a deep cave system to find
the fact that a fair substantial amount
is underwater some of it involves
climbing going up if we were exploring
this from the top down we would be
throwing ropes down the shaft as opposed
to climbing up from the bottom but this
is starting at the bottom of the problem
and trying to see if we can explore into
the mountain going upwards another thing
it's rather curious and I always found
this funny when I looked at the history
of exploration and things like that if
you would you would look at a map of a
very deep cave over in France for
example and it would have
dates on 19 1898 1930 1950 to 1980 the
places that over the course of time
sometimes over a hundred years in many
cases there would be expansion of
knowledge because technology had changed
or something like that and so many of
these things will go for a ten-year or
15-year hiatus before somebody will say
you know it's time to go back and look
again and so this right here czev a 2003
was the first expedition in seven years
to what is certainly one of the great
caves over the world it would be like
the equivalent of Everest getting
visited only once every seven years
that's that's this the nature of these
places and the logistics of getting to
them this picture right here is rather
curious you can see all these little
white streaks there that's 3000 meters
of nine millimeter nylon line that's
going to be used to rig this cave and
straightening it out and cutting it and
bagging and things like that is one of
the first little chores that you do on
an expedition the area is located just
to the east of the the well known table
kind Valley this is the place where corn
was first discovered by anthropologists
back in the 1960s well proven to have
existed there is one of the earlier
agricultural remnants of a society
ancient society that was where it was
first cultivated I should say this is a
Robert mang nation that that crew and
then you're going up from a desert
through deciduous and then finally up
into a pine forest at 3,000 meters
elevation and one of things you can see
here is what looks to be a giant valley
in fact that valley extends in five
different directions of about the same
size and sitting at the very bottom is
this little soccer field with nice green
grass going in the bottom it's it's
called a y'know in Spanish meaning
meadow and the curious thing about it is
that this is up a 3,000 meters elevation
all the water that drains within that
five kilometer diameter circle goes into
this entrance right here and when you
find things like this this is the kind
of things that people who are looking to
discover a deep cave somewhere in the
world look for those kind of signs does
it capture a lot of water is it very
high elevation
and in this particular case it's it's
really sitting on top so what we saw
before there was explorations in this
thing called the chub a resurgence that
at the very base of the money we're now
at the very far upper right at the
entrance of cueva cheve a trying to go
down and in this year 2003 the deepest
point the cave was 1,386 meters and you
see this thing called Chauvet som that
means there's an underwater tunnel there
and as soon as you start adding all of
the rope work and the fact that you got
to do cave diving at the end of this you
start to see that the logistics start to
man up which is why people don't do this
every year
very typical here this is just going
through a series of 120 shafts on the
way down and traverses they vary in size
most of them you know probably 15 20 30
meters a lot of them can get up as high
as 50 to 150 meters this is a 320 meter
level I hope everybody understands
metric because I'm not going back to
feet we we made that conversion a long
time ago at the National Lab anyway so
this is the 500 meter level here this is
where pretty much the the limit of where
you could get on a single day's travel
this would be about a 24 hour journey to
get out of this point and back out with
a backpack that's the beginning of a
shaft if any of you guys or people saw
for example you know some of the
Hollywood representations of you know
what happens underground things like
that invariably they have something like
a bottomless pit and you know they throw
a rock in and it goes forever curiously
enough this one here is is 150 meters
okay if you throw a rock down this it
takes about six seconds freefall thing
at the bottom that's really not much the
the current knowledge of this kind of
thing a single single drop not
necessarily deepest cave in the world
with a single drop is now 600 meters
over in Croatia for people who are into
morphological features it is as far as
I've heard from colleagues a straight
drop it's got Alpine ice water that
flows into it so it's not a very
pleasant place but 2,000 feet straight
down
oops slipped
you're supposed to kit it supposed to
catch me here one of things about deep
caves is that they are very much like a
diamond analogy it's like like the limbs
of a tree very high up in the tree you
have very small limbs they come down
they eventually join to form a trunk
think of each one of those things as a
potential entrance that collects water
so the tops of a very deep cave
frequently tend to be small unless they
have a big focus mechanism that's the
term for that big sinkhole that you saw
there frequently you don't have that so
you end up with these very tiny passages
that as you get deeper they get bigger
after they join with another and another
another but eventually in all these
cases by the time you get to somewhere
around the 800 to a thousand meter level
you have a substantial underground river
that you are dealing with it continues
to build and become a danger a physical
danger so you find yourself building
tension traverses and things like that
to bypass all this stuff that is correct
yeah rainy season that water would
probably be four or five meter meters
higher in that area and you would not
want to be there some passages would
flood completely shut this picture on
the left here is something that's called
a taut line slack line traverse and it's
a it's a technique that we picked up
from the Europeans probably ten years
ago in which you have a what used to be
called a Tyrolean line which is a
diagonal line going down and then you
have a slack rappel line and so you hook
up a short cable on to the the taut line
and you repel the slack line what it
does is it carries you magically away
from the place you want to avoid which
in this case is that big waterfall and
coming back up is a little more
complicated you have to put a pulley on
the on the taut line and have send the
slack line this kind of gives you an
idea for the logistics here you'll note
that there's distinctly different types
of suits going on here that's because
we've got nine nations involved on these
projects typically sometimes ten or
eleven right now it's it's it's mostly
us Mexico England France Switzerland
Germany Poland Canada Australia Portugal
Spain are the main ones these guys right
here with the light-colored yellow suits
are all
polish team they're unloading tackle at
camp two at - 800 meters on the far
right over there the guy in the sleeping
bag is on the lead rigging team he's out
about two days from the entrance at that
point these guys up there have just
bought in a resupply of rope and food to
keep the lead team going that's a very
good question in fact up until I would
say last year we did it all by basically
messenger you would send a message back
with somebody from camp - camp - camp
which offered tremendous on it's like
one of these games were y'all sit in a
circle and you telling message the next
sound by the time you get back it's not
anything close to what this guy really
wanted and if it happened to be that he
wanted a battery pack for a drill
because then we're going to be able to
rig anymore and what came out was you
know I need a charger for a battery pack
but it doesn't work with that one and so
the guy gets this charger for the
battery pack and says well you know this
one runs 110 AC we don't have that done
here and you know and we've seen stuff
like that and and and that's it that's a
really good question because it bears on
what I'm going to show you at the very
end of this thing it's this logistical
pyramid that you're fighting and the
question is can you cut the ties to the
surface okay and there are some things
that you can cut some she can but the
issue of communication is one that was
dealt with over the last year and we had
three solutions one of which was to deal
with magnetic induction radio and
actually put receiver stations on the
surface and then standard radio relays
back the second one was to run a multi
hop Internet in and the third one which
we ultimately ended up doing was using a
single wire low impedance comm system
that used the earth as the ground very
clever design came out of Australia it's
just a little tiny box the size of a
pack of cigarettes and with that you got
one hand on the wall for your ground and
you press the button and you've got
communications and it works like
gangbusters so we've been using that
since we ran seven kilometers of wire
over the last year and one one system
here but anyways this is this is a
typical large town when you're down
there
everybody asked me what you know what is
it yeah I think was mentioned that GPS
system before here are be tough to
satellites either what's the technology
GPS would not work underground I mean
you put a piece of paper over only only
between the open entrances so you could
go from the highest entrance to the
springs provided you had made a link
between them and it would serve as a
corrector you know an ultimate absolute
corrector to whatever survey that you
had done in between okay it all it works
if you have access to open entrances
again we surveyed polar coordinates you
have a metric fiberglass tape you have
two optical instruments handheld
reserves sub toasts made in finland
quarter degree accuracy on compass angle
and roughly the same on vertical
inclination so if you think about it on
polar coordinate system you've got all
the information you need to convert back
to Cartesian or you know standard GPS
type type coordinates so that's
basically how we do it as you'll see
here at the end here we actually have a
computer model of the entire internal
coordinates of the mountain and they're
done in Northeast and not standard you
know UTM GPS coordinates so you can
actually overlay those on a standard GIS
model and look at it right now we're in
the process of converting and getting
the digital terrain model for Oaxaca and
I don't happen to show you but you can
you can see what the surface looks like
on Google Earth give you the coordinates
anyways one of the things that people
always ask is here is you know what does
it take to get on one of these teams and
so the guy on the right over there is is
doing the normal test that we asked the
remaining at 4:30
so I where'd you go from camp camp it
takes roughly one days traveling by one
day's travel we're talking anywhere from
12 to 16 hours one-way travel time
between camps so this is camp three
you're done at the thousand twenty five
meter level and you can get an idea for
the feel of the tunnel right there we're
on the side of that on a little talk
that over there finding the finding flat
spaces is always a challenge in a deep
system because you have rivers that are
flowing the place out every year and
surveying we it is not uncommon to have
a biologist along it is not a an
intentional search that we do to have a
biologist along in the same way that we
would not necessarily have a geologist
along most of the people who do this
long enough recognize instantly if
there's something unusual and they'll
frequently collected some people just
carry a little vial of formaldehyde
because there are people who do this you
have to you have to watch that though
because you're crossing a curious
boundary in certain countries in Mexico
is one of them if you're doing
scientific research you have to have a
scientific visa which is totally
different from a standard tourist visa
which is what most explorers go on
that's an interesting connection you
make there yes people like penny Boston
and a few of these other people who are
fairly well known extremophiles
biologists and things like that
norm Pease John's beer people like that
some of the times they're finding these
things in caves frequently they're
finding them elsewhere in hot springs
and places like that there there are a
whole host of those and that's a totally
different talk I will talk a little bit
about the types of things that we're
designing apparatus to detect on your
elbow and when we do the 12:30 conquer
so again the thing is when you're when
you're going down there you're picking
up more water all the way which means
you're you're constantly reading more
rope so about this point you've run out
of your 3,000 meters of rope and you're
getting ready to to move on to doing the
final bits of exploration and as we
invariably find the deeper you get it
seems like the higher the probability is
that you're going to find a tunnel that
is completely underwater and so in
chivay you're now at a point where you
can see the waters is building up
massively in that left-hand slide still
doesn't mean that you can't get small
spots if you hit a hard layer of rock
you can easily hit a figure that's
narrow that's actually not narrow narrow
it would be something that would be
compressing you know your chest and your
back at the same time and just barely
getting through and so you know this is
the this is the typical place that you
would get up until probably 1970 75
these places used to be called terminals
some sort er normal siphons meaning
that's it okay that's the end let's get
out what will be rig the ropes and go
home
until people started taking a dive mask
along and sticking their head under wire
and saying hey you know the cake doesn't
end here it's just full of water man and
so that started a whole cascade over the
last 30 years of this skill sport
whatever you want to call it called cave
diving and it's it's developed into two
distinctly different factions if you go
for example down to cancÃºn or the
Yucatan you can actually take a sport
course and
and do a cave dive down there right now
if you have a you know you can get an
open water education then you do it a
basic cave dive and you'll see what some
of these cenotes and things like that
look like very fascinating also very
deadly if you go much further without
the robber the proper skills the other
faction which is perhaps I would say on
the order of one of them to three or
four hundred of these other types who go
and visit these Springs and things like
that doing cave diving is what we would
you would see the divers who would do
this kind of stuff and the problem is
that you have to have all these other
skills behind you to get to these
locations the other problem is that to
transport normal diving apparatus let's
say a tank of compressed air to these
places is enormous and so when you get
down there if you don't find the way on
on the first crack you've just shot all
of your equipment and all of it has to
go all the way back up right now this is
this is at a point eight kilometers from
the entrance one way three and a half
days travel time very arduous that's
after it's rigged so you're about six
weeks into the expedition right now just
to get to this point and that's with
with your one shot right so to break
that what people have done has gone to
close cycle life-support systems we're
now becoming popularly known as
rebreathers and what those things do is
close the metabolic loop and you can get
anywhere from six to twelve hours out of
a backpack that weighs the same amount
as what you had before and you can take
the recharge materials to give you
another 12 hours so suddenly the
distance underwater becomes less and
less important as long as it's not too
deep so in in 2003 we were successful in
passing this first one here it was 120
metres long about 12 meters deep which
by diving standards is not much the
second one about a kilometer away this
was all a large cascade canyon again
with all that water that you saw before
two hundred and eighty meter dive there
and on the far end of that there was a
place where the ceiling had collapsed
and you couldn't go any further so the
problem then is now what do you do right
well you could perhaps put a team out
there and
on that far side of that second
underwater tunnel and see if you can
weasel your way through what everybody
thought was you know maybe it's time to
start looking for an alternative way
into the heart of the mountain and so a
year later we had a three-month
reconnaissance expedition looking at
areas in between that entrance and the
resurgence to try to find a way on and
this is kind of a topographic map of
what's going on this is the main CHFA
entrance right here the resurgence is
right at the very top there that's over
18 kilometers straight line distance
between those two the limestone band
runs is a five kilometer wide chunk
perhaps about that wide from here to
there and the idea then is can you find
places where there are entrances
dropping in well this was one of the
areas right here that seemed most
profitable for for looking for new
entrances indeed we found a lot of stuff
while we were up there it's one of the
few remaining true cloud force in Latin
America it's up at about 2,600 meters
elevation you can see everything is
covered with green moss this is on a
typical day we run typical day where the
Sun is actually out this is more typical
chopping your way through a ten meter
high vegetation to to look for entrances
but entrances we did find over 150 in
the space of three months and many of
them quite spectacular from the entrance
looking out and things like that but
ultimately we ran across this one here
which had the name j2 now you might
wonder where do these names came from
well since we're doing the original
exploration in fact the only people to
ever have ventured into this cloud first
before or a handful of local hunters
from this tiny remote village on the
mountain down there called ello go tal
and so this was this was pretty much
cutting track where nobody had ever been
even in the jungle on that mountain and
we had various groups breaking up to go
do the surveys well the Americans went
with a lot of the Mexicans and we would
put a P for PO so which means in Spanish
and we were
- like P 25 or 30 something like that
the poles the Spanish and the
Australians went off in another group
and they use the term J which in Polish
means yes Guinea a which means cave so J
2 was cave number 2 in college and that
was where the name came from now we were
able to get down a little over 340
meters something like that during the
course of that that project and the
thing that made this very interesting
was the fact that there was a wind
blowing into this entrance that exceeded
35 miles an hour 3540 miles an hour and
and that alone was enough to drive a
team to want to come back and find out
where the heck that was going because
you don't get a wind that's 35 or 40
miles an hour in a cave unless there's
something enormous underneath it takes a
huge hydrostatic differential in terms
of compressed air to cause that kind of
airflow to form which also means that
there's consequently a big cave but but
a very deep cave as well attached to it
and so this is this is expedition life
and the cloudforest gear is all hung
under tarps because it's always dripping
and rainy everybody hangs on their tents
when they're not up and caving it is wet
it's dirty you have to deal with a lot
of really strange characters who have
attitudes and and they have strange ways
of resolving their problems but in
general I would say if I had to add up
some of the experiences that I've had
through life and and what has been the
most valuable to me it's the people that
you do these crazy things with a lot of
people I've talked to you about this
said well you know it's kind of like war
and you're out there with a platoon or
something like that you all barely
survive for some lucky reason and you go
back and you have that experience to
think about for the rest of your life
the difference is here is we meet every
year this is my family that's my
international family
and and they've all got crazy ideas
about what life is about and everything
else so it's a good cultural diversity
time for all of us so this is the
exciting thing that got everybody to
come back there you you might think that
that's not so exciting
in fact it and the first 400 meters
really isn't exciting in fact it's it's
really terrible you're you're basically
in a fissure it's one of these deals
where unlike Cheviot did not have a huge
drainage area and so therefore you were
working in very high altitude you're up
in one of these tiny little limbs that's
small and leading on downward and
ultimately there's a series of shafts
there's one that's about 140 meters long
it's not nearly as big as the ones in
chivay but it's controlled by the same
geological strata so it tends to form
shafts just like all the other things
repeating the ideas Campbell one was
established at 500 meters about eight
hours from the entrance not as far as
normally we would like but that was the
only place that we can actually put a
camp below that you're now in a clean
water
Rock you're picking up streams but soon
as you have something about that size
you know you're going somewhere you know
that you're definitely headed for a very
very long remote trip down into the end
of the core these are these are kind of
like walking through mountain streams
and things like that with a you know a
slot canyon become a roof over your head
you don't really even think about the
fact that there's a roof over your head
unless your cave diving that's that's a
more disciplined type situation where
you really are thinking about what are
your options for getting out whereas
here you've got plenty time to think
about it you get tired you can just sit
down same thing with with being on rope
it's again j2 very similar to chivay two
and a half kilometers to get to the
moment of exploration in 2005 three and
a half kilometers where we got
this year it starts off at about 10 to
12 C at the entrance and by the time
you're down 700 meters it's sitting it
around 1314 and it's not so much from
geothermal heating as from the fact that
you get frost and snow and stuff like
that at the high elevations that run
down these valleys and dump into the
entrance and you're really equilibrate
in with the mountain by the time you get
to that depth so again a typical
difficult camp down there we can we have
a wonderful relationship with the
Nalgene lab Water Company and we've had
it for almost 25 years I would say you
might wonder what do you use these
things for well the thing is you're
constantly in the rain you're swimming
you're diving you're doing it if you
want to be happy
underground you don't want to arrive
there with your food soaked your clothes
so can you sleep in back so very very
bad karma well in this particular case
you know we found out a long time ago
actually that long ago but we find a
very good synthetic sleeping bag that
would fit in a four liter bottle if you
compressed it now I'd take some some
extra effort to make it fit in there but
it's worth it because these things are
like nuclear and destructible you can
you can actually drop them down shafts
and they just bounce around at the
bottom and off they go
so so you can carry your hammocks down
there you can carry your clothes down
there in these things and basically
you're transporting
these bottles through the cave until you
get to to where you're going to go yeah
I don't see the advertising so how much
does it cost
very good question I've run in projects
like this that have run as little as 25
grand to run an expedition when I was
doing stuff in college at UT Austin - as
much as over two million it depends a
lot on the technology that's being
involved when we were first developing
close cycle life-support systems we were
building eight nine ten prototype
devices that were running 50 to 80 grand
apiece - small process manufacture we
had to design our own computers that's a
whole different talk that that I don't
have an opportunity unfortunately to get
into here but we over the course of 15
years we developed some pretty high
technology and building that stuff cost
money so I would say generally a project
like this you're looking at around 100
grand and you've got roughly 40 to 50
people who are involved typically on the
order of 20 25 industrial sponsors
corporate sponsors I could put up most
of that National Geographic has been
very very good to us we have probably
been sponsored by them I would say seven
eight times they don't always do a story
once in a while we'll do a story in the
ellow magazine the mainland frequently
they'll do stories and adventure
magazine things like that sometimes
it'll come out on the web there's a
great website that's still archived
there on the 2004 expedition Rolex
another other good sponsor there but
we've been very fortunate in the last
couple of years to have some individual
patrons who put money into the you know
much like Lance Armstrong put up the you
know built up the the u.s. cycling team
for the true de France and all that we
had people who would put into a
non-profit corporation to try to get the
team out in the field and we've been
pretty pretty lucky the last couple
years we've pretty pretty much been self
sponsored the last year's that will
change if we have another high-tech need
that pops up so somebody was asking how
we know where we are this is this is
really typical you you have somebody
who's a good artist sketcher who's
taking the notes down and basically
you're building maps of of what the
roadway looks like ahead
you have to navigate through and that's
information that you pass on to the next
crew that's coming in to change out with
you when you want to go back to the
surface you might wonder how long you
stay down I've cumulative Lee spent 397
days below 400 meters deep
typically your run would be on the order
of anywhere from 10 days to 2 weeks
maximum somewhere between 18 to 20 days
as you'll see when I want to show you
the slide at the end here we're
extrapolating to complete this project
probably on the order of 35 to 40 days
as a mission length of time at distances
over 30 kilometers from the entrance in
2005 we had a rather curious thing
happened that hadn't happened to me in
20 years because invariably we always
took cave diving equipment with us just
in the off chance that you do ran into
another more common well we had so much
wind in this cave j2 that we figured you
know why bring diving gear it's just an
extra piece of stuff you're not going to
use because there's so much wind that
means it's all open it's deep and we're
just gonna be rigging a rope this year
so we had plenty of rope until we hit
the 700 meter level and you see this guy
here on the left up to his his armpits
they're in water in that fissure which
obviously he's not going to go any
further in and we didn't have any dive
gear in base camp so we backed up and we
tried the old climbing trick go into the
roof see if you can find a place where
the old river went and try to bypass the
Sun well we tried that for two weeks and
it didn't work
and finally we drew straws in Basecamp
and four lucky volunteers drove two and
a half days back to Brownsville where a
team from Austin and we contacted on Sat
phone brought down enough dive gear for
four people and then they drove back so
within five days we had dive gear at
camp this is not your normal dive gear
these are carbon epoxy tanks they run in
6,000 psi they weigh about 8 pounds
empty about 16 pounds fuel hole so
there's half the weight of the tank is
the gas that you're putting inside there
yes in this particular case yeah these
are shallow dive so you don't need
heliox or anything else that's it again
that's a whole other subject we can talk
about it people are interested because
there in fact were higher-level fishers
but they were only a couple of
centimeters wide but because they're on
the order of 30 40 50 meters tall
you've got enough cross-section there
for it to get through however even with
that what we discovered and I'll show
you the something interesting here that
happened just after this in order to do
a dive you notice that I narrow that
Fisher was well under water we found
that in fact it was still almost narrow
it was it was about a metre less than a
meter wide maybe 3/4 of a meter wide and
you had to get through that well the
normal technique is to either have tanks
on your back or on your side but those
wouldn't fit through we couldn't get
through the thing with that so we ended
up doing this thing where you strap two
tanks together that some neutral you
push it ahead of you and then you
basically split through this tight crack
underwater while pushing that gear ahead
of you and here's that here's the phone
we were talking about the first use that
we saw with that was in 2005 where we
ran an underwater line through the
underwater tunnel to talk to the crews
who were on the other side just in case
we had a problem so this plant from Camp
2 to the crew that was on the lead team
on the other side of the Sun and what
they discovered over there was something
really curious that's something that I
haven't seen in 40 years of doing this
stuff is that where those guys are
standing right there there used to be a
gigantic pile of boulders about 15 to 20
tons worth and they were small enough
that they had backed up and gotten silt
on them and built a dam which pulled the
water up in this fissure to a point
where you had you had to dive through so
they started pulling the rocks out and
they found that indeed they were
lowering the water enough to eventually
lower it two and a half meters to where
they had air space to go through so this
guy right here on the right is actually
coming through the place where we dived
with those two tanks just the previous
day and beyond that things are you know
pretty much the same just just the kind
of thing that you'd expect in a and a
small in figure into a gigantic cave
again you know doing lots of reading
along the walls and then finally you get
to a fine point in the deep cavers world
where you still have all this gigantic
wind and you run out of rope at the end
of some big shaft going down there's
nothing but blackness below you and then
you come back and you see where the heck
you are and it's at that point that you
begin the cycle anew for the next year's
project so everybody says well you know
we're all out of time this year what we
gonna do next year so you look at these
things and you start thinking why are we
coming back here or not in this
particular case we did and again this is
the cultural diversity of the the teams
that we have up there when you're
sitting at base camp and doing nothing
but either sitting in the rain forest or
working in the muck you tend to have a
curious psychological outtake and look
for ways to amuse yourself is that this
is our tour Novak on the left from
Poland that's mark Wilson on the lower
left over there from Australia and Tony
Dwyer from Germany on the right and
again you know upper section tight
narrow dirty uncomfortable when you get
down to about the thousand meter level
and you're in the water and this year we
did something we did a couple of things
different this year because we were
trying to experiment with ways to break
this tie chain to the surface and the
first thing we did was try to reduce the
amount of clothing that you have to take
down and one way we did that was by
finding a way to introduce heat into the
sleeping environment here that's a silk
tent weighs about 1 pound fits in one of
those 4 liter Nalgene models and it
raises the temperature of 6 people
sleeping in there by about 6 degrees C 6
to 8 degrees C it's quite quite
significant such as you can really cut
down on the weight of what you're
bringing on down again typical to go
camping environment here ok so we are
not in a gulag or a concentration camp
here these are happy explorers reducing
weight we've only got one spoon between
the entire four-person crew
no balls no cups one pot and and so
that's that's you even think to the
level of where you you you either don't
take a toothbrush or you cut the
toothbrush off to save the way to the
handle when you're going down places
like this because everything has to be
carried out there's another interesting
experiment that went on probably half of
the weight that we carry this might be
amusing or or whatever is is the fact
that we we've gotten away from the
traditional way that people used to use
light underground which was calcium
carbide right up until about I would say
2001 2002 this was the standard way that
we went calcium carbide you put it a
normal container you put water on and it
generates acetylene you light the
acetylene you got this very bright flame
anybody who's used a welding torch knows
how bright acetylene is they use this it
was invented back in the early 1800s for
miners we've now completely supplanted
debt we used to use seven to eight
hundred pounds of carbide for an
expedition seven to eight hundred pounds
we now use less than 20 pounds of
lithium ion batteries and what you see
right here are lithium ion batteries
that we've developed for drills the the
way the rig is using a pneumatic impact
drills well those used to use really big
heavy batteries and taking those out to
the surface every time was probably 25
percent of the mass that you were
transporting up and down so what we did
now is by going to these batteries and
using a hydroelectric power station to
recharge them by hanging the water
we have snapped that tied to a servicer
and off we go down into big tunnel
you're now at six and a half kilometers
distance from the entrance at about
100 meters down geology is all around
this is what's called a slick inside for
those who've ever heard that term in a
geology class it means a place where the
earth has been just ripped up and down
you can probably see it out in the sand
wrists fault in other places like that
if you look very carefully but this is a
graphic example where the left side has
just dropped down below the right side
and you can see the signs of salacious
materials like clay and stuff like that
which have a nice color to them that
indicate the fact that these walls have
removed some seismic event in the past
all these photos take another flash
presumably you're seeing this whole
thing with your pencil headlamp and
that's about it
actually not a pencil my lovely we
designed our own LED lights and you like
that you know right degrees right and
that's does a good point so if I if I go
back up here I don't wanna delay the end
of this show too long you look at a
slide like this okay you don't see that
when you're walking through it okay
that's that's a multi flash thing pretty
much like from about five slides before
this until this right here all those
previous slides were taken with either
bulb or large-capacity underwater
strobes and Kodachrome 200 film using
mikonos five cameras this year everybody
has gone digital and as a result of it
the quality has gone down
okay so we've gone from probably 20
megapixel 25 megapixel resolution to
these three and a half megapixel
waterproof cameras that you can put in
your pocket so everybody likes them but
we haven't crossed that frontier of
bringing the quality back up in terms of
digital because I'd say if you gave me
the top-of-the-line Nikon 15 megapixel
digital camera right here $6,000 camera
I and 39 other people on that team could
trash it for you in less than a half a
day in an environment like this so
that's that's the problem that we're
we're still working on there the
environment can vary dramatically the
rock here can just be as fluted as Swiss
cheese you have to really watch yourself
when you're walking and stuff like this
there's a term for it it's called a kind
of list means razor rock and Latin and
it's very peculiarly present in traffic
Caves in certain areas this kind of
looks like a pleasant area but in fact
everything they step on breaks off
underneath them as they go through not
everything is big these are the kind of
things that you occasionally have to
deal with and while you're doing that of
course you're also passing five or six
duffel bags that you carry between your
team with them frequently we don't have
the sense to show those in the pictures
because they're in the way of the camera
we're down at the eleven hundred and
fifty meter level here and finally we've
arrived at camp three this is a far more
arduous trip here you're about seven and
a half kilometers now from the entrance
1,150 meters down same ideas again
though the silk tent to keep you warm
lightweight stuff
there's our happy crew this is the we
call this the deuce team that's the the
Dutch members of our team on the left
there and myself and Matt Cummington
who's from Stanford are the u.s. members
so is the Dutch US team and this is a
typical night down at Camp three again
with the single pot servings and it
looks it looks suspiciously comfortable
in this place but in fact you can have
nightmares because you wake up you got a
lot of great place and you step outside
realize where you are this is what you
look like after ten days down it gets to
be a little wearing on you after about
20 days down you don't look a whole lot
different you just have a little more
facial hair it just gets to be a place
that you go to work you know you get up
every morning and do it again you know
things that you don't see on the service
just razor like little things with
popcorn growing on them in the middle of
a big tunnel stuff like that and of
course the ubiquitous underwater tunnel
which marked the end of this year's
exploration at twelve hundred and ten
meters down that's our lead diver for
this year Jim Brown coming back this was
not a rebreather dive in order to get
off a quick recon right at the very end
of the trip we just took two carbon
tanks buzz and and as a final act of
arrogance we we tried to put a climb
directly over the top of the sump and so
the the conclusion of this story will
only
you hanging so to speak so where is all
this this going you know the white why
do all these people spend enormous
amounts of their their private effort
and money and time and risk their lives
at to do this well it's it's largely
because we're looking at something
that's gonna happen it's gonna be an
event it's gonna be like is the US or
the Russian it's gonna be the first on
the moon once it's happened that's it
it's history it's gone right now the
deepest cave in the world is sitting out
there waiting there's a couple people
who think they have it they quite likely
do have it either the Russians or the US
team probably are on to it and chivay in
the eyes of the American you know
conglomerate team is the place where
it's going to happen and it probably
will not be anywhere else in the world
and southern Mexico in our opinion we
may be surprised but this is this is the
way things have been going starting as
early as you know 1700 how deep people
have been underground currently this is
a little bit out of date the Russians in
21 40 as of January last year otherwise
the map is is pretty much the same
cheve a is down there at number nine
you'll notice however that there's not a
whole lot of difference between the top
10 in terms of vertical distance if we
were to find a 400 meter shaft at the
end of chef a for example we would
surpass all that in one afternoon
I mean if just a matter of taking a 200
meter rope down there and another 200
meter rope thrown connecting together a
rig among and down you go but you know
it's always more arduous than that this
is uh giving you an idea as of as as
late as 1980 you could count the number
of thousand meter caves just the way you
would a number of 8,000 meter Peaks so
it was it was a very serious thing since
then the technology has changed it's
become a more popular sport I want to
close with one last PowerPoint slide
here and then show you two other images
these are not all the same when you say
the deepest cave in the world at 21 40
is sitting in Chechnya right now with
the Russian team standing on top was
that as difficult as what's going on at
sistema chivay for example okay if you
look over here krubera which is is the
place that was explored by the Russians
there's a great article on national TV
graphic May of last year if anybody
wants to read about what the Russians
have been doing great guys good work but
on the scale of things you can see that
what's going on down in southern Mexico
absolutely dwarfs everything that's
going on over there the distances are
enormous what you're dealing with over
here krubera you could pretty much be at
the bottom of Cabrera in two days and
that's it and it's not going to go any
deeper because the springs are the level
approximately 30 to 40 meters below that
and it's a very difficult piece of
terrain in terms of straight up they'd
have to get through to go that deep so
what I want to show you now just in
closing okay this is this is the
vertical view now this is cueva cheve a
this is j2 out to what we did this year
there's another cave charco and there's
the resurgence so you can kind of get an
idea now we're inside the mountain and
all these things are generally trending
down in this direction ultimately
they're going to hit this area in here
and because you can see that there
they're getting close to it already and
there's a long distance here what that
means is there's going to be a lot of
diving in that section right there not a
very pleasant prospect but it's waiting
out there in the looms which means we're
going to have to invent better diving
gear fortuitously that is in the wind
right now we are working with a company
to develop the mark six rebreather it's
going to be about the size of a
briefcase give you three hours under
water at depths down to sixty meters and
that'll be out by January next year our
team will start training with it for a
2008 push on the second something and j2
down there now from a from a logistic
standpoint here's okay come back here we
go this is this is that that topo map
what we've added now is this new piece
of information here here here is the
work that's taking place over the last
three years at at j2 three months in the
field this year added this little tiny
green line okay now you start to get an
appreciation for the scale of this kind
of thing I know a couple of really good
people who have
high-altitude mountaineering working and
I always ask him you know what what's it
like like like ed Viesturs for example
we were having a conversation one time
and I said you know when you go to
Everest or k2 or something like that
what was the thing that really impresses
you most and he says you know it's when
you get the base camp and you look up
and you go holy smokes this thing is
huge enormous just bigger than anything
you could possibly imagine by looking at
a picture well that's that's kind of how
you start to feel after you go to a
place like this and you say hi now it
was a really tough expedition we're now
there for three months we beat ourselves
you know all over the place that's what
we added you know this is another thing
the difference between exploration and
adventure is one word data if you don't
you don't bring data back you haven't
done anything you know you've had it
you've had an adventurer you've had a
thriller you've had some kind of a you
know a tourist trip or whatever and some
people you really don't see that much in
the deep caving world but it's starting
to happen in the mountaineering world
with people going to Everest and in
particular and you see the results of
that with what happened for example in
1996 but any of it
all the stuff in here in between is the
giant annulment how are you gonna beat
the Russians if you can't get into that
well this is the this is the logistics
map that we're projecting down each one
of those little red circles represents a
projected underground camp one day
travel time underground based on our
knowledge of what's been going on in the
system we're expecting that there's a
major fault that takes it all down to
Mono curving northeast and then finally
Northwest but just to give you an idea
if you want to get to the resurgence
from someplace like j2 which is
currently the only open system that's
down there you're looking at 11 days
one-way travel time to get to the bottom
11 days back out that's 22 days just to
go down there and say hi right and then
you normally will spend anywhere from
seven to seven days to two weeks doing
actual exploration so we're looking at
times of 35 days roughly when we finally
pull this off and god knows when that's
going to be the 2008 expedition is
targeting right here and if we're really
lucky we may get to 70 or 7u on that
so that's where the world of very deep
exploration indoors is standing today we
could give you similar discussions over
some of the other caves in Europe but
this is the kind of technology that's
out there this is what people are doing
yeah how quickly if at all I mean does
the underground terrain change like you
say when you come back and suddenly one
of the caves is collapses that comment
or not almost not at all we used to say
that those are Hollywood theatrics to to
inject molasses into movies and things
like that
if anybody had the bad karma of going
seeing that movie the cave last year
they'd have an underwater collapse that
traps this team you know beyond it but
in fact I I know of at least two or
three cases where that has happened and
it's usually been in places where it was
a virgin exploration nobody had ever
been there before the rocks were just
precisely balanced at the wrong angles
and you it's quite it's quite common for
example to go through unexplored
territory and step on a rock the size of
a truck and have it just move like that
you know go back and forth it's really
scary the first time it happens to you
but you realize all that it's not going
anywhere it's just it's just balanced
you know but every once in a while you
know you have to you have to think about
those things and one of the things that
we do is when you have a team of 40 to
50 you come prepared for a wall what we
refer to as self-rescue so we have tools
in there for dealing with that if we do
have a collapse highly unlikely I've
never had to deal with one in 53
expeditions but we had had to deal with
a lot of other stuff including
fatalities broken bones all kinds of
stuff like that yeah
we've changed that dramatically we used
to go all freeze-dried and then we went
to the extreme of thinking the
freeze-dried running it through a solid
shooter and compressing it with a jack
into a for later now gene bottle so that
you get the absolute most dry food into
the smallest possible place what's
happened in the last two years is that
we said you know this stuff really sucks
and it would be it would be better to
have something that is dense and dry and
so we've gone to doing things like high
carbo routine so for example rice we've
gone back to whole-grain rice which is
you know I wouldn't have predicted this
20 years ago we've done that we go to
ground dried meat for anybody who's
traveling in Mexico is very popular
breakfast is called machaca right you
can get matcha kind of dry in Mexico at
Sam's Club and so this year we bought we
bought a ton truck and worth of food
from Sam's Club and sorry on a few other
places in Oaxaca City and we didn't buy
a speck of freeze-dried food and
everybody actually liked it it was
pretty good it was heavier a little bit
heavier but everybody ate well and they
had a higher crime higher proto higher
calorie diet than we've had in the past
we're burning about 8,000 calories a day
by the way if anybody's wondering it's
it's on tour with the Tour de France
just as you say do stream the ropes do
you think the depends on the rocks
you carry everything everything no no it
depends on where you're working this is
considered an active exploration project
so the things that will survive year to
year a stainless pot for example will
stay at Camp three Camp to camp one the
ropes if they can will be pulled up to a
location that is outside of the zone of
the water arrives you can tell on the
walls how father before the water is
going to rise and you pull your rope
side of the main shaft you coil them up
and you hang them staged them this is
the term that's used and frequently
we can just reuse the mirror after your
it saves on the order of two weeks of
restocking effort if you're going when
you're totally done with a place if
you're absolutely absolutely certain
that it's done
you clean it everything comes out two
weeks all the debris comes out all the
waste all they use spent trash anything
like that all comes out frequently if
the sleeping bags and things like that
that are down there is utilities we use
common sleeping bags people don't carry
personal bags so you go from camp camp
camp if they're wet or something like
that you're not going to dry them down
there you'll bring those up okay if
anybody has any other questions you can
you can hit me afterwards</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
