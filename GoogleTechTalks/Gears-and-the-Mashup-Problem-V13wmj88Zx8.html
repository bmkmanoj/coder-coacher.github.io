Yahoo speaking about gears and the
mash-up problem and just short intro
Doug and I worked together at electric
communities a company that he was a
founder of where we worked on a
graphical social virtual reality and we
were doing distributed secure scripting
of world objects which is a precursor of
the kind of master problem that the
world faces today so that's here's Doug
hi hello everybody well we're struggling
with the video let me begin by
introducing myself first I will
establish my identity by showing you my
California driver's license let's see
here's my yahoo employee identification
just so you know and you also have the
kind words that mark gave you
great but you don't just have to believe
me that it's important also to establish
yourself in terms of reputation with
other people so Brendan Eich who is the
creator of JavaScript said of me that I
am the Yoda of lambda programming and
JavaScript and by that he meant that I
am instructing all the young web
Padawans on the nature of JavaScript and
and lambda and also referring to my
skills as a with a lightsaber some of
you may also be aware that I'm the
discoverer of Jason the popular data
interchange format and on that dave
winer said jason is not even XML who did
this travesty let's find a tree and
string them up now fortunately nobody
listens to dave winer on a similar topic
James Clark who is the architect of XML
and xslt said any damn fool could
produce a better data format than XML
which it turns out is true so I hope I
have now established a trust
relationship with you
you've inspected my credentials you've
inspected my reputation you are now
prepared to believe everything that I
tell you and and you should because
everything I'm going to tell you is true
except for the joke about the
lightsabers I was at Lucasfilm for eight
years as director of technology there
and I never got any good at lightsabers
good those things turn out to be a whole
lot harder than they are in the movies
so what I'm here to talk about today is
not me but to talk about security with
respect to the web which i think is a
topic which is of critical importance to
all of us security is the number one
biggest problem in the whole world wide
web and it is a consequence of the way
that the web came together we a common
practice we see an application and
platform development which is still
going on which is ship it now and secure
it later we'll get it to market quickly
established that we did the right thing
and then later we'll try to figure out
what the right thing actually was that
turns up is really really hard and we
have a lot of examples of this but
somehow we haven't learned it yet and so
we're still seeing new platforms coming
to market almost daily which do not
concern themselves with security
thinking that they can fix it at a later
time perhaps by adding a security module
or some other mechanism and that has a
lot to do with where we are one of the
consequences of that is you tend to see
a lot of application models which have a
security model which is basically blame
the victim in which we retreat routinely
ask questions of the user which they
cannot possibly answer even if they
understood the question we don't give
them sufficient information to answer it
and all it does is allow us to say it's
their fault for making the wrong choice
this is an intolerable way to do
security systems and any security which
is based on this is a false promise but
it's commonly practiced we also see in
the web policies and mechanisms which
prevent useful things and allow
dangerous things one of the worst
examples of this is the same origin
policy
it is standing in the way of progress in
the web but is not sufficiently adequate
for protecting the things that it claims
to protect now we also see a lot of
circumvention to get around the same
origin policy which impairs security
even further big problem so that's the
state of the web the web is 3274 the
21st century at least that's what it was
it's gotten better recently now some of
the youngsters in the audience might be
wondering what does 3270 mean is that a
year or what no it's actually a piece of
gear this is a 30 to 70 this is a
terminal that was built by IBM toward
the end of the time sharing era time
sharing was a process in which a big
expensive computer would be shared by a
lot of people at the same time and IBM
wasn't very good at it they're operating
systems for some reason we're in it
we're not able to do a process which in
response to user input so they tended to
not work very well so the way they got
around that was by developing the 3270
which at the time was called an
intelligent terminal and the way it
worked was the mainframe would pump a
page full of stuff to it with some holes
in it the user would fill in the holes
and push the tab key to go to the next
hole and when the whole page was filled
in they would send it back they push the
submit button and go back to the
mainframe so when the web happened there
were a lot of dinosaurs out there who
looked at that and said oh yeah 3270
remember how to do that so we saw a lot
of web application architecture which
was lifted directly from the 3270 model
the problem with that was the same
problem with the 3270 itself was it was
a step backwards in terms of
interactivity you just can't interact in
a in a flexible way when you're limited
to page transitions and so getting away
from that was recognized as a major
opportunity for the web the first
approach at restoring that interactivity
was Java when Java was introduced and
when they teamed up with netscape there
was huge excitement that Java was going
to fix the web
allow the web to be the application
platform that would allow us to be
liberated from microsoft it turned out
unfortunately though that Java was a
huge failure as an applet technology
which was the thing that was introduced
as it was very popular it had huge
acceptance if you went into any
bookstore in the valley at that time and
you know go to printer's ink or computer
lib or stacy's and go to the computer
section fully half the computer books
there were about Java and it was there
is enormous interest but the write once
run everywhere promise was not kept and
so for people who are trying to develop
applications in Java it was more like
write once run away screaming it it was
really really hard they had an
unworkable blaming the victim security
model and they had a really tedious you
I model very very difficult to use now
they failed on on the applet level but
they were turned out very successful as
a server technology basically because
with servers you don't have to run
everywhere you just have to run in the
server and Java was pretty good at that
the security model didn't matter because
it server isn't expected to run
untrusted code and you don't do a lot of
you I'm modeling are you I programming
in servers so did really well there but
it left a vacuum on the browser side now
the thing that Java taught us and we
knew this going in was at running
everywhere securely and interactively is
really really hard but it turns out
javascript is doing it and is doing it
pretty damn well so let's look at where
javascript came from javascript was
developed at Netscape by people who I
guess figured that Java
was the wrong idea and I think they saw
that correctly JavaScript gave a
programming model similar to hypercard
to the browser that was a very
interesting step forward first seen in
netscape navigator to microsoft took
that idea and pushed it in a really
interesting way first off they made
their clone of JavaScript and they
called it jscript not because they
considered it to be a different thing
but because sun claimed the ownership of
the javascript trademark and microsoft
and son were not getting along well in
those days so microsoft call it jscript
it was an extremely high fidelity clone
of Netscape's javascript engine they did
such a good job that virtually all of
the bugs and design errors that were
incorporated into the original
JavaScript were faithfully copied into
jscript
in fact when Netscape then went to Ahmed
to have the things standardized in an
attempt to prevent Microsoft from
running away with it akma which was the
computer European Community European
computer manufacturers association
called the specification ECMO script
instead of JavaScript because they
didn't want to deal with a son either
and they put into the standard virtually
all of the bugs that Microsoft had
discovered in the original
implementation of jscript and they
remain in the language today but despite
that it worked really well and the
closeness of those implementations were
amazing so that jscript and javascript
are more alike as implementations than
any pair of implementations of any other
language and that's why the run
everywhere thing is working in the web
microsoft also created a generalized
document model where all elements are
scriptable this was a huge advance
forward very clever idea they added the
xmlhttprequest and in doing that in IE 4
and it got corrected in IE five and 55
we had everything needed to do Ajax all
of the Ajax technologies were in place
then then suddenly five years later
Jesse James Garrett a consultant at
adaptive path discovered Ajax it
occurred to him that the interactivity
that we had wanted back in the Java era
that we didn't get and never got was
possible using aspects of the browsers
which were present and he called it Ajax
standing for asynchronous JavaScript and
XML the adoption of Ajax has been huge
Ajax no longer seems to mean anything
Ajax is now just the way you do web
applications it's gone completely
mainstream
so Ajax is great it gives us
applications without installation and
that's important because installing the
applications is annoying and it's
dangerous and it asks users questions
that they cannot successfully answer so
Ajax allows us to avoid that we have the
promise of highly interactive
applications at least when they're
designed correctly we have the leverage
of the social components of the web
which are huge and important the
applications can be easy to use again
assuming that they're designed correctly
we have greater network efficiency than
we had with the old style of 30 to 70
applications because we don't have to do
page replacements in response to every
user interaction but it is too damn hard
to write these applications and we're
limited in how much we can push this
platform going forward it's a great
thing to come out of Ajax is mashups
mashups are by far the most interesting
innovation in software development in 20
years mashups are really important at my
company I believe they're really
important to Google as well being able
to take bits of programs and rub them
together and make new things all
happening within the browser is
wonderful and powerful but there's a
problem mashups are insecure mashups
must not have access to any confidential
information or any privileged
connections to any servers this is an
inherent problem in the browser which
trips up mashups pretty significantly
and until this is fixed mashups are
constrained to only trivial applications
the really important powerful
applications are not possible until we
fix the insecurity of mashups and this
is really critical because advertising
is a mash-up any ad which injects script
into a page is mashing it up and is able
to compromise the user's identity and
connections to his servers and anything
else that is matched up in that page
this is a huge problem and we need to
fix it because it turns out that's
important so what are the causes of the
problem well one of them is JavaScript
by design JavaScript dumps all programs
into a common global space there's
nothing to protect the secrets of one
component from another in any
information which is available to any
component is available to every
component that's just the nature of
JavaScript and it's because they did not
anticipate that there would be multiple
interests within a single page so a
consequence of that design decision in
JavaScript was that we suffer now from
XSS attacks even in conventional web
applications where quoting errors or
careless scripting insertion can lead to
compromise this is a big security
problem and there is no solution to it
given the current state of the art the
other source of the problem is the
document object model this is the API
that the browser presents to javascript
in the Dom all HTML elements are
connected in a single tree so that every
element is linked to its siblings and
parent any element gets access to every
element so all of the information on the
page is at risk
the nature of the web is sort of inverse
to the way you think about security and
other systems which is one of the things
which i think is made it historically
difficult to think about in most systems
the right to write is harder to obtain
than the right to read but in the web a
script can write to any domain or load
and execute scripts from any domain but
it is severely constrained in what's
domains it can read from this is odd and
unusual but it is the nature of the web
and I don't see that we can change that
either so if there is a script from two
or more sources the application is not
secure period it's just the way the web
works which is really a shame because
mashups require that we have scripts
from multiple sources and there's huge
value that can be obtained if we can
figure out how to do that web time some
of the oldsters might remember used to
mean really fast back when Netscape was
driving things they were operating in
the web time which meant that they could
ship a whole new set of bugs every week
it was just amazing rates of change but
web time doesn't mean fast anymore web
time now means really slow in evidence
of this is that epic atma script was
last revised in 1999 an HTML was last
revised in 1999 the process by which we
are pushing this technology forward has
gotten to be painfully slow so I'm not
looking for any hope in fixing HTML or
xmas script I think we need to figure
out some other way to go forward
so looking at what has driven innovation
historically the web started as a
proposal as an idea as a prototype and
when you're at that level change is
really easy if you change your mind
about how something works it just
happens it went pretty quickly to
standardization and from standardisation
other people started making browsers and
those browser makers at Netscape and
Microsoft and earlier in the mosaic
group broke all the rules they decided
that the HTML spec and the related specs
were inadequate and and some significant
ways and they just went and changed it
they it would implement anything they
wanted and for many years they were able
to get away with that that made things
difficult for developers because
everything was in flux and the standards
were not well understood and constantly
changing and the set of bugs you had to
deal with we're constantly changing
eventually that got flushed out but it
it had the result of pushing the web
technology forward very quickly we can't
do that today it would be just way too
painful way to destabilizing the thing
that's pushing the web for today are the
application developers not taking the
browser technology in its current state
the application developers have been
pushing it in ways not expected not
anticipated doing really powerful useful
things in some cases of finding ways of
of turning bugs into features it's
dangerous it's in way reckless but it's
producing a lot of value but it's also
starting to expose us to risk because
it's causing us to adopt practices which
are obviously dangerous
so what we're working with today is
repurposed browser technology trying to
make the best use out of what we've got
since we haven't seen any progress
really since 1999 this is good because
it allows us to profoundly extend the
platform but it's bad because it takes
pressure off of necessary improvements
and it promotes very bad practices one
of the very bad practices for example is
the script tag hack this is a common
thing in a lot of Ajax platforms in
virtually all of the mash ups for a
circumventing the same origin policy for
accessing data it's extremely unsafe I'm
recommending instead a capability called
Jason request which is a much better
alternative for getting that stuff on
other servers it's available now as an
extension Firefox we'd like it to see it
become standard equipment in Firefox and
in IE and everybody else if you'd like
to see more about it recommend you go to
Jason org Colin are you here today
no all right so what what if we kind of
step back from the mess and look at well
what would it have been had we gotten it
right from the beginning what sort of
pieces would we have and I think the
place to start is with safe containers
in which to execute programs that would
allow us to have be the first step
toward achieving cooperation under
mutual suspicion which is what mashups
require so we start with what I'm going
to call it that and if that is just a a
computation container you can put a
program in the doubt and it can run
there and compute all at once but it has
no capability of doing input or output
it's just ducking the VAT that by itself
is not very interesting gets a little
bit more interesting if I have two bats
now I can have two separate programs
each running in its own container unable
to interfere with each other and the
fact that they cannot interfere that
there is this boundary between them
which prevents them from contaminating
each other or stealing from each other
is really good but it is not enough to
allow cooperation so I need some kind of
channel which connects them a very
specific channel which allows them to
exchange messages of a specific type by
which they can communicate but which do
not lead to compromise this is the basic
model that we need in order to do
mashups this is the fundamental
primitive once you have these
connections then you could consider
having more vats with more connections
and then you then the problem becomes
figuring out who gets to talk to who and
that turns out to be a really
interesting problem but it's a lot nicer
to think about them the problems we have
to think about today
on another problem that we have with the
browser right now is that it was
designed strictly for online use and as
long as everybody is online that's fine
but we're finding that we have
applications now that have greater
requirements for reliability we're also
finding greater requirements for
mobility and as we go more and more
mobile connectivity is often harder to
achieve in mobile and so being able to
work reliably offline is really really
important when the most important
breakthroughs I've seen in this area is
Google gears Google gears is doing some
really good stuff in providing us with
mechanisms which allow applications to
develop offline solutions I like Google
gears a lot my favorite feature of
google gears is the worker pool the
worker pool looks a little bit like this
you've got a VAT one of which represents
a web page and another represents a
separate process in which you can run
JavaScript and you've got a channel
which allows the two to talk to each
other now some of you may recognize that
this looks just like the other picture
that I showed representing the mechanism
that you need the foundation for secure
systems I think worker pool has it I
think that there could be modifications
and extensions to the worker pool idea
which get us to safe mashups I think
it's too late to fix JavaScript there is
work going on that the ACMA atma script
has a committee which is trying to
extend the language I think some of the
extensions that we're looking at go way
too far will destabilize the language or
going to make it extremely complicated I
think may actually make it more
difficult to do programming in the
language did not provide us any new
capability there's nothing that we can't
do in the current language that we could
do in the proposed language and because
it's so much more complex thinking about
its security properties is going to get
even harder
but I think that's okay while JavaScript
certainly needs fixing I don't think we
need to depend on fixing JavaScript
security problems or enable in order to
go forward we just need to put
javascript in of that and worker pools
showed us how to do that so what I'm
here to do today is to propose a
generalization of the worker pool idea
so that worker pools are used not just
to isolate processes in order to support
offline operation but become the
fundamental primitive by which we build
mashups so in order to do that we need
to establish discovery introduction and
communication services that go not just
between pages of worker pools but pages
and frames page widgets desktop widgets
web services and everything so that this
becomes the fundamental way in which
everything gets mashed up flash
Silverlight everything gets mashed up in
this way perhaps even desktop
applications join the mashup
so some of the major components that we
need some of these already existing
gears we just need to tease them out and
and change their mission I need an
asynchronous message router so that
every module gets a persistent
unguessable name and that becomes its
address for message passing specific
objects in modules can also be given
unguessable names so that we can have
finer granularity in the way that we
create modules and that messages can be
represented as json text what there
might be optimizations which avoid that
step but conceptually everything is
chasing text so what gets sent between
the modules is safe that you don't have
leakage of capability we would also need
a module manager which every module
initially has a connection to which
provides discovery identification
services so for example modules from
representing the same site don't have to
introduce each other going back to their
common servers but instead can figure
out a way to find each other locally
that could give us some better
performance value and I think the module
manager should also provide for some
anti-phishing services so that the user
has a better chance of correctly
answering some of the questions are
going to be asked I think having these
mechanisms are the sorts of questions we
ask the user become important ones and
answerable like do you want to give this
much money to to that site that becomes
a much more interesting question then do
you want to allow that site to do
something that you don't know what we're
telling you what it's going to do but
it's going to do it what you want
having a mechanism like that we can mash
up everything everything becomes a
mashup I think the the power of that is
going to be huge and it will radically
change the way we think about
application development operating
systems were supposed to provide of
these services but never got it right
but I think by elevating this stuff to
the web we get the modularity boundaries
right and we get the functional
boundaries right and we get to mash up
everything securely and that's really
important because there's a lot of money
at risk so I'm imagining where we could
have lots of components on a page or a
screen or anywhere it doesn't even
matter anymore which are all capable of
having persistent connections to each
other which can survive disconnection
from the network perhaps can even
survive power cycling just a whole new
way of thinking about how we build
applications up from components so
here's what I'm proposing specific
proposal that we reconsider the design
of Google gears to address the mash-up
problem as well as the offline problem
which i think is it is already a long
way towards solving that we develop
mechanisms and policies that allow for
the registration exchange of rights to
use channels then the hard part is
figure out how to get it deployed in all
of the new browsers and provide upgrades
for the elderly browsers
so the next step I'm proposing is the
mash-up solution design summit in which
we collect people from the most
interested parties including Google
Yahoo Microsoft IBM HP adobe Facebook
and whoever else has a a powerful
interest in this problem so that's why
I'm here and we have some time for some
questions so are there any questions
there's a microphone I see right there
he asked the question
anybody remote
so how do you avoid ending up with the
blame the user security situation again
here I'm sorry how do I avoid what you
were saying that one of the one of the
problems with with Java was that they
had sort of this blame the user thing
going on and what about this will not
you know end s up in the same situation
um it's by having finer control over the
capabilities that we're providing so
that generally we're not asking the user
to manage powerful relationships most of
the relationships are going to be less
powerful less likely to cause harm so
the consequences of getting it wrong are
insignificant everything is adequately
contained
you understand
mark Stiegler everybody good mahan i
think i'm one of the originator zuv the
blame the blame the victim phraseology
but in any event the way in which we
computers blame the victim today is they
ask you these ridiculous questions like
do you want to get your work done or
bought by giving all of your authority
to this thing from somebody you don't
know or do you want to not get your work
done neither of those choices is
acceptable the only way you can get to
the point where you can ask the user
sensible questions is by having the
rights that are going to be granted be
things that make intuitive sense to the
human being so for example in the you
know if you've got paypal and you've got
a a purchasing and walmart on the same
page at the same time it makes sense to
ask the user the question he will
understand the question do you want to
transfer five dollars from paypal to
walmart to purchase this this this thing
of toothpaste but it's not going to make
sense to the user to say do you want to
give authority over your entire paypal
account to walmart okay that's a bad
question we shouldn't be asking that
question so that's
marks Kegler of HP everybody any other
questions
so regarding Jason requests we discussed
earlier about introducing the cross-site
request for xhr which has been proposed
by the by the web api group has been
implemented in for firefox 3 do you
still want to push JSON request yeah um
there are a couple of arguments against
Jason request one of them is that it's
not XML and I'm no longer very
sympathetic to that argument we don't
need to support every mode of data
transport or in order to solve a math
problem we just need one so so the
proposal which is implementing Firefox
is data agnostic so you can do JSON you
can do text you can do it XML right
which whatever you want yeah which I
don't see any value in that the thing
that I specifically don't like about
that model is that it confuses the trust
boundaries on it i'll show you the
diagram where we've got the the two
containers with the connection between
them the only place we see that in the
web is in the network itself where we
have the server and we have the browser
and the thing between them so that's a
great thing you've got this natural
trust boundary which is a network itself
in between them and so I like the
security model in which the server is
responsible for what information it
wants to give to the browser I that's
the only way I think makes sense to
think about anything else i think is
ultimately going to break the thing
about the xhr model is that the trust
boundary gets confused because the
server is now trusting the browser to
enforce its security policies and
historically browsers have not been good
defenders of security so i think it is
Miss placing where the secure design
should go I know that there are lazy web
developers and I don't mean that as
pejorative because all web developers
are lazy
and I mean that in the nicest way in
fact it's the hard working one side i'm
suspicious out because they'll work
really hard at making things which are
huge and unnecessarily big that don't
want to put the proper discipline in the
server and I don't want to encourage
that kind of behavior so for those
reasons I'm very much more in favor of
the Jason request I think it has a
simpler programming model and I think it
has a better security model
can you say something about how the
Google gears and whatever else is
involved in the solution you're
proposing does something to enforce
separation between programs that run and
their access to different pieces of the
Dom mmhmm yeah I should describe the way
that the worker pool works the
motivating application was you've got a
web application that needs to
synchronize itself with information that
it got from a server or it needs to
persist itself to a server it has some
process which could take a long time to
do running that in the browser thread is
not indicated because the browser UI is
locked up for the life of that procedure
and that's really bad there have been
people arguing that we should have
threads in JavaScript if you have
multiple threads then you could deal
with that but that turns out to be an
extremely bad idea you don't ever want
to have multiple threads at the
application level that's madness because
because it's impossible to think about
threads so they're Prentice Lee reliable
so the thing that gears did which is a
brilliant said Doug worker pools are
event loops like any I guess they are so
a worker pool is a that with a
JavaScript interpreter in it it's thread
isolated and memory isolated from the
browser page so it's a completely
independent VAT but it's able to do
messaging so it's the fundamental
primitive it doesn't have any UI so
that's one of the things we think about
is how do we provide you I to bats but
everything else is there it's brilliant
and so how do some scripts in the worker
pool have constrained access to
different pieces of the page they have
no access to the page they said that
they make requests that somebody else
mediates who mediates them currently the
page so you can send requests to the
script in the page and it may or may not
do whatever you ask which is the right
thing to have happen so what I'm
proposing is we generalize that model
not just for worker pools but for all of
the modules that would participate in a
mashup
anybody else
okay I think we're done here
this isn't really a question just an
observation the it occurs to me that the
module manager that you define in the
architecture operates a great deal like
the power box in most of the object
capability work that we have done it is
again the thing that holds all of the
rights to with that that exists within
the entire browser and its job is to
mediate to the granting of those rights
which is exactly a power box pattern I
agree with that
one small remark here so Google whether
we like it or not you know we're an
advertising company we appeal to
everybody and we try and somehow make
our work appeal to people who are not
necessarily willing to install anything
new Oh be that a new browser or a
browser extension or whatnot so one of
the problems I think that we run into
constantly and will continue run into is
sort of the inconvenience of having to
support the high road in the low road
all the time and if this is going to be
some foundational fabric for how mashups
work then we either need to support it
in both the high road in the low road or
or somehow we need to come up with a way
for making that more ubiquitous which
right now we've thus far failed at
precisely because if we try and push too
hard our users will stop using what we
give them have you have you any sort of
you know observations yeah that is the
hardest problem in the web right now is
that how do we go forward the standards
process has failed the browser
development process has failed we're
stuck with the 1999 technology and our
options are either we have to figure out
some how to fix it and go forward or the
web just becomes uninteresting and we go
back to proprietary systems which I
think would be a tragic step forward
although urbis the tragic step forward
like I said is exactly what it would be
so the problem I've been struggling with
was how do we go forward and my best
hunch is that a partnership between the
most important sites on the web such as
your company such as my company could be
the thing that that gives us the force
the power to get these problems
corrected you've already made some
momentum with gears I don't know if you
have a plan for how gears goes
mainstream I'd be curious to find that
out whether you have a plan or not I
think that is the most likely train that
we should be jumping on to go forward
together with
was there a particular mashup or
something you had in mind that kind of
made this idea come together or did you
just read the code Reed we know what you
could find and go from there I've been
doing mash up since before you were born
I have some history with some of the
people have been talking here we had a
company called electric communities some
years ago which was doing mashups which
had dimensions which go way beyond the
stuff that we're talking about today but
we recognized back then back in the the
early mid 90s that the stuff was
necessary and we were perplexed when the
web became dominant without having
anticipated any of those problems so now
in retrospect were discovering that
we're right for whatever that's worth
but we also have knowledge and
experience which allows us to look at
the components that we have available to
us today and see how to push them
together in a way which increases their
value
when they're understanding the question
of is there a particular current example
of a mash-up which is a particularly
good concrete example yeah question was
are there any specific concrete examples
and and I'll answer that sort of
obliquely I'm all the time seeing
examples of mashups that people want to
make where I tell them pull them apart
we can't do that yet so the examples are
showing up all the time and I don't want
to be saying them right now because I
don't want anyone to go oh that's a good
idea i'm going to go down and do that
because we're not ready for that yet but
there's certainly a lot of people who
are getting excited about the
possibility is in the mash-up space who
are doing things which currently are
extremely unsafe
one example comes to mind of at the
moment if you go to Facebook they ask
for your gmail password to get all your
contacts out and we don't want to give
all of your ability to send receive read
email to to Facebook you just want to
say these are the people in my account
that i would like to invite to facebook
that kind of restricting of the of the
authority is is the driving force behind
these capabilities thing that's a really
good example one of the nice things
about capability systems is that they
allow you to step down the power of the
capabilities that you're dealing with so
you're not getting away the whole farm
you're only given away the specific
capabilities that you want to be giving
away at that point yes do you think
there is a safeway holder channel data
type can be extended so lambdas can be
sent to I'm sorry is a safe way to do
what to extend a channel data type
between wets so long task and functions
can be sent you can always send
functions as source and JavaScript will
always have the ability to execute them
in fact I think that's how gears are
working now that you can you could send
a payload to a worker and have an
executor for you
are we all done okay thank you everybody</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
