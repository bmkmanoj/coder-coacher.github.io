Matt Landis and we're co-sponsoring this
tech talk by kuwan I first learned of
going when i worked at beatnik which was
a tiny company up in San Mateo that did
MIDI synthesizers for cell phones and
when we were in our final decline in the
late 2000s we watched in amazement as
the iphone was taking over the old
market that was formerly held by symbian
and Windows Mobile which was kind of our
bread and butter and one of the things
that were really amazed by was the whole
app phenomenon and one of the companies
that was really part of that whole
initial app phenomenon was mule which is
a audio of music and gain company which
was co-founded by duong I did apply
there and I didn't get in so that's why
I'm here so I'm before before
co-founding smule developed a very
unusual programming language called
Chuck which I'm hoping he'll demonstrate
today and it has some bizarre operators
a couple that I really come to mind were
one was called up check another one is
called spork and in addition to being
the CTO at real continues his research
at Stanford at karma and ccr ma where
he's an assistant professor and in
addition of that he's a musician of
course and you can find on youtube of
performance of his and one of his
ensembles playing stairway to heaven on
ocarina and it's it's both beautiful and
crazy so with that I'd like to introduce
go on
thank you very much and thank you all
for having me um it's really a pleasure
and honor to be here I think I'll just
jump right in with this slide and
actually this is karma and this is where
I work as an assistant professor at
Stanford this is the center of a
computer research in music and acoustics
ccrm a pronounced karma and it's
actually this wonderful intersection of
a lot of different disciplines around
music computing technology and design
combining everything from signal
processing to music cognition psychology
to computer science and of course music
and really finding sometimes very
serendipitous and sometimes intention
kind of intersections between all of
those disciplines but jumping backwards
in time a little bit we actually can ask
a question why computers for music and
there I think a lot of reasons for that
among which is the precision of
computers to actually you know once you
have an algorithm to generate particular
sound you'll always have that sound and
then you can de mal e ibly change
control and use that sound creatively
musically compositionally the other of
course is the possibility for
fantastical automation the computers and
programming affords us in fact this IBM
360 here is it's actually one of the
machines I was used for among many other
things actually sound synthesis of
course back in those days it it was a
the process of actually generating sound
computer was a very painstaking one you
actually had to actually know whatever
the way to interface computer was punch
cards whatnot you had actually painting
Lee craft those by the way this is
before my programming time so I'm kind
of just speculating as to what that
process was like after hearing it from a
lot of my colleagues and if you're
fortunate I've actually have resources
for to compute you would then basically
in queue your job to be processed in
you know as a batch and maybe a week to
three weeks later you might get back
analog tape that has been you know you
know da converted from the digital
synthesis to the sound and when you hear
that you'd be like that's not quite what
I wanted and then got to start the
process over again so if you think about
kind of the feedback cycle there it's
days to weeks potentially fast
forwarding in time and this is actually
language at Glenn mentioned it's the
Chuck programming language this is
actually one of many different synthesis
languages we have available for today's
computers something that I work tomm
along with a lot of other wonderful
folks at Princeton when I was a graduate
student there and rather than telling
you about I'm just going to show you
using this thing called the mini article
this is an ide for Chuck and is written
by Spencer Salazar who was a fellow
student at Princeton he's now a actually
graduate student at Stanford and
actually show you a blank buffer first
so Chuck the name Chuck comes from the
verb to throw perhaps carelessly to
chuck something out there so what I'm
going to do here is actually instantiate
a sign ask or a sign oscillator i'm
going to call it foo that's our instance
i'm going to use this particular
operator that's the chuck operator i'm
going to chuck it to the deck which is
an abstraction for the sound output on
this computer so essentially I've
connect to the output foo into the input
of Jack and this is kind of like a very
textual way of like patching different
audio synthesis modules and this is
actually a complete Chuck program if I
were to run this Chuck is happy we don't
really know that except we saw the plus
sign that means Chuck is like I
understand more or less kind of what you
want me to well understand least this is
syntactically a correct Chuck program
and but it doesn't really make a sound
so to make a sound we actually have
deals something that's very specific to
chuck and that's this like requirement
for you to actually deal with time
so what can then say here's two seconds
a duration chuck to the Chucky and now
which is a special keyword in Chuck that
represents the current time far to do
this and hope this isn't too loud it
plays that sign tone for that duration
and so basically the idea here is that
Chuck is what we call convey strongly
timed language which you actually have
to really deal with time in order to
make sound if you think about it kind of
makes sense since time and sound is such
inextricably intertwined sound is a
time-based medium so what we can do here
then is can write a slightly more
complicated program going to change the
frequency of food to 220 herds actually
think that's what is defaulting to i'm
going to copy and paste this over three
times in this straight line program
change that it change that to one second
so you can imagine what this would sound
like right so now we generated those
tones and sequence now let's add a
little bit of control to this in fact
it's going to loop actually don't have
to content and Chuck but I just just for
clarity I'll do that and if you do this
see I'll make Ashley make this a little
smaller ah the shortcut for that is not
working so i'll just make the window
bigger you can all kind of guess as to
what this would sound like i hope you
believe me when I say this will keep on
going I can't really prove that
so okay so let's do something else with
this instead of hard-coding these values
I'm going to generate a random number
between 30 and 1,000 and this isn't
hurts and i'm going to set that to the
frequency every i don't know let's do
100 milliseconds all right so now all
we've done is generate kind of the
canonical computer music this is you
know the music that computer is supposed
to make when they compute I suppose but
let's keep going so what if we change
the frequency randomly not every 100
millisecond put every 10 milliseconds
what does that sound like it's like I
always think that is computers version
go a little bit and then let's keep
going what if we change every thousand
times a second we randomize the
frequency on this sine wave what does
that sound like it sounds much more like
texture and I think part of the reason
there is we actually crosses perceptual
threshold where we stop receiving these
frequency changes individual events
rather now we hear more of a continuum
more of a kind of a stationary texture
let's keep going even more what if we're
every digital sample change the
frequency of this randomly within this
range what does that sound like is
anyone anyone know I've been care to
guess if you're thinking noise you're
partly right there's actually another
component here so let's go and play this
okay there's definitely a noisy
component we also heard that whistling
sound it turns out the whistling sound
is the frequency that's really at the
average of the bounds of this uniform
distribution that's just something that
happens we actually are actually
manipulating sound at this point and I
think the takeaway here is chuck is a
language that allows you to really zoom
in into time and control audio synthesis
at a very fine grain level if I then can
also zoom out so that was once amp which
is duration of a digital sample
we can go to sell milliseconds with all
seconds you know you can control things
at the granularity of minutes hours days
and even week yes question oh so um the
question was what's the sample rate the
Sam right here can be can be set to
whatever you want right now this is
running a CD audio rate which is 44.1 k
but you can change this to whatever
sample rate you like and then the
duration of the sample is dependent on
of course your sample rate whereas
things like minute week these are
actually you know more according to real
time this probably this particular
program probably wouldn't be extremely
exciting but it is something that you
can do when you do mout in time with
Chuck we kind of stopped with week his
month seems kind of challenging because
you know not all months are the same
duration exactly someone did suggest
fortnight as a as another thing you can
put in here the two weeks but we've so
far which is done week but of course you
can construct your own iterations in
chuck by simply just saying you know for
week chuck is my notion of a month and
then you can then turn around use a
month has another to rate union
iteration and while this is a fairly
simplistic way to think about kind of
duration it is useful one and that
allows programmers composers sound
artists to kind of define their own you
know frame of time and duration so
that's part of chuck the other part of
chuck is you know i guess the first part
of check if it's kind of about this
control over time the next one is some
notion of concurrency and we'll try to
demonstrate here with three independent
programs here is MoDOT ck by the way ck
is the extension to chuck files all this
is is just an impulse generator going
through a filter and we're sweeping that
filter and it sounds something like this
okay so that's Moe Larry sounds like
this it's exactly the same almost except
we're actually emitting these impulses
at slightly a faster rate the other ones
ones every 100 milliseconds is once
every ninety nine milliseconds then
curly just sounds a little bit different
he's going in 101 milliseconds and also
the range which we sweep the filter is
different so with these together if
we're to run them here Chuck Moe Larry
and curly at the same time but I'm now
using the command line version of
chopped and kind of hear them now
phasing in and out of each other and
that's the other part of chuck is that
allows you to kind of create independent
control flows and then just kind of
throw them together and because each of
the control flows is already dealing
with time there's a module in Chuck that
actually can very precisely schedule all
of them in fact in Chuck Chuck parlance
the each control is like Hayes is called
a shred it's kind of like a thread but
it's non-pregnant evanda cailli
controlled via time and then the shreds
are shred our stretch 'old by the chuck
shred jeweler and the shredded filler
basically these jobs that can take all
this information about time and put them
together in a sample synchronous way so
which end up with is a very precise way
to talk about time and thereby you know
to be able to talk about sound so one
last thing I'll show you about chuck is
kind of a way of working with chuck and
that's kind of this idea of like well
computers are so fast and by the way
Chuck I would think is probably like the
least efficient sound synthesis
environment ever created and i can i
think i know i can almost proved that
I know in my heart that it is and it's
actually doing a lot of things that are
inefficient but part of that is because
to try to grant a certain level of
flexibility and control through code
Chuck gives us complete sample
synchronous control over the South
synthesis parameters over time and so
basically you can change you know
anything whenever you want in whatever
rate and the rate is completely dynamic
another thing it affords is this way of
working which is you know in contrast
with like you know mainframe computers
and synthesizing sounds there chuck is
meant to be very immediate so chuck is
something that at least by design was
trying to get people to experiment more
kind of in the moment so we did this
thing called on-the-fly programming and
I'll try to demonstrate with this simple
program here and all this is if you take
a quick look here it's just instantiate
the same old sign oscillator connect to
the deck we have an array with basically
pitch offset so we're going to use right
now there's one element in it when Ranma
draw from this array offset it into some
register and then convert that into a
frequency and you saw every 200
milliseconds so if you were to play this
right now it just generates the same
tone because there's only thing we have
in our rate we're going to is add a
little major second here I'm going to
hit replace shred
so when you see that equal sign is
actually like violently taking this
piece of code out of the virtual machine
and then shoving in another version to
replace it so if we're then to make this
a little different in terms of the
registers that can be offset into you
start getting these pitch classes but at
different registers resulting these
essentially eight different pitches
let's keep adding to that sign a major
third Rico perfect fifth let's make this
a little faster major sixth if you want
to get add a little reverb in here
perfect major seventh make a little
faster drop this to mine to minor and
then so it's idea here is that you can
really experiment kind of endless in the
zone and you just want to just get
immediate feedback and I think sometimes
by granting this type of very immediate
feedback fundamentally can change the
way we think about and you know work on
audio programs so um well that in a
nutshell is kind of the chuckling which
is a lot too and there's a lot of I kind
of call them potholes in the language
this is still a developing language so
there's like no less than like two
thousand disaster areas which will you
know crash or thrash I don't know but it
is being used by a very active community
and it is cross-platform so tours it
will I like to think of it as dual it's
just as likely to crash as well and
pretty much any platform and it's
actually something that's using a few
other things that I would like to talk
about so that's Chuck so one of the
things chuck was used in um and this is
one of the projects out very fortunate
to be part of when I was at Princeton is
the laptop Orchestra this is the
Princeton laptop Orchestra this is
started by my advisor Perry cook and
music professor Princeton Dan Sherman
and in KD it was that with a laptop
Orchestra you pair people with laptops
and also with if you can see there's
kind of this hemispherical like r2d2
dome-like thing that's sitting next to
all the players and that's a
hemispherical speaker array an idea here
is that with each instrument can we
actually make the sound more intimate
and have its own kind of a local
presence like more traditional acoustic
instruments if I were to place a and
violin up here the sound doesn't
naturally go through a mixer and come
out of PA system it comes from the
artifact and the idea here is that can
we actually make computers think of
computers as instruments but also make
him sound more like a traditional
intimate you know chamber music
instruments so I'm Dan actually coined
the phrase electronic chamber music is
something that the laptop Boris is meant
to play along with all lists in all the
intimacy the sonic intimacy that's
associated with chamber music and this
is actually a closer look at the speaker
arrays and this is from the Stanford
laptop Orchestra so the Princeton one's
called pork and after i started at
Stanford I felt we really needed a west
coast version of the laptop Orchestra
and so slark was then born and and I can
give you a quick idea of how these
speaker arrays and in slower was created
so what we did was actually take ikea
salad bowls one of what you see is
pictured here an 11 inch ikea blanda mat
for those of you that are interested in
perhaps building your own the first step
is to turn it upside down it's a very
crucial step then you drill holes in
them six holes per salable and then
we've made base plates route of them we
did a lot of different things to make
them look nice and then we took these
4-inch car speaker drivers actually six
of them per salable and also we stack
basically the stereo t
amps so basically yes you have six
channels independently addressable sound
we basically made everything in like
multiples of 20 and fortunately we had a
wonderful group of students actually you
know design and this together in 2007
2008 and then we you know added laptops
we added multi-channel audio interfaces
we sit on meditation mats and pillows
this is kind of a we don't only do
tables or chairs right now because it
seems like there's so many wires hang
from behind the tables and this seems
like a much more clean aesthetic here's
an Ikea breakfast tray this is where we
put the laptop on a lot of things of the
one orchestra comes from Ikea and and
then we daisy-chained some power
together and then we have like a
wireless networking hub or switch we
conditioned the powers we have various
audio interfaces as well as gaming
interfaces we use as music controllers
and put that together you get kind of
you know this is one of twenty laptop
Orchestra stations and onstage will look
something like this this is the Stanford
laptop orchestra playing with the
Stanford new ensemble playing
traditional acoustic instruments and
playing across the Pacific with
musicians in Beijing in kind of a
real-time network collaborative concert
by the way this is a research area that
Kris chafe our director of karma has
been working on for quite a few years to
really connect different parts of the
world actually play music together over
the high performance networks that we
have today and so this is kind of a
coming together several different
research projects and we actually even
you know we actually perform every every
year there's a there's a course in the
spring at Stanford that is all about
laptop Orchestra in fact there's a
concert tonight at karma 7pm that
features a mobile phone works and the
laptop Orchestra and is actually going
to be having several audience
asian based pieces so definitely much to
check that out immediately follow that
concert is the karma Musa circus which
is a common white console which
essentially turn the whole building into
a kind of a concert stage we've just
throughout the building all different
kinds of installations and instruments
and performances is going on just kind
of walk around and experience so that
all starts at seven tonight at Karma on
campus at Stanford so come check that
out if I haven't fully deterred you from
from it yet so here which is doing one
last svn update outside of karma before
going into the sculpture gardens to
perform one of these outdoor concerts
that we did in 2008 in fact one anecdote
from that is we had to take the wireless
networking hub and put it in high up in
a tree because we're so spread out that
it was there's a lot of interference and
so this is the one we get direct line of
sight between it and all the all the
machines I was trying to synchronize and
as I mentioned it is a course in
Stanford where we actually learn
everything from coding to sound designed
a composition to of course performance
and perform together as an ensemble and
again we use chuck is kind of our
primary tool of teaching and using to
build instruments and sounds so I think
one on tues give you a quick demo now of
like of some of the things that we use
to actually build instruments and I'm
going to switch over to the wolf vision
now and actually maybe the first thing
I'll show you is if this works this is
an instrument that's based on just an
accelerometer of the physical laptop if
I can lift this thing without wrecking
it this is not an instrument this is
just a little demo the idea here is that
we're using just sensors inside on the
laptop to actually control the sound
synthesis I think of it is is actually
changing the valve that is being uttered
by this god will pulse is that we're
hearing I think of it as like gently
grab
someone by their throat and molding
their mouth to form the shapes that
would you know how do these sounds and
actually anytime you have accelerometers
or tilt sensing you also have what we
call smack sensing by the way this is
research that fellow graduate student at
the time Rebecca fee brink who's
actually gave a google Tech Talk Now
long ago here on our work on real time
machine learning for music she's going
to be actually a professor at Princeton
in this coming fall she and I did this
research and actually converting the
physical laptop as a platform for making
laptop Orchestra instruments and we did
this smack sensing using the cellar
ometer and there's another demo Oh so
this just senses basically um yeah so
it's trying it's trying to take kind of
experience a little bit outside of the
screen in the mouse and the UI of the
laptop and thinking of it more as a
physical thing on the tales of fat is
then this kind of instrument that
Rebecca and I created called joy of
chant for a piece of the same name and
that uses this joystick and if things
work let's see there we go alright so
how's loose when you squeeze the trigger
here it starts singing yeah that's how
can fool anyone there's not like a you
know real person singing that's as a
computer-generated you know singing
voice but it is generated it's actually
not recorded it's actually completely
you know just out of numbers we actually
compute in here alright so how does this
instrument work so by tilting it to one
corner Oh versus another you get
different vowels hmm and then when you
move kind of a smooth interpolation
between those vowels and then get things
are in control and because this is a
model we can kind of break it down into
its component component parts instead of
kind of this pitched glottal train
glottal pulse train that's generating
what we think of his pitch we can send
noise through this model
can make it brief ok and then can map to
the keyboard make it you know sing a
little bit so I just tied the keys z
cbad gwe and it's kind of laid out like
now like fretboard of a guitar and you
can make it
a really high by the way if you twist it
you got vibrato so and then if you want
you can play little diddies with
I
so that's that's the joy of Chan and
that's just one of I think up to date
more than 200 instruments and pieces
they've been created for the laptop
Orchestra so moving on there's this
quote that I've since really taken to
heart about computing this by the HCI
research or ben shneiderman who said the
old computing is about what computers
can do was the new computing is about
what people can do and I think that is a
theme that you know really is very
relevant to you know pretty much
everything we might do with computing
today and certainly for music which is
of course of primary interest to us when
we think about computer music with that
in mind we go to this thing and this of
course is the iphone and before working
on the iPhone we actually worked with
kind of the first mobile phone orchestra
at Stanford and we're actually using
nokia devices running on symbian and
working on that I think was the first
realizing that I had allowed these these
mobile phones are getting so powerful
there you know in terms of computation
but then they also have all this like
sensors you can use accelerometers now
multi-touch gyroscope but then they're
also really connected and also they're
really really personal you know these
devices are all but invisible they're
just you know you kind of don't notice
them and there's something that we have
with us you know that can put a slip
into your pocket you can use while
you're waiting to get milk at this
convenience store is just something that
is so like in the moment and thereby so
intimate so that was that's when I
really really wanted to you know see
working to with this kind of device for
music and for sound
and so when the iphone sdk was announced
in the spring 2008 we decided to well in
a i think in a bout of insanity to
actually start a company to really kind
of leverage the things we've learned and
continue to learn in the research side
at karma and elsewhere in computer music
and apply it to actually kind of the
startup or we can build products that
can reach a critical mass of people to
actually learn more about what we can do
with mobile devices so thereby you know
through that process this mule was a was
kind of born so I'm gonna give you a few
demos here to kind of show you some the
earlier products we did the first
product we did is actually think called
sonic lighter and it's not a musical
instrument it's a it's a lighter but it
is sonic in nature so i'm going to show
you that here so basically you know kind
of when you first open it it's nothing
more than just and yet another virtual
lighter for for your phone of which
they're like dozens and dozens but uh
you know this one the idea is that you
will respond to accelerometer will
respond to touch and by the way the
seller on the whole idea is that you
know you should be able to hold this up
at concerts and use your phone which
people are actually doing these days
they just used like the brightness of
the screen to be their concert lighter
you can of course pinch this they give
the flame different sizes but then this
is where I think the similarities maybe
stop it which want to make some
statement with us aesthetically we try
to say that this is not a simulation of
light on your phone your phone is the
liar and we try to prove that by you
know having tilt the phone and actually
hear you can't really hear it hear me
see if I get there's this kind of
unnerving crackling sound that's the
sound of the flame burning the side of
your phone and there's yet another kind
of a gesture that you can do here which
is you can actually blow out the flame
by blowing into the phone so
there we go so what I'm actually doing
is of course blow into the microphone
here and there's a little Chuck program
inside the sonic lighter that's tracking
basically an amplitude of that signal
and then when it gets above a certain
threshold it starts wavering above
another threshold said oh this is
sufficiently strong I'm just going to
extinguish myself and and then there's
another thing you can do here which is
given two lighters you can actually put
one into flame thrower mode and light
the other one so let me show you that
again and this is this is done also
through sound okay land or so there's
actually emitting a very faint signal
from one of the phones it's and then
this other one is basically looking for
exactly that signal or something close
to it once it detects enough of it said
Oh someone's trying to ignite me I'm
going to burst into flames and that's
kind of the way that this works and then
there's a another aspect to this which
is kind of a social test and so on this
globe visualization not unlike Google
Earth well it's a very pared down
version because the zoom level kind of
stops here but anyway you can see all
these points of light and those are
where people have recently ignited their
sonic lighters from around the world and
this is just social experiment but it
ended up being kind of something we put
into every subsequent product we've ever
released its mule and you can actually
see the first six days and seven days of
you know kind of sonic lighter and the
world was just like lighting up it was
kind of fun is also uncanny how much
this image matches images of the earth
you know is taken from satellite images
you know from space and night speaking
perhaps to population densities as well
as perhaps to maybe
distribution of wealth because you know
this is meant to be kind of provide that
tinge of connection between people who
have a sonic lighter it's like seeing
this globe you know we wonder if is like
you know there are other people out
there like me who have bought a virtual
lighter for 99 cents on their iPhone and
somehow that's connecting us in some
small way any case so what that brings
me to is another favorite quote and I
think this is one is so timeless and
then at least some of you I've also seen
this zoom that says any sufficiently
advanced technologies indistinguishable
from magic from arthur c clarke and so
it's I think we're their technology you
know we're not really magicians but we
do try to build sufficiently advanced
technology with music in one of the
things we try to do on the tail of sauna
glider was actually build an instrument
called ocarina and and this is a meant
to be kind of an ancient flute-like
instrument kind of reimagined for the
iPhone and again using you know
everything that we could possibly use on
the iphone and and so if you look at
kind of the design of ocarina it you
know is kind of this exercise and design
that was inside out as backwards it
wasn't like we said we want to build X
and let's see how to make it work on an
iPhone it was ok here's an iphone what
is it good for what are its limitations
and can we find something that really
fits that profile so it's kind of this
inside-out design i'll try to play a
little ditty for you on the ocarina to
demonstrate i'm going to put on these uh
speaker gloves this is actually from the
stanford mobile phone orchestra we
actually just took these gloves chopped
off the fingers of the gloves actually
sewn on these kind of portable speakers
that are battery-powered and we added a
splitter here so you can just basically
still have your fingers to manipulate
the phone but you get this mobile
application much like
kind of the intimate sound you get from
the laptop Orchestra and hopefully this
will work I'm going to fire up ocarina
it looks something like that and you
press down it uses multi-touch to
actually let you hold down different
combinations on the finger hole and then
you can blow into this so far to try
playing this louder so that's pretty
much the whole idea so and the
accelerometer is used to actually map
the sound vibrato so if I play like this
horses you merely get that little extra
boost of instantly just just add water
type of expressiveness to it yeah all
you have to do is to tilt it and with
this you can play you know a number of
Diddy's I always end up playing the
zelda theme because this is kind of what
inspired this instrument does it just
because it's just something that we love
so much
ah
for example so um and this is an
instrument that you know we really want
want people just to pick up and start
playing and to help them with that we
actually have a number of aquamarine
entablatures on our website to help
people get started and more than that
there's the same social feature in
ocarina that actually shows you what
other people are actually playing at
their current locations around the world
so let's see if we can tune into
someone calling themselves lawless
sounds like a sounds like a very um yeah
a very nice rendition of twinkle little
star with some artistic license thrown
in there very nice and you can see this
is just literally going all across the
world it's like for the first week that
we launched ocarina that the song that
was like going all that was like all
around the world happened to be amazing
grace that kind of became the like you
know stairway to heaven of ocarina you
know if it's like if you go guitar shops
it's a no stairway it's like you know
this one would think there's a moment
everyone's like no more amazing grace it
was because it was actually one of the
few kind of tablish sure we had on a
website since then users have generated
more than I think like three thousand
different tablatures rock arena and so
now you can play you know a very large
choose them a large repertoire of music
so that's a little bit about the ocarina
and if you look at kind of the user
community behind it if you just did a
search on youtube force mulock rain or
iphone rock when you found hundreds of
not thousands of user videos that are
performing for the world on their iPhone
and again this is kind of the tablet or
the tablature looks like it's kind of
like a game you just have to follow
along blue circle means you hold it down
white circle means you you don't and
then the arrows mean you basically hold
that note for a little longer than the
other one so you know what the melody
kind of sound like and you have a chance
of just picking this up and playing that
within I don't know like 10 seconds so
to demonstrate I also show you we
actually held a contest called this
contest blows ocarina contest would try
to you know basically find the top
youtube performances of ocarina players
so this is one of our winners
she's really good
so you can actually see her eyes on a
ricotta she's actually scanning
something and presumably probably it's
the score to this on her computer so in
some sense like the computer monitor has
become kind of like you know from
ocarina kind of the modern a music stand
and Audrina has become some kind of like
a recorder it's kind of uniform you know
it could be your first instrument that
you learn how to play and it's really
that easy here's just one another one of
our winners doing something very
unexpected so she has playing music of
the night to her nose on the ocarina and
apparently she spent a nose flautist for
like all her life and this is just the
most recent nose flute that she has had
you know to play with she actually
recently appeared on The Ellen Show
playing nose flute so we're very happy
that she did this she along with our
other 14 winners each received a
thousand dollars and a small t-shirt for
her we send her also a box of Kleenex
just for her troubles under the anecdote
here and this is what sonic glider we
actually had like we actually had a
disintegration using google maps where
we actually showed where all the you
know basically at different times where
all the people have lit up on the sonic
lighters and then one day we got an
email from a user who said hey check out
this location and we started zooming in
and kind of start seeing this pattern
emerging and so one of our users
actually left us a message and we verify
in our database is actually one device
that did this and they you know this is
pretty much the easiest way to do this
is probably not to hack into our servers
but rather just walk down the street
light up the sauna glider blow it out
walk a few more steps and do it again
until you've constructed this message so
okay so that brings us to kind of
another instrument in another experience
and this is called leaf trombone world
stage and this is actually to take
ocarina add some gaming elements to it
so you can kind of on the right side you
see kind of these like well you don't we
see see this
leaves flying towards these markers and
you're meant to be kind of opening the
trombone slide to that location while
blowing into the phone so it's like kind
of a trombone hero of sorts but then
there's also a composer where users can
actually create content today more than
6,000 leave trombone tracks have been
created by our users and then you can
actually do this thing on the world
stage for what we call kind of this like
crowdsource judging of leaf trombone
performances and it looks something like
this but maybe the best way is just to
show you there's gonna be a loud pop I'm
going to swap audio here so I cover your
ears a little bit okay and I'm going too
far out the world stage here on the leaf
trombone
see ah do that one so what the app is
doing is actually recruiting judges from
from the pole of users so when someone
actually submits a performance of world
stage the app goes out and finds three
judges 22 in real time relative to each
other judge the performance so we're
about observe this particular judging
session so you can use emoticons to show
your support there's a sonic ladder
being waved their you can also put text
messages here um well everyone's got
their ladders out now is it really you
know that kind of a performance in that
kind of a so on and so the idea here is
that we can even if you don't speak the
same language you can actually use
emoticons and sometimes you can get too
excited and your way we had I think I
guess the system had a sensor this
particular user we imagined it was a
message of support in at the very end of
a performance you actually get a rating
between 1 to 10 and this is a way to
really give feedback
back to the performer everyone's rocking
out all right so that's pretty high
scores and idea here is that I mean well
it's it's really hard for computers to
actually gauge what a good performances
especially on the leaf trombone you know
some things that are some things are so
inherently difficult from computers to
capture like if it rooms is funny or sad
or you know failed spectacularly but
it's still awesome for some reason like
the notion of awesome is kind of hard to
capture for computers that as well as
far as I know today so this is a way to
kind of use computers to set the
conditions right for people to then mean
of course compute their human
computation cycles to this process so
it's basically research problems like
this that unifor which we actually
formed kind of mobile phone orchestra at
Stanford and actually where we actually
do research not only locally but also at
a wide scale and that you know
everything kind of somehow shrinks to
like a five letter acronym or like a
name you know like Chuck karma slower
caloric smule in this case mofo the pH
that's a mobile phone Orchestra and
we're of course we use these type of
hand mounted speakers and we perform
like laptop Orchestra but also we take
kind of the location awareness of these
devices and the distribution of these
devices in the critical mass and to you
know ask different kind of research
questions then when I try to solve since
these devices are so ingrained into our
everyday lives and so that's you know
just a little bit about the mobile phone
Orchestra now for something completely
different this is T Pain and before we
actually ended up like talking to t-pain
about making a nap together which we
ended up doing he turned out to be like
a sonic lighter user and here's like a
picture of him blowing out the lighter
and he was really happy apparently about
being able to do that and if some time
later kind of independent leave this
incident
we actually got together and talked
about making a nap together in fact it
was actually one of the few times like
we usually come up with our own concept
and ideas that we develop this time it
was t-pain and nappy boy and said hey I
have an idea let's just put auto-tune on
the iphone and so you just turn your
iphone into this oughta to Mike that's
all you got to do and for us it really
thick is we told t-pain was Admiral we
want to build an app for you that really
kind of captures some essential part of
your who you are as an artist and we
didn't want to build yet another kind of
a fan app for you want to build
something that really kind of captured
some part of you know your your essence
as an artist so it kind of really fit to
actually put his music along with
autotune on on the iphone and what came
out was actually i am t-pain and this
idea is to really transform every user
into t-pain and at the risk of
embarrassing myself to embarrass myself
further i will i'll sing a little ditty
free i'm gonna gonna be another audio
pop as i unplug this ok here we go see
this work check check yeah yeah I'm
gonna turn off that microphone there
yeah yeah yeah yeah
oh ok so that's a little bit auto-tune
apologies in advance shutting watch me
Jimmy my you achieve opti pain to get
idea so little bit more natural
show you Holly let's get drunk forgive
me dick and buy you a drink anyway you
get the idea oh so that's I am t-pain
and today like I like two million people
have downloaded this in our auto tuning
you know not only two teams music
through this thing this technique that
t-pain has really taken to in a logical
extreme auto tuning their life so
everything from like I don't know their
cat their babies whatever they can find
an auto tuning and also they've been
taking some of the tracks that we've
bundled with this that t-pain is
released and they're actually doing this
kind of stream consciousness like kind
of like talking about their life and
wrap in autotune it's pretty cool all
right so onwards magic piano this is
another applications actually the first
application build for the ipad and this
is something we did in early of this
year in the early earlier this year and
it started actually with long long who
pictured here is the pianist who played
in front of like five billion people at
the Summer Olympics Opening Ceremony
it's one of the you know most renowned
pianist today and we met in 2009
magically like a month later the ipad
was announced and said hey here's a
large multi touch device they can use
and suddenly you know the piano that we
were planning on doing made a lot more
sense so out came matched piano and
within you know a month of release
people were playing at cats were playing
it this is a viral video that got like
six million views and it was just like
the cat playing the magic piano and so
the app called noby noby boy and
apparently cats really like iPads and so
two babies incident so oh maybe i'll
give you a demo of that as well
how am i doing okay I think I'll I'm
almost through but I fee if you need to
run to feel free to escape okay if you
need to escape please do so I um I'll
just keep going for now wow it's a
really dirty screen I forgot that was
actually live okay we'll just live with
this dirty screen for now I can turn off
the lights may be here we go that's a
little better so this first mode is just
kind of like an invisible keyboard
absolutely impossible to play anything
on this is almost as difficult to play
on but he looks kind of cool and that
was kind of like fifty percent of the
reason for doing this and in this mode
you can actually hope to play something
on if you want
and then you have various different
modes now this is actually not the
things people doing on the magic piano
these are just kind of like little toys
but then people are well they're really
playing on the magic a knows the song
book and me see if I can play something
for you here it's a little clair de lune
and the timing is completely up to you
so and this is kind of something that
just kind of it's not scored is not
meant to be scored is just hey it
doesn't try to judge you at all about
kind of like playing this and it's come
up to you how you want to play the song
I wish me to show you another one that
has more of a multi-touch on here
you
so on and so forth so that's kind of the
magic piano and also had this duet mode
which is probably not going to work
right now depends on how many other
people are also trying to do it over the
magic piano this actually randomly finds
another person whoa okay so that's
actually a real person somewhere out
there right now playing something and
then we try to end I think you have
nothing else you can play some heart and
soul on this but i don't think i can get
this person interested he seems to be
interested is more like freeform
sometimes i respond so anyway that's
another social experiment where we're
trying to say okay this is kind of like
a piano roulette thing we're just kind
of like pair people up a minute at a
time and then let them play together and
you know if they like playing with each
other they can let you know have
requests for more time so that's that's
magic piano as two more things to show
you then i'll charge you them quickly
glee this is a another apple we try to
introduce kind of a collaborative
singing into kind of social singing into
this so the first thing you can do with
glee gonna unplug is to use it kind of
like a harmonizer so so i can open up
glee here and get it to work
ah so that is my voice and chop it up
into all these little tiny sound dreams
and then it basically puts them back
together hit different pitches but it's
still my voice so it's basically this
like just add water type of auto
harmonization you some moves we built
into the scene there's a person call
themselves odd days that's now going
after piano over here as they just
connected while I was talking it all
days is plain mary had a little lamb so
let me assure them so basically this is
meant to be just constantly auto
harmonizing with you
and then this is number of songs you can
sing from the TV show and then what you
can do is once you've you've some sing
the song then you can actually go to the
world listen to other people sing but if
you hear anything you like you can then
choose to add your voice to that
particular performance today we have
performances on the globe which have had
like dozens of performers like john
lennon's imagine for example there's a
rendition with like 60 people on it all
over the world it's kind of hunting and
a little creepy but like infinitely
awesome that people are doing this and
then just completely not by our own
doing people have self-organized to get
like a world version of we are the world
into the glee club just a credit get as
many people as they can sing on this so
that's Glee and really if you look at
all the different components of it it's
really kind of you know on the client it
does pitch correction harmonization and
visualization and then basically in the
cloud allows you to share and sing
together on this thing and the final
thing I want to show you is actually an
application we just released last week I
guess that's the magic fiddle it looks
kind of like this it's kind of a game
it's also a way to teach how to play a
fiddle of sorts and it actually is an
instrument that we like to think is like
it talks to you it's if you mad can
imagine like Hal 9000 from 2001 like you
know kind of appearing in the form of a
magic fiddle and you know trying to help
you to learn how to play the magic
fiddle that's pretty much what the
experience like so first thing you
actually see on this app and says hello
i am your fiddle let's play music
together so i will attempt to play a
little for ya
that other speakers running out of
batteries I'm going to swap it into this
wine me
okay that more or less works plug this
into my pack this is kind of like well
the original how this app came about in
concept was that he was like we're
actually walking out of a concert that
long long was playing with San Francisco
Symphony and started as a juggler like
we had our iPads what does more like it
would be like totally absurd if you had
an app like a violin they had to
actually hold up to your face to play
and you seem like such a ridiculous idea
and that we had to go ahead and do it so
this is kind of the violin
and you can do vibrato on this can do
plucks the tuning is really low let me
actually said this to something we're
saying
and then we thought this actually was
going to be a pretty hard instrument for
people to just pick up and play and turn
out to be actually people just just kind
of do it but we actually made like you
know the story book which is basically
two books of four chapters each that
teaches all the different techniques
from how to hold your iPad properly to
play the magic fiddle to how to playing
you know mary had a little lamb and then
you can go into psalm book and basically
play this in kind of like a rock band
guitar hero like thing so let me try to
play a little bit for you
so
and really that's the magic fiddle and
that's kind of the latest thing and it's
kind of just trying to you know if
there's a concept that's uniting a lot
of these different experiences between
we're doing a karma and smooth one of
them is just trying to set the
conditions right through technology to
get people to experience joy of making
music and you know it shouldn't I think
we've gone to a point where it's like it
feels like making music stirs are for
like musicians or composers or you know
people who actually decide to do that
for a living no I think making music
should probably at least a start making
music shouldn't be any harder than say
picking up your phone and calling your
best friend and so I think that's one
area of the research that we're really
you know working on and yeah if you long
YouTube you also find like the st.
Lawrence string quartet actually playing
Pachelbel's Canon in D with iPads I
won't have time to show you this here
but if you just look for ipad violin you
have it so to wrap up just some things
that we've we thought about is we're
doing this you know if you look at
phones versus computers laptops or
desktops they're roughly equivalent now
you know like the same basic components
if display you have sound you have
computation you have networking but you
just have less of that on the phone just
have less of everything smaller screen
real estate less powerful CPU less
cycles less memory etc but some real
sense phones are more powerful because
of the very kind of personal nature that
they bring the things that you would
want to do on a phone that you never
want to do on a computer and vice versa
so I think in the end the day it just
feels like they're just fundamentally
different and from a design in thinking
point of view it really they really
deserve to kind of be their own kind of
a blank slate if you will when you
actually when certainly when we think
about designing things for this and the
other one think about this is almost
like you know is we're making more of
these experiences for people to play
music it just feels like in this in the
same way that well if you think about
computer
desktop computers when we go use it we
kind of go to it we immerse ourselves in
its world in its screen we kind of sit
down at our computer and we focus on it
but for mobile devices it's like
bringing computation out into our
everyday lives and that's something that
is really significant something that I
think certainly from music has a huge
potential that via to be unlocked so
i'll leave you with another quote since
I love these quotes and this is by of
course the late Marc weiszer one of the
fathers bikal is computing we said the
most profound technologies are those
that disappear they weave themselves
into the very fabric of everyday life
and I think you know as far as mobile
ghosts it's certainly from music this is
it's just prophetic and altered true and
becoming even more true is as time goes
on and so I guess with this I just want
to thank you and for having me and for
letting me torture you with my various
performances thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
