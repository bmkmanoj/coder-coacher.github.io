logic talk and Bruce and I started
talking I don't know about a year year
and a half ago yeah about this and you
know as you're aware googles mission is
to organize the world the the world's
information make it universally
accessible and useful and the decisions
that people make based on information
that they look up on google or use from
google impact the real world and what
Bruce is going to talk about today is
that you can make information available
to consumers that so that their values
can impact their decisions and that acts
on their real world both in a local as
well as macro way that was Bruce take it
away Thanks Thank You Ross is this like
okay okay so we're an intimate group and
we'll just proceed that way and thanks
all for coming and let's see there as
well said I mean our challenge is to
connect shoppers values and how they
spend their money and can we grow social
wealth out of that there are benefits
for consumers the benefits for Google
and it's and it's business partners I'd
like to talk about how we could work
together on that and then have some Q&amp;amp;A
and crosses arranged for some lunch
before I go any further I have a
neuromuscular thing that'll make my head
shake I'm not going to collapse I've had
it since I'm eight I even have a
childhood friend here to vouch for the
fact that since age 15 it's been the
same exactly and Michael and and so I
wouldn't be put off by that um second
this what you're seeing is about seven
years of work to boil down into into it
what we'll talk about conferences are
some of the most inspirational that that
I've seen
and I thought I'd start off with some
intersections to the work that that I'm
working on our brains are production
machines and they're based on taking in
and storing experience our physics is
built on the beauty of nested layers of
simple relationships our society is
built by seeing acting on and
communicating the meaningful in your
life simplicity cells according to David
Pogue depending means more than wealth
patient capital means more than charity
democratization of content is the
literacy of this generation our brains
respond faster to threats drowning out
hopeful news and how to use it we need
to learn how to listen the three billion
new voices on the planet waving on two
dollars a day let's build public spaces
worth caring about because life is lived
locally I want what I can't have I need
what I don't want my mind won't stop a
little bit of consumerism fetish there
where are you now the US spends
consumers and businesses and about sixty
percent of our gdp or economic product
Canada in the US have six percent the
world's population and consume forty
percent of our resources the average
household spends seventeen thousand
dollars on things it says it needs like
housewares and foods seven hundred and
twelve billion dollars a year was spent
on holiday purchases including nine
billion on greeting cards okay so
that's a lot of greeting cards and when
you look at seven hundred and twelve
billion dollars even in the context of
this week's primary costs it's a lot of
money and we don't know whether we're
spending it well this is a chart that
shows basically for the last number of
years since 1998 about a fifty percent
growth in consumer debt over the period
of the Internet's growth that's the red
line on the top and the internet
e-commerce value per person is the is
the green so one could ask if we
continue these trends and an e-commerce
continues to go up and up and up and the
consumer debt goes out how much of your
disposable income is going to be spent
for consuming at this large increasing
rate and this is a chart showing that
the percentage since 1980 of consumer
debt service the yellow line has gone
from roughly twelve percent to to
fifteen percent and overall the red line
includes rents and mortgage payments so
that we know that people take out second
home loans to pay for those consumerism
we're seeing nearly twenty percent of
disposable income go this way and you
could ask is this generation that's
increasingly indebted buying things that
are socially valuable are we buying
anything of social value are we you know
creating debt and and drags on the
economy that we that we really need are
they worth thrill now what is truly
green and what isn't as we start to
witness and green washing and
other issues what's missing today I
think are the consumers don't have
information they need they don't have
rankings of products green and other
social impacts they don't have systems
to show social issues as revenue dollars
so if i buy a green product how much
consumption depends on me and others
buying that green product they don't
have incentives to use their social
values when shopping they don't have
affinity group buying power clustered by
issue if I want to eradicate child labor
or accelerate women's issues or men's
issues how do I find others doing that
in real time I don't have tools to
prioritize the portfolio of regional
concerns each region doesn't have the
same issue of poverty or or environment
or infrastructure how do i see regional
concerns accurately do I get better
credit card interest rates as I shop
more responsibly using social values and
a bank to leverage these social value
rewards or incentives we don't have any
of this in fact by contrast for anyone
who watched Super Bowl or the primaries
we add statistics up the yin-yang and we
had no comparable rate of statistics for
how we shop in a year we won't get to
that level of statistics I'm looking for
a macbook pro but I have to go through
to find a macbook pro and if it is
ethical and is to go to the apple
website to go to websites like a lenovo
i know that that ranked corporate social
responsibility go to the industry
environmental pages go back to Apple to
see if they've bought products in a fair
labor way I still don't get to the
answer I can't get to the answer there
is a better approach we could rank each
products ethical score we could profile
ethical consumer preferences
my preferences in your preferences we
each are different we come from
different backgrounds we have different
priorities we can match the products and
this shoppers ethical scores we could
reward ethical shoppers with kind of
cash back rewards that are very common
we could use regionalism to increase
local economy and buy local campaigns
and that could be around the planet we
could finance companies and regions who
grow social impacts that ethical
consumers would now have the aggregated
power and visualized power to demand
this is my view of how Google serves
shoppers today and and you know it's
it's what you do and you do all kinds of
amazing things here I'm asking you to do
a little more with at the end of the
talk so we go and we search for the
product and we go on my mobile device I
find a store that's selling it I go and
look for the best price in a catalog or
whatever and then I go buy the product
and check out with it simple the power
in that transaction is all in the
manufacturers hands all in the
retailer's hands not in the shoppers
hands when you're looking at social
values there are synergies of Google to
build what's missing and these are just
a few of many and I'm sure you can think
of dozens more but clearly you've got
the analytics to help merchants
understand the greater market power of
serving the socially aware consumer you
have finance you have your way of
looking at the financial markets that
could put the financial power of
socially active consumers you have a
Google and Google Health that are ways
of customizing the browser experience or
customizing the interaction
with the information blogger and and
orkut and Google Groups obviously ways
of communicating across affinity
networks and building those and feeding
them more accurate information of who
cares about given social issues you have
the droid and and your grants and your
philanthropy and clearly some of the
initial or inertia to get the the
products out there into and to see what
what people want may come from there and
then the most talked-about feature is
Android and your mobile presence and
what's that going to do and how how are
you going to distinguish that that
service when people carry a cell phone
are they going to get and transact
information about their social concerns
that are environmental concerns their
their public health concerns
infrastructure concerns are there going
to be able to do it or are they going to
just see in a different format all the
other information that keeps them from
having that power the world's going
green you know thank God we have honored
that Eureka kishimoto immediately passed
mayor from Palo Alto is sitting here and
and she's led the cause for a green
economy in Palo Alto I mean you've done
that and and so we know that there's a
tension on it well and then there's
Google as the webs com posts for finding
direction and taking action how does
Google what what is google do to help
consumers make better green choices
where does Google fit into a green world
I don't know the answer web commerce
could mean so much more imagine socially
active consumers buying ethical products
business is getting ethical traits out
to consumers in other words yeah you
might read of a business paying a huge
fine or having a big toxic release what
did they do about it afterward how do
they communicate that message
consistently and authoritative Lee to
consumers governments could use web
commerce to fund local change instead of
just walking up to Sacramento or walking
up to the Congress and saying give us
money or pleading for a bond initiative
guess what the social commerce could
prioritize that issue and we'd have ways
of aggregating that demand banks could
reward consumer and business social
impacts they could say we can reduce
interest rates to consumers that shop in
accordance with their social values got
less why because you sneezed why because
the the bank's know that a socially
conscious consumer or business is a
better credit risk we have many studies
showing us and affinity groups could see
the ethical goals that their purchases
achieve so no longer will they have to
survive on studies that are self
validating they can actually in real
time start to see what it is that
consumers care about when it comes to
labor or fail trait or when i go to
google and I have a queer USA save San
Francisco Bay or second query saved how
altas environment nothing in the ad ad
ranked column blank stares back at me
say what do you expect me to say there's
no ads here there's no ranking of good
choices there's no way to buy a safer
environment there's no ethical sense
from my dollars and cents what if I made
the query tomorrow or next week with
your help and instead we we got a couple
different features we we saw values rank
ads in other words the placement of the
ad reflected the social value delivered
to me based on my profile so if I want
to green the world the topmost ranked ad
would be the credibly validated producer
or manufacturer
of a product that fits what I want it's
a smarter choice obviously you would
expect that the better match would have
a higher click-through rate would be a
more valuable product to Google we can
talk about how to show that we could buy
a safer environment we could turn sense
into into ethical sense what we could
also do one other thing along the bottom
of the browser we could put a stock
ticker but instead of corporate share
prices we would put social concern
revenue figures in other words shoppers
who voice the preference for
environmental issues would represent how
many billion dollars of sales that day
or that minute and suddenly the affinity
groups and the ng the nonprofit's who
care about those issues are working hard
on those issues would would cite real
market statistics on that the value of
solving that issue and gaining market
share there are two concepts for
conscious consumerism that that I've I
think are needed one is called the means
meter and the other is sustainable
resiliency and I'll go through them
quickly now for the moon's meter think
about socially responsible consumerism
on your iphone or your gphone excuse me
in your browser take the ad search and
other metrics and add these social
scores that that user values are full of
let the customer loyalty be a matter of
what which product or which
manufacturers the most transparent is
letting me see the supply chain that
gets me my product the footprint that
gets me my product and the labor that
gets me my product and and that's how
you're going to increase loyalty you'd
have channels for government
incentives in other words perhaps a
sales tax regime that responds to the
kind of social behavior that this new
technology would unleash so instead of a
flat sales tax a community might decide
guess what you know for socially active
consumers we're going to make a
difference so we're going to give you
back a tiny bit of that sales tax
revenue or the state could do that and
the zipper that we talked about in terms
of seeing the aggregate purchase power
of socially conscious consumers the way
to do the means meter I would suggest is
is not to ask 20 questions that's a
turnoff I think you know we could have
sliders like an equalizer if I in this
room had a hundred-thousand-dollar
stereo and I gave each of you a little
equalizer bass and treble panel and said
make this stereo sound perfect to your
ears the readings on those sliders would
be slightly different and we each have
our values in that difference as well
we'd have a burnin period so after a
month despite what you thought your
values were we would show you well it
seems like your values based on what
you're buying is this hey you can change
that fact but here objectively is the
kind of person you say through your
purchasers you are sparklines Edward
Tuffy's technique would make Adsense ads
even more valuable because you would see
here's your goal at improving a social
metric like environment or child welfare
well this is how far you're away from it
and if you bought into this advertisers
product this is how much closer you
would get to that goal and the reason
that's important is that would change
perhaps the credit provided to you by a
bank or the feedback loops from that
industry the ads would rank highest
based on on how they the advertiser
contributes to your social portfolio and
then this zipper to let affinity groups
know really that they control that much
in consumer dollars sustainable
resiliency is the second necessary
feature and that is what's the regional
context in which business occurs now we
have s or I or which is not Stanford
Research Institute it is socially
responsible investing metrics that that
mutual funds like Domini and pax world
used to say well is this company more
responsible is it doing the right thing
well that's a global rating of good that
global rating isn't disaggregated into
is HP or Google or any of the household
names doing the right thing in the
headquarters area that it lives in how
would you know you never see a rating
like that well sustainable resiliency
would say what are the impacts of
Commerce that are that have happen just
by dint of the way that region works
what are the regional gaps and
sustainable resiliency energy health
other concerns how do you layer on to
the region not just the benchmarks of
problems which everybody uses to fight
for budget dollars or go to to state
governments and get programs funded but
they also use to drown out any one
else's issues if you layered those on
top of each other regionally you could
actually have a whole layer cake a
balanced portfolio approach to managing
these concerns so that wall street and
government credit ratings could improve
for regions that do a better job of
growing their sustainable resiliency
that doesn't happen today and then
ultimately you have this advocacy tool
on this this goal setting for consumers
to say i want my issues my region to
improve its its performance
in the social sustainable resiliency
world we can get the web content from
unexpected places as you know
corporations are investing a lot in
enterprise knowledge management software
or in GIS geographic information systems
in risk management supply chain there
are ways to tap into those systems to
see the supply chain in a very different
way these corporate environmental social
governance ratings that I've talked
about as s RI we need to see those
spatially correlated in other words not
for the entire world but decided to a
populated area so that we can manage the
impacts at that scale and then we need
to see business to government and
business the business procurement
patterns imagine a means meter of social
values but this time at the
institutional level at a university
level or at a government saying we want
our procurement mechanisms to have the
same kind of accountability and positive
impacts we're going to I'm saying let's
give away Android phones for free I
don't know but but you have enough
reason to want to take your social
values on the road and there's enough
constant use of that information as you
express yourself through purchases that
to distinguish Google's mobile phone and
their ads as a user experience I think
you have to give the consumer much more
validating and invalidating information
than just talking at them saying you'll
feel better if you buy this you know or
you'll be like Paris Hilton if you buy
this or Tiger Woods if you buy this I
mean that's nonsense we can make the
information really valuable and then
everyone will want a google phone
because they'll want to use values-based
commerce I think it ties also into an
ethical bank and I am forming an ethical
here I moved here two years ago from New
York to try to do that an ethical bank
is different for reasons I'll get to but
clearly if you have consumers that are
motivated to perform and to use their
money in a very different socially
conscious way it's not just about
getting green checks to write it's more
than that or paperless statements this
is a schematic of how to buy the laptop
how I like to scan and grab all the
laptop ad search information there how
to load your social priorities in your
profile which is obviously updated as
you shop to find the best match of
social values and and financial values
to use a credit card that gives you the
rewards for shopping this way and then
to interact as an affinity group based
on the metrics that you're trying to to
improve whatever social concern you're
trying to improve I think we can change
the world Google's had an amazing impact
Google can be a lever for for greater
transparency in the corporate and market
structures not just a frenzy of Gen X
and Gen Y Gilded Age consumption to be
blunt and debt Googlers can buy a less
vulnerable product and planet the u.s.
global consumers incur less debt it
cause less harm to their family and
their region in the planet and they can
help find transact and Bank the
abundance that is socially responsive
for those who who choose and I expect
some of you do you probably are using
some of these s RI funds to invest your
money wisely I just wanted to give you a
scale of where that that fits here all
the socially responsible investment
funds
here's the level of public debt across
the country here's the GDP that gross
domestic product the size of the economy
and here's the amount that are socially
screened by different issues and you see
it's not a lot relative to some of the
billions and trillions we've been
talking about and as you'll see the the
relative importance of funds that are
screening for issues that you might call
important is tiny in so if we're talking
about animal rights or no pornography or
no gambling or no alcohol or equal
employment tiny voice of dollars
speaking to those issues tiny through
the socially responsible investment
funds it's great industry it's had a
great impact it's not enough to move the
planet fast enough to solutions we care
about I've mentioned a few times this
notion of an ethical bank I think that
that we need a new form of banking to
supplement what we've had you've seen
reports of subprime there were SNL
crises before and there were all kinds
of excesses and basically the excesses I
think trace to the fact that the banks
don't have a measure of their regional
impacts they don't see not to make
credit available at the price they make
it in the quantity they make it in a
place that has not the jobs or the other
drivers of growth means meter helps
those drivers occur helps those jobs
occur anyway credit rating agencies can
take a banks greater continuity of
revenues into account and grow the
supply of money for this we need the
social capital markets I'm gonna shoka
fellow which is a group that recognizes
social entrepreneurs
there are two thousand of us around the
world Muhammad Yunus who won the Nobel
Prize for Grameen Bank is probably the
best known and so the social capital
markets are very constrained when you
donate to a non-profit the cost of funds
that nonprofit is roughly thirty percent
by the time you find the money and use
the money as a non-profit and report
that you use them we need social capital
markets that are much more efficient
than we have one of my favorite examples
of a of a socially responsible bank is
Wainwright bank in Boston and they've
been around for for close to 20 years
and let me show you their stock price
over the last two years so yellow is
Wainwright Bank blue is citibank stock
prices purple is Wainwright Bank a forty
percent in two years and yellow is the
entire banking sector composite buy from
Dow Jones so you have a sense that an
ethical bank doesn't give money away
doesn't lose money it's actually a safer
way to bank and that's because they are
socially accountable and they are
regionally accountable Nate and they
stick to their knitting and they don't
engineer financial products for the sake
of driving bonus seasons every year the
means meter to sum up would amplify user
social goals and commerce would voice
them would give them a stronger voice
the zipper I think is an important
feature of putting the the buying power
of socially active consumers to work in
positive ways sustainable resiliency
does dignify an awful lot of concerns
but in context and relative to other
issues in that
and says half of what regions are doing
an affirmative Lee better way better job
of managing that portfolio of concerns I
think the android phone could be an
amazing tool for ethical consumers if we
if we make it so and then an ethical
bank to actually incubate for the
financial sector some of the ways that
you use these new technologies to give
the power of transparency back to
customers and depositors and and and
spenders there are synergies here at
Google there are tons of them Ross's web
my appetite I read what you will do
every week let's let's build some of
this and and if we have questions I'd
love to take questions from here I know
there are some remote sites that are
hooked up for questions and and so
that's that's what I came to tell you
all so and I know that Ross is arranged
for for lunch table afterwards here so I
don't know if is this a new way of
thinking for you all have you seen this
kind of presentation before are you
aware of the social impacts on the other
side of the Adsense and the and the
other analytics that you're looking at
no you you're freaking geniuses it's
scary to stand in front of you all but
I've been looking forward to this and
engaging your minds in thinking about a
very different paradigm for the future
of Google that is customer centric and
is looking at how to push and empower
consumers to push their values out into
the world
and by doing that to grab much more
content as Ross said into the web to
make that content much more useful
interoperable accessible open it up
there's a whole dialogue we could have
about procurement systems yeah
just cuz the remote people
the question I have is you're talking
about one kind of value but Google is a
lot a little in the news for other kinds
of values namely privacy concerns so
what some of the things you're asking
for for example the value based ads and
so forth when somebody issues an
environmental search whatever that means
and that's something else to figure out
you're now asking our users to give us
more information and expose more of
their privacy or less than you look at
it in exchange for a richer experience
around social networking or whatever
else so you know I'm exchanging one
value for another in one case so if I
questions you know any comments first of
all on that and secondly do you have any
data on the willingness of socially
aware people to it to share more of
their personal information if they see a
value on the other side yeah great
questions I mean the first is I don't
want any more privacy incursion than
Google's already promoted and I'm a
lawyer in three states i as a
non-residential fellow of Larry Lessig's
Center for Internet and Society over at
Stanford you would do bad things to me
if I stood here and said we should we
should take away more privacy but I
think broadcasting the affinity concerns
that you share with others that have
your environmental or child welfare or
other thousands of other concerns that's
not something that has to reveal my
identity that can reveal to me the power
of the group i'm in but that doesn't
mean that the manufacturer can find me
it's not the same thing it means that
the manufacturer can find the group that
has self-identified as caring about
values certain values second you know
there are a lot of studies that show
higher levels of satisfaction from
manufacturers
who green their supply chain who promote
workplace safety who do all kinds of
socially active things and and you know
we can go through that on the vertical
basis in terms of the agriculture The
Omnivore's Dilemma problem or my is
Whole Foods whole foods we can go
through it from you know many many
angles but yes that the studies are
there to confirm that there's higher
levels of loyalty and satisfaction yeah
I thanks for the talk very good um you
make a lot of emphasis on the gphone do
you think that is more important than
just accessing the desktop I didn't more
people or do you know if more people is
buying on the font and at home using the
desktop I don't know that answer but I
do know one answer there's a study from
javelin strategies that came out about
two months ago that looked at why mobile
banking no I do it and they found that
if somebody who loses their credit card
they don't figure that out for two days
they was their cell phone they figure it
out in 45 minutes so the rate of
identity theft losses to the financial
sector might improve like diminish based
on switching to a credit device that's
embedded in a phone so you can only lose
the one thing I don't I don't have a
preference for either I'm sorry to
overemphasize because I rode on I think
the desktop will be a far richer
experience for all this than the phone
but the phone will be this persistent
identity mechanism for the future and so
we've got a we're going to live in that
phone that's going to be how we roll it
to the world we've got it make it useful
we've got to speak our values through
this as opposed to let a telephone
provider give us content that we have to
pay four dollars a month for that
doesn't let us be who we are to the
digital world yes
a great talk I'm just a question can you
tell us sort of what's been happening
with companies disclosing agreeing they
are and how socially conscious they
aren't because sort of I think that's
the key element sure to understand I'm
purchasing and you know what I'm you
know you know it's really still in its
infancy I mean there are multiple
standards somewhat in London tells me
there are a hundred and sixty thousand
ratings of good 160,000 ratings that's a
lot of confusion you can pick the
braiding you want JD Power pick JD power
I don't know what it means in a context
it just it's a nice gold emblem so uh
you know um I'm not going to choose what
the trust among all these thousands of
ratings I'd rather have affinity groups
a guess what we believe that Riverkeeper
data Robert Kennedy's nonprofit is
measuring string gauge quality in Palo
Alto we might prefer that to the epa's
measure of quality at some point so that
affinity group metrics of trust what
data do we really trust weaves into
helping to create a platform that brings
in more and more data that either is or
isn't trusted in use so there's a little
metadata characteristic about that the
answer specifically I think many
industries are refocused on how do we
report out our grain or are you know
supply chain footprint or all these
things with external validation we're
going to see not because we want to see
but because it's a new market will see
dynamics to the carbon offset markets
and whether how much we trust all that
and and so this will evolve and I think
the more transparency we can have the
consumer pushing for the better the data
is going to get there's a lot of data
out there there's also
services you know that Nielsen and
others who package data for the obverse
of what I'm talking about so they're
aiming their metrics are looking at us
as consumers not giving us ways to to
look at what we're buying responsible
yes ma'am so uh well I'm gonna go push
mode I'm there maybe pass me or palo
alto um and you know I've heard parts of
this talk earlier but oh my i absolutely
believe you're you're definitely going
in the right direction break um and you
know I know googles mission is kind of
organizing information and data and you
know from my point of view from the city
you know everything from like is it
there's zero way school you know that
you know how do you mean I mean it's
basically any chair that you sit on I
mean how do we know which where this
material comes from like I mean ideally
there'd be a bar you know barcode on
every material just to say where it came
from you know how to recycle it right
you know and etc and so I maps you work
we're moving towards this place where
everything is going to have these multi
multiple layers data yeah and question
is how well and how to pay fertile mayor
because if the consumers demand it
paying for it is easy if the consumers
see it as a bird cost it's not as easy
and and so you know I know what you've
done in Palo Alto in terms of recycling
I mean just amazingly difficult to get
people to to figure out for instance
food waste and how to deal with food
royston and we've had lots of dialogue
around you know greening houses and
environmental footprints for houses
these houses get assembled in purchases
per day and if you are if you buy from a
renovation or right or if you buy a
house how do you rate the house you know
there will be an RFID tag that I'm sure
the remax realtor will be pleased to a
fix once they find a profit motive for
doing some really and a dry bike you
know you won't be so hard because
consumers will want it because a lender
will say if you buy a house that by the
way it's located on a mass transit route
we will give you a better rate on your
loan then if you don't have the option
to use nest transit and therefore have a
higher energy program yeah of course in
our NRDC's David Goldstein he's the one
who did who started that locate location
efficient mortgage oh um yes uh-huh
right and so that's definitely what
along what you're thinking about
absolutely soon whether it's a big
purchase or a tiny purchase I think
we're we can go there so um I guess one
question is you know one thing that's I
know that's becoming a big success is
the web-based loans yeah you can
possibly Kiba right so are you kind of
keeping an eye on that can't build on
that so you can have kind of direct
bidding on certain I I think so I mean I
just as a lawyer I think if you're going
to be in the lending business you should
just be a bank and it's hard it I don't
know that yet it has to be this
intermediate I hear that yeah you know I
feel passionately that the microfinance
movement is strong that should be free
and open but at the skill dollars that
I'm talking about it's you know you're
not a big deal on it five hundred
dollars you're not at a thousand dollars
you're that much higher multiples and
and you probably just need to be a
banquet I love the means meter to work
with Kiva or you know any of these
groups yes do I think that the bank in
ethical bank can bundle the cash back
rewards of its consumers and if the
consumers decide to send it that way and
send it out to a Kiva and say go lend
this is your cashback word it's in your
monthly statement but instead of keeping
the money and spending it on a silly
little catalog item
you know another bows excuse me both
item you can actually send it over to
kiva and start spending it there it's
just money and so I think an ethical
banking can do a lot to work with those
services but you do need a bank in the
first instance to do a lot of this hi
Lila hi Bruce as I mentioned a few days
ago i'm starting an auction site for
responsible outsourcing and one of the
biggest problems that we've faced is
getting good data on what our vendors
are doing as far as their labor
practices yeah and these hundred and
sixty thousand rating systems that you
mentioned a lot of them are kind of meta
and that they ask us companies to report
on their supply chains and then audit
maybe five percent of them and I assume
that the auditing processes they use are
not as robust as we'd like them to be
right right so my question to you is are
you thinking about how to handle this
auditing process so I'm planning to
enter that game at all or do you think
that there are really good companies
that are being formed to do that well a
little bit of all that I confess on the
son of an accountant so my father would
be pleased to know that I would think
about the accounting systems that that
operate use a standard called XBRL
extensible business reporting language
and I've talked about spatially relating
XBRL so that you take the typical
fortune 1000 balance sheet and and you
see in terms of cost you see labor
imagine clicking on that cell and seeing
a map of the world and seeing where the
labor was and drilling into well we know
they bought their labor from a certain
spot on the face of the planet we can
with NASA help and Google Earth you know
machinery look down and say well that's
actually accessible that's not a good
place for people to work it's not safe
or
have from transparency international
some corruption indices that we don't
like suddenly you you have a framework
in which to use live accounting data not
survey spooned out data you're actually
in the innards of an ethical company
looking at the same data their CFO is
using and using that to in real time
tell the company as well as its
consumers that it's acting ethically why
does the company 10 yes they don't want
to be suit yes they don't want two
Perrier you know problem of rebranding
efforts might find something toxic and
on and on and on plus they really want
market share there's there's some data
that says they will get more market
share and more loyalty from the green
consumer than trying to hide and make
believe this a walk go away so I think
if we deal and provide incentives the
deal in the actual corporate data that
will be farther along in the social
capital markets then relying on these
sort of cottage industries of rating
services that went to the 160,000 but we
can use 160,000 to I just don't think
it's enough
we're about to run out of time I've got
lunch tables set up for people who'd
like to join us and I just like to ask
Bruce one more question sure it seems
like this is really bringing together a
whole bunch of data and automation in
order to make something work a lot
better there's little bits and pieces of
this that you see that are out there
already but they're not tied together or
they only work in a tiny area yeah
Google is very much a data-driven
company ran I would ask you what is the
simplest experiment that Google could do
that would generate data that would
support this I wouldn't call quite a
hypothesis because it's pretty obvious
it works but okay what could generate
some data that could really show that
it's worth pushing on this Ross I think
the food and beverage vertical is live I
think these consumer electronics
vertical is live for looking at if you
coupled the existing data I mean I
showed you the industry's laptop thing I
mean that did it says and it's updated
monthly I think what do the companies
that register their data through EPA and
EP how do they perform in these other
metrics that would be a tiny real-world
example that we could do this afternoon
I think food and beverage is important
because we all are buying food every few
days and so connecting the pattern of
social awareness to eating like an
Omnivore's Dilemma thing with Michael
Pollan is a good thing to do and it will
drive demand for other services so
that's one of them I'm working on right
now and the food and beverage industry
is the grocer's associations they're
getting very active in this supply chain
transparency stuff okay great well I'd
like to thank Bruce and we'll be having
lunch after it thank you all for coming
