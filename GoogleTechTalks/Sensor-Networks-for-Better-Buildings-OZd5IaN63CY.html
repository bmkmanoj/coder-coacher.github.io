camera is I don't know
is somebody there so I'm gonna be
talking today about you know at the at
the Media Lab the work I was doing just
to give you a historical perspective was
smart spaces trying to understand people
in spaces usually with cameras sometimes
with microphones and this work in some
ways carries that on in just opening the
boundaries up and trying to think about
building scale projects so how do people
use buildings how do they move around in
buildings what are the patterns what we
learn from those patterns we can we do
with them and since it's really from
personal experience is really difficult
to build camera networks to cover an
entire building is just an engineering
nightmare and it's not terribly good
from sort of a privacy perspective
people don't like to live under
ubiquitous cameras so we moved to sort
of sensor networks and so I'll explain
what that means some sort out which is
kind of a buzz word these days but I
have a particular kind of network of
Mines and I'll talk about that this is a
that this talk is actually going to be
about a sort of the umbrella project
there's a lot of little sub-projects but
that's why there's so many names here is
a lot of people a lot of smart people
contributing to the work that i'm going
to show many of them interns some
outside people like Carson is at
University of Tokyo and then many people
at wirral URI is doing a lot of the
analysis going to work in interface work
Darren and Jonathan are really helping
out on the hardware side of things so so
buildings so buildings are dumb right
now most of them it's a nice time to be
alive because buildings are starting to
become more interactive more aware but
currently they're pretty dumb so the
question is how do we make them smarter
and I'm just going to start up with a
really sort of warm up example so when
we renovated a space a couple years ago
at merle the building codes required us
to put in these little sensors and this
is just a motion sensor and the only
purpose of motion sensor is to turn the
lights off when you're not there so it's
an energy-saving thing it's not mandated
by building codes at least where we are
and within a week or two everybody had
them disabled they
male the one around told you how to
climb up and tweak little knob so they
would basically stop doing what they did
and that's because they were incredibly
annoying and so the question is why why
are they annoying you know that
everybody knows why if you happen to
have been in a building where there's a
motion activated light in the bathroom
or whatever everybody knows that's doing
so so what happens is you have one
sensor in the office and you get some
readings over time and then the reading
stopped and now the system has to make a
decision system has decided well you
know are they there or not so I have the
light on maybe I leave the line on for a
while waiting for them to move again
then I turn it off that's what I'm so
studios let's turn the light off and so
you know i was sitting i'm talking on
the phone or i was reading sitting still
light goes off waving my hands you know
it's really annoying so that's why
everybody disabled them so the core
message i think in this talk is this
problem and so the question is if we
have if we just had two sensors if we
had a sensor in the office and a sensor
out in the hallway for example then you
see this kind of trace we see motion in
the office and then this motion stops
and you see motions start out in the
hallway then you can start doing some
real reasoning and say well you know I'm
pretty sure I just saw the guy leave
right because the if you leave some
place you have to move so I should be
looking for that motion I should be
understanding it and similarly you know
if I see motion in the office if I never
see you outside the hallway then you
must not have left and so I should leave
the light on that's really simple and
that's sort of the simplest version or
what I'm gonna be talking about but
that's the gist of it that's if he one
takeaway message that's the idea so the
context it's basically about context so
why am I doing this so I work for
mitsubishi electric research
laboratories and Mitsubishi Electric
makes first order anything that has
electricity in it so there's a lot of
opportunities try to connect where these
are all things we're thinking about I
mean there's a lot of groups thinking
about eldercare Georgia Tech and CMU and
people at MIT in the home essentially
some people thinking about nursing homes
and we're thinking about that too but
there's also a sort of a security
business that we're involved in there's
we make basically everything that all
building infrastructure heating lighting
security access control things like that
so there's all sorts of systems that
could leverage better context if they
can understand how people were using the
buildings they could be more efficient
more useful more reliable more
informative you know dependent this is
sort of a this is just my little laundry
list of you know what I'm force myself
to think about occasionally to make sure
that I'm connecting to motivate the work
and make sure it's going in a direction
that makes sense so since we're number
so i told you i promise you to talk
about what I mean what hi meds about a
sensor network so the there are a whole
lot of smart people thinking about the
network part of sensor networks how do
you do distributed algorithms how do you
load balance how do you measure network
in a way that's energy efficient all
this stuff I'm not thinking about that
there are lots of smart people thinking
about them I'm really thinking about the
sensor side what do you do if you have a
sensor that's the size of the building
what does that feel like how do you use
it and so that the network part really
for me is just about getting the data
back to some place where I can touch it
and look at it so it's really about the
sensors so the sensors we have in the
building right now we sort of done a
phase deployment and we started with
these this very smart fellow the men
well who i think i'm not sure if he has
a job now or not I think he's looking
for a job so you might want to look at
him he worked with a house n project
Stephen and Tilly those people who know
as part of that project as well and so
this is a system based on the mites
ports this is the might it's a radio
processor board that they use in their
projects and he was an internet Merle
couple summers ago and he helped us put
together this motion might so its
emotions own off-the-shelf motion
sensors same motion sensor you'd find in
any motion activated light or appliance
he'd buys these are really cheap
reliable well understood things and we
hooked it up to the their boards that
get wireless communication and we
installed a whole lot of them so
marilla's but now covered with with
sensors
I say second implementation because a
lot of this work is informed by a small
camera network that we put up and
collected data from so roughly 20
cameras in a small part of the building
but this was the real target having a
some sort of low-cost easily installable
system and the next generation of stuff
we're thinking about in the next
generation of installations is this sort
of board that we daren't a Jonathan
Admiral designed which is a 80 to 15 for
so use a standard radio a
standards-based Mac it does no reliable
communication it can do all these
wonderful things that Jonathan has
managed to make a do and it runs out of
battery for a long time so for a
research prototype this is key we can we
can lower our installation costs to
nearly nothing they they come in a box
with a magnet we literally just stick
them up on the ceiling and then we just
let them go and they'll run for long
enough that we can do our experiments so
this is a little wonder of Technology
and the amazing thing about if you have
this is a very much a that's okay come
sit down if you guys are mostly software
people you might not be paying attention
i don't know but but this this device
you know you can order the parts send
them off to a prototype plays have a
couple hundred built for practically
nothing I mean it used to be head to
like make your own circuit boards by
etchingham and yes it's not the case
anymore so the cost on these things is
coming down you know surprisingly to me
anyway and you just need a person like
Jonathan here's what he's doing and then
they can make these things and it's a
lot of fun actually communication range
it's a 80 to 15 for is a 2.4 gigahertz
so it behaves somewhat like 802 11 be in
a sense of like what it penetrates you
get a sense for that and the range is
maybe not quite as much as ADA to them
be its lower power solar bandwidth
though it's only 256 kilobytes so you
know in a space like you could probably
since this is very open I bet you can
put a receiver in the middle and get the
whole room
but when you get into like walls you
have to worry about like plaster sort of
absorbs it so you have to worry about
the structure of the walls at merle I'll
show you a map in a second at merle we
have about I think seven of the
old-style receiver is covering about
3,000 square metres and these are
supposed to be a little bit better on
the range this also has like an this
chip right here is the radio chip it
also it implements the Mac it does AES
encryption it's like it's just crazy
this whole thing draws the reason we get
three years because this whole thing
while it's sensing draws about 50 micro
amps so that's running the sensor doing
some signal processing on the
microprocessor and sleeping and then
when it wakes up it wakes the radio up
for a couple milliseconds sends a packet
goes back to sleep so so the duty cycle
is really low on the radio so why simple
sensors I'm going to occasionally box
out little TRS you can get these on the
amuro website they usually are other
publications but just to save space I
just mark out the TR so you can go get
them so why simple sensors so this is a
sort of a subversive aspect to this work
which is if you read the literature
about this kind of stuff typically what
you see people doing camera networks
because that's what they know a lot of
the people coming into this field like
me have a vision background those are
the sensors they know this is a desire
not to throw information away so you
collect as much information as possible
you reason about it get some nice
results fantastic and I certainly
started that way but what I realized was
that camera the price of camera is
dropping drastically and the willingness
to spend money on surveillance is
rocketing helped back drastically I'm
pretty soon these two things are going
to cross it's become perfectly
reasonable for some definition of
reasonable to slap cameras up everywhere
and you can certainly do some really
cool stuff that way the question is
whether you want to so the subversive
aspect of this work is to try to create
a knowledge base that says you can do a
lot of the things that you can justify
you know wanting to do like better
heating more efficient or whatever
better elevators even security
applications you can do by having a
dense network of really simple sensors
and a sport maybe a sparse network of
other kinds of sensors RFID aware and
and the idea is to economically undercut
that future of cameras everywhere so so
we did some we did some actually that's
sort of my hand away the explanation
Carson Reynolds is a fantastic writer
and a fantastic thinker about that
Nicole issues he worked with Rozlyn
Picard on affective computing so he was
thinking about the ethics of affective
computing this is this idea that your
computer is going to sense your
emotional state well it's the wrong word
but in a two second presentation i'll
use that one so you can imagine there
are some ethical issues there and Carson
did his doctoral work thinking about
those issues so i leveraged that work
and we we got him to help us think about
this work and so his tools called
dimensional meta ethics and I'll sort of
again sort of a undersell the work by
calling it sort of ethics and engineer
could love it's sort of sort of sort of
you take you know derivatives in ethical
space and think about how systems change
as the context changes and you do it in
a very sort of dimension my dimension
way so it was a nice way to think about
this and all sort of walk you through
this real quick but you know there's
basically what the slide says is that
there's economic reasons to use the
sensors but that's not it there's also
an ethical reason to think about using
these sensors and the M it comes down to
cameras basically provide a greater
potential for abuse you know if I'm
collecting video of you and I can index
into it then I can find video that has
nothing to do with my original intention
of installing the cameras but could be
damaging so the dimensional meta ethics
sort of framework is you come up with
dimensions along which the system might
change like what's the context who's
controlling the system you know what is
the system collecting for example motion
versus video say who's controlling it is
your boss or your your spouse or just
random people on the street you know who
has access to it those kinds of things
and so what typically happens in these
systems is engineers like us we think of
cool things to do we do them and we're
thinking of an ID you know ideal
environment you talk
where everybody's go in the same
direction thinking the same things and
cooperating and often you know things
like this well it doesn't make such a
big deal you know ok so we collected
video nobody's going to abuse it it's
okay fine but if you sort of if you sort
of shift over to dystopian world and
think about oh what's the worst possible
case say you know if you have cameras
you know that's actually sort of
submissive belen court and contains a
lot of other sorts of information that
wasn't really necessary that could be
damaging it's very hard to give people
feedback you know people do these papers
where they talk about showing people the
video from cameras but if you have 100
cameras you're not going to put up a
hundred monitors and does it really mean
anything you know so so I think what we
came down to we did we did a that the
this feedback and transparency issue was
sort of the central issue that it was
hard for people to understand you know
if you see a optical glass you know
there could be video being taken you
don't know where it's going because you
don't necessarily know the people
controlling the building you don't know
whether you should trust them if you see
you know so optical glass I guess but if
you see where's that picture if you see
this sort of dome you know the the
infrared motion sensors look through
this sort of fog plastic I think people
are savvy enough to know even you know
just everybody on the street every man
is savvy enough to know that that's not
a camera you can't see through that you
know we're used to seeing eyes and we
know what clear means we know it what
video is and so you can immediately know
that there's immediate feedback it says
you're I'm not gonna be able to tell
that you're picking your nose through
that device just not going to happen now
I can't tell but you're naked to that
device that's sort of that's why people
put these kinds of things in bathroom
before they want to have motion
activated lights on their bathrooms
because people know that you're not
going to see anything through that so
that's the that's the sort of immediate
feedback the sort of transparency that
we're looking for that people can feel
comfortable living under these k know
there's an upper bound on what they're
going to lose by being viewed this was a
survey we did on the web actually
welcome to 2006 whatever you know we
published it on craigslist and did a
web-based survey and so this is not
quite scientific but we got an
overwhelming preference what we were
asking people is well if we were going
to have this this kind of system that
would help you you know make your
workplace more efficient would you
rather it be cameras or motion detectors
well okay sort of looking under the
light post but we were trying to measure
here was whether the everyman was
sophisticated enough to understand this
difference and this is some indication
as a preliminary study that they are so
that's good so that's the why that's
sort of two ticks on the Y so let me
talk it just real quick about the how
how did we build it and this is again
this is research prototypes we're
working with the company to try to think
about what the real thing would look
like but this is what we came up with
for gathering data for research purposes
and I've never built anything like I'm a
software guy computer vision guys as
introduced I've never built anything on
the scale of you know 500 things so it
was a real treat for me to do this so
things were the boxes so you have to
think about this like what's enclosure
going to look like you know what kind of
oh my gosh 1125 re you have to think
about this a hard problem you're going
to drill holes in plastic that's really
expensive so you have to we actually
printed these hopefully I have the video
if you guys that don't have a rapid
prototyper haven't played it's a lot of
fun so it's a little thing it prints
plastic essentially and so we print
these things up and the section ends up
being cheaper than injection molding if
you're you know in the 500 range you
know you have to get up to like because
you have to make the mold you have to
get like thousands before injection
molding makes sense so we printed these
all and and then you have to get them
from the ceiling somehow so I should
learn how to use these stilts to put
them up so why so if you can imagine
moving a ladder and climbing up at five
hundred times that's why so this is what
they look like on the ceiling that's me
just installing it on this way
so this is what you get in fact let me
jump over to the live version of that No
so this is a just a little data viewer
when I'm at home I I just show the live
I show people walking around the space
but you get a movie and all demos are
better and fast forwards this is
obviously times ticking away very fast
here but what you're seeing is this is a
map of mer you know if you ever been
Demuro the elevators are here reception
Lobby kitchen some in our room I'm
giving a talk I haven't me going to talk
about this exact stuff people's offices
are around the outside so what you're
seeing is people walking around the
hallways in the lobbies and the meeting
rooms and stuff like that and what
happened now is it 1253 there was a fire
alarm so this is what evacuation looks
like people are flowing out of the
meeting room down the stairs and leaving
the building so this is the kind of
thing that I really wanted to get to
this is like peel off the roof of Merle
and what's down in it let's see where
everybody is it's a kind of view that's
very difficult to create from a camera
network unless you have very dense
cameras this is this is my boss doing a
sweep to make sure everybody's left the
building and then there's one person
gets left behind the bathroom there come
on you a second and then then it jumps
forward in time when we see people
coming the elevator going to the kitchen
and we see people come up the fire
stairs because they don't want to wait
for the elevator and you can sort of see
people reflow back into this thing so
this is this is exactly what I'm trying
to understand how do people use
buildings what are the patterns what can
we get so that gives you a sense of the
data so he jump out from this
okay so how do you use a system okay so
so then the question is well we got the
data we have been collecting data for
about 10 months and we got those sort of
phases so this from the 8th floor we
have about 10 months of data and so the
question is what how do you get stuff
out of that and at this point I may run
out of time actually I'm going to
there's two parts the sort of two takes
on this that we've as many takes on
those two takes that I'm attached to do
I'm trying to cut one of these out of
the talk like it's like killing puppies
like I just I can't do it so I'm going
to try to talk about both but I'm going
to talk about this one first and and
hopefully we'll get to that one there's
I guess there's a there's an hour and
then a break and then maybe another half
an hour so this stuff relates to the
really interesting demos I want to show
so I want to try to go through this a
very high level and then hopefully leave
time for talk about this and show the
demos well we'll definitely show the
demos hopefully I'll talk about this but
the two of the Schism is do I think
about things in a building way is a
really interested in thinking about the
building understanding itself or am I
really interested in people there's
different applications this kind of
stuff is for you know how do i tune the
heating system how do i predict
elevators you know things like that how
do i understand the structure of
behavior in the building and then this
one is really about people it's really
if I care about people because I'm doing
surveillance or security or I want to do
really careful census for disaster
recovery things like that then I have to
sort of think about things in this way
and and I'll explain what those mean
with those two things are so we're going
to start there so this was this is
actually work that I did with a man well
and we published it at this location
context awareness hopefully republish it
somewhere else but this is the current
publication and the idea is you know I
said I wasn't really thinking about the
distributed processing part so we tried
to make a nod to it here in the sense
that we're trying to find things that
are local so we can build local
detectors that only use local
information because in sensor networks
there's this idea that you want
information travel locally so you can
save on communication costs so you want
to aggregate information locally
abstract it and then only send a small
amount of information upstream because
that saves energy so although we're not
thinking about that very carefully we're
certainly thinking about it a little bit
in the way we're designing our
algorithms for the building and the
other reason to think about locality is
that hopefully you want to be able to
build relocatable things you know you
don't want to have to customize the
network to every building so every
building has you know junctions in the
hallways or corners or meeting rooms and
you want to be able to build models that
can be reused you know there shouldn't
be you know we're all people there
probably some differences in the way you
guys use hallways and I use always but I
bet they're really subtle you know
probably very similar meeting rooms
things like that so I should be able to
learn models here and pick them up and
put them over there and of course
there's domains you know picking up
models that I learning here and putting
them in an industrial setting maybe not
so good but but the the assertion is
that there's a small number of local
models that we want to learn so we build
this hierarchy and this is sort of
there's his work by Aaron Bob like a
number of years ago about gesture a hand
gesture and he was thinking about what
are the different kinds of models we
need to use what kind of information do
we get out of them how do we think about
gesture if I have a kind of gesture I
want to recognize can I go to some you
know a list and say well it's this kind
of gesture they probably need these
kinds of models and this is kind of
information processing so we're going to
try to do the same kind of thing so we
build this hierarchy and the movement
activity action comes from those words
come from Aaron but we're going to reuse
it the sort of building context so
motion is the bottom there's no context
it's just one sensor is their motion
under the sensor not a whole lot you can
get from that but this is going to be
you know our hardware sensors and then
as we go up we're going to get more
context we're going to get more spatial
context in the sense that we're going to
look at clusters of sensors and we're
going to add in other sorts of
information so for movement we're going
to think about no temporal information
we're going to build straight-up
detectors static detectors and obviously
we're looking at temporal sequences of
data but we're not going to model the
temporal sequences we're just going to
model the whether things are there or
not
and then as we move up we're going to
add in temporal structure so these are
more harder models to evaluate so things
like maybe Markov models but since we're
abstracted up we're going to have less
input data we're higher level data to
think about and the top is this sort of
activity action is the idea of having
the context you know you walking down
the hallway to a certain place is an
activity but going to get your mails and
is an action you need to know that
that's the mail room so it has special
meaning it has some link into the
context so this is a sort of hierarchy
we're going to try to break the work up
that way so the motion is but you know
we've implemented in hardware very
simple I've already talked about that so
yeah these numbers are all old actually
I should have take those so it's a
movement so movement so imagine this is
a little chunk of hallway so the measure
there's a crossing hallway and these are
five sensors one that covers the
intersection in some context so we came
up with we do basically its enumerated
all the possible things that can happen
in that kind of space so there can
either be no motion that could be there
can be someone loitering at the
intersection that could be someone
walking through the intersection maybe
someone turning corners in various ways
they could be people appearing and
disappearing assuming that you know
there's offices that aren't observed for
example so this is an indication of
somebody's like coming coming to a space
and disappearing into an office it's not
observed so this is sort of a set of
things that we can expect to see in
these kind of chunks of buildings and
we're going to try to learn those and so
we build a we gather data by hand and we
do a boosted I hope that wasn't 11 okay
we build a boosted set of detectors so
that we can detect these you know
literally they're going to be detectors
we're going to detect these events we're
going to take that that activity that
the sir motion at the intersection save
a hallway and abstract it into a higher
level label that's something like
someone walking through or somebody's
loitering or whatever
so we're going to reduce the
dimensionality and also have higher
level labels so so on all the and all
the results here i'm going to show this
maps this is a map of Merle of the
eighth floor so the elevators or it's
already so talked about I can't I get my
little cursor to come up anyway you can
read and this gray area is the part
that's actually observed by the sensors
what I'm going to show is you sort of
really abstract map it's like a sensor
map and so it's just going to be just a
sensor so kind of keep in mind where
things are just to reduce the clutter
essentially and then dark things are
going to generally be high probability
and light thing is going to be low
probability so this is showing a
particular probability distribution over
the space and so that one happens to be
turning so this is the probability of
seeing a turning event at a particular
location and this is really it's not
terribly meaningful accepted that just
to validate that you know we're not
seeing turning events where there aren't
possible and we do see them where they
are possible and where they're the only
option we see them all the time so
that's good makes us feel good about the
detectors that they're doing their job
for example but that's just to give you
a sense of what that display means so
similarly we can make a straight you
know walking straight detector and again
places where you can't walk straight you
don't see any probability and other
places this is actually normalized
differently this is normalized by the
maximum and the environment rather than
a per sensor so what this is really
showing you i like to say this is the
first example of a computer being a
smart as a building because carbon good
so this is a carpet where predictor you
know as you walk into a building hasn't
replaced the carpet in a while you see
where people walk you see that the high
high volume pathways are and that's
exactly what this map is this is showing
you where the high volume pathways so
people walk you know coming from the
kitchen there's coming from the kitchen
though walk this way which is
interesting because they could walk a
shorter path this way except that there
are secure doors on the way and they
don't like using their card so this is
an indication that people will avoid
secure doors in our space so just again
just to give you a sense of what those
maps mean so as we climb up the guy just
pointed at those
these are the security oars and there's
the coffee so researchers worked on here
typically in here and that's the golly
so you know I can show you maps all day
and you can say oh they're pretty maps
but it doesn't mean much so what we did
was we passed we presented people with
these kinds of maps and we asked them
questions like where do people stand
around in the space you know people at
merle are experts in the space they walk
around it every day they know how people
behave so we did a survey and we so
please mark up where you think people
stand and then we generated those
probabilities from data and nobody had
seen the generated maps so that's the
survey this is the map nobody had seen
these kinds of maps we hadn't done them
so we did the survey first and then we
looked for the data and so this is just
to show you just to give you a sense
that in fact it's sane disagreement so
people you know stand around and meeting
rooms you know call wood or whatever
this is actually a dead center that's
with white people stand around the
middling room the lobbies things like
that it's interesting to see that people
overestimate how much time people spend
standing outside of certain people's
offices they're certainly there on the
data and you can see it because you have
a mitsubishi projectors that's good most
projectors don't pick that up so so
there's some you know fundamental
agreement between the survey and our
real data results so let's climb up the
hierarchy a little bit so i still have
time so the next level i said we were
going to take these detectors and clump
them into temporal sequences so with so
these are models where the temporal
sequence is important it matters that
you do a certain thing in certain way so
the two things we're going to look at in
this talk our visits and meetings so we
define a visit as someone coming up to a
space stopping loitering and then
leaving so each of those comma-separated
things is a as a as a movement
lower-level thing so these are these are
detected symbols that represent some
collection of sensor readings and then
similarly a meeting is going to be
either people xing or entering a space
over time so maybe over five minutes you
know how meetings happen as scheduled
for ten people show up maybe one person
shows up minute next minute couple
minutes later whatever people
aggregating so this is something where
it's important that a sequence of thing
is happens within a certain window of
time
certain way so let's look at those so
this is again the survey is on the right
and the meeting is on the left and so
this is a this is detecting meetings
finding places where meetings happen in
the space and you see some different
disagreement there's a sort of
interesting disagreement about the
kitchen so so the survey participants
were generally unwilling to call the
things that happened in the kitchen
meetings but the the system certainly
thinks their meetings and in fact it it
will see a difference the next slide 21
/ 10 potential error is that elevators
look like meetings and you can see what
that is with the relatively simple model
people are aggregating there and leaving
there so it looks like a meeting place
but you see it looks less like a meeting
place then the meeting rooms are just
good so this is where the disagreement
comes between the survey participants so
now you ask where do people visit so
where do i go and dwell for a short
period of time and leave we didn't
really we we basically wrote we wrote
down Markov models to say i want to see
these kinds of symbols in this order go
yeah i defined yet exactly so but the
argument is that for portability i'm
basically writing down sentences I'm
saying in a sense I'm saying a meetings
are where people enter enter enter enter
go look for that and so it's it's good
that it worked because that means i can
go to a new building and come up with
new sentences at a very high level but
you're right typically train these
models and so we have to add we tried to
do that and and what's that's trained
yes we literally put up cameras and
annotated data the reason we didn't
annotate the meetings for example is
even though you feel like you're having
meetings all the time they're rare
enough that it was a real pain to go get
the data and find it and label it
they're just not enough examples and it
turned out that it worked to just write
down the sentence so we just presuppose
the you know the transition
probabilities to be some you know
uniform thing and that works okay so
anyway this is where the visit thing so
people people reported that they were
visiting the mail room in the kitchen
and then certain people certain people's
offices and certainly they do that but
the system really wanted to see the
kitchen is a meeting it really refused
to recognize it as a visit and maybe
this is a case where there's some
subtleties between those models where if
we actually learn
from data we could pick that apart or
maybe we need a more complicated notion
of a meeting we remember these aren't
actions these are not contextualized it
doesn't know that that's a kitchen so
perhaps there's special models for
kitchens so the visit thing so the
action so this is good okay so so this
is the very simplest action so this is
just to get to the top of the pyramid I
think there's a lot more work here but
I'm going to show one simple thing and
that is that and again this was
something that we could get ground truth
for so when we send documents to a
printer there's a log that's created so
we know exactly when that happened and
then particularly you know people
sometimes go pick up their printouts
presumably if they're printing something
so what we did we said this system
here's a sequence these I got a graphic
for that so here here's the probability
of seeing a visit event in the space
based on in space right and so most
people every day everybody goes in the
middle room so that's a highly visited
space and mer so what we're going to do
is we have you know what we see here is
a each of these little boxes we have a
temporal sequence of visits you know in
particular time there was a visit and
there was a sequence of in time but what
we have is this other sequence right so
we have 155 sequences of visits and then
we have this one sequence of a
particular printers print queue log and
what we want to do is find the
conditional probability that this place
was visited some time after this job was
sent that's all we told the system we
said look for a you know 10-minute
window or something go and what you get
is a very different so this is just a
just to go back this is the probability
of seeing a visit this is the
conditional probability of seeing a
visit conditioned on the print queue and
so what you see here is that you get
this huge peak coming out where the true
location of the printer is which is that
circle and you can see that before in
the in the sort of joint probability of
the just like probability you see that
that space is a visited space but not a
highly visited space it only happens
sometimes certainly much less in the
mailroom much less than the meeting
rooms but when we condition we get a
much different
answer and this it's hard to tell with a
gamma but that peak is much much higher
than every other peak in the plot and
actually the other Peaks make complete
sense so what do you do after you pick
up a printout well you go to the fax
machine you go to the meeting rooms you
go to certain people's offices that's
what these secondary Peaks are and we
didn't tell it to pick the first visit
so it's happy to pick other ones so this
is the kind of stuff so what what this
says to me and what I was very excited
when this happened we can do it with
other printers obviously what this has
to me is that that the pyramid is is
working to at least some degree all the
little pieces you know we've taken the
motion activations we've turned them
into movements we've recognized them as
activities and now we're contextualize
in them into actions and that whole
pyramid has to work at least somewhat to
get this result this is a sort of
validation that that whole structure is
working to me I was very excited to see
this on the other hand finding printers
a little silly you know where they are
but but again just to remind you this is
we have ground truth for this so we can
get it so this is a we're closing that
loop we're doing real real experiment
here and validating this result yeah
that's right so so given the sequence we
have a temporal sequence of not just
someone but but many people I think
there were maybe a hundred events 100
print queue events and so for each of
those events index is in the time and we
look to see if there's a visit at that
place nearby so we're doing sort of a
sloppy sort of correlation we're trying
to find things that may have a window to
offset but we're trying to find
correlations in co-occurrences that's
right yeah there's no so the next thing
we show you is about how do I show that
a person went from here to there this
has that's a very good point thank you i
usually make that point this is this
part of the system has no idea where you
were where you came from all it's
looking for is that particular location
a visit and it doesn't know that it's
you know if i print it you could go pick
it up that's okay it'll count that as a
hit you could you could think about
reversing this whole this equation and
look for you know when i send a job
where do I appear in the space i could
try to find people's offices and we
thought about doing that we haven't done
it there is that history question and
then there was a question it says
something we thought of at the time when
we did this we didn't have enough data
and now we do we just haven't gone back
to do the experiment because we were
doing the other stuff which I'll talk
about in a second another printer right
so here's the other stuff so how are we
doing on thunder doing okay good all
right I feel like I'm talking super fast
but for the people at home you can watch
the video and probably slow it down so
now it'll be good okay so people
centered models so that was very space
tender just like we just said the system
isn't thinking about tracking people in
the space at all it's only looking at
these very localized detectors and
trying to build stories about them in
this case we're building stories about
the people about where could the person
possibly have gone and this part of the
work really feeds back into this sort of
privacy question which is you know if
I'm going to claim that that these
sensors are better than cameras I have
to do two things I have to prove that
they're useful enough to actually
supplant the cameras I also have to push
the boundaries hard as possible so i can
say no this really is the upper bound i
believe this to be an upper bound
privacy loss and so this will eventually
end in the scary demo which shows you
sort of our furthest push out into like
how invasive can it be so so before we
were talking about the the activations
of the sensors and we're building
detectors on them now what we're going
to do is look at spatial temporal
sequences of activations we're going to
say when people walk through the space
they create this structure a chain in
the data and because our sensors are
dense it's relatively easy to do that
chaining unlike a camera if you have a
camera here and a camera you know 50
meters away a lot could have happened
and I have to hypothesize all that I
could have gone this way I could have
gone that way there could be someone
with a similar shirt gets messy oh these
sensors they're only a couple meters
apart so if I see an actus chain of
activations I can be pretty sure that
those chain of activations were caused
by the same motivator the same person
the same car whatever it is so what
we're going to do is we say if we see
these chains we're going to pull them
out into something called track 'let
we're going to associate them as a thing
as an object in the database this is all
database driven when I show you the demo
there's a my poor laptop running mysql
with all these all these chained things
in it it still works and then we're
going to go further we're going to say
well if I at the beginning of a chain if
there's no explanation for that first
activation that person must have entered
the space from someone observes part of
the space so we're going to call that a
beginning and furthermore if they if
there's an end of the chain which has no
this doesn't explain anything that we're
to call that an end we're going to put
an end on it and then what we're going
to do is we're going to reason in this
space we're going to totally ignore the
observations we're going to think about
these structures so now it's just a
different cut on the data we're trying
to abstract again do dimensionality
reduction and abstract out some
high-level description of the data that
we can reason about quickly so of course
that's you know this is a this is the
ideal somebody walks out doesn't get
near anybody else
and go somewhere else and we know
exactly where they went but of course
the problem of these sensors is there
they don't give you very much
information again if two people cross
paths I can't tell it i'm wearing you
know green you're wearing blue I don't
have a camera so what we do is we put
these joins and splits we say this is
very much you know classic tracking both
of these observations explain this one
so we're going to link those together
and do join and we're just going to take
that ambiguity and stuff into the
database or not going to try to resolve
it we're going to keep it around and
similarly if we see a place where to
track looks can be explained by the same
track we're going to call that a split
so this would explain for example if
someone comes out of a and someone comes
out of B they meet up in the hallway
they walk for a while and then they go
two separate ways that's what it looks
like in a graph so this is the sort of
the next most complicated graph and we
don't know we don't really have any way
of knowing that a went to Z or a went to
why it's ambiguous we can't tell so yeah
I should have been clicking those so in
the demo I'm going to show you just to
start getting you warmed up because the
display is if you don't understand it
you have been introduced you can be a
little busy so I want to give you pieces
at a time so this is a piano roll of
data so there's sensors this way up and
down and time this way and whenever a
sensor activates it drops a little blue
dot so you see these these structures
right these are people walking down
hallways and so when we overlay the
track coats on top of them this is what
we get so what you see here is that
here's here's a start where's my pointer
pointer anyway the little red triangles
the start and the the little white box
is an end and then these are the
ambiguous reasons even though you can't
tell it from he on a roll these are
probably spatially nearby each other
because we have to unroll to d into one
d so there's places where we break the
loops so this must be this is a case
where these two pads we're near each
other and you can see there's a lot more
complexity than what I had on the screen
because it was trying to record every
possible ambiguity so it gets a little
messier than I the my nice plot and you
can have arbitrary grabs where people
you know we can do reasoning about you
know
could not possibly have gone to WRX
because this is a directed thing and you
know these graphs can be arbitrarily
complicated and in fact as the
population of space goes up they become
arbitrarily extended because they just
keep going so one of the scary demo the
sort of surveillance demo is we we
decided to try to build a system where a
person could interactively disambiguate
this graph and say using their knowledge
of the space their knowledge of people
perhaps other sensory modalities that
they have access to they can
disambiguate and pick out a particular
graph and help the system to say well i
know that a went to y and so the demo
I'm going to show is sort of a graph
explore it looks like this so again this
is the piano roll the track that's on it
the red path is the current sort of the
current explored part of the graphic
current sub graph that the person is
interactively exploring and you can see
you know again we have the little
components the ambiguities that begins
the ends and the tracklist and then at
every instant the person's job is to
disambiguate these kinds of situations
in order to help them do that we we have
sort of a cut on the graph so this shows
your current temporal slice on the graph
and you have things that you've chosen
and then things that you have yet to
decide between accompanied by in this
case video evidence and we also give
sort of a spatial view on that so the
the red path comes up here and then
there's an ambiguity either the person
goes left or right the person has to
disambiguate that so the way you think
about this is one way to think about
this is that these sensors provide
contextual information that's ambiguous
and that can you can use that to improve
a number of systems heating systems
whatever in this case we're improving a
camera system so we have a limited
number of cameras in the space we're
going to try to use the contextual
information to make the cameras more
powerful
and then the output of this you know
well this is the video evidence the
output of this process then is a
collection of video evidence and a track
of the person through the space so yeah
this is somewhere so let's jump to the
demo let's see here this takes a little
bit to start up my poor laptop is so
what unhappy about being made to do this
so as a bunch of there's actually a
bunch of really interesting demos I'm
going to try to get in before the end I
want to get in this one and then I'll go
back if people are interested and i'll
do some of the other demos so you're
going to see exactly that display i just
sort of walked through and what I'm
going to be able to do is make
selections on the space and I'm going to
be able to search on in this track let
space and they'll say show me where
track started at this particular
location for example and get all those
pull out all those graphs and then I'm
going to be a little walk a graph and
show you what's going on so if it I've
practiced this demo because I've a lived
in my time also the other reason I
practices demo is because it's
impossible to say to people well we just
recorded a bunch of data we're just
going to show it to everybody they don't
like that so what we did is we found
instructive examples and then we went to
those people and said can we please show
this particular video and they kindly
agreed so that's those the video you're
going to get to see what this poor
laptop is trying to do is it's running
mysql this demo is going to come up it's
pulling a bunch of data from mysql to
build the interface and then when I as I
work on it it's going to be making SQL
queries into mysql oh my poor laptop so
if you ever have the advantage of seeing
this demo like on a real computer runs
much faster and there should be any
second there we go okay oh that's just
because I touched it
so one of the cool things behind the
scenes I was keep talking is a the way
that we format these SQL queries this
was a one of the things that one of the
many things that you re contributed to
this project was he really figured out
how to craft these SQL queries that they
were efficient and so that they returned
ordered list so you could admit errors
and things it's very cool I don't know
why I start your show started by now
full power oh dear
so let's go to a few seconds maybe no
color so the there we go okay so the
first so again you see this sort of
layout of the space with the sensors
going off and now we have these cameras
so we have several cameras there we go
we have several cameras scattered
throughout the space but not really
dense enough to give you a feeling for
you know what's happening the entire
space so that's where you get this you
see people walking down hallways instant
so what I'm going to do I'm going to
pull out a particular person's office
i'm going to say i'm going to say show
me tracks that start at that office and
there they are so just do a little query
and pulled them out and i can look at
just that list of hits take that one and
then this is the graph these are all the
graphs and if i zoom in we start to see
the actual graphs like a like there's a
beginning is a deterministic graph
here's the beginning of my hit this is
the one that I just queried and there it
is so this is the first track 'let so
the person comes out of their office and
walk this way and then passes in front
of some cameras that's what the white
boxes mean means there's a video
evidence of that part of the track then
they continue on to this part of the
space and they get lost so let's explore
that i'm going to say explorer i'm going
to select that track and then there's it
shows me the video evidence here's the
person zoom out a little bit so there's
the person right wearing blue so
remember that and then there's a couple
different pieces of video evidence she
walks through that space there and then
we get to this area here and the system
has gotten confused or some sort of
ambiguity than that has happened it's
given me an orange option and blue
option and in this case it's relatively
trivial they're actually you know really
should have probably been part of the
same track so I pick blue and now we get
to something more interesting so this is
a case where there's a split so two
people cross paths so what we can do is
we look at the video evidence it's
showing us a different
we say oh ok so this track is the person
in the white shirt going to the right so
it must have been the other one which
was the person the blue shirt going to
the left there she goes and then we get
there she is again so we can some I'm
going through this little too fast but
but basically what I'm doing is I'm
walking this graph at every at every
ambiguity I get a choice and I get
presented whatever evidence there is and
I could just be the way people are
moving on the map in this case there's a
lot of cameras in this particular space
so I get lots of video evidence in fact
there she is right there and I can pick
her though she is and what that and then
I say I'm done so i walked the graph and
now i can look at for example i can zoom
back out and i can see this whole
behavior so i can wipe over it she comes
out of her office stops at the printer
walks up this way through there comes
around there and there she is so
everything before this point you would
never have gotten with the cameras you
wouldn't have known that she stopped at
the printer you wouldn't know where she
came from and we can you know we can
just walk through all the video evidence
so this is very much this is aimed at
being a forensics security tool says you
don't really have to put cameras
everywhere you can put a few cameras at
choke points and then i can give you the
in-between information you don't have to
guess we'll have observations to tell
you exactly what happened and so this is
this is an example of that and many
thanks to Kathy for allowing us to show
that in public to everyone so I'll jump
back into this because other cool
examples but it's now noon so let me
just quick go back here and just wrap up
for the people at home okay so they sign
off go away so just it i mean just say
what i said are ready five times the
idea is to create an awareness of what's
going on a building in a way that's you
know economical both in terms of money
and installation costs but also in terms
of sort of privacy costs to human costs
so there's a there's a social sort of
pressure to make buildings more
efficient or more useful or safer but
there's also a human cost their human
desire to have
see and still want to live in the
buildings and so this is a future we're
trying to create and it projects into
lots of the things the Mitsubishi
Electric is building lights cameras
access control heating elevators all the
stuff so so why don't we I guess maybe
that's the thing to do is to end there
and maybe take questions and maybe do
some more demos that people are still
interested in here yeah so are there
more questions
oh I supposed to repeat the questions I
told a simple question I think the
motion sensor is very good for privacy
because as very limited information
exposed in the meantime this limits its
capability of construction kinds of
constructing rich context that you may
want to construct interesting
applications so do you have any comments
about the capability of the motions and
system that you can consider so that's
exactly the put the trade-off that we're
trying to figure out how exactly it
balances so so the question is if you
have sort of just will say just to file
a loaded word but you know applications
you can justify like making the
elevators better or making the heating
bill heating in the building more
efficient or improving the way that you
interact with your co-workers to make a
more a more rich space things like that
can you accomplish those with these
kinds of sensors that's the question
then you certainly can accomplish those
things with cameras so so there's some
point at which you have to have enough
information is sort of a frontier we
have to get above that threshold in
order to do certain applications and the
question is where where do sensor
networks where these kinds of sensor
networks fit today are they below that
threshold above it cameras are certainly
way above it you know and so that's the
question we're ahead we're trying to
answer and we're actively mrs. active
research we're trying to push all those
boundaries to figure out how far can we
push them what can you get what kind of
applications does this enable and I
think there's clear evidence already
that if you're trying to predict
elevator load I think you can easily do
with these kinds of things if you're
trying to tell if you're trying to
extract sort of maybe social networks in
the space that are I think there's a
specter of those you know if I want to
know who do you talk with in the hallway
I can try to get that inter inter
indirectly through the graphs by saying
well I know you tend to interact this
high probability that you leave your
office the same time as someone else and
you tend to have ambiguous interactions
in the hallways with them or I get a
cameras and I could see you and
and I could record that event right and
so almost certainly you'll get a better
better data from that kind of thing the
question is it can you get enough data
to do what you want with the other kind
of sensor now that's where we're trying
to answer so I don't have answers if you
can go down a laundry list and say I
want to do XYZ you know I don't have
answers to all of those because we're
still working on it but that's the
answer that's exactly the question I'm
trying to get to yeah yes your last
movie kind of suggests that there's some
space for incorporating some fryers or
some information about the way that
people move in a building for instance
right people don't take unnecessarily
convoluted paths between one person's
office and another so it I'm sorry if
you had any thoughts on either
incorporating some heuristic or training
up some models like that right so some
of the older work I didn't there's a
backward and forward looking answers to
that backward we've already done some
work which I didn't talk about today x
just too much which was using the sort
of less structured approach you know
treating the sensors is basically a bag
of observations and trying to find
connections and that was really
motivated by trying to predict for
example elevator load so knowing that
someone was going to go to the elevator
and understanding what it what the
what's the first part of the sentence
that ends push the elevator button right
and so that's sort of a version of your
ear question and we've done some work on
that um the forward-looking part is well
we could probably do a better job if we
use some of these structures and we
haven't yet gotten to that with sort of
future work so we're we sort of touched
on it but I think there's a better
answer in the future if we come back to
it yeah so the I can try to me try
whelmed answering questions I tried this
yesterday and I didn't have enough focus
but I'll try again there's a more a much
longer version of this which is kind of
fun to do so keep asking questions and
I'll try to get there you have questions
let's see so it's poor guy so we're
going to follow this poor guy so we're
going to explore that you select that
okay so there he is he's got this is a
billiards unas star of stage and screen
he's got a white shirt black pants in
ponytail so pay attention to that and so
he starts out a very similar to track
heading up into this space we've got an
ambiguity here again it's sort of a
trivial one well I know I actually this
was some interesting what's either turns
around goes back or he continues on so
we could explore each of those I happen
to know he continues on from the
interest of time she could do that and
so for example here's an interesting
case where the dense sensors really win
so he comes around the corner and
disappears from the camera view you
can't as far as the cameras concerned
he's gone but because we have done
sensors we know he's still there in fact
somebody crosses his path and then he
comes back into view very slightly and
he'd have a really hard time trying to
recognize that as bill unless you knew
but the motion sensors even though they
can't see his ponytail or whatever they
know it's him because they didn't seem
like if they knew he was there and so
they got him there he is and he talks
for a while and then let's see it's keep
going but to ask the system to Rick it
going okay so let's see if I can do this
right
okay so you might be heads away from
this area and then he ends up I believe
here we lose them again so look into the
future and they think there he is going
back okay so so he now I've got it in
the computer oh when I play it show it
to you so we've got this whole
interaction it starts at ten fifty one
and it ends at 152 that can't be right
okay starts 1046 ends at ten fifty
something so it's you know a big chunk
of time and basically we get all the
video evidence so what he does he leaves
his office he goes to talk to one of the
administrators for a while for a few
minutes and then he he disappears into
this horrible ambiguity which is the
kitchen right it's a horrible ambiguity
because it's there's many people come
and go from there but if he goes to the
kitchen he has to leave the kitchen at
some point and it just so happened that
in this case it was relatively easy for
me to find that leaving and we don't
know it's him until except that it
happened that track goes back to his
office we have some reason to believe
it's him and then he then he walks in
front of a camera so there he is that's
the video evidence that in fact we got
him so this is his entire like like
coffee break basically so he comes out
of here and goes up and gets coffee and
goes back so that seems like that's
pushing the boundary pretty high right
like we can make these stories with just
a few cameras and a bunch of summer
sensors we can make these stories that
have pretty detailed descriptions of
what people do during the day so that's
an indication that this boundary is
pretty high on the other hand we don't
know that he you know did anything
embarrassing while he was walking down
the hallway so that's that pushes the
boundary down so that's that's this
trade-off that's sort of a that's the
scary demo so
okay for those of who for those of you
who can join us for lunch please feel
welcome and what's so give a final
thanks to our speaker</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
