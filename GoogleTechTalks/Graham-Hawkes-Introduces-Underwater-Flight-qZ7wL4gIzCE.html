we're really happy today to welcome
Graham Hawks whose uh he's been working
on this wing submersible for the last 15
years and about 35 years of other kinds
of manned and remotely controlled
submersibles before that founded a bunch
of companies in this business and
basically produced all of the deep
diving submersibles that people have
used to explore the world's oceans and I
think this is a incredibly interesting
and exciting opportunity for for Google
to get involved in these kinds of things
maybe take some pictures or something
Graham tell us how it works well thank
you I just met a guy he's got how long
is that thing 19 meter concrete
submarine that's the first is anyone
else here involved with Google ocean or
ocean connect yourself or is this just
all general just ocean connected stuff
okay well like we've all been to too
many talks where where the subject is
going to see the planet and it's all
incredibly important I'm going to try
not to go there okay i think the common
theme in engineering and exploration is
that people do it for passion and get a
big kick out of it so part of what we're
doing is we're going to show you is the
birth of underwater flight but before we
go there you're just going to have to
bear with me a little bit because
perhaps it is important so just a couple
of statistics and i don't want to turn
on anybody's toes but earth is a really
stupid name for this planet
it turns out ninety-four percent of life
on this planet is aquatic we all know
two-thirds of the planet is ocean but
that's misleading because it's a
three-dimensional place where the
average depth is four miles I don't have
deep your subs how deep is just operate
it turn admit it so you're near surface
so average depth of four miles and you
compare that to the terrestrial habitat
which is really a thin film so it turns
out that there's a habitat if you want
to weigh one to the other this planet we
rather stupidly called Earth is about
ninety-four percent an ocean planet
we're in a six percent minority and that
is a problem for a lot of people who
would prefer that the I know it just
doesn't speak to the idea that this
planet is human centric it's it's a
maturity it's an understanding of who we
are what we are that we've yet to rise
to okay and let's just leave it at that
so what we're trying to do is get access
to not two-thirds of the planet but was
it 1920s we're trying to get access to
this planet turns out we don't have
access and we've looked skyward but we
just haven't looked downward so I don't
there's anybody here but occasionally if
you give a talk you can find there's a
billionaire or two in the audience
building rockets is actually five in the
u.s. those Rockets are 180 degrees of
course
this was nineteen thirty this is kind of
where it started this was a William
Beebe and that that hollowed out
cannonball there lowered by a cable in
the nineteen thirties created quite an
excitement barden and BB called inside
got locked in they went down three
thousand feet and so very strange things
and that was the first kind of human
contact into that deep space that was
nineteen thirty you would think that by
now we can all go anywhere anytime you
want that's not quite the case after BB
the next kind of big thing in terms of
vehicles and manned vehicles were well
the latest and greatest in Shanghai
which is Japan's entry into deep
submergence Israeli true I'm not sure
it's ready for six thousand five hundred
meters it's about twenty-two
twenty-three thousand feet built in 1989
and really the last of the big ones this
is the most recent sub single one owned
by China herb Japan China is now
building one and there are only five
deep subs on the planet okay fine they
probably move at a 122 knots
irrespective of other claims that's
probably where they are 12 knots maybe
two and a half knots require a
mothership to operate in the bottom
right-hand corner there's Atlantis
that's the mothership for the u.s.
single deep submergence craft which is
out in only five in the world
lots of problems with them this is
probably the least of them but I think
this is funny there are chairs inside
these submarines submersibles and people
peer out of portholes and go down deep
sorry but I think that's a pretty
fundamental problem the next kind of
milestone perhaps if you'll allow me to
say this was some of us build shallower
but really much more friendly subs this
is one of mine this is deeper / deeper
over to there are two of these built and
sitting in that is James Cameron and
Cameron used two of these in a really
interesting film aliens of the deep
showing deep subs that Russian Muse down
at things areas in the ocean where two
plates come together and create kind of
volcanic type activity thermal vents
where sea water is taken down into the
Earth's crust superheated and comes
blasting back up it's a chemical
chemical and biological laboratory
Cameron found excuse me others found
vents and 3000 feet the depth rating of
these subs and so aliens of the deep use
these two so I'm going to suggest that
this is the sub you're looking at there
is the pinnacle of conventional
submersible technology we need to throw
it all away and start again now you
won't hear many people say that because
some are still trying to raise money to
go back and build big clunking
submarines remember that's five on the
planet changes building sex
and some people want the US have number
72 Nate if anyone's into scale is you
guys so I'm suggesting 7th and 8th
doesn't make any difference you need
seven and eight thousand perhaps this is
a big planet we need something brand-new
we need to start again here's the
fundamental problem and this is where
our lab which is up the road parts
company with almost everybody else the
strange thing is no one's following us
so perhaps we wrong but you be the judge
of this here's what we think is
fundamentally wrong there's five subs
clustered there one of those the one on
the far right is no the one on the top
is Alvin with the US flag Alvin is is an
heroic much-loved piece of us technology
gives access to the deep ocean I'm the
only one standing up saying it's a
complete failure but I have to really
qualify that not for Alvin not for the
crew not for what she's done she's done
great work but she was designed and
built in nineteen fifty just 50 years
old a prototype so how many of you are
working on projects by your building
prototypes and in 50 years if that's the
only one that still exists was that
successful now didn't work didn't change
much didn't get to any scale whatsoever
that that's a problem and here's the
problem with it that bottom axis there
is weight thousands of pounds so look
where those five o'clock and the one
that China's building is probably going
to go off the scale to the right
so here's the problem that we see it's
the weight so if I can build you one of
these Serbs that way 60,000 pounds and
deliver it to you because you want to
submarine for one dollar right your
problem is you can leave one of those
things in the top to launch it that's a
mothership 20 tons of fuel oil a day is
going to drain your pocket 24-7 tied up
somewhere with the Kirov 50 are we wrong
no one else gets this no one else is
where we are it's the weight of these
things that's why there's only five only
five subs so I put that weight barrier
at 10,000 pounds why because if we can
get under 10,000 pounds we don't have to
own our own mother ship in the fleet of
oil field support vessels in the fleet
of national research vessels typically
they will have an a-frame on the back or
an articulated boom crane and typically
that can just about manage to launch and
recover about 10,000 pounds roughly
so what our little labs done is said
that man subs are dead there's no scale
effect unless we get on this 10,000
pounds and get rid of the stinking
mothership that we don't have to offer
that's it so I'm going to leave plenty
of time for questions you tell me where
we wrong in order to get that weight
down we had to do one thing submarines
conventional submarines displace their
weight they're typically neutrally
buoyant in a water house out that what
the conventional ones are so wheat is a
function of volume by definition volume
is if I take three of you sit you on
chairs and draw the smallest volume
around you without you having to contort
into some extreme positions stay like
that I've just defined a sphere have
probably 60 or 70 inches internal
diameter figure that out with titanium
the strongest material we've got right
wrong but never mind that's where
everyone fact sphere is the best
solution right it actually is probably
can't afford it so figure out a sphere
around three people bingo 60,000 pounds
you want to get to the bottom of the
ocean 100,000 pounds mothership dead
finished arm dinosaur forget it you're
going nowhere you're going to dive in
the ocean the way that Japan is costing
$80,000 a dive you're going to dive once
or twice or three times a week that's it
no scale you don't match anything it's
so last century stuff to get the weight
down if it's possible you just have to
get the volume down so you have to take
this round pressure hull and shrink it
around you or you just have to do it
isn't it's no longer round titanium is
no longer good enough that's just tough
you just have to try and figure it out
so now perhaps you understand some of
the issues that our little lab decided
we could solve and nobody else ever
thought we could I think nobody's
followed us nobody's saying nobody else
is saying we got to get rid of the
motherships nobody else is trying to
build subs under 10,000 pounds so
worried the nuts are we right both well
that's interesting I don't deny it I
don't deny either of those okay so this
was a design concept that we actually
were nuts enough to build and Karen and
I launched that in 1996 deep flight one
the whole idea was to shrink a pressure
hall around the human being and imagine
the pressure because we couldn't afford
to do it we could take foolish and death
so titanium doesn't work but ceramics do
ceramics do ceramics have an interesting
property in compression only in
compression they kind of behave like a
liquid like a fluid at the bottom of the
ocean and Marianas Trench 16,000 pounds
per square inch water exists and if you
flipped your hand through it it would
feel like water on the surface there's
only a second order increase in density
it's just impervious to pressure you
can't push the molecules that much
closer together so there are now some
mechanical engineering materials that
behave like a fluid and glass is one of
those by the way
that potentially give us the ability to
build pressure holes that take enormous
compressive stress so if you look out
the compressive stress of glass you'll
probably find some of these reporting
you that two thousand pounds excuse me
two hundred thousand pounds per square
inch titanium is going to fail it about
130,000 the 200,000 figure for glass is
all over the place it's probably because
there's a floor the reality is if that
was pure enough you probably can't
squeeze it enough in reality will break
at some point however take that piece of
glass and pull it and just pulls apart
so it has zero tensile stress so I'm
talking about a glass that you drop in
smashes and I'm saying build a submarine
out of that and you're saying you're
nuts what I'm saying well it's because
if we can engineer it just purely for
compressive stress we were okay but
bring it to the surface and bump it into
a dark it's you've got big problems you
just correct around you but there are
some engineering ceramic so that's what
we were looking at with this the
pressure hull there is mainly
cylindrical half as efficient as a
sphere but there are some potential
materials that can handle that the
pressure hull is shrunk around the human
is volume is low that sub displaced
2,700 pounds potentially the geometry
were used in there could go to full
ocean depth with the right material but
there's another issue if the pressure
hull is that small how long is it going
to be comfortable the existing deep
serves underwater blows they're going to
take six aid if you went for the bottom
12 hours to think that you're taking a
thermos flask you're sitting in the
chair you've got some means of dealing
with bodily issues which we won't need
to get into and the code uncomfortable
but you're in there for a very long time
we call that
hotel accommodation in the whole form
we're looking at is much more like a
pressure suit there really isn't hotel
accommodation you're going to be
comfortable in there for three four or
five hours don't ask me how but we know
that you also all know that that's what
you'll drive down a freeway before you
start looking for a restaurant then you
get out small aeroplanes spacewalks the
future deep submergence that's the
timescale you're looking so take that
time scale and look at full ocean depth
which is vertically seven miles away
that means we had to set the idea that
we can only spend one hour going down in
one hour coming back numbers are pretty
simple that means we're vertically
transiting at seven miles per hour
doesn't sound like a lot but water is
850 times as dense as air and these
underwater bloons are never ever going
to achieve that you're never going to
get down and back that quickly by
blooming underwater so it turns out you
actually face the same problem that
existed over a century go by trying to
master airspace and transition
transitioning from ballooning to fixed
wing aircraft haven't got time to really
get into that you could challenge that
in questioning probably will but just
trust me the math the math is the same
to a first order approximation anyone to
a few percent approximation the math is
the same it turns out if we're going to
get from the bottom of the ocean if
we're going to move through the water at
seven miles per hour the drag goes up
with a square that's 70 that's from two
miles per hour which is currently
realistic and under water ballooning 27
call it a factor of three the drag goes
up with the square the power goes up
with the q it's just not going to work
you just can't get a blown
from Europe to hear carrying people and
it's just not going to work it's just
not going to work with humans in this
vast dimensional space ballooning so you
got small pressure hulls limited time we
got us learn to fly underwater it's just
that simple it really is hence this
thing had wings had no buoyancy system
didn't look like any other sub the
control systems inside had to all be
kind of cleared out the way I'm actually
crossed a phobic that's me in there I
was going to be the only pilot of this
crazy machine so maybe you're right you
see this far it goes through here anyone
in this room is claustrophobic makes not
appreciating this it's really
interesting it turns out because i know
i've been in this small machines the
whole idea of being close to phobic is
visual so we can take anyone who says
the claustrophobic anybody here will
admit to it you all are to a degree or
promise you okay if you Shannon if we
put you in a space suit or a hardsuit
that's totally confining to you but your
head is clear you're happy stick that
helmet on then you start screaming take
the helmet off and you happy it's visual
oh I'm happy happy unhappy happy I know
that and so this thing is right there is
structural but its back behind my
peripheral vision I can't see it and I'm
smart enough not stick anything in front
of me there that tells me I'm in
anything and refractive index and
geometry of this front storm here is
very close to that of water which means
you have a wonderful thing if you take a
window in a vehicle in air in aircraft
you'll where you're sitting behind a
window we can adapt the geometry and
underwater craft so that window when it
closes down on you you can see right
here that's claustrophobic in there
underwater that's optically dissolved
underwater the psychological effect is
your head is out there and your whale I
mean a fish I don't mean to you know you
know I'm saying
so I'm in there and I think gosh I keep
telling people but it blows my mind
every time I don't know where this dome
is and I put my finger out and I don't
know when I'm going to touch in some
point it just folds up it's the coolest
thing it's not claustrophobic but this
was an underwater flying machine and it
was meant to get us through to the next
generation of working man subs and this
was published in New Scientist years and
years ago it shows how we hover with
vertical thrusters it shows that we stop
we've got manipulators it it shows how
each one of these modules is one person
in each one they are completely
self-contained so they can be touched
this is a one-person submarine that's a
one-person submarine they United
together we came up with this incredible
idea of a land system I'm being funny
about that so this two wire connection
in their computer software so in one is
a passenger the others a pilot and
sandwich between is the complete work
package however you want for
manipulators which is ridiculous but
we're making a point full hovering
thrusters published years and years ago
that's how we stop and hover that's how
we work we can now make that we've now
publish that that will cost you about 3
million bucks for one of these full
ocean depths sub the whole set weighs
about 10,000 pounds you don't need a
stinking mothership we're there we're
done I'll show you a sub that we built
for 37,000 feet and guess what the US
just spent 27 million dollars on the
design study to upgrade Alvin they could
have bought three new ones and those
thinking mothership people don't believe
where we are they just don't believe it
I've just letting you know letting it
all hang out there so that's this I'm
going to go through and tell you what
happened
next and where we are when we launched
that deflate one it was publicly
launched in Monterey I promise you is
you're welcome to come and look at this
end our workshop up in point richmond
it's tiny it looks incredibly
uncomfortable it actually isn't it just
looks at and before we launched it
before people saw that in the water
almost everybody will walk by and they'd
shake their head and go you'd never get
me in that you're nuts however after we
launched it i was flying around happy as
a clam in monterey wanted to see what
was happening with the press i mean a
press launch of a submarine as a funny
thing because you go to heaven god so
trying to well anyway so trying to look
to see Karen on the show I would just
jump this thing up and look around and
it would disappear down and the crowd
went whoa started clapping I was running
with the support boat I was nervous that
they were going to run over me and
destroy me so I will pop us out of the
warden like I'm here don't remember me
I'm here don't run over me but I'd
learnt to porpoise like a dolphin is to
do with the wavefront the thing has
pretty low drag when it's submerged but
as soon as you break the water and
generate a wave train to drag increases
so within two or three cycles of that
I'd simply learn to stick my nose up
look around and get the nose under that
wave and back down and I could shed that
way with no loss of speed afterwards
when I looked at the video I'm a dolphin
I just know what I know why dolphins do
this stuff they're looking but they're
not getting the penalty of a wave trying
they just wait what underneath it it's a
cola step so that in itself
changed a lot of people's perception and
when we came back out I noticed a lot of
people saddling up to this thing and
kind of planning you a little bit of a
funny grin on their face I know imagine
what it might be like and some would say
must have been really cool so you know
what it was designed for is designed to
get the weight under but it actually
opened up this whole idea of flight and
the whole idea of an adventure and fun
so the next thing we actually were
funded through a friend of mine to build
we've always limited by funds but we're
tiny little entity was a two player to
place flight trainer the idea was let's
take flight and see what we can do with
it forget depth that's not compromised
this machine by trying to go deep that
simply push underwater flight for safe
and see where it goes so we built this
flight trainer there's Karen who's right
here's my wife we had a ball with this
thing lon step in Monterey off of the
utility dark in in 20 feet of water a
sandy bottom is the most boring place to
launch this up in a planet but we we've
always done that because we need to test
the things or water and that's what we
go first so in this dive there's a
reporter in the back who bug me but I
said it's going to be boring there's not
much point but I take you anyway but now
for the first time we're flying and boy
is that different we're moving
underwater we go through a cloud of
jellyfish looking at the underside of
waves of the kind of streaming over you
flying through this beautiful cloud of
jellyfish and then the reporter behind
lets out a blood-curdling scream he's
obviously dead or very close to death I
mean it was the most amazing scream my
head snapped around to see what it was
and all it was was this guy a big sea
lion who incidentally with conventional
subs just get the heck out
the way they're bored and they move away
but we had this sealer and stuck on that
wing tip about six inches of head
forward focused is like I don't know
what this big blue thing is but I'm its
wing man that looks cool we just had a
escort and by the time I turned and
looked at him the someone black a big
shadow went over head and it was another
even bigger one that did a barrel roll
take a look right around my comp it and
this guy said I'm better than you this
is I master this place let me zoom done
that was a boring dive everything else
since then has just gotten really exotic
because we're beginning to have
encounters with these big animals that
we've never had before so the next thing
we did was wow we've got to get our
signature as low as we can we've got to
get our acoustic out late our electrical
and leakage down we started going to
lower voltage making sure we built in
plastics getting our signatures down so
that we could have these encounters with
these big animals well that was some
years ago and then when was this Karen
when did Steve countries yeah we've been
talking we've been having discussions
with Steve Fossett's for a number years
prior to that he was interested in for
lotion death we had some interesting
discussions we I wanted to build to one
person subs and we will both go down
safe we can film each other Steve wasn't
interested in that he was interested in
solo record which meant that he didn't
have somebody else going along with him
so although she has a girls I thought
about it and said okay I don't need that
record doesn't be much to me Steve would
build you the machine but Steve you'll
let me go afterwards right I'll get to
use it and get to the bottom of the
trench
and blesses Harper Steve Fossett is
Steve Fast Eddie said now yeah now I
dive it goes in the Smithsonian you get
the technology deal now but a number two
years later we called him up said Steve
okay we'll do it so now we had to put
the money where our mouth is and build a
pressure hull that actually could take
37,000 feet believe Lana couldn't get
ceramic built in that size if we have
been google or had plenty of money we
could have done but we didn't we were on
a shoestring budget but this is a
pressure hull we ended up with and it
ended up as a filament wound carbon it
can be done just can be done our
engineers are sitting in the audience
and we're all traumatized because we
went through a series of tests model
tests DoD facility pushing carbon to
37,000 feet which is 16,000 external
pressure so take a scoop a bottle this
thing you're afraid is going to blow up
in your face put it down 7,000 feet in
the ocean and the external pressure is
equaled open the valve and nothing's
coming out thinking a bit deeper open
the valve and water goes in and now
you're only about 16 of the way where
we're going with that thing with a human
inside it's a pretty serious problem and
so we set up a number of model tests
designed to fail because we would we
wouldn't find the limit of material
until it failed so we built models that
were designed to fail within the
pressure that we could subject them to
and that's why we're all traumatized
because the rascals never went where
they're supposed to and they made a
hellish bang it wrecked it must have
registered on the seismic meters around
the world i bet those the labs knew when
we were doing testing seriously this was
a pressure vessel buried in the ground
in case it ever let go it would take out
the town it was in but nobody knows
it was serious stuff but in the end we
think we got there in the end we ran a
full sized test that if we extrapolated
it was going to be safe and Steve bless
his heart overruled all of us and said
we're done not testing enough money I'm
going to go with it so the rest of the
machine thrusters flight control and
here you see our philosophy that the
pressure hole is just the minimum we
need everything else we imagine we were
fish engineers you know fish engineers
would not build things to work in there
that need to be encapsulated protected
from pressure they would just build
stuff that will work in their
environment seawater is a corrosive
conductive nasty fluid pressure is
horrendous but fish cope with it they
would design stuff that would just cope
and so we did all everything externally
is is remarkably comfortable at pressure
and so we ended up building a number of
components there actually were just
insensitive to pressure it just had no
effect no measurable effect interesting
thing so the whole machine was built and
that's with all of these components
which will go to 37,000 feet or 37 feet
really they don't care they really I'm
not attuned to the difference but trust
me that pressure hole is
but we got there and we were four weeks
away from launching this machine as an
underside view of it the front view it's
pretty heavily engineered to work at
37,000 feet but if you see it's in our
workshops up in point richmond it's an
aeroplane it looks like nothing else but
an aeroplane there she is in the side
view then there's our team that's how
many people we had and remember I talked
about getting rid of the mothership well
that thirty-seven thousand foot sub a
prototype way more than we wanted we
wanted that a 5,000 pounds of weight
8,000 pounds but give us a break it's
the first one is twice as deep 10 times
a range of anything else ever built
about one-tenth of way we'd learned that
Steve's camera and PlayStation was a
call PlayStation then Karen or Cheyenne
if you follow so links TV set number of
records in Cheyenne leader called
playstation or the other way around 130
foot carbon fiber catamaran gorgeous
machine with it bendis mastered off a
chilean I called Steve I'm said Steve
you know we are going to have to rent a
mothership to do the testing and your
dive you just just mastered Cheyenne we
can use her and we'll save you a ton of
money by then we knew what we knew have
to get anybody surprises that okay we'll
do it so there's our mothership which is
in alameda right now finished this
tripod gantry would lift the sub up
through the middle there were 2 250 yeah
ma diesels put in the back there and she
would do about 19 knots with these 250
Yama's sipping fuel and crew
that is our mothership she does not burn
20 tons of fuel oil a day she runs with
a controller three and i can tell you i
was looking forward to having as
gorgeous sub on that deck selling under
the Golden Gate Bridge for guam we would
have created so much mischief have we
done them here was a sub one-tenth the
weight of anything else the whole
project costing a fraction of what
another team in the u.s. it's been just
trying to do a study but you know Steve
managed to steve was last a month before
we launch this thing so what happened
next what happened next actually we went
up and tried looking for Steve quite an
adventure I'm good time to go into lab
what happened next was kind of figured
out we had some space and time to build
her own so I built about 65 for
everybody else time to build one for me
that had no constraints didn't have a
single requirement or a single customer
and my own require very mind we probably
could have scraped the money to go to
37,000 feet and gotten on the front page
of all the newspapers but so uh so what
we would have end up with a very
expensive difficult to use craft had a
different goal in mind which was that
these guys their territory perhaps his
3,000 feet but typically it's a thousand
feet of under I wanted about a move with
big animals we had discovered underwater
flight these things were potentially
incredibly maneuverable these guys crews
had four or five knots and I wanted to
perfect underwater flight just for the
halibut that needed a different pressure
whole this was the design we came up
with remember we just come out of a
program with a 37,000 foot pressure hall
so the bill bonded a thousand foot
didn't seem that different
anymore what that meant was we had
enough guts if his gods or stupidity you
decide to be able to say you know what
every single pressure hull has been
built has been spherical around its kind
of carved in stone thou shalt not build
a pressure or other than brown we knew
how to use composite material to get
enough strength that we could see we
don't have to obey that rule anymore a
triangular section is going to be more
comfortable to the human form and we got
lower frontal area and I don't care
about that I'm going to make this the
way it should be and whatever depth
would get we get that's that's the
philosophy there's a different view of
that hole then there is a machine again
the pressure Hollis is a two-person one
connected minimum space all the
machinery and most of this stuff came
straight off a challenging most of the
stuff will be quite happy at 37,000 feet
bigger wings fly by wire this baby was
going to fly and maneuver the way that
we're going to see what it could do
that's the concept of it but didn't
quite get to build it for ourselves that
way now second customer I don't know how
you measure your customers by the way we
measure hours right now one over time
one two and three but look who we got
first one was fast said this gentleman
you may know his Tom Perkins as in
kleiner perkins Tom came into our
workshop and if anybody on this planet
could look at the workshop and figure
out who was being who the real thing I
think it was Tom Tom and I differ on
this I think it's fair and I think he
would support it we become friends he
would say it took him 35 minutes I think
it was 25 before he was so agitated he's
a very polite person but it's quite
insistent
you be in my office in San Francisco
tomorrow ya canna club okay contracts 25
minutes before he's asking for contract
he wanted that machine that we were
actually built in for ourselves you know
the Maltese Falcon is Tom's exquisite
sailboat his and he is a serious sale is
a serious pursuer of Technology The
Maltese Falcon is known as impressed as
a bigger sailboat but trust me it's it's
exquisite you may remember she sailed
under the Golden Gate Bridge little
while ago Karen and I were on board tom
was showing her off to his hometown but
she came in here to pick up the sub and
there is Tom in that son there's a
falcon and here is that sup the one that
I thought was the most beautiful thing
on the planet the one I really wanted to
build myself and here it is and here's
that team a couple these guys are
sitting in this audience right now
that's the team that's the sub it was
peer 37 I think she's on Pier 37 Maltese
Falcon and his next door we're going to
pick her up under a crane that's on the
forward boom and put her on the deck we
put her on the deck we got the sail out
spend a month on board what a month
take it down to the Sea of Cortez now
here's a man he's got everything in the
world but now he has the first really
call underwater aircraft really cool one
and he wants to know what it can do well
first of all we got to test it we got to
get the bugs out of it we've got to
learn to fly it ourselves and then we
got to train them I'd allowed a month
for that short I know Tom allowed this
about two days and announced that we
were done seriously this was a serious
time but here it is i think in the Sea
of Cortez I'm looking at the silver head
in the back there so that's Tom I think
that's probably me he SAT still for
about two dives I figured it'd take 20
to train him he said in that backseat
twice and he was done fortunately the
guy is really good and this is really
easy to fly
the next thing that happens we went
through testing and trials in a really
compressed time Tom got bored with the
Sea of Cortez he wanted big animals and
I was completely clueless about the
capability of the boat way around and
the mindset of Tom Perkins and the
captain Tom said where can we find big
animals and I stupidly said how you know
ten years ago with National Geographic
we found this incredibly wild it was
dangerous by the way place in the
Pacific we're at the time I'd refused to
put deep flight one in and I said I
think it's we dive with scuba gear
there's clouds of hammerhead circling
around this a really cool place but I
didn't get past the but come so where is
it Chris where is it chris is Captain
started throwing up charts found one of
the Pacific I put my finger on it Tom
looked at it and said Chris how long
this is quick chris said uh three days
Tom say go before I knew it the sales
were out we're healed over and this boat
was just barreling out for this
dangerous place in the Pacific we got
out there the morning we're out there I
thought it's going to be okay Graham I
don't have to do this dive I don't have
to show him how to do it they're never
going to anchor it's way too dangerous
sure enough I'm out there and I'm woken
up morning and chris says were anchored
you need to get ready tom wants to go so
Mon Dec looking at the sub looking at
this wild place is this huge swell
coming through it's a pinnacle in the
ocean because it's a pinnacle it's
attracted local sea life and outboard of
that sea life of the Predators the tuna
predating on this gorgeous see life is
cruising around there and outboard of
those are the really big predators
really big ones very cool but there's a
wild current running there's this surge
this is cleaning up and down this rock I
can only imagine what the cyclic current
is underneath there's a huge current
sweeping by and every man sup I'd ever
been built on I'd ever built remember
that 64 put in the water
what he gone so this was a lethal place
to launch myself I'm standing by the sub
and I'm trying to figure out how to tell
Tom no it's another guy you say no to I
think he snuck up behind me I haven't
got a good poker face so he read me like
a book and he just stared in my eyes and
said Graham you built this up to do that
didn't you yes okay we go so we did best
dive of my life the sub obviously flew
out there it's so strong and powerful we
just circled circumnavigated that rock
under water is the coolest thing we went
around the back we broke communications
as darkseid little moon stuff announced
on the comms that we losing
communications be back in seven minutes
when we came out from the dark side we
circled shallow families small fish went
deeper down this rob lurking in our the
big Galapagos sharks that look like
great whites that menacing their big we
moved out board of the rock out board of
the big predators we'd learn to fly
these machines by the way we're big
animals and as a few principles that you
learn very quickly one is that if you're
going to approach a big animal a sharp
and you want to signal that I'm friendly
I'm okay you get on the same level you
don't really get in front you get back
to show perhaps your little subservient
and you keep to one side but you keep
easily within their eyesight you don't
worry them by losing their eyesight the
opposite pot attack posture is down
underneath behind them we found
ourselves down underneath a school it
reminded me of a motorcycle gangs of big
hammerhead sharks both wearing huge
grins on their faces say you know we
must be the first human beings in the
history of this planet to stalk big
sharks underwater yeah anyway
there's that machine we put lasers
aren't haven't got time to go into those
but Charles and I were testing this out
he screamed and I did I said Charles put
the lasers on we both scream straight
out of Star Wars completely freaked me
out I've given you two customers so
who's the early adopters of these things
well there's a clue is another one there
probably recognizable the silver-haired
night on the left I get a run through
the shop but he took one look at the
super Falcon onboard a yacht I'm wanted
one but one fed couldn't have the weight
and so we just came back this is a few
weeks ago perhaps last week it's a three
seater open cockpit trainer down call
for scuba gear so where is all this
going
well
remember we started this with wheat we
want a few people I think to start
worrying about scale you have google
maps and we could do with visually
sampling this ocean and stick it here on
coming up with that data but it's not
going to work it's not going to work if
the cast just limits this to a handful
of people so we got three customers but
they're our early adopters what we're
aimed at is lower costs and scale we're
aimed at big numbers trust me
one we don't get too big numbers but we
do try and explain expand this this is
the second super Falcon is Karen of mine
I've been just in love with this machine
here it is early dawn Monterey and we're
running a flight school so if anybody
here wants to come fly one of these
things just contact karen and wheel
arranger just tell you that some of you
may know her local that's John Sculley
with his son we just this is this is
that sub this summer we're just having a
ball we've got scale we can operate now
from ships of opportunity
we've we've done we've taken man craft
to this next generation we're taking
them through the barrier and now I tell
you quite frankly we're going to take
unmanned systems through the barrier and
these are the things that are going to
unlock the ocean this is what's going to
give a scale and again a finish right
there so thank you for your attention
and and I'll take any questions if
anybody wants to tell me we're idiots or
but wrong well you've got any questions
built very long in sorry there's a
number of university groups that have
built very long endurance underwater
gliders that that well they refer to
them as that do you have any opinion
about that particular direction of
research yeah it's great it really is
that that's one way of getting scale
there are three basic craft and the
ocean man's mercy balls we've broken
through to the next generation of
ultralight man subs but there are
remotely operated vehicles and there are
what but in our answer we caught a UV
autonomous underwater vehicles
unfortunately all three have pretty
fundamental problems the conventional
man sub is just too heavy but we
described how we've knocked that one
down the remotely operated vehicle there
is no there is no physical principle
whereby we can get enough bandwidth
transmitted wirelessly through water to
remotely pilot an unmanned craft real
time so when we say remotely operated
vehicles unlike drones in the air which
can be piloted remotely real time you
can't do that under water so the
underwater remotes that exist are
connected by it typically by an
electromechanical cable
that mechanical cable works for the
offshore industry was developed those
craft it absolutely cripples them for
going to high seas and for going deep
give you one example Japan built the
deepest remotely operated vehicle ROV
it's now been lost but it did exist for
a number of years it's cable was wound
on a winch that was three stories high
remember we started by saying the
motherships kill everything so if you
have an RV who support equipment needs
its own mothership from our point of
view you've wasted your time anyway so I
Revere's have a problem a UV is the
gliders the answer to the ROV cable
these are craft that can be quite small
and they let loose they are limited
simply by artificial intelligence their
robots so there's it looks like you know
it depends what you think about AI but
it looks like it's going to be a very
long time before you know robots will
intervene in the ocean so we're really
focused on what the industry calls
intervention that is where let's go
let's imagine there's a smoking chimney
and we want the DNA samples from here
and we want the mineral samples from
there that'd moment is out of the
ability of an AUV it requires ROV or a
manned vehicle RVs have huge problems we
think we can solve those we've just been
through massive problems with the man
subs how difficult can it be two
questions one is are you concerned about
maybe a squid or something wrapping
itself around your vehicle and tearing
it up or and the second one is if you
could talk about your power supply a
little bit the squid thing is just a
fabulous question but you get me going
on the giant squid look our biggest
problem with a giant squid is to make
sure we've got cameras
rolling when we get that close I mean I
don't think it's going to wrap itself
around they are big they are powerful
they're very smart in their environment
the idiotic thing is we think they're
rare because they've been no human
encounters to live to tell the tale I
have to add that last little bit there's
no human encounters have lived to tell
the tale with with giant squid the giant
squid the Kraken Israel we've got enough
bits and pieces we know it's real out
there is there predated on by blue
whales they're probably not rare at all
it's just that we've gone in the ocean
with dumb stupid slow machines radiating
noise and light these babies have
eyeballs this big same structure as
you're an IR eyeball they're clearly
collecting the the low light from
biological light and the last expedition
used to my subs now one of them deeper
over to go and film the giant squid in
New Zealand and it's the funniest thing
if you watch that these guys really did
know better but it's just humans can be
incredibly stupid sometimes so the sub
goes down to film a giant squid right
with a big eyeball the eyeballs used to
low-level light the camera taken down is
going to get exquisitely high-definition
video is designed for sunlight so it has
to be married by two big two kilowatt
arc lights that are going to take down
ten to the six more light there never
existed in this environment and you're
going to film a giant squid oh come on
so it's sitting on the bottom lights
blazing no squid and if I'd had better
cartoon skills I had this dynamite
cartoon that the sub sitting on the
bottom Mike deGruy inside talking
dejectedly to National Geographic people
on here no giant squids yet and out
beyond light range where the light is
now attenuated so it's not searing the
eyeballs there's wall-to-wall giant
squids and the mums are trying to push
their babies to be the first on national
geographic TV and the babies are going
the lights the lights
can't stand the light so so you'll find
that we're really interested in very low
light level how we see as pilots in that
environment is no good us taking down
lights that illuminate that place as if
it's sunlight what's going to happen if
we do that we're going to fly through a
sterile environment everything that's
big and smart has just got the hell out
the way but why we hope to see a giant
squid this one of my things frequency of
light to which the giant squid are other
things might be interested
those we have an optical range between
600
peers if you eliminate me with allyson
van Meter light that this cleft and I
can build a camera they look at
let's just talk look we are talking
about an environment and science which
is so backwards is nuts it's just nuts
it really is so look at man subs do all
the man subs that have gone down have
gone down with their is plug these
pressure hulls do not transmit sound
Charles here is trying to get as
hydrophones transducers on the outside
we want to listen to the environment so
that hasn't even been done yet let alone
what wavelengths and what cameras can we
build it's just a wide open field trust
me it's just it needs bright people to
come and help us work on it they're
probably all the ones that articular as
well really bad with
yeah we have a budget problem but so so
clearly they're already gathering this
data
one yeah they are what we want to do is
we want to we want a simple binaural
hydrophone array displayed so that we
hear the pilot and crew here that
naturally if we're down and there is a
humpback whale singing we want to be
able to know where it is so that's how
God is that you so it's a great gun also
means reward surface underneath the
jetski tearing others will hear that
thing coming but I just illustrate how
crude how backward this stuff is Karen
and I went to look for a shipwreck by
the way and I know some of you are
mapping in the South China Sea it's a
it's a lovely story we've got got
squabbles with pirates all kinds of
things but the thing that's interesting
is that the charts the bathymetric data
that anybody google or anybody trying to
do a bathymetric map of that area will
look at the area we're operating in
royal captain shoals and put the bottom
at 600 feet it's 600 feet we just happen
to be down there exploring looking for a
shipwreck a 600 feet on this sea mount
that the slope was still 70 degrees 700
feet 800 feet nine hundred thousand feet
remember the bottom supposed to be a 600
feet 11 hundred feet 1,200 feet 1,300
feet 1,400 feet we found a shipwreck in
the bottom still going down just
illustrating we live on an unexplored
planet and lots of that stuff the infill
on the ocean bottom is just artistic
film so I have a couple questions if
lights books animals then what is that
how do you see what is the point of
having a human look at the window
there's nothing to see well the giant
squid has got an 18-inch eyeball that
they are using light and if we dark
adapt I've been on a dive where we just
turned all the lights out and just let
our eyes dark adapt I think there's kind
of an overlap so we just have to put
lights on the sub
that operate in that much lower range
and let go of the idea of filming
exquisitely beautiful jenks camera and
style there are cameras that can see
obviously much lower than human eyes and
get underneath the squid but if there's
a commercial function then you probably
should use a remote and you won't find
us or ourselves arguing the man to
better the cameras that was an argument
that was used ten years ago the cameras
are evolving faster and humanize and
have already crossed over it probably is
your question so you know unmanned
solutions in the future will probably
dominate 20 21 and demand stuff will be
left for those of us that want to go
down probably so my other question is
how hard it what is the comparable
difficulty of attacking the problem of
building a cheap support ship just to
figure out some way to you so you can
lift 60,000 powers into a smashing well
that might be another solution or
another solution is you just get bigger
so that the sub doesn't need a support
ship and it's just autonomous another
way that we're getting rid of any costs
at all we're trying to get the cost
really down to where it's just
affordable so another way we can do that
is improve the range of the super Falcon
so that we can operate close to a canyon
as in Monterey and just not we'll just
go from short we'll just fly out there
but there are solutions big autonomous
submarines that's beyond our budget and
unmanned systems such a very small and
economical hi question from New York can
you hear me
from New York yeah that's right I was
wondering what happened to Steve Fossett
submersible was it ever was ever used
now it's sitting in a workshop it's
owned by the Steve Fossett estate we own
the technology the machine is sitting
there gathering dust we don't know its
outcome yet stay tuned
what's the education skills training
experience for your members of your team
our engineering team we just try and get
the brightest we can in young before
they messed up I cut them loose that's
about what we do questions
two questions first what is this
dangerous place that you visited in the
Pacific The Rock apetito it's about 200
miles southeast of Cabo San Lucas okay
it's part of the is it Sakura silence
okay thank you and the second is tell me
a little bit more about propulsion
communications human endurance factors
of your latest submersibles how long can
people stay down well and do you and do
you compress those at all because to me
about do you put any compression on
those at all would you oh no no now if
you fly a commercial aircraft your cabin
pressure is going to fluctuate between
you know 14.7 then maybe 10 or 12 PSI
fly super Falcon this kept within half a
percent because it doesn't need to be
but we can so we do it's a little
microcomputer very clever so it keeps it
very tight and we're only by the way you
know the life support and there is the
same as a closed system same as the
spacecraft so there's no bubbles we're
only consuming oxygen we're metabolizing
oxygen cylinder this bigger last year 24
hours and propulsion was a big has been
a big energy storage has been a big
problem batteries electrical systems are
preferred they're simpler we know how to
build those so you know the modern
lithium battery has been our Savior it's
why we can fly de the prototype d flight
one was to fly with our koers aluminum
oxygen seawater batteries they never
materialized but fortunately they
required a buffer of battery pack of
lead acid batteries saudi fly one flew
with lead acid batteries you know 20
million germs we have the same problem
as wright brothers our subs or more
energy use higher levels of energy than
a conventional submersible but with the
lithium chemistry we're getting on super
Falcon and Tom made 23 dies today we
just came back
with the sir we delivered to Branson and
we actually rent we ran training on that
for two days we never charge the battery
so we hope we're home and dry on
propulsion thank goodness we waited for
20 years old
let me buy super falcon for the price of
a luxury car when they're made in batch
quantities of two or three hundred just
that simple I don't know when that's
going to be you bet you know what we can
have a lot of fun with the one that
exists before we get to that point I
guess related to that question other
than the pressure hull itself is the
rest of the equipment that goes into it
off the shelf as it were as in used in
in marine environments now is there
anything else that you build yourselves
no no and that that's that's the barrier
to entry in this is nothing so it's not
like aviation or where we can buy
avionics or an engine from somewhere for
example the advent of flight we needed
an artificial horizon not available we
couldn't use vacuum powered ones for
aviation had to build our own so Charles
is writing the code for now we we can
buy nuts and bolts we can buy
semiconductors nessa
