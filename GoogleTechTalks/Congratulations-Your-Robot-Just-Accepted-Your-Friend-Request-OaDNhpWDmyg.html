by a literate rich Legrand ylian or bosh
type that's a trendy okay all right
alize from CMU and rich is a heads up a
company called charmed labs I might have
seen it they've gotten together and
they've they've built something that I
don't even want to attempt to describe
but i'll let them do it in their talk we
have about 40 minutes and then we should
save a little time for questions there's
a Dory page that was on the invite so
feel free to add your questions Dory
page will handle them when when we're
done okay bring it on you guys so thank
you everybody for showing up and thanks
Andy for inviting us to come this is an
honor to be here we have a two-part
presentation so I'm going to set you up
with the problem that we envision and
have messed around with for many years
we've actually been working together for
more than a decade and then rich is
going to come up and present to you the
solution direction we've been going and
actually give you kind of a call to arms
so it's two parts and it's about
robotics and robotics future and how we
can make the most interesting robots
possible that's fundamentally what it's
about and it would be great if I could
show you a you know some kind of Moore's
Law graph for robotics wouldn't it be
cool if I could show that to you and say
here's where we are and we can
extrapolate from that and this is how
cool that robots are going to be and how
many we're going to have in our lives in
five years but I can't do that it's
completely impossible to do right now
and in fact there's good reasons why you
actually can't do it at all and that's
the subject of another talk about why
that's essentially impossible so we
can't do that we can't look at the
progress that has happened in robotics
to set some context up for what we're
going to propose today and what we've
been working on and if you think about
the progress in robotics there are some
pretty big and hefty robots that are
pretty outstanding I mean they're pretty
amazing at what they do they're also
deceptively challenging issues that
swirl around them so I don't know how
many of you have read pw a singer's book
wired for war but the predator drone is
a really interesting example it's one of
these robots that's well it's a robot in
the sense that there's very significant
amounts of mixed control mixed autonomy
going on so there's a human in the loop
but it's got significant autonomy on
board it's a celebration problem it's
got this
problems telemetry issues and it doesn't
touch our lives every day it's not
something we wake up with except if
there's a news report about something
bad happening or something good
happening depending on your political
point of view but it's an example of
something that matters a lot for
robotics which is how humans are robots
interact with each other and how we
design interaction until operation and
telepresence so that's one interesting
category of progress that you can point
to another interesting category of
progress you can point to has to do with
dynamics and control this is big dog out
of Mark Roberts lab and company in
Boston it's pretty astounding because
one of the things that's really hard in
robotics has to do with human muscular
control so having series electric series
elastic actuators that can tune
themselves to damp themselves the right
way and have the right energy density to
actually do things like walk and jump
that's pretty much remarkable and so if
you also think about robotics and
Moore's law or some such thing for
robotics this is pretty important it's
also a little bit scary looking I'm not
sure you want to run into that in the
parking lot alone deep at knight someday
but if you think about robotics in terms
of the Turing test if there was such a
thing as an equivalent of the Turing
test in robotics then it would be very
pleasing to see that we've actually
gotten to the point in robotics now
where there are robots that can perform
at the capability of humans that are
virtually indistinguishable from the
robots so I had to show this to you it's
just too cool
oh the hand came down so yeah so
dynamics in control that's a big one too
the last one I'll give you yeah they'll
flailing away they're just like robots
there is another part of Robotics Oh
regime erotics it's really hard that
there's been big progress on it has to
do with computation and sensor fusion
right taking a whole lot of sensors and
doing something human scale but the
human does it with two eyes in a brain
we put I don't know how many sensors on
one car it's kind of absurd but we're
getting the fusion down right we have
computers that can deal with that
process it model it and make decisions
about how to do things like parallel
park so that's impressive so okay we've
got impressive progress for very
expensive robots I just showed you three
robots all of which caused many millions
of dollars what about the things we wake
up with and live at home with us what
about the blade runner like things
running around at home marching and
giving songs to us while we boil eggs
for our enemies who visit us never mind
what about the things at home are they
interesting are they are they something
that we care about if you turn to home
robotics and look at progress there we
have things that are being mass-produced
we have tooling people have figure out
how to manufacture robots they sell not
in massive numbers but they sell but you
know there's a problem with all of these
with rovio and rumba and a thon tugs and
all such things they don't pull at my
heartstrings right I'm not excited and
giddy about the next version of any of
these that are coming out I'm not like
really really curious to see in the next
Electronics Show what crazy-cool
exciting thing I'm going to order right
away and stand in a long line for in
either of those categories of thing it
cleans my house or it does just
telepresence or it delivers things for
me in my hospital so in a way robotics
doesn't have its soul it doesn't have
that emotional center of object that you
would become totally attached to the way
you do with well your PDAs and devices
and your music players and all those
good things because they weave
themselves into your life another way of
saying this is every time I see a
venture capitalist they ask me this
question every single one of them in the
first 45 seconds of conversation after
they find out
professor what's the killer app what's
going on they have a mentality in which
they're trying to figure out the killer
app so the company can make it right and
there's reasons to think this is the
wrong question and I'll give you an
example of why be this might be the
wrong question all right an example some
of you may have seen or some of you may
not have seen bum bot who's heard of
this 10 very few people okay well you
need to know about this this is
interesting group the great thing is all
the examples I'm giving in this talk or
examples that I use in my robotics and
ethics class so they're all ethically
questionable examples bum bot was made
by this bartender he owns a bar in
atlanta georgia and he had this problem
there's homeless people who sit on the
sidewalk in front of his bar he didn't
want them there so he took a grilling
device for smoking meat and put a high
pressure water cannon in it made it
remote control so now he can be inside
his bar drive this down the sidewalk and
shoot high pressure watcher at the
homeless who are sitting on the sidewalk
in front of his bar now the reason this
is interesting while completely
ethically questionable or maybe not even
the word questionable we can be a little
trying that is because it's the power of
what happens when somebody becomes
really inventive with today's modern
equipment that you can very easily get
hold of at home depot in a couple other
places right you don't even have to go
to sparkfun to do this not even that far
and so my proposition and I think riches
thesis with me is going to be maybe what
is the killer app is completely and
utterly the wrong question and maybe
there's a totally different question
that's the right question which is the
rhetorical question what is your killer
app and if people can be incredibly
creative like that with relatively low
competence parts building a robot that's
not really that sophisticated the
interesting question is what can we do
if we could reveal to people a set of
tools that allow them to make really
really interesting robust and how far
could they take it so the question I'm
going to answer the next three minutes
is what's the right recipe what do you
need to make magazine sophisticated
robots interesting robots robots that
you would have an emotional attachment
to in your home or in your social sphere
at the human scale so here's five or six
things really fast one of them is an
ecosystem now there's a picture of
honeybees here because I keep honeybees
keep a bunch of hives and it's an
excellent exam
of a community in which there's a
fantastic ecosystem if I want to buy the
parts there's a mix-and-match set of
parts available from multiple vendors
that allow me to build up my hive just
the right way and there's a massive
amount of hardware and know-how
available on the Internet I can order it
get it build these things so there's a
kind of physical ecosystem that makes it
possible for me to put together
sophisticated beehives very quickly and
that kind of ecosystem is something we
clearly need so the people have the
right building blocks there's something
else about the building blocks though we
want configurability right people put
things together but we don't tyranny I
run a ton of educational programs around
the world you interview girls in middle
school about the lego robot programs and
they don't like it and you ask them why
and they say oh that's easy Legos are
ugly they don't like Legos now granted
there's mostly men in this audience so
you know maybe the women in the audience
can let the men know if this is true or
not but there's an aesthetic component
here you need people to be able to use
the materials they want to use and
fabricate something that's actually
interesting to them so you can't
tyrannically suppress form for the sake
of ease of configurability and yet you
want configurability so there's a really
interesting challenge there that you
have to solve another one that I think a
lot of the commercial robots we're
missing is emotional connection the
thing the robot does and what it
represents to you has to be in your
heart right it has be interesting to you
this is a great example this is called
Braille tutor it was part of bernadine
diocese program called tech bridge world
at CMU and what they did which was
genius is the way you teach a blind
child to write Braille is they use a
device that pushes down to make bumps
but you're pushing down so the bumps on
the bottom right so you push down and
you make the bumps we're using a stylus
then you turn it over and you read it so
you have to learn to push the start with
a stylus backwards right you have to
write in reverse and so you have to ruin
to write learn the letters and learn it
all in Reverse first and split it around
so they made a robot that exactly takes
the reversing part out of the equation
so you're right with the stylus and you
can see physically in real time what
you've done just a very simple robot
interesting in terms of emotional
connection because what they've taken is
very simple parts that you can buy at
sparkfun and a few circuit boards you
fabricate and have made something that
they feel really strongly about it has
an impact they smile about it they feel
good
they feel good in the in developing
world as a result too so you need the
emotional connection a vibrant community
another one we're almost done by the way
with list soon its richest turn this is
a big deal you know about that boy from
the point of view Android and from the
point of view of every kind of form of
social networking and sharing that goes
on in the world it's a little bit
missing in the world of hardware
sometimes the example I put a picture up
on here is we have an electric car
program called charge car in which we
trained mechanics in independent garages
to convert cars to electric cars and
it's hilarious because we've had events
where we show who killed the electric
car we show Gasland and we invite people
to come from the public and we bought an
old Exxon station so we run the whole
program in the next on station which is
kind of cool because we have an open
flame we have a barbecue you don't
usually have open flames and Exxon
stations you understand why you're
Googlers anyway what's interesting about
that is you get environmentalists
activists complete gearheads who
couldn't carry with about the
environment all in one room passionate
about a particular subject in this case
about electric cars and cars last
weekend we had a formula f1 lightning
electric car in there we had five
different electric cars in the room at
the same time and people are all just
all over them talking about Fanning and
striking up conversations so
fundamentally you need a community but
you want to get diversity you want
people from completely different
backgrounds to end up working together
in hacking together and that works
really well for topic like cars that
people get unfortunately that's another
male dominated one when we do these
events but you need to do that around
robotics in my opinion last inherent
power this is where a lot of the kids on
the market fall found they don't
fundamentally give you enough power to
do really interesting things this is
just an example from bug labs where you
know if you're going to do some
networking how cool is it to have
something that's running full blown
Linux so it's a real processor you can
actually code it up it has an operating
system and it's often easy for people to
get trapped in the world of a pic micro
processors and get far enough away from
true competence that they can't do
really sophisticated interesting robots
with vision and speech and text of
speech synthesis and all that such so in
a nutshell that's sort of the set of
things that we think you if you could
nail all of those at the same time then
maybe we can answer the question what
your killer app we have an existence
proof that rich wanted me to share it's
a good existence proof because it's
exactly what vision I did last so the
thing we started working on before this
was a project called GigaPan and I
didn't I don't know how many of you are
aware of Japan or what it is so like
five percent of you it's basically a lot
of software and some hardware and it's a
robot that holds anything from a DSLR to
a small camera robotically moves it
around takes thousands of pictures with
it and then it's a stitching software
the puts that all together fabric hits
it into a giant panorama and then a
website that takes billions of pixels
and shows it to you so you can see Dubai
and 45 billion pixels 45 billion pixels
is interesting because you can zoom in
right you get lots of detail and there's
obvious things you can do with it but
what's interesting is to show how this
works when you give people enough power
and you have a real community what do
they do with it so I'm going to tell you
about three scientists really fast and
what they did with this to show you
diversity and I think this can happen in
robotics so these are scientists right
these were not gearheads they took the
GigaPan and they did specific things
with it further science so look at how
different what they did is Jane Goodall
they took tobacco plantations in
Tanzania they take pictures of them
because they're illegal plantations
where the primates have been pushed
shoved off because the trees are dead
right they showed the panorama to their
funders who don't have the time to
travel to Tanzania they show this to the
funder then they zoom in and zoom in and
zoom in until in the corner in the
forest they can show every tree being
rigged to be killed so they can increase
the plantation size and then they ask
for money so this is actually money
requesting process right using
technology example number two alex smith
University of Guelph in Canada DNA
barcoding of life he runs the entire bar
coding of Life Project they go around
the world and DNA barcode species of
insects and capture with the GigaPan the
entire context of the insect what's cool
about is they're storing the DNA now
together with a link to exactly where
say that spider was in the entire forest
and then you can go and do a
biodiversity assay counting every insect
in the picture which is crazy it's
mind-blowing it changes the way they
think about biodiversity and lab work
last example this is where the gear has
do take over in kind of a hilarious way
so when you do a scanning electron
microscope in
of a part of an ant it's great it's
really beautiful but you just get one
part of the ant what if you could do the
entire aunt well that would be thousands
of pictures right who can sit there with
an XY stage and move their hand like
that for 50 days so what they did is
they took the GigaPan right the same
unit I showed you they took the motors
in it stuck rubber tubes on the axles in
the motors pulled to the XY levers off
the axles stuck the rubber tubes in the
axles then they literally program the
GigaPan top left bottom right it go
that's all the gigapan spun the XY stage
of the scanning electron microscope and
took a multi-billion picture of an
entire aunt so now you can zoom in on
any part of the ant and get the
individual picture that you would
ordinarily be seeing crazy for nature
photography and science engagement
because you're getting the big picture
and you're getting all the small
pictures you could possibly want and may
not even know that you want at the time
when you do the imaging so that's just
an example of what happens when you take
creative folks scientists in this case
and give them a technology that's
engaging with enough power to do
something interesting with it ok back to
reality so we're going to do this for
robotics right we want everybody to make
their killer app in robotics so how do
we nail all this our proposition is to
nail this first of all to do ecosystem
and configurability you have to have a
partner right somebody who's going to
mass produce parts for you and we've
been banging on this for about two years
now carefully we lined up a partner
signed a full licensing deal with them
and rich will tell them about you
they're actually the biggest robot
manufacture around so it's very exciting
so we've got that done we have an
ecosystem we have configurability and
that's a really big first step next step
you need to inherent power you want a
process of this absurdly good and rich
I'll tell you about the one we have now
that's out and the one that's coming out
that's even better and last thing I'll
say how do you nail this how do you get
an emotional connection and get a really
good community well one possibility is
stop thinking about the device that
you're making as a device and start
thinking of it as something that's
thickly integrated with you socially in
your environment in your cloud so maybe
the problem is the robot and you and
your world have to be integrated
together socially and technically in
terms of data and so that you can use
the computational cloud as a
computational orthotic that helps your
robot be far smarter than going to be on
its own and so that you and the robot
all feel like you're friends with each
other in a really deep way so that's
where I'm going to leave it and the
challenge for rich now is going to be
sharing with you where we've gone now I
want to tell you a few words about rich
before he goes up here because I respect
him more than a lot of people that was
really poorly said what's the better way
to say that I've known Richard for a
very long time and I respected deeply
rich is one of these guys who is an
inventor and he knows how to put his
finger on the pulse of the most emerging
technologies and before they're even
quite out convinced the companies to
give it to him so he can use them and
invent a completely new way of putting
the pieces together that hasn't been
thought of yet and so it's exciting
because from a hardware point of view
and and a firmware point of view he's
been able to nail how we can redefine
the leading edge of robotics for people
like us to invent with so anyway having
said that I'll stop now and rich would
you like to tell us about the solution
side good good stuff I've never done in
a talk with eola before we never
rehearsed this talk before and I'm not
I'm a nerdy guy right I guess he looks
pretty nerdy too but I'm not so good at
the presentation stuff so so bear with
me I want to talk a little bit about the
the telepresence robot kit which was a
project we did back in 07 it was a
project between charm labs and Carnegie
Mellon it tries to take advantage of
every person's you know inventive power
kind of what Allah was just talking
about and essentially use telepresence
as the hook try to get kids interested
in science and technology we got some
money from Google Intel because they're
kind of their kind of scared about the
the pipeline problem you know or not as
many computer science graduates nowadays
so people invented stuff like you know
they want to check on their dog they
want to conduct their own you know
there's a picture of a Mars rover they
want to conduct their own Mars mission
in their backyard you know see what kind
of life forms are they want to invent a
robot that you know scares the heck out
of there brother you know that kind of
stuff and turkeys been very successful
but we want we want to expand it so we
first got started we had to create our
own network and we got pretty bogged
down in the networking problem because
we had to create our own our own custom
peer-to-peer technology so what we used
we relay servers essentially you know if
your device is behind a firewall or an
at router there's no way to talk to it
but there with the relay server you can
connect you know basically any two
entities on the internet but that had
scaling and bandwidth issues had latency
issues as well and it's not really where
we wanted to spend our time but we had
to do it because there's really no
solution that exists that allows you to
communicate with devices over the web so
essentially the web is broken for
devices there's there's plenty of
middleware solutions out there that
allow you to you know it's like pub/sub
kind of stuff but they kind of assume
that you have a fully connected network
and the internet isn't a fully connected
network there are existing push
technologies out there that might allow
you to talk to a device behind a
firewall but they tend to be unwieldy
and devices have you know some special
needs so we kind of invented this term
web invented web embedded devices and
essentially what it is is we're assuming
that these devices are you know pretty
small 32-bit process or you know a
couple megabytes of memory the targets
must be accessible regardless of the
topology
network you know they could be behind
firewalls net servers that kind of stuff
good bandwidth low latency that kind of
we want to avoid using relay server as
if at all possible and we don't want to
do any like crazy network configuration
stuff we don't want to you know have to
you know do any port forwarding or
assume that you know universal plug and
play is enabled earning that crap it
should just work so we sort of stumbled
on this so gtalk and lib jingle we
needed we needed a technology that you
know dealt with NAT routers and
firewalls and gtalk does that and since
it uses XMPP we can you know push RPC
you know remote procedure calls calls
through it and you know remote procedure
call is kind of the workhorse of
embedded communication and control it
also allows us to do a direct UDP
connection oftentimes between two
entities they'll do like hole punching
schemes that kind of stuff and get us a
direct connection and it does all that
kind of transparently so it's and in the
case that that doesn't work they'll
actually you know insert a message relay
so it sort is sort almost there so I
wanted to quickly illustrate an example
because I'm kind of bending some use
cases here imagine you have a small
embedded system it could be a Linux
single board computer could be an
Android platform could it be your PC
running Windows or Linux let's assume
that it can affect the environment some
way or sense it because you wouldn't
want to embed it otherwise you install
our software it you know it it runs upon
boot up you know it's just a little
server we make no assumptions about the
networking only that it has web access
it could be any kind of any kind of web
access and then it's up essentially you
know we're kind of almost there you go
to your you can go to your gtalk client
and type in something you know like you
know get power status or
or list modules or send picture and then
you'll get the information well but
there's a lot that I'm not being that's
not being said about implementation you
want to you want to have you know again
RPC implemented on both ends both on the
client and the server side you you can
interact interacting from a gtalk line
is great we want it we want to be able
to rub you see calls and texts as well
so that you can you can interact through
gtalk client as well as a web browser
and we also want client libraries that
make writing client apps easier because
you know gtalk clients are great and
read buzzers are grade and ubiquitous
but we want to have you know be able to
control these things from from custom
applications and we want to be able to
do all this easily want to be able to
set it up and configure it easily so how
could you use this I mean how useful is
this sensor networks sensor networks
kind of a hot topic it would be very
easy to create a sensor network with
this technology environmental sensing is
kind of a hot topic social proxies a
social proxy is a device that that gives
you some kind of social interaction and
for so for example a simple social proxy
would be like a ring that you wear and
it glows when your girlfriend or
boyfriend or rubbing their ring you know
it's just like a simple social
interaction a more more complicated more
complicated stuff i'll be talking about
later smarthome you could use this thing
to you know monitor your your alarm your
thermostat you guys have heard all those
scenarios unlock a unlock a you know
your front door for a guest or something
like that robot telepresence of course
this idea of embodied interaction you on
there I'm able to manipulate things in
the environment or your pet project you
know essentially this allows you to
embed any kind of you know computing in
to it anywhere and so this is my pet
project this is a really killer app by
the way so Lance he lives in Austin he's
known to ride certain routes in Austin
so what you have is a device disguised
as trash that sits on the side of the
road and it takes pictures of bikers you
know you could use like some kind of
cloud-based computing to recognize
bikers and faces and that kind of stuff
it forwards the the pictures to you and
you you look at and go that's not Lance
not that's not lance and then when you
see him you you suit up and then you
intercept him right at some rendezvous
location and then you enjoy a ride with
lands for as long as you can keep up
with them so anyway this would be really
cool I mean stole my friend so I bike in
Austin and a lot of my friends have
biked with Lance and it's kind of
frustrating they just kind of run into
him and so anyway I'm going to show them
I mean I'm gonna he's probably going to
kick my ass but he's going to see a lot
of me here's another idea this is this
is an idea it's a social proxy idea
essentially you have a device with a
speaker a camera network connection a
treat dispenser little robot treat
dispenser actually there's a video that
goes along with this oops
I don't know has anyone seen this video
is this funny stuff so essentially this
guy built this ball launcher for his dog
and sit there and play fetch with them
all day the dog gets it so so this
device also has one of these ball
launchers on it and so what you do is
using your cell phone you call your dog
you dispense a treat you know a little
button you know you go hey flat oh and
you dispense a treat and then with a
throwing motion you like throw the ball
with your dog right has a little
accelerometer in your phone and you sit
there and play tell effete with your dog
while waiting at a stoplight so in the
dog what you just yet in this case he
relives the machine but what's what's
interesting about this is essentially
you're putting your dog on the web I
mean this device is acting as a proxy
for your dog a social proxy and allows
you to interact with your dog it also
allows other people to interact with
your dog you could have it could put
your dog on a social network for example
and then they you could have your dog
could have his own friends that you that
you approve that you approve of course
and yeah we work with the robot dog yeah
that's a good point actually and what
else can I say it's uh there was some
other point about this well anyway the
I'll go on to the next example another
example would be a jelly bead dispenser
this is another really good killer app
essentially what you do is you your
social network friend gives you a jelly
bean
it could be a combo like you know to
roasted garlic one Tabasco one jalapeno
your response you know what's this chili
and then you're you're you know he
responds nope this is hot wings and so
this is like another good killer app so
you should have seen the ones that we
didn't present so this this is a good
app actually I mean we tell a pooch calm
is not taken so we're looking into it
maybe maybe investors but I'm just
kidding please another another we have
other ideas rover like robot with a
camera and grasper essentially you
conduct your own Mars mission like I was
saying before find and identify animals
insects in your backyard take pictures
you know send it to a blog automatically
a scavenger hunt search search for and
collect items escape you know you could
rig up some kind of elaborate scheme
where you you press a button it opens a
door you get a key you know yet to take
the key and then open the door and then
your escaped not the fine taught not the
fine china devised a way to break you
know a nice fine china plate which
actually was acted out in ILA's kitchen
a guy from spain had actually gotten on
his table and knocked over a plate but
luckily it also knocked over the robot
so it rendered it incapacitated so i
like to talk about a little bit about
the hardware and software ecosystem that
we've put together so innovation first
is they're there they're well known for
their vex line of robot products are
also well known for being the hardware
providers for us first which was started
by dean cayman of segway fame they
actually they actually ship more robots
than I Robot they have some robots they
have some consumer grade robots at
target and toys r us and they also the
vex robe
it's our kind of nominally geared for
education we've partnered with them they
provide the manufacturing and
distribution of the of the controller as
well as lots of other products I'm going
to hand this around that's the that's
the controller that that innovation
first charmed labs and Carnegie Mellon
has designed we've put together you know
kind of a generic operating system
called Turco as it's based on
openembedded because it uses a web
server for configuring network
encryption your password the name of the
robot that kind of thing it has drivers
for motor control general purpose io
interrupts sensor input you know all
audio voice synthesis as well as cameras
it also has a library for motor and
sensor abstraction we have our own
integrated development environment which
is based on Eclipse uses you know it has
a really simplified workflow for a high
school audience you can click on you
know connect to a certain it has buttons
on the on the right hand side or left
hand side that allow you to you know
connect to a certain robot you know
build debug you know eclipse is kind of
unwieldy so we simplified it it also
installs on Windows and Linux so we also
some of the work so that's some of the
work that we've done some of the future
work that we need to do we need a piece
of software that runs on a device or
robot something that's pretty
lightweight an Apache like server that
can handle RPC calls deal with video and
audio streams a text interface for debug
and config that mirrors the remote
procedure call interface like I was
talking about some kind of loadable
module model and it has to be you know
really easy to configure and set up
as well as client libraries we need
client libraries to create an
application you know create applications
that talk to our device / robot clients
you know could run on pcs or possibly
Android platforms we also so these
client libraries will manage the
connections dispense the RPC request
decode and render the the audio and
video see at first we're going to add
you know C++ and Java support and then
add eventually down the road javascript
so we can try to embed as much
functionality in a browser as possible
we want to create lots of interesting
robot examples that use this technology
you know possibly use Android phones to
control the devices as well as use the
Android phones as targets themselves and
we're we're just kind of getting started
we haven't we these are just kind of the
first steps here are the specs on the
Turk brain the vex pro is being passed
around it has an arm 9 200 megahertz
which is kind of passe nowadays but
that's why we're designing a new one has
32 megabytes of beer am 16 a flash which
you know that gives you just enough to
have some pretty interesting linux
functionality to USB host ports Wi-Fi
webcam support it has these motor
controllers that use the back EMF
signals from the motors for feedback so
essentially a lot of motors need like
optical encoders these use the the back
EMF voltage to actually sense the
voltage and they and they actually can
integrate the voltage to give you
position and we're able to do that
because there's a feel fpga field
programmable gate away gate array on
onboard that implements these functions
we've essentially you know created a
robot ASIC with a bunch of robot IP on
it and it's all open source you can you
can go look at it the nice thing is is
that this
about a sick we can kind of target it
for different platforms and it makes it
easy to you know you know go to
different processors and that kind of
thing it has a built-in speaker has a
keypad an LCD it's compatible compatible
with all the vex motors sensors beams
and it has it's pretty well cost
optimized it's pretty cheap so if in the
future we're working on a cortex a8
which is you know a lot of Android
phones obviously use this have has a lot
more RAM more flash what's interesting
is that it'll have two camera inputs
which means you know we will be able to
you know these are regular camera inputs
will be able to with all this processing
power will be able to do a lot of
real-time image processing and provide a
much more rich set of applications that
you can that you can handle we also have
a interesting co-branding deal with
texas instruments texas instruments is
the source of the processor they're
giving us a lot of parts including the
processor basically a cost so we're
going to be able to provide this at a
ridiculously low cost which is very
exciting and of course you know it'll
it'll have enough power to run something
like like Android so I wanted to go a
little bit into you know the ecosystem
these are these are vex parts that the
innovation first guys manufacture here's
a here's a picture of all the gears you
have spur gears pinions you have
sprockets chains you have tractor treads
you have racks you have rack gears you
have worm gears as well as bevel gears
lots of different wheels you have
regular wheels have you know these these
Universal wheels omnidirectional wheels
these things are called leg wheels that
there's a lot of different structural
members plates axles fasteners just all
sorts of stuff kind of
innocent of the rector sets but the nice
thing is you can bolt stuff on to it and
you can you can bend it so it's it's
kind of nicely inherently configurable
there's lots of sensors there's encoders
light sensors sonar sensors
accelerometers bunch of different types
of motors are different torques and
sizes tactile sensors reflect reflective
sensors controllers from 8 bit to 32 bit
they have remote controllers that that
controller which is like us you know PSP
controller is uh actually has a Wi-Fi
dongle in it there's a Wi-Fi dongle that
it uses that Wi-Fi dongle is also used
on the VEX pro there's battery chargers
there's batteries of course and then
these are pretty cool these are little
pneumatic valves that are electronically
controllable so you can make a robot
that you know can punch or throw or kick
or something like that we just could be
kind of dangerous so they have safety
goggles and here's here are some
examples of various robots that that you
can make this is bolt pulled from the
website a lot of these robots are made
by kids and here's one that suits rubber
bands has tank treads along the same
thing we have a robot that shoots a
paintball gun I don't know if the kid
actually made that but you can see it
has like one of those x10 cameras on
there this one I have no idea what it
does something to do with beer and
pouring it but I don't think a kid
invented this one I guess at this point
I'm going to turn it over to ELA cuz ela
you have we have the deal this is the
exciting stuff so this is the part where
we're going to finish and the question
was how do we recruit you right and and
what what is it that we're recruiting
you for we feel like we've got enough of
the basic ingredients that it's
interesting now for an explosion of
creativity right thing number one is of
course we'd like to get some full-time
people working on developing some of
this stuff and that's called funding and
that's not a conversation for this crowd
thing number two is you can imagine
short events we can imagine doing a
robot camp where we do one out here
we're doing in Pittsburgh
invite people to come out for two days
and give them all the parts in the world
and let them go crazy doing a heck of
but we wanted to give you something
really visceral here now today so that's
thing number three I grew up in Kansas
City part time and I had these things
called smorgasbord which were absurd
events involving ridiculous amounts of
food but it was all you can eat and the
food was pretty scary-looking but the
all-you-can-eat part was really
interesting so we come up with this idea
for you it's an all-you-can-eat deal for
you so here's the idea all right come up
with what you want to do with these
robots and we'll select some of you and
of course if you get lots of good ideas
will select lots of you actually and
we're going to give you boxes of parts
we actually came with two boxes full of
exports hear all sorts of building
materials are in these and there's the
actual of Expo controllers so that's
kind of cool right we'll give you a box
of things that you can get off the
internet and things that you can't
actually buy yet because they're not for
sale yet for three or four weeks but
we'll just do that so if you have an
interesting idea will give you stuff so
you can build it and the dream of course
is you can additionally with Android and
the robot that's the whole interesting
part but this is the best part which is
we're going to give you a coupon it's an
all-you-can-eat coupon that you can use
on the Internet to get whatever you need
from innovation first for free so that's
that's got cash a right nobody in the
world has those yet they have just been
invented by rich and innovation first so
so a that's the proposition to you is we
can give you all you can eat coupons I
think we're ready to just take questions
and see what you think of this general
direction thank you very much
so let's uh project a Dory page if we
can are we going to start with questions
from the audience than the whole figure
out how to get the Dory page projected
I'm already as you got close to the
reins right here the one thing I can't
do with this if you're running around
don't go anywhere just as anybody
because thought of making just having a
simple plug the phone in and then you
can access the dearest motifs
researchers are you right i'm wrong and
Iran you're right okay okay yeah yeah
okay I'm glad you made it ok cool well
you're sitting next to the good due to
nose well I mean so we actually I mean
agreed that that's a very good platform
I mean we're not involved yet as far as
you know using the you know an Android
handset as a compute as a robot
controller but that's like a that's a
pretty sexy platform as his wine will
explain we're here to introduce you to
each other there's one other parts to
that also low hanging over there for the
studio audience you take a picture of
them there's one other parts of that
puzzle though which is you want
something that knows how to do motor
control the FPGA is very useful for that
you want something that can deal with
the messy part of physical interaction
with sensors and motors and so the dream
is make sure we can optimize something
cost optimized something for that
whether the Android sits on the robot or
whether the Android is your social
communication media for talking to it is
another question that's interesting
we're
we have this thing announcement Bella
Rio called device top Cloud messaging
filing device messenger it uses a lot of
the same pathology that you guys were
complex
so it becomes on the network and part of
your social activist innovation out and
then reach out to these guys through the
existing network
so many many upwards weekend
it's funny I mean weird I think the only
the only bias we have with hardware is
cost I mean Android handsets for what
you get is an incredible cost you know
that you get a lot so that's great we
want to get our dream is to actually get
something down to like you know 9995 or
something like that and we can do that
just because you know because you know
consumer electronics bring everyone's
price is done
so the set of parts that you put it
there
there's a certain assumption with
that's my knees comfortable screwdriver
you not about really small kids playing
out of this would be the examinations or
less remain whether that's a little
early but the age range at AMARG it
touches I think with I think with vex
you know it's it's probably mean they
target like you know 12 and up and our
stuff you know like the the vex pro
controller you know is is even it's
actually targeted for high schoolers but
you know i mean that's that's just
that's just kind of where where we are
right now we want to once as the
software gets more and more
sophisticated interesting thing is as
the sufferer gets more sophisticated we
can bring it to more people stuff like
the App Inventor you know is would be
great you know we can actually you know
it could open up to a big much bigger
audience we actually have a program
called robot diaries for middle school
girls and their the construction
material is actually craft materials
because they're comfortable with it and
they can do aesthetically really good
robots with it so you're giving them
everything from feathers to bells to
pipe cleaners and hot glue and they make
amazing robots and you have a processor
and use we had our own iconic
programming language but now there's a
better so you can totally take this in
the middle school even and really start
to hit some underrepresented audiences
in this domain
we've done lesson plans for about
diaries for 3-4 hour lessons and for
full-on three-week-long lessons and
we've deployed them actually the
National Science Foundation just give us
a funding to do it across the public
school system in Pittsburgh so we're
going to be piloting across the whole
public school which is exciting because
you have to learn how to talk teachers
talk how to align to their curricular
standards so that we're doing for the
next two years is there any look at
actually getting kids together that have
the supplies and that people don't have
to be all the online friendships go out
of finding the craft supplies you could
get them to make their pretty robots
yeah it's the ecosystem problem you know
if vex provides this stuff i'd love to
see scholastic provide the craft box
that you need to do robot barriers for
middle schools and I think that's
totally doable once you have a once you
can demonstrate the market there will
only be too happy to sell the academic
supplies to the schools
they sell it original supplies so it's
like getting a unique skoo from them for
a set of the things that they have in
their warehouse think about 11 weeks
yeah that's what does what the target is
it's in beta about 20 people have them
so yeah it's on the omron
right right now no Dennis that's
something we're going to add later right
now we have just the abstraction
libraries I kind of so I'm going to add
it you know network abstraction I'm
going to talk about eventually we had
vision but figure out the turbo s so we
put some time
yeah you're a robot I think we're about
Diaries org or community robotics org
you should be able to get to at least
contact information for the people who
have all the curriculum in our lab three
dollars want to bring it down I think we
could do that with volume there's a
thing of ketchup
the new the new one that uses the cortex
a8 has 6 X 6 X combination found and
they may actually have been cheaper once
I don't want that key topside types i
just want to fill a little little tiny
robot you want to make a version of it
ports sockets and you're killing me we
tried well i mean one thing is i mean we
try to we try to space optimize it as
much as possible without adding much
cost and so that's that's the product
man so I think in the future you know
things will just kind of naturally tend
to shrink they also do wait yeah also
whole Rome will have you know will have
different versions that maybe don't have
as much features and then and this is
this is kind of a superset of you know
this will satisfy a lot of users we
cannot offer
that's that's like a second floor
director
closer
we're coming community are you guys
building for that staff you know the web
RPC stack that it's kind of work to be
done you how are you seeking
contributors to that and are you
organizing that ever that's a good
question we don't we don't know how
we're organizing it yet exactly but
there's a few things we can do one is we
can actually use some of the CMU
community we've done this in the past
with mini contest at CMU where we bring
them in for a week or week and give them
some challenges and have them run and
we've gotten some excellent example
application programs that way so
probably tap our local trade of
engineers who don't sleep at night first
but the idea is right to create some
kind of community it's much bigger than
that and that's part of what I think we
want advice for completely totally open
source everything is open and actually
so let me ask a question raise of hands
how many people would potentially be
even interested in hacking on something
like this building a robot well that's
good yeah there's some selection bias I
guess from the advertising poster
we do robots at Google doctor I mean how
many members we have probably a dozen
contributors and another dozen workers
the list is grown and two they get
together regularly and half and code we
get together on mondays and we're trying
to do bringing Google Apps basically
cloud robotics max in your location his
recognition robot
have you set it up set up by formulas
from let it relax no we have like half a
dozen in play the best movement boo loo
love to join like a conversation you're
talking about standardizing the commands
we standardize the few and it's really
cool when we can pull out a cell phone
and somebody's brand new robot they fire
up and they said we're just parallel
loop to the gym and you can drive it
using the code you already have but we
only have a little bit of standardized
through the solar conversation that
sounds fantastic you have a lot of
senior lettuce especially on stuff
Google's so yes plenty of people who
used to go there too well thanks for the
attention</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
