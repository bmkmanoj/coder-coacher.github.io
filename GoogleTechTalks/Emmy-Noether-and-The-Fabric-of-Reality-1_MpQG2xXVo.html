today he is a really diverse character
and I'm happy to be meeting him today in
person for the first time although we've
corresponded a bit over email he was on
the physics faculty at University of
Texas at Arlington he was a collaborator
on the team at Fermilab that discovered
the top quark he is national science and
society correspondent at examiner.com
he's a noted public speaker he's author
of numerous technical and non-technical
publications including his novel the god
patent which is the first novel to
advance from online ebook status to
print success the god patent includes a
major character based on the protagonist
of today's talk Emmy Noether I'm happy
to present and please welcome ransom
Stevens alright so how many of you have
heard of Emmy Noether before at least
before reading the god I love you
see I give this speech in the valley and
and I don't have to explain quite as
much right so as you know that Emmy know
there was a turn of the century
mathematician who lived in Germany
it's amazing I've converted this little
area to my office already so um this is
what I want to cover today and I really
appreciate you coming out and I'd like
to thank Robert for having me so here's
our agenda this is this talk is a mix of
science and history the history is
biographical of em II know there's life
and we know they're led a very
interesting life that was challenging
but she was a very happy person so we
will cover that we will talk about
another's theorem I will explain the
physics behind others theorem and more
history will go back to history with
Emmie's reality over there and then
we'll talk a little bit about two major
problems in particle physics because
they directly relate to another's
theorem first the matter/antimatter
asymmetry and then second the origin of
mass problem which translates into the
search for the Higgs boson going on at
Fermilab outside Chicago and it's CERN
straddling the Swiss French border then
finally we'll wrap up with just a few
words about Emmy Noether and then I'm
going to sell you my book we'll see
first Emmy Noether was born in 1982 in
Erlangen Germany her father was a math
professor at the University there at the
University of Airline it in 1900 when
she was 18
Emmy got a teacher certificate this was
pretty standard fare for a brilliant
young woman the plan was that she was
going to teach French and English and
German to students to girls at girls
schools but then she decided she wanted
to be a mathematician now this was kind
of a weird development in 1900
but especially 1900 Germany right
because she did have this problem with
being female and so she couldn't
register for classes at the University
she did have the advantage that she knew
a lot of the math faculty since her
father was a professor there and so she
was allowed to audit classes right we've
all thought of this I
I think every time I ever when I was an
undergraduate and took the check you
know from the financial aid office
across the street to the cashier that
three-hour thing where you stand in one
line for an hour and a half you get the
cheque you go standing in the other line
for an hour and a half you give them the
check that you know I could just take
this cheque and I could sit in on those
classes and learn the same stuff she
actually sort of did it she did her
bachelor's degree in mathematics without
ever actually enrolling in a class or
taking a test but she did take the final
exam in Europe then and still in many
cases now it's common to have one grand
exam at the end of the program upon
which all things are based and she did
very well on that exam and was granted a
bachelor's degree without ever actually
having to pay registration though I
don't know that they actually paid them
in 1904 she went ahead and applied for
graduate school and ran into many of the
same obstacles but then having performed
so well on the on the grand exam of the
undergraduate program she was allowed to
enter the university as a graduate
student and of three years later she was
obtained one of the first PhDs that was
granted to a woman in Germany
well after that what do you do right
what do you do with a math degree when
there's no software industry to go into
you want to do more math so you do some
pure math so she wants she set out for a
faculty position in Germany which was
rather ridiculous at the time of course
with that same handicap being a woman
she went to Gooding in the University of
gooding in which at the time was kind of
the center of the mathematical universe
this was a place where all the
heavyweights were working right around
right around 1907 and remember 1907 is
seven years after Planck discovered that
something was funnier about light than
was expected prior to that so it was a
very exciting time to be in math and
mathematics and mathematical physics in
particular
she took an unpaid position and what
that means basically she was teaching
some classes as a guest lecturer and
studying with doing math right cutting
edge her parents died and she got a
small inheritance from her father of
course her brother got the lion's share
of the inheritance by virtue of being a
man but she was able to survive at the
University on a combination of her
inheritance her natural lack of interest
in those things material well I don't
know if it was natural but she certainly
ended up with a lack of interest in
things material by virtue it at least of
her inability to obtain them
she was also floated the occasional
deutsche mark for covering for
professors they needed her there they
knew how good she was and she needed
some cash to stay then in 1916 she
formulated what would come to be known
as nother serum which we're going to
talk about in a minute but as she
struggled through producing lots of
papers which of course is the thing that
professors are expected to do even now
but she couldn't be a lead author on a
publication so she was a secondary
author on many major publications not
the least of which came to be known as
mother's theorem and then in 1919 it
came to the faculty a meeting of the
faculty at the University of good and
that they had this brilliant
mathematician and can we grant her a
faculty position it was 1919 which of
course it was just after the Armistice
of World War one and this is rather in
the centre of Germany in 99 that the
quote just sew in 1919 the history in
philosophy faculty in the Faculty Senate
at the University of göttingen said
what will our soldiers think when they
return to the University and find that
they are required to learn at the feet
of a woman it's unthinkable but she did
get again through the back door
what's called a privat-dozent position
which is somewhat below an
instructorship in America somewhat below
an adjunct professor position which
means basically that she was kind of a
TA like a graduate student but she
wasn't a graduate student of course
because she couldn't enroll there anyway
if she hadn't already anyway so you get
the picture
but it was finally in nineteen nineteen
twenty-two she finally got her first
academic income so let us turn now to
some of the science and knitting that it
gathers the Millers theorem is most
succinctly put like this for every
symmetry there is a corresponding
conservation law and this is how it
works rather than develop the
formalization and do a bunch of
mathematics pull up the the screens and
go forth on the whiteboard I have built
a machine and this is how it works we
take the principle of least action which
I'll describe in a minute and then a
symmetry and I will define what I mean
by symmetry in another minute we take
those we apply anothers theorem do a
bunch of math you know a couple of pages
of not even but page or so of algebra
and calculus and then bingo
out comes a law of nature okay so prior
to that when Newton devote when Newton
formulated his three laws of motion what
did he do well he observed things things
like apples falling from trees and
candles flickering and light through
glint lenses and so forth to come up
with them very empirically but now Emmy
Noether
provided some mathematical formalism
from which presented with a symmetry a
law of nature could be derived so
something very special is going on in
there oh and here's of course a copy of
the original paper sure you've all read
that already in the German and digested
it good so the first ingredient to
developing the laws of nature is the
principle of least action now the
principle of least action is a
nating thing and if it were attributable
to one person then I would have an
accompanying talk about that one person
but it's not
it started in optics the observation of
the way that light rays travel by format
and then Moe patois another one of the
French mathematicians of the 1700s
formulated a more general theory which
was then elaborated by Euler Lagrangian
finally Hamilton put it together in the
fashion that we know today and basically
it is this stuff happens in such a way
that a quantity defined as the action is
a minimum and the way I've always
explained this very hand-waving li is
that the universe is lazy and it will
take the path from point A to point B
whether that is cooling a beer in the
fridge or the trajectory of a of a golf
ball or what-have-you the trajectory of
an electron through a circuit board
nature is going to do it in the way that
is easiest and by easiest mathematically
what I mean is that the action is
minimized now the action is defined up
there to be the sum of the difference in
kinetic energy and potential energy as
things happen all right so if we take
any system and add up the difference in
kinetic and potential energy the energy
of motion and the energy available to do
work add that up over each incremental
step of the system and then postulate
all possible steps the actual process
will be that which minimizes this
quantity the action so here's an example
the golf ball flying across a golf
course we add up the action if we follow
the yellow line which is kind of a weird
trajectory it might have then the action
will be larger than the orange line
which is also clearly a non-physical
trajectory
which is larger than the actual path
which the golf ball takes so that's how
it works that's the principle of least
action the first ingredient
the second ingredient is symmetry now
what I mean by symmetry is this if we
take a uniform sphere in the top left
and rotate it it looks the same doesn't
matter which access we rotate it about
but the sphere always looks like a
sphere if we go to the top right and
look at a disc a disc looks the same
about rotations through and about an
axis that goes through its center okay
so those are simple continuous
symmetries an example of a discrete
symmetry is what you have when you look
in the mirror I look the same except
that left and right are switched okay so
that's a discrete symmetry so that's
what I mean by symmetry now we have the
principle of least action and symmetry
so let's plug them in tune into another
theorem okay so that's what we do and
here's what we're going to do we're
going to posit a symmetry the first
symmetry we're going to pause it is very
straightforward and it is spatial
translation now if I look out upon the
universe it looks the same if I'm
standing here as if I'm standing over
here okay
or even farther away the universe is
more or less isotropic another way of
looking at this and probably a more
accurate way is to say that if I do an
experiment here I will get the same
result is if I do that experiment over
there okay that spatial translation now
that symmetry all I do is switch in my
equations X prime to X plug that in to
the principle of least action and use
the mechanics of nathers theorem and lo
and behold we get Newton's first and
second laws conservation of energy
covers them both force equals mass times
acceleration and a body that is in
uniform
Oshin will continue in in uniform motion
until it is acted upon by a force which
is easier stated as a conservation law
the conservation of momentum so what
this tells us is that there is something
very fundamental between the
relationship of the geometry of space
just moving along one coordinate system
in a straight line and momentum alright
the dynamics of the laws of motion are
determined by the geometry of space
simple linear geometry okay so let's do
it again here's a better one let's say
if I do an experiment now I will get the
same result is if I do that same
experiment now time translations very
much like spatial translations only now
I'm saying well let's switch from T to T
Prime in the principle of least action
so we've applied those we stick it in
another theorem we turn our mathematical
crank and we get conservation of energy
which for my money is is really very
fundamental the conservation of energy
is something that we bump into pretty
much all the time
no perpetual motion machines no way to
derive energy without doing something
right
say spilling oil all over the Gulf it's
not funny
but it might as well be so this is the
first law of thermodynamics and we have
tied it to the way that time evolves in
the universe there's something extremely
poignant about that I don't know what it
is but energy and time are intricately
related through another's theorem this
very simple symmetry comes right out so
the story goes on if we rotate a system
right if I do an experiment it with this
orientation I get the same results if I
rotate the whole thing around
and do the experiment like this that
gives us conservation of angular
momentum which is the cod which is the
reason that when you write a bicycle
it's easier to stay vertical when you're
moving then when you're at a stop also
it's why top stay up it's why tornadoes
form it's why the water goes down the
sink the way it does with the vortex so
this is what I mean when I put in the
title of this talk the fabric of reality
it's not just that I like to say fabric
of reality
who doesn't like saying fabric of
reality anyone I didn't think so
okay there's one guy there always is
love that guy so another's theorem shows
that the laws of nature result from
symmetries from geometries in this the
universe that we live in the laws of
motion are tied to spatial geometries
work heat mass all forms of energy are
tied to the way that time evolves to
duration and then what this starts to
indicate is that space and time are a
thing that they have some properties
that affect the stuff that fills them
that in fact the laws of nature are not
dictated by the stuff so much is by the
background the painting is dictated more
by the canvas than the paint if you will
canvas being a fabric see tying that
around yes we D so a vacuum is then we
start to get a hint that it's a
complicated state so now let's go back
and we know there has just had her um
has had her her theorem published it
makes some waves and these are her
mentors and friends they're the
University of getting it during her
tenure there from 1908 to 1931 these are
some big names in 20th century
mathematics Felix Klein from the Klein
Kaluza formulations Hermann Minkowski
did it from a tremendous amount of work
in the geometry behind general
relativity David Hilbert did the
mathematics for advanced quantum
mechanics Hermann vile did the geometry
and math for a great deal of quantum
mechanics major dudes and Emmie was
there with them the whole time and in
1920 is quoted here Hermann vile said to
the Faculty Senate I am ashamed to
occupy such a preferred position beside
a me whom I know to be my superior and
among these guys they are all close to
her Felix Klein was one of her closest
friends well I guess I can't really say
that the biography of amia is sparse so
it's 1931 1932 Germany Emmy Noether is
Jewish she's an intellectual you know
they always come after the intellectuals
first you notice that it doesn't matter
the the Communists came after the Stalin
went after the intellectuals Taliban
went after the intellectuals
some of the Republicans come after the
intellectuals they always come after the
intellectuals first and she was also a
liberal pacifist she really wasn't on
board with World War one so what happens
well you know what happens
so this bozo was not Emmys friend and
she was one of the first six professors
in Germany to be fired now her brother
who I haven't mentioned was also a math
professor her brother took their
father's position at the university of
air land and when in 1931 when the
writing on the wall was becoming clear
it was much clearer for intellectuals
than it was were for academics than it
was for people in business but they had
to leave they couldn't make a living it
was unpleasant her brother went to went
to Siberia went to a university in
Vladivostok which eventually became a
pretty big university but there was a
hiccup there and Emmy didn't want to go
there because it wasn't
where all the math was going where all
the math was going on and there is there
is one line of thought that permeates
amy's existence and that is a deep
passion for doing mathematics it's
simply what she wanted to do she never
got notoriety while most of you have
heard of her you also know that very few
people out there have but they've all
heard of Einstein so that's who she
turned to in 1933 for help she wanted to
go to the United States and Albert
Einstein convinced this the Rockefeller
Foundation to match the emergency
committee to aid displaced German
scholars and got this woman who has set
the stage for formulation of the laws of
nature from fundamental symmetry got her
a one-year gig at Bryn Mawr and for the
first time in her life she actually had
an official faculty position a one-year
position now a little bit of background
on Emmys relationship with Einstein she
did a lot of the mathematics that tensor
mathematics the multi-dimensional matrix
formulations that are needed to describe
warp space times she set up a great deal
of that mathematics that he ended up
using so they knew each other and and
Einstein was her mentee a year after
that when her position ended she had to
once again scramble for to have it
extended all right it's kind of weird
right perhaps the greatest mathematician
alive at that time and she can't get a
job at Bryn Mawr while her mentee is of
course leading the Institute for
Advanced Study at Princeton such as it
was thing is I don't think Emmy really
cared that much as long as she could
find a place to do math so let's carry
on the goat go back to the science now
the interesting thing in physics is when
the theory falls apart what happens when
it doesn't work
that's what experimental
always want proving a theory works is
boring but if you can take something
that is on the pedestal and knock it off
ah that's the that is where careers are
made so we look at this and say well
what happens when we think we have a
symmetry and then we plug it in
principle released action apply the
symmetry turn the mathematical crank
through anothers theorem and we get a
result something that ought to be a law
of nature if that symmetry is truly
symmetric so we apply that that in that
well the principle of least action is
built on a pretty strong foundation
anothers theorem is simply mathematics
right so you can prove it it's
mathematics let's prove it there's
nothing really to question there so what
you would question is the symmetry at
the other end your hypothesis so what do
you do well of course I have another box
this one considerably more expensive
than the mathematics the experimental
green box so what do you do you do some
experiments and you find out do the
predictions as that law of nature does
it hold up to experimental scrutiny if
not then it's what you call a broken
symmetry and broken symmetries then beg
a lot of questions what is their
ultimate impact on the nature of matter
so here are some interesting symmetries
they look at first glance some of them
look at first glance as if they oughta
obviously hold for example parity parity
is this left left right switch when you
look in a mirror if I do remember when I
when we did time translation the issue
was if I do an experiment here I get the
same result as if I do it over here
right time translation now parity this
switching of left/right means if I do an
experiment here do I get the same result
is if I do that experiment and rather
than watch the experiment in what rather
than take the data from the actual
experiment if I take the data from the
mirror image do I get the same
results seems like you probably would
doesn't it well you almost always do so
it's kind of obvious symmetry but you
plug it in and something strange happens
now here's here's another Simha to
symmetry time reversal if instead of
going forward in time if I go backward
will things look the same well it really
doesn't seem like it because my hair's
not getting any less gray right time has
an arrow so this looks to me like a
completely obviously broken symmetry but
if you look at the laws of nature
you know the trajectory of a particle
the evolution of simple systems not big
statistical systems but systems where
you can track every piece the equations
are symmetric under time translation so
at the fundamental level there's this
problem that time translation looks
mathematically like it ought to be a
symmetry though it clearly violates
something in fact it violates the third
law of thermodynamics entropy increases
so there's something funny there now
here's another one that's somewhat more
esoteric that we need to string all this
together and that's called charge
conjugation now a charge conjugation is
that we switch all of the charges of
matter the opposite way so for example
we take an electron turn it into a
positron we make it from negative to
positive we just switch the charges of
everything a proton becomes an
antiproton now charge conjugation
amounts to switching matter and
antimatter
now since antimatter is defined to be
the equal of matter except for this
change then in a universe full of
antimatter we would certainly expect the
laws of nature to be the same everything
would look the same it just have flip
charges instead of having electrons
flowing through motherboards you'd have
positrons big deal okay but there's
something funny there too right because
this is an annoying problem is that in
every
ace where matter is created from energy
there are always equal amounts of matter
and antimatter so how come this universe
has almost all matter and almost no
antimatter there's a huge broken
symmetry so one of the experiments
that's been going well various
experiments that have been carried out
since the mid 60's have been trying to
figure out what where's this broken
symmetry so let's have a quick look at
that first we switch the direction of
time and we do the left-right switch and
we switch all these charges we we apply
all three of these apparent symmetries
at once and lo and behold the product of
them all seems to hold it seems to hold
okay it holds in every case but if we
reduce that if we remove the switching
of forward and past if we remove the
time translation symmetry then and we
apply just this left-right the parity
and the matter/antimatter
switching of charge then there is a
broken symmetry there are just a tiny
handful of processes involving these
esoteric particles K ons and B mesons
things that we just don't bump into
every day and there's this little itty
bitty asymmetry there where there's a
tiny tiny bit more matter than there is
antimatter that gives us two things
first it gives us a hint as to why
there's more at matter than antimatter
in the universe but more interesting
than that well I don't know but equally
interesting to that is that if CP if the
product of Si and ki is broken but the
product of CP and T is not broken then
that means that somewhere along the line
that time reversal is broken too so we
can all breathe a sigh of relief because
the third law of thermodynamics is then
allowed to continue because there is a
broken symmetry don't know what it is
trying to figure
it out so finally the standard model has
a problem the standard model is this is
this great big theory which is built on
on way too many experimental details it
involves nature at its most fundamental
level all of the matter that we are
aware of that we can easily observe is
made up of these things quarks and
leptons and force fields that are given
there on the side photons gluons Z's WS
and I drew in the big G for graviton we
don't need to know what any of those are
to realize that the standard model of
physics it'd be perfectly happy if none
of these things had any mass at all but
once again we have a great deal of
empirical evidence that we have mass and
in many cases our masses increasing as
we eat more there's mass where did it
come from how did it happen in fact if
we do a rotation among all these
particles just switch their names and
leave the masses out none of the laws of
physics change okay
there is a problem this is the origin of
mass problem and this guy here Peter
Higgs at st. Andrews University I think
maybe Edinburgh he's a Scotsman he
formulated a theory about and to say he
formulated the theories really giving me
more credit than he deserves but there
is a lot of theory behind broken
symmetries and he used that to
hypothesize a particle which appears
when a symmetry is broken in a certain
way and he called it the Higgs boson
well I discovered a particle that
decayed very quickly I called it the are
because I thought I'd be too obvious if
I called it the s because my last name
is Stevens I thought I could get it by
but the are the Ransom but everyone knew
so this is what you do anybody here ever
solved a differential equation yeah so
you know differential equations what a
pain in the ass there's really for an
interesting differential equation there
is no
simple pedestrian way we start here we
try you know we do go through these
steps to get the solution they just
don't work that way there's a few that
do but they don't
those ones aren't on the final right so
what you do is you learn a lot and what
it looks like when you're a freshman and
you have a TA who solves the problem on
the on the whiteboard it looks like
she's pulling something out of her hat
it's like I'll never think of that and a
test there's no way I'm just going to
come up with that but later as you
become a junior and senior you realize
that the building up of experiment of
experience gives you an edge and what
that edge is is you try things that
worked before and that's how you solve
differential equations well that's how
you do most of mathematics and physics
is you need to just start trying stuff
it's like debugging problems with
Microsoft code right it's not working
what do you do well just go to options
go to the next thing it's going to work
eventually reboot a couple of times get
star office so here the thing is
magnetism is a similar case in a magnet
a magnet is manifestly asymmetric right
it's got a north pole a South Pole but
the equations that describe magnetism
are radially symmetric the equations
have spherical symmetry the solutions do
not they like to have North and South
Poles their dipoles they like to be
quadruples they don't have radial
symmetry so that's similar to what's
going on in the standard model so what
we do is is we try the same thing so
with another interesting thing with
magnets which is directly related is
that if you take a bar magnet you heat
it up there is a well-defined
temperature called the Curie point where
it loses its magnetism where the
equations that describe that magnetic
field go from being manifestly
asymmetric to being Bing at one
temperature they suddenly become
radially symmetric starts to sound a lot
like what might have happened at the Big
Bang a very hot you
verse cools and as it cools something
happens so this is this is what happens
particles at a obtain their masses
through interaction with something that
pervades that permeates the vacuum the
vacuum really is something special and
it's got this background the canvas of
this of this painting might be the Higgs
field that heavy particles are
constantly interacting that the Higgs is
slowing them down like a viscous fluid
whereas massless particles don't
interact with the Higgs they go zipping
right through photons light is massless
so where the island or iron filings line
up with the magnetic field the particles
line up with the Higgs field the top is
the heaviest one on there 171 times the
mass of a proton and it lines up with
that Higgs really sharp it's got a very
very strong coupling so that's the idea
of how the Higgs works so now we turn to
the straw experiment this is very
high-tech who wants a strong who wants
to get carry on this experiment with me
some of these symmetries have been
broken before just fix your straw and go
with it
it's an advantage to giving this in the
oh my there's no end of straws over
there let's not so this is the idea okay
at the beginning the big bang at the
beginning of time the beginning of space
the beginning of space-time the universe
was so hot
thank you see Carson goes off the air
and no one knows the line how hot was it
yes it was so hot that the energies of
these particles were just way way bigger
than their rest energy than their mass
so if we look at I'm Stein's famous
equation equals MC squared and then
write it down the way it's actually used
by physicists which is to say it's the
rest mass and zero times the speed of
light squared plus the energy of motion
in this case the thermodynamic energy
that that thermodynamic energy was so
much larger than the rest energy that it
was effectively massless that these
particles were massless okay
when it was hot so then the universe
cooled universe cools we press down on
the straw and as it cools more and more
the straw bends it picks a direction and
bends it's no longer it no longer has
that typical spherical or cylindrical
symmetry that we look for in a straw
it's a broken symmetry and when that
symmetry breaks the particles begin to
interact with the Higgs and obtain mass
the Higgs then becomes prominent at
those temperatures and below so you look
at your straw and you say but you know
it didn't have this quirky little thing
in it then maybe if I pressed it just
right with all perfect symmetry than it
had collapse on itself like that kind of
like flipping a coin and having it land
on its side you've probably managed to
do it but I bet you couldn't right now
something happens now whether the
universe was symmetric before it cooled
or whether there was an underlying
asymmetry that caused this symmetry to
be broken in a given way just like the
straw chooses a direction when I push
down on it I don't know doesn't really
matter the particles have mass so this
is then the fabric of reality with the
Higgs boson so the geometry of
space-time dictates the laws of nature
nathers theorem gives us that the
space-time vacuum is saturated with this
Higgs field so if we want to detect this
Higgs field well how do you detect the
canvas on a painting you're looking at
the painting right how do you do it well
you have to bring the canvas to light
you got to move some paint off you have
to do something and here we have to
inject energy into the system the
current state of our space-time interval
any random spot the spot of space-time
right here in my hand is too cool for
there to be any Hague so we have to
inject energy and to get one to pop out
so the idea is basically like this if we
think of the Higgs field as a as a pool
of water than a wave in that pool is a
Higgs particle we have to give them
energy so yes there's your the
experiment the very expensive green box
of experiment is this true or false it's
a broken symmetry we have a concrete
prediction do an experiment so that's
what these experiments are doing at
Fermilab and at CERN the Tevatron at
Fermilab which is in Batavia Illinois
there are two experiments the d0
experiment and the CDF experiment these
are great big things four stories high
and I think d0 ended up costing I want
to say 200 million just for the detector
not including the accelerator and then
there's at CERN the Atlas experiment
there's two major experiments there that
will be looking for the Higgs the Atlas
experiment which is an acronym Atlas
stands for a toroidal LHC apparatus
Atlas yeah real creative these guys and
there's another one the CMS which is
compact muon solenoid so there are these
two experiments going on and they are
dumping literally dumping energy into
the vacuum and try and look for certain
signatures that will tell them if there
is a Higgs now interesting thing there
are various constraints that you can put
from other measurements where the Higgs
where evidence of the Higgs must lie
even though it's not clear evidence that
limits the the processes so that if the
Higgs is not found at either Fermilab or
CERN then it's out of play that
mechanism doesn't work and if that
happens well then things get even more
interesting right the experimental of
the theorists I bet Peter Higgs is
really like for the Higgs to be detected
in his lifetime that would be tidy and
nice but the experimentalists across the
hall from them no Higgs they want
Technicolor Technicolor would be cool
because it's another layer off the onion
we had that little chart of quarks and
leptons Technicolor would say that
there's another layer that quarks and
leptons can be broken up into smaller
things that's always kind of you know
the first knee-jerk response since we've
all seen the the way things go right you
have atoms then atoms are made up of
stuff then protons are made up of stuff
it only seems natural there's another
layer and there's other approaches one
of the interesting ones is that there
could be extra dimensions that there
could be something happening in an extra
dimension that leaks into our reality
and gives these particles mass finally
Emmy Noether all these laws all these
theories that involve symmetry are built
on top of nethers theorem in fact
superstrings the standard model of the
standard model of physics these are all
called gauge theories and gauge theories
are built immediately on another serum
every law everything that they predict
is ultimately predicted by something
that you can get using another's theorem
so that's the reason that I think that
emmy noether made arguably the most
important discovery of humanity
this relationship between the fabric of
reality and the way reality is how it
works the effect of the canvas on the on
the painting so anyway so she did she
moved to Bryn Mawr where she got a
one-year position which she was got
generously extended for a year she had a
reputation for being a very challenging
teacher she was the kind of teacher who
would put a really hard problem on the
board and then ask you how to do it by
name and this can be very painful right
but she was one of those teachers that
we've all had that at first we hated and
then as time went on we realized now wow
she's really cluing me into something
there's something special here and then
you really learned so she had a squad of
students that followed her around in
Germany that ended up being called
another's boys of course she didn't have
any female students because there
weren't any and then she went to Bryn
Mawr where it was an all-female school
and it was the first time she'd have
she'd had female colleagues and she was
very very happy there but in the in
during her second year as an instructor
at Bryn Mawr she didn't feel well and
she didn't tell anybody about it she
went to the doctor and the next day she
missed her lecture and no one was like
Emmy Noether misses a lecture has never
been done before and history but she was
dead so she went to the doctor she had
an ovarian cyst it was removed it was
1935 things didn't go too well and she
died two days later but that's why I set
this here that from my impression of
researching her is that this lack'd is
complete lack of notoriety that she had
through her life and after her life I
don't think it mattered to her I think
she was very happy I think she really
enjoyed doing mathematics she was well
known for doing things like walking into
you know walking into walls and stuff
thinking about math and forgetting
things except her students and her
classes so those are good reasons to
remember emmy noether
and she's not completely without
notoriety you can see
picture up here which is on a library at
a girls school in her hometown of
Erlangen they ought to trim the bushes
out of the way but it's it's a it's a
plaque in her honor and she is honored
and in various spots including Bryn Mawr
and now at Google so here's a list of
things she did and if any of you are
real pure mathematicians then you might
be writhing in your seat that I didn't
even mention her most important
contributions because I don't really
understand them so I wasn't going to
mention them but I figured some of you
might have known them but she did a
tremendous amount of work in non
commutative algebra as you remember that
that's where the law of the distributive
property doesn't work a times B is not
equal to B times a and group theory
which all seems to have to do with
Donuts and hyper complex numbers and
rings and the theory of ideals and rings
is known to be one of her greatest
contributions but as a physicist and as
an existence in this universe for my
money no there's theorem was really huge
for all of us so how does that fit in
well Robert told you at the beginning
that this brilliant novel that was
composed by someone in the room involves
a character that is based very loosely
on Emmy Noether my characters named Emmy
nutter and I proposed this that had Emmy
Noether
grown up in 1980s Los Angeles she would
have been quite like my character I mean
it her but Emmy Noether grew up in the
kaisers Germany it's the only reason
they were different truth is when I
wrote this book and we know there was
sort of a hero of mine just by being a
physicist and so I mean the the first
chapter where she appears it's her
giving a lecture of teaching her
students at Cal Miller's theorem but she
doesn't call it that she doesn't say
what it is um but when I wrote the book
I hadn't done any research on her at all
I did all the research afterwards so by
very loosely I mean very loose
based so this is my book I have a few
copies if you want it you're welcome to
buy it on Amazon I actually get a really
nice royalty if you get it there it is
available of course in Kindle and so
forth and what I want you to do if you
can just take a couple more minutes is I
have some evaluation forms I'd really
appreciate it if you could crank them
out real quick let me hand them to you
now that'd be okay all right thanks
so while he's working out the story with
the evaluation forms I'll ask the first
question this question is actually
inspired by a piece of email I got from
someone who I don't know whether this
person was able to attend the talk or
not but someone someone sent me email
and said just a question for ransom
Stevens and I won't tell you initially
what the question was because that'll
make it easier to answer that well I
want you to answer a different question
I why this is a question begged by the
question I was asked to proxy to you an
email so another theorem that you told
us about starts you with asymmetry and
gives you a conservation law and the
question begged by the question I got an
email is is it the case then that for
every conservation law there is a
symmetry yes for every conservation law
there is a symmetry so the question I
got an email is a given conservation of
information in quantum mechanics what is
the corresponding symmetry I don't know
it's a very interesting question I don't
know I don't know I gather the person
who asked didn't know either
yes I bet this person didn't know but
information is it is now I don't know
the answer but it's certainly worth
worth trying to dig up I know some
people that I can ask sorry so first
thanks for the talk if I only understood
half of what you said would have been
even better question is I think I read
this morning or maybe yesterday
something about in the LHC there was
this experiment that the results seemed
to indicate there's there might be five
different mass Higgs bosons or something
yeah one of the things about the Higgs
is that it takes more than one and there
could be a lot of them okay the Higgs
the Higgs gets complicated very quickly
yes there's likely if there is a Higgs
there's probably five is a good number
five is I think the minimal number one
for each generation
and they couple differently and they'll
have different properties some of them
might be charged the minimal Higgs boson
is a neutral scalar it's a neutral
spinless object I'm curious with the
title why the god patent oh the god
patent the reason that my book is titled
to God Pat and I did not pay him to ask
this question the reason that this book
is titled to God patent is this it's the
story of a laid-off engineer trying to
rebuild his life after making a great
deal of stupid decisions okay so he was
in 1999 he was working for a company in
Norton North North Dallas that did fiber
optics and it just started doing fiber
optics right it was 1999 I was a very
exciting time to be in high tech and as
you probably did when you were first
hired here at Google in his orientation
package there was a memo that said if
you submit a patent you will get a bonus
and if you if that patent is then
granted you will get another bonus and
so Ryan McNear and his buddy foster read
two of the characters in this book
sitting there looking at it and Ryan
says you know we got a couple of hours
and the patent attorneys for this
company they don't know anything about
the kind of high tech were doing let's
just crank some of these out we can get
a boat so they did and what Ryan thought
of was to define to submit a patent
which ultimately was patenting the soul
and calling it software algorithm that
it was a neural network that begot other
neural networks in a semi biblical way
but it was artificial intelligence
dressed up and enough in enough
engineering ease that it could ease that
it could get by the patent examiner's
for that company he didn't expect it to
be granted but it was his friend foster
patented creation inmate called it of
course a power source a generator
our generator now so this is kind of
funny right then you submit some crazy
thing you dress it up in enough
engineering jargon and it actually gets
granted as a patent I'm sure no one in
this room has ever done that but I know
a guy who works at a company that makes
semi processors over here somewhere or I
guess over there somewhere
and he has the patent for drilling a
hole in fiberglass not vertically right
that'd be a via in fr4 right but he
drilling it horizontally patented that
called it an optical coupling channel
and dressed it up in a great deal you
know lots of lots of flow diagrams and
stuff but boils it down horizontal hole
in the fiberglass you can have to pay
Intel royalties for that bad boy next
question any questionable okay so in the
abstract you said that nether serum was
violated and you would give examples but
my understanding is that it only applies
to continuous symmetries so so it
wouldn't apply to your discrete no it
does it applies to discrete symmetries
in fact one some slides that I actually
left out because we didn't have time is
that the first one you learned the first
application of another third theorem
that you do in a textbook in quantum
physics is is the conservation of charge
and that's actually a discrete symmetry
you multiply a phase to the wave
equation and then go through
Schrodinger's equation and require that
nothing changed right because just
altering a phase can't change anything
and and charge conservation comes right
out comes out of the global the global
phase yeah
I actually wanted to comment on the
popularity of north around the relative
popularity among mathematicians and
physicists because in algebra for
example it is completely impossible to
publish a paper without mentioning your
theory and ring whereas in physics it is
still possible to publish a page it is
possible not mention the author's
theorem right thank you I in defence of
mathematics you don't get that at the
cat at the Atlas cafe in San Francisco
there's a really dumb question I'm sure
but you said that you talk about
experiments and their results being
invariant I mean I wonder what you meant
by oh variant experiment over space a
because if I take a measurement on my
GPS and then do it over there the
results different right
so that experiments not invariant yeah
you didn't move out of the whole system
okay yeah yeah the whole experiment the
whole system you're doing needs to move
right or you're changing the symmetry of
the system but for GPS if you measure
GPS I think a way you could you could
gauge that is that you throw out a you
measure it twice right you measure with
how far you're moving away with a
yardstick
so you actually measure and then you put
in the right X Prime and that will
change your result your measured result
and your predicted result and you get
the same okay so you do you can't sweep
anything under the rug except the
isotropy of space that is that what
we're testing is that it we have one
more another
it's about the higgs-boson so I heard
that the way that the expose on would
explain all the masses of the
fundamental particles is that different
particles would couple to the higgs
field with different strengths and so if
we indeed find the Higgs boson then
aren't we just exchanging all these mass
values with a set of coupling constants
to explain I mean it's it's like we're
exchanging a set of unknowns within a
set of unknown so what's my what's the
advance in that case right this is a
good point and it up frequently
experiments feel like this right that's
the the issue of we answer one question
and it brings up more and more so the
answer is that if we discover the Higgs
boson that hopefully will make
measurements that will dictate what the
how it couples to different particles
but they'll all type be tied back to the
way that the symmetry breaks or to
something fundamental yeah if if we have
to if we have a different coupling for
every particle that exists that has mass
then we haven't bought ourselves
anything we're just in fact we've lost
because we got more particles and more
in the same number of things we have to
measure so that doesn't get us farther
down the road but the thinking is that
understanding the mechanism will will
get us farther before we let you close I
just want to check and see if there are
any questions from the remote sites okay
looks like there are not are there any
more questions here please help me thank
dr.
