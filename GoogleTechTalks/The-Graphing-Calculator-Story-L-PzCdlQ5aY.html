Seattle engineering office as a software
engineer in 1992 I was hired as an
independent contractor at Apple computer
to write operating system code for a
experimental hardware project on that
project I met Ron of a sewer he was also
an independent contractor doing software
for they for the project Ron's here to
tell the story of what we did after that
project ended thank you for inviting me
let me apologize in advance there would
be no actual technical content in this
tech talk I'm turning 40 next week and
so I apologize if I become maudlin but
I'm taking this opportunity to embrace
becoming an old codger by reminiscing
publicly about the adventures of my
youth I started programming in 70s back
when programs were stored on punched
cards and the VT 55 terminal was
newfangled I was a faculty brat at
Lehigh University so I had access to all
sorts of toys as a yungin when I started
college at Stanford in 1984 the
Macintosh was brand new and it was an
interesting time to be on campus looking
at computer use because when I started
college in 1984 there were max on campus
I had one and Stanford was nerdy adopter
but largely and nearly all the students
still use typewriters and the
interesting thing to see was that the
original Macintosh along with McCreight
1 point 0 was so amazingly easy to use
and easy to learn that you could take
someone and I did this many times
someone who had never touched a computer
before was completely non technical sit
them down in front of the original mac
and in five minutes of instruction with
mccrite they would learn everything they
need to know and it would be blindingly
obvious to them immediately
that they could get the paper written
that they had to have written that night
they could get the job done quicker
using the computer even after they took
into account the learning curve and so
in terms of ease of use and ease of
learning that's a very strong statement
that you could take someone that's a
complete novice and it's just obvious to
them that yes this tool does the job
better even even with the time it takes
me to learn it I was studying physics at
the time so most of my time was spent
doing mathematical problem sets it
involves staying up late at night
writing out 10 or 20 pages of algebra
for each one and what it was ironic that
I was watching essentially the last
years of the typewriter go away as word
processing was just obviously the right
way to do things and at the same time
the computer was far more useful to my
colleagues writing English papers than
to me doing math for the the math I was
doing the computers were just not at all
useful it wasn't that the math was
difficult I had access to systems that I
was familiar with the state of the art
and computer algebra at the time which
was maxima and reduced and
mathematically they could do any of the
sorts of things we were doing in our
problem sets but the time it took to
formulate your problem in their command
line interface struggle with their
syntax and then interpret the result in
a way that's presentable as a document
was for more time than it took to just
do everything out longhand with pencil
and paper and fundamentally that's the
user interface problem so I took some
time off from school to develop software
to essentially do for mathematical
problem sets what word processors 24
people writing prose this became
Macintosh product around 1987 called
Milo that was billed as a math processor
for students during problem sets it
integrated text equations and graphics
in a document the equations were WYSIWYG
they appeared in the standard textbook
notation as you entered them and you
could manipulate them doing the sort
serve algebra and calculus things that
students would be doing as
undergraduates
while the original product myla wasn't a
commercial success it was influential on
a number of other products and the
source code from it I licensed out to a
number of other companies that were was
later embedded in other products the its
biggest limitation just as a tool for
students was that the word processing
and it was extremely minimalist it was
too weak even to do the simple things
that students needed so I went out
looking for companies to essentially
embed the Milo software in their word
processor and ended up at frame
technology they were looking for a
mathematical typesetting system for
frame-maker 2 point 0 and I worked there
for a while embedding embedding the
mathematical typesetting for Milo into a
framemaker all of the computation that
went into it all of the computer algebra
system essentially came along for free
and they left it in just to give the
sales folks more buttons to push for an
to make demos they didn't quite realize
what they had until it had been shipping
for awhile and someone at an Arizona
nuclear plant sent in a bug report to
the forum it evaluates this particular
integral incorrectly but at that point
they were committed
so free maker was a beautiful system
it's still shipping today and free math
is still derivative from the original
work I did on Milo I was at the time I
was proud to be responsible for the only
page layout and word processing program
that would evaluate derivative
symbolically and multiply matrices and
have serious mathematical underpinning
but it still wasn't ideal for students
and again it was fundamentally about a
question of the user interface the there
are a number of problems with user
interface in mathematics the most
fundamental one is that mathematical
notation evolved for use with pencil and
paper it involves a much larger
character set than you typically find on
a keyboard and it's intrinsically
two-dimensional so after working at
frame for a while I went off on my own
and did what many others have done i
wrote handwriting recognition system
that could handle a large character set
for mathematical symbolism Greek letters
and also parse the two-dimensional
structure of the mathematics as you
write write it on a tablet I took the
version of Milo which embedded the
handwriting recognition so that you
could essentially write on a piece of
right on a tablet is for a piece of
paper equations and text and scribbles
and be able to manipulate the equations
and then started taking that to hardware
companies look at the time when go and
momenta and pen computing were very
popular looking for a hardware platform
that would be appropriate and this is
how I ended up at Apple I had what was
an impressive demo of pen computing but
still was a long way from a useful
product and needed a hardware platform
that was suitable for it this is where I
met Greg so after a year working on a
secret hardware project at apple and I
won't go into any details on that
ultimately the project was cancelled
and while on the one hand the that the
time working at Apple was both it was
very educational working in system
software and also very educational being
part of a large company when the project
was cancelled it was in one sense a
relief because the harbor project we
were part of was having problems and but
in another sense it was extremely
frustrating that essentially a year of
work was completely wasted so at this
point I decided that I wanted to stay
and finish it so that it wasn't a waste
as the hardware project was winding down
one fellow would visit my office almost
daily and tell me that the therapy see
group which was down the hall was
building some exciting Harbor and I
really had to meet them but while while
working on this other project I was too
busy so after the original project was
canceled I went and visited the folks at
PowerPC who were interested in the work
I was doing but were unable they were
too busy with her own work just to be
able to hire me so this this one fellow
brought another friend of his into my
office after the project was cancelled
and just camped out there for the night
decided we decided that they were going
to port our software software I had been
working on to the power pc hardware and
they they spent until the wee hours of
the morning going through fifty thousand
lines and getting it to run as a PowerPC
native application at the time the only
way to build on powerpc was to
cross-compile from an IBM rs.6000
workstation so it was a difficult piece
of porting in the the PowerPC wasn't
shipping yet the software tools for it
weren't ready yet and there wasn't a lot
of expertise and how to build
applications for it but after after many
hours we got its to compile and Link
and then took it down to the next
building were one of them knew where
there was one of the rare PowerPC
prototypes the first time we launched it
the the monitor attached to the
prototype caught on fire and started
smoking again I could not make this up
the fellow just shrugged and unplugged
the monitor and carried it out onto the
balcony to avoid setting off the smoke
detectors plugged in another monitor and
tried again and we were very impressed
on the PowerPC machine it was running 50
times faster than it had been on the
development machine I had been working
on before things that had previously
been taking five seconds of frame were
suddenly animating at ten frames a
second it was a a qualitative difference
in what you could do with the machine a
qualitative difference in the behavior
they just looked at it and said this
doesn't suck which at Apple of the time
was high praise typically people in
system software was struggled to make
small improvements and if they were able
to improve something a little they would
praise it by saying that sucks less so
at this point we had an impressive demo
we had a native PowerPC application
almost the only one in existence because
everyone in Apple that's working on the
PowerPC at this time and this is in
August of 93 is completely focused on
just getting the hardware to run getting
everything to run correctly under
angulation and no one has spare time has
been working on native applications
because all the focus is on
compatibility no one outside the company
expects Apple to succeed it's been
announced publicly part as part of the
Apple IBM Motorola I instead Apple is
switching the PowerPC but no large
company had made such a transition
successfully yet and the expectation was
that the first release of these machines
would be a disaster because of
compatibility problems so with all of
the internal engineering cycle is being
focused on compatibility this was one of
the very few native applications
unfortunately after the last year of
struggling with a failing project I was
completely burnt out we've been working
long hours
and killing ourselves for months trying
to keep it this project from being
canceled long past the point where it
was obvious to everyone on the outside
that it was doomed and I was in no shape
to do the work needed to take this demo
and turn it into something real so at
this point I called Greg who was now in
a different division of the company and
explained that you've got to come over
and see this where I'm I'd really like
to ship it but there's an enormous
amount of work to do and there's no way
I can do it alone I'm Greg fortunately
was just finishing up a contract in this
division at the time so he talked to his
manager and said that he would start
reporting to me and she didn't ask who i
was and let him she let him keep the
office in the badge and my old manager
hadn't turned off my badge so we both
still had access to the building and we
both still had our offices but he told
people that he was reporting to me and I
told people that I was reporting to him
that neft no managers in the loop so we
were able there were no meetings and we
could be really productive it was an
amazing change I went four months upon
months of what seemed like a death march
of struggling to do little things and
being completely unable to accomplish
anything just because of the the
friction in the process to suddenly
having no meetings and being able to
program 12 hours a day being able to
decide things by going in and chatting
for 30 seconds or five minutes and just
asking what's the right thing to do okay
let's go do it and suddenly we were
making a huge amount of progress it was
a great relief and greg was starting
fresh hehe what i was burnt out but Greg
wanted this to succeed and he was
putting an enormous amount of effort
into just being perfectionist about
every detail when we started I figured I
think there's about a month's worth of
work to actually take this and polish it
into a finished product Greg probably
had a more realistic idea of what that
meant at the time
so while this was going on I had no
official relationship with Apple I had
been a contractor but the contract ended
when that project was cancelled I tried
to be completely honest with everyone
when this came up people would sometimes
asked me do you work here and I tell
them no and then they'd assume oh that
means you're a contractor and I'd say
well actually no and then they'd ask but
then who's paying you and I'd say no one
and then they'd ask but how do you live
I'd explain I live simply and then
they'd get a really strange look at
their face and say what are you doing
here at that point I pulled them into my
office and give them a demo and the demo
was very flashy and I'd explain well I
had been a contractor but the project
was canceled sometime back and I decided
to stay and finish it anyway and all the
engineers that I explained this to were
extremely sympathetic at this point in
Apple is history just about everyone had
been through one if not two or three or
five or seven cancelled projects it was
very very hard to get things to ship
back then there were lots of ways
projects failed and lots of projects a
lot more projects got started and
finished so after seeing what I was
doing they were they were sympathetic
and as often as not asked if there's any
way they could help there had been a
something of a history of skunk works
projects engineers there had been many
times in past where engineers took their
canceled projects and worked on it after
hours on their own time trying to revive
it and sometimes were successful there
was one project at the time appropriated
enough codenamed Spectre which had been
cancelled and revived five times at the
time I was there I don't know if it's
shipped since then mostly because we
didn't report to anyone we weren't
anyone's responsibility we were just
under the radar no one worried about us
because everyone was focused about
worrying about what they were
responsible for and we both been working
there for over a year so we were
familiar faces and it was assumed we
belonged everyone assumed someone knew
what we were up to was responsible for
us and we just relied on the power of
corporate apathy we just kept showing up
because it was so far outside people's
expectations that it just didn't occur
to anyone
what was going on but I did slip up at
one point but someone from facilities
visited me in my office one day and
explained we're moving people into these
offices because on my map of the floor
these offices are empty so your manager
is going to have to find your new space
and that sort of thing happened all the
time engineer changed from one group to
the other and didn't feel like
schlepping all their stuff so they
stayed in their old office until someone
else needed the space and she just
figured that my new manager would find
me space but I had been so used to
telling the story because I'm telling
you here now I told her the truth she
was not amused that she had called
security and had them cancel our badges
and told us in no uncertain terms that
we had to leave now right about this
time apples went through the great
layoffs of 1993 where they laid off
about ten or fifteen percent of their
global workforce during the layoffs we
were safe because we weren't on the
books we didn't officially exist after
the layoffs there were plenty of empty
offices so we moved our stuff and I made
an effort to avoid this one facilities
person who actually knew we didn't
belong there and our badge is no longer
work but we had them physically so we
just wore them as decoys and made sure
they didn't get anywhere near about a
door detector and I'd show up in the
morning and I'd park my car and look
around the parking lot for a familiar
face and then time I walk to the door to
arrive right behind them they'd open the
door for me and say good morning Ron I'd
say good morning and trailing after them
or if Greg got there first I'd called
Greg and he'd let me and her vice versa
and we were just being so productive we
were started we started out working 12
hours a day and it just went up from
there because we were getting a lot done
that at this point the thought of
stopping it for a trivial reason like
not having building address access just
didn't occur to us I'm physically we
couldn't do what we were doing outside
the building because the only way to
compile on powerpc required in rs.6000
workstation with custom software that
didn't exist outside of Apple and there
were no developer notes or developer
support because no one was building for
powerpc so we really need access to
engineers to even know what to do things
are be able to do things and there were
no prototypes to be had outside the
company
we realized what we were doing was
ludicrous at one point Greg and I just
stopped and looked at each other and
said okay let me get this straight we're
literally sneaking into the building of
aiding security to do volunteer work for
an 8 billion dollar corporation at least
this is certainly going to have good
storytelling value in spinal tap idiom
this one goes to 11 now we were making
great progress programming but the more
we did the more we realized that there
was an enormous amount to do and we
couldn't do it alone it's not adequate
it wasn't just a question of the
programming there was everything else
that goes into making software it takes
a team effort and there were lots of
things we just didn't have the skills
for at one point I went out and just
hired out of pocket a graphics designer
a visual design expert that had
previously been laid off from apple and
just hired her onto my project she
didn't know what my situation was and I
thought it was safer for her not to know
just for her own benefit so I invited
her in and showed her what we were doing
and she did some designs for us that
eventually shipped documentation was a
problem I I hired some people to help
with the documentation our biggest
problem was QA fundamentally you can't
do your own QA it's a question of seeing
your own blind spots and it's expensive
to do it well and that was something we
couldn't afford and needed people to do
unfortunately at this point I always
kept my office doors open and people
liked what we were doing so they'd come
by daily to see our progress report bugs
I fix them and invite them back in the
next day to test their fix some show
them what they've done then they got
excited they were having some effect and
so a lot of people were going through my
office and regular basis to see what the
latest changes were and we'd become
something of an underground cause sled
people whisper about us like have you
have you heard the story of these two
guys you've got to see what they're
doing it's really cool and I let it be
known that that we really needed help
because we needed people to start
testing this so at one point these these
two guys come down from
upstairs they're doing QA on the PowerPC
system software and they tell me they're
really bored because they spent a long
time developing automated test tools and
now they're at the point where they push
the button in the test tools start in
the morning and they see which API is
break and send out the email but but
basically it's an automated process and
they heard we needed some help they told
us that you know they had stuff they
were supposed to officially be doing but
it was boring so they wanted to help us
out but I shouldn't let people know so i
gave them copies of the software and
they started reporting bugs they started
reporting lots of bugs it was great one
of them had a PhD in mathematics one of
them had done shareware math software
before they were amazing i could not
have found more qualified people had I
looked the Wallace is going on the
various engineers that are helping us
out want to tell their managers they
think it's cool it demos well they think
look of course they're going to love
what you're doing you have to show to
them but I've been putting them off for
weeks because it's one thing for
engineers to think or something
something that's cool and it's another
thing to ship something to millions of
customers and I know that I know that
difference to the default assumption
when an engineer says look I've been
working on my own time and I've
developed this cool thing the default
assumption is that there's a very high
burden of proof that would you be done
actually is worth shipping and when we
were at a stage where the software would
still crash I didn't want to show it to
anyone in management because if they see
something that crashes they're just
gonna shrug and say yeah that's cool
okay I don't have time to think about
this and so for a long time I was not
letting I was only showing at engineers
and telling them wait a while it has to
be perfect before you show it to your
management and the big thing that was
missing was everything we were doing was
in 2d this was at a time when there were
no GPUs and 3d hardware was the province
of SGI so we needed to be able to render
3d graphics and software and it's not an
entirely trivial thing to do this was
before there was a lot of open source to
choose from and I it looked like
something that were to take me at least
a month to do that I didn't have I
talked to a friend of mine who's at
Google now who was an expert in these
matters he took a weekend off from his
startup company and wrote us a 3d
software renderer
there was just amazing he did in two
days what would have taken me weeks or
months and it worked perfectly the first
time with bug free once we got that
integrated and things were stable enough
and impressive enough that I was ready
to I was ready to seriously start
thinking about how we could ship this
and the biggest problem that faced us
was a question of how to get something
to ship because I knew lots of projects
that have been cancer lots of official
funded projects on the books that have
been canceled there were a lot of people
in the company that have the power to
stop things for one reason or another
but it's very difficult to actually get
through all the land mines and convince
folks that this really deserves to be on
the machines and a ship so at one point
a fellow from the hardware team came to
my office early in the morning I got to
am one night and explained to me how
Apple worked physically he said Apple is
a hardware company there's a factory out
in Cork Ireland that produces machines
and the production ramp is going to
start on such-and-such a date and the
night before the factory starts boxing
machines in the warehouse i FedExed them
what's called the golden master hard
disk and that gets cloned onto all the
machines in the factory and at this
point in a blessed history there was a
huge attrition rate the company wasn't
treating engineers well the future of
the company was seriously in question a
lot of people were just leaving as is
and he told me so if you get me the bits
the night before it the golden master
gets fed ex to Cork they can appear on
the GM disk and they would be boxed in
30,000 units in the factory before
anyone knows they're there in in a very
real and pragmatic sense he said I
decide what does and does not show
so this conversation needless to say
warm my heart because that was a problem
that that I was completely flummoxed on
I just tried not to think about it
because it was too depressing and it was
obvious you know if they pulled a stunt
like that he would lose his job or worse
and as soon as anyone realized it was
there the legal exposure they would pull
it and kill it so it's it wasn't a path
we wanted to take but it was really very
reassuring that the offer was made now
in retrospect I don't even know if he
was serious but this is this is what he
told me and and it was it let us move
forward with more confidence now we
didn't want him to lose his job and we
thought that it was our responsibility
to at least do the due diligence make a
good faith effort to go through proper
channels so when we had the 3d and when
I was no no longer aware of any crashing
bugs and it had been in enough tester in
the tester stands for long enough I told
all the engineers that have been
supporting us okay you can it's time you
can go to tell your managers to come
meet come meet me oh and even before
this this was a time when we had access
to amazing resources that we couldn't
have had had we officially existed this
was a time when I knew folks at IBM that
we're complaining IBM was just starting
their fab runs on the original 621
PowerPC chip and it wasn't fully
debugged yet people at IBM couldn't get
the chips because although they were
going to be using it in their
workstations Apple would ship a million
power pcs the first year which is 10 or
100 times more than IBM would ship so
all the initial chip one chip runs went
to apple for testing and other the I
think maybe 200 powerpc chips that were
in existence at all most of them were in
hardware being tested there was a very
small number of coveted machines that
the system software folks who needed it
to test to ship on the initial release
had and no one else in the company could
get them I would occasionally have lunch
with people that were fairly high up in
projects not related to PowerPC who
would complain that II I'm on the
waiting list and I won't get a machine
for six months but but at this time Greg
and I actually had some machine King
an engineer from the hardware group came
to my office at midnight one day and and
brought a machine in and said now now
this looks like an ordinary 68k
Macintosh so don't let anyone take the
lid off officially officially this
machine doesn't exist if anyone asks I
don't know you and whatever you do it
must not leave the building so we had a
powerpc to work on at this point still
we're sneaking into the building and
still no managers know about us but the
project's far enough along that that we
can give it to people it doesn't crash
it looks impressive and so I tell
everyone okay bring your managers in
will make a good faith effort to
actually convince them that this needs
to ship and so they all went to their
managers in various different groups and
said there's these two guys you have to
meet we can't explain why just really
it's worth your time be at this office
at 22 in the afternoon and it'll be
worth it trust us so the afternoon comes
around and these 15 people are packed
into my office but I haven't met
introductions all around and I give them
the demo that I've been giving to all
the engineers that have been coming
through and I explain how this is really
useful in a math classroom that it's
something that high school teachers can
use essentially as an animated
blackboard to explain abstract concepts
visually and for Apple it's also a
demonstration that the PowerPC
fundamentally changes the rules because
previously software designers would
design their software around the
limitations of an 8k and eight megahertz
68k machine the bottom of the line
because they wanted to sell to the most
computers possible to the largest
installed base and so they had to assume
that they were writing their software
people for people with the slowest
machines and that affects a lot of user
interface design decisions and with the
PowerPC let Apple do is it let Apple say
this is the new lowest common
denominator when you're designing
software think of this is the new
slowest machine and it's 20,000 times
faster than the original Macintosh from
10 years previously and that lets people
as a software designer think of things
very differently things that had
previously been batch oriented can
become interactive things that
previously used to take a long time you
could do in an inner
give way which lets you simplify the
interface in a lot of ways that now 12
years later have become natural we take
for granted but at the time renew so I
gave it a demonstration all the managers
mostly focusing on the user interface
implications that this is the
demonstration for developers on how they
can improve their user interface using
the speed of the machine to do things in
a new way and the managers all looked at
this and said that's awesome that's the
story we've been telling people all
along but because we haven't had any
native apps because we've been so
focused on compatibility we've had to
talk about it we haven't been able to
show them but this really illustrates
what we've been trying to do and no one
else adapa was working on educational
math software so this didn't step on any
toes the managers just look at this and
said that's great why is it been such a
secret who's your manager why didn't
they tell us about this before so at
this point I tell them the story much as
I'm telling you here now up to this
point and I explain no the project was
cancelled several months ago this badge
was cancelled if I get it anywhere near
a door security will appear immediately
and escort me outside and they laugh
until they realize I'm serious and then
they get too quiet and think about it
for a bit and then they just look at me
and say okay we really want to ship this
we'll figure out a way to do it whatever
you do don't repeat this story so now we
have were adopted by the people in
charge of the powerpc project on whom
the company's future depends which in
some sense makes us official but we're
still sneaking into the building so at
this point things get really weird
because they're assigning people to work
on it and I'm in the middle of this
world wind of activity with all of these
employees actually assigned to do
various things on it then this project
that I'm effectively managing while I'm
sneaking into the building so the first
thing they do because engineer it's
really easy to to do an impressive demo
that that is just a fit the smoke and
mirrors so the very first thing they do
naturally is they have to get some due
diligence to have to get some someone to
test this and see whether it's real
whether it's worth shipping or whether
it's just smoke and mirrors in the demo
so the head of QA on the powerpc saw
suffer is the first person to take me
aside and says I've got these two guys
working upstairs they already have a
full-time schedule they're really
overworked but I want to introduce you
just to see whether they can squeeze
into worked into doing some QA on your
project because we need to test this and
I smile and he introduces us and we
shake hands and I meet my testing team I
didn't tell him that they'd been working
on it for a few weeks now hmm so we have
official key way now the the other big
thing we need is a usability testing
because we want this to be actually
useful in schools it's going to go out
on every machine and it's just going to
be there in the classrooms and the big
question for us is this is something the
teachers can use and it's it's very
different to design software for
engineers than it is to design software
in that's useful in the classroom in a
classroom situation a teachers have no
attention is there any time spent
playing with the software when it
doesn't work is taken away from the
curriculum it's taken away from the
students anytime something crashes it's
just a waste of time for everyone so I
will assign people from there a chai
department to do a formal usability
study they signed people from QA to do
testing they signed a whole lot of
people to do localizations it was I
think translated into about 15 languages
meanwhile we're sneaking in the building
apparently the people who run the
powerpc project despite the future of
the company depending on it can't get us
badges because you can't have a badge
without a signed purchase order you
can't get a purchase order without a
signed contract and there's no way they
could explain our situation to legal
without us being escorted out
immediately so at one point while all
this is going on this one fellow Tim
sees Greg waiting in front of the
building to looking for someone to let
him in and just a cost Greg I'm sickened
and says I'm sick and tired of you guys
loitering in front of the building every
day I'm gonna get you badges so he comes
to my office and tells us he's gonna go
statue likes try to explain that no
they've tried they couldn't there's we
can't get badges without a p.o we can't
get a peer without a contract and he
just drags me down to his office and
sits on the phone with
folks and he goes around with him in
circles for 20 minutes and I'm just
listening to his side of the
conversation but I'm sure that it's gone
I'm sure it's going the same way it
always has me he'll fail they say well
if their employees they get their badges
after they go through the employee
orientation and he explains they're not
employees we have no intention of hiring
them and they say well if their
contractors to get the badge you need to
get the signed contract and these
Thompson says no they're not contractors
we're not actually paying them then he
says well if their employees and they
just going to circle they're not
contractors then on employees we're not
paying them yes they need badges but he
wore them down eventually eventually
they said okay you take the badge form
where it says contractors you cross that
out and you write in vendor and where it
says contract number you right in the
magic words no dollar contract he got us
badges the next day it amazed everyone
it amazed the people running the project
apparently Apple as most companies is
strict caste system you can tell the
distance by the background color on
people's badges where they are relative
to you in the caste hierarchy the white
badges are employees they're very hard
to fire and they get lots of perks I
think it was the yellow badges were
summer interns they're treated as
employees but they're really just
college students and the green badges
are contractors and because of various
IRS law rules you can't give the many
perks and have to treat them very
chablis but we had orange badges and no
one had seen these before
but what amazed me is they exactly
described us as vendors what it meant is
that we didn't work for Apple they
didn't pay us but my company has this on
loan to Apple to work on site oh so we
were the few the proud the vendors the
people that watered the plants worked in
the cafeteria and fix the Xerox machine
are the vendors they go they don't
actually work here but we get building
access so we didn't have to sneak in
anymore that was good usability testing
was a very eye-opening experience for me
I had been working on various forms of
this software for ten years entirely
focused on the usability it's we were
designing it and with entirely in the
mind of this is going to go into
classrooms without any training with
very little documentation with no
support and we wanted to be useful to
teachers and students and we spent a
long time agonizing over small details
in the user interface thinking what
would make it simplest easiest to learn
easiest to use most useful in the
classroom situation and Apple did a
fabulous job on the usability testing
they went out and they got a group of
teachers and in the first day of the
testing the teachers all SAT around in
groups of two they were given the
software and said to make problems for
the students to work during the rest of
the week because they were working in
groups of two they would talk aloud
through everything and the person
running the test just SAT them at the
software and said this is going to go on
machines in the classroom it's not
coming with anything so we want to see
what you can do with it to try and set
some problems for your students and then
he's just SAT with folded hands for the
next two hours watching them not saying
anything well they tried to use it and
while I was behind a two-way mirror
pounding on the glass it's it's a very
eye-opening experience I think all
design anyone who designs you interface
all engineers should be forced to go
through this watching real users
actually try to use their software the
questions we agonized over were so far
beyond the actual issues that stopped
them several steps before they got there
and the sorts of things that they had
trouble with were things that never even
occurred to us could be a problem
and watching that eight hours the day
for five days as group after group went
in and ran into problems just it forced
us both to go back and rethink a lot of
things from scratch and enormously
improved the interface and enormously
improved how it was useful in the
classroom
so the having being publicly known in
the company helped in a lot of ways with
all of the resources that we suddenly
had our disposal usability testing was
amazing it also made things more
complicated because suddenly being
public the software was being demoed to
outside companies as well and as soon as
that happened to driven to different
groups called in one of them claiming
that the software infringed upon his
patent causing a fire drill because
Apple has deep deep pockets and that
they don't want to ship something that
gives him any exposure it took me a
while to demonstrate that the patent
that he was referring to actually
referred to me as the prior art so they
really didn't have to worry about this
case and another company that did
mathematical software simply called and
said you shouldn't ship this just
because they want to be the only people
that are known to ship mathematical
software Apple very politely declined
which impressed me because a week before
we were still sneaking into the building
and the next week Apple is rising to our
defense so at this point we're working
long hours 14 16 hours a day it's kind
of a blur we'd just show up run through
the tests check out the bugs fix things
we were very fortunate in one respect
when we started the project the original
ship date for the Power PC hardware was
much sooner and because they were
producing hat because they had to ramp
up the factory the drop-dead date for
the software to start the production was
several months before the actual release
date and so when we started we thought
we actually only had a little more than
six weeks or eight weeks to finish the
entire project before it had to go to
the golden master disk and it was a very
tight schedule we designed everything
around that schedule because they
weren't going to delay the hardware for
us we weren't on any official plans if
we were late they just wouldn't ship it
that was simple and no one else would
care and so we we
on the other hand because no one was
expecting the software there was no
pressure on features there there was no
design document there was no one saying
it has to do this this and this so we
just cut down the future sets to what we
basically already had and what we knew
we could ship reliably and then focused
entirely on usability and on making this
offer stable we wanted to make sure that
something shipping on millions of
machines would never crash and then the
hardware schedule slipped three months
for reasons that had nothing to do with
us obviously and so at this point we
have the code essentially frozen the
feature set completely frozen and we
have an extra three months during which
we did nothing but testing and a line by
line code review it was a unique
opportunity it was more testing than I'd
ever had on any project before or since
because we were the only native PowerPC
application everyone who had a prototype
and as time went on this was more and
more people immediately went to our
software to play with because it was the
most interesting to pay with other than
our software and one or two other tiny
demos it wasn't obvious outside the box
that this was nothing but a typical
Macintosh compatibility was really good
but running things under emulations I
ran about as fast as they used to on the
last generation of machines it was only
when you ran a native application that
suddenly it was doing things you could
not possibly do on the previous
generation machine said it was obvious
that under the hood this was something
completely different and so for many
months as the only native application
everyone who had the hardware was
playing with our software and coming by
my office and saying this doesn't work
this is confusing fixed it crashed here
and so for many months we we added no
features we did a line by line code
review and we did nothing but testing
and no code changes that were in bug
fixes as a result it was the most stable
application I have ever shipped before
or since and I like to brag that we
reached what built both Apple and power
computing Apple for many years after
that point when people would bring their
Hardware in complaining of random
crashes one of the things they would
recommend and one of the first things
they would do when they had a piece of
hardware is they would run the self
running demo that the graphing
calculator shipped and let it run
overnight
and if the demo crashed they would
classify that as a hardware failure I
like to think of that as the theoretical
limit of software stability now now to
be fair later versions of the software
beyond 1 point 0 were not that crash
proof but that that original version I'm
very proud of a gnat respect so to make
a long story short um eventually yes
they shipped it it's still shipping in
the mac OS 9 ghetto to this day but it's
been shipping now for 12 years and has
been on a 20 or 30 or 40 million
machines it's in use in high school
classrooms around the world only
recently with Tiger did they replace it
with a native program called grapher
that's completely unrelated to this but
it's still shipping as part of the mac
OS 9 partition few install classic now
as the project was ending I was able to
hire I hired a few people out of pocket
and was able to pay them but Greg had
been working 12 14 16 hour days for six
months now as a favor to me on something
that I initially said oh it will take
about a month and there's no way he
could explain to his parents what he'd
been doing they don't use computers
they're not technical so one day I was
looking at the new york times and i saw
the picture of a friend of mine on the
business section and i knew the guy that
the yacht that the particle is about so
I showed it to Greg and said hey I know
this fellow how do you like to have your
your picture in the New York Times so
your parents know what you've been up to
and he looked at me and made the only
possible response he said yeah right
so I made a bet on the spot for dinner
at this really nice restaurant and I was
expecting to be honest okay I was
expecting to lose the bet but I knew the
fellow that had written this other
article and I called him up and said
I've been working on this cool software
I'd like to show to you and now I don't
work for Apple and I can't represent
Apple but the software is something I've
been working on for 10 years and it's my
supper so I can talk about the software
i can talk about user interface and i
invited him over and I gave him the same
spiel eyes giving other people I didn't
talk about Apple at all um except to say
that we develop this new stop fritter on
a new faster machines and the Apple IBM
Motorola and alliance was public so he
knew about that and he was writing an
article principally about the alliance
between Apple IBM and Motorola but
they're big companies and just to put a
friendly face a human face on and they
an article he talked a little about the
new generation of software and had a
photo of the three of us who had
principally wrote the software on the
front time of the New York business
section so Greg kids Greg's parents
could see what he had been up to now I I
tried I called someone I knew Annapolis
public relations department and said I'm
giving an interview to The Times would
you like to send someone over to because
to represent apple and then they gave me
the standard response engineers are not
allowed to talk with the press um but I
didn't work there so the next time I saw
that PR person she was absolutely livid
presumably because there was really
nothing she could do about it we
couldn't be fired but it was good press
for Apple and our parents were pleased
that's basically the story I'm still
where I've been I'm still working on the
software this is last year's version i'm
working on the next release that will be
out in six months or so I've been
working on it now for 20 years every day
is an exercise in software archaeology
um email either me or Greg oh and the
the website official plug the website is
WWF ET com or just google graphing
calculator
well we were working 12 14 16 hours a
day so our expenses were very low and I
live simply and Apple we were both
contractors Apple prior to this Apple
pay very well as contractors in some
sense i think my attitude was Apple paid
me very well as a contractor for things
that didn't ship I felt duty-bound to
actually finish it and ship it
attractive
um all of this occurred after Steve Jobs
had left and before he returned so
there's not during his tenure um haven't
heard anything from him about it we
wanted it we wanted this offer to keep
shipping this we didn't want Apple had
any reason to have to pull it so yes
after all of the events of the story
everything was made retroactive Lee
kosher the software was licensed to
Apple so that they could ship it
comfortably for as long as they liked
questions oh I'm sorry I'm the question
was were we eventually paid and did
steve job that for comment on it and we
did eventually license it to apple for a
nominal fee but no there's never any
comment from steve
the question was so how long did I go
between paychecks I I don't actually
recall because I'd been working for a
contractor my entire career it was
typical for me to go two or three years
between paychecks so it really was it
wasn't out of the ordinary in my case I
often worked for a company worked on my
own for several years and then licensed
to work and so this felt quite natural
oh thank you very much our pleasure well
damn i will do you know though what do i
do now I'm still working on what is
essentially the first C program i
started writing in 1985 I'm still
working on it full time it's what you
know what software is like it's still
not done and I have it's been teachers
have been using it in this form for over
12 years now I have a very long
collected list of requests that they
have I'm continuing to run down the
feature list continuing to find ways to
improve it without making the interface
more complex it's a common tension it's
a constant tension between keeping the
interface simple easy-to-use means easy
to learn while also being able to do
more interesting and more powerful
things the fundamental design that I'm
trying to reach is one where if you open
up a typical a textbook for some subject
you'll often see an equation in a
picture and I want to be able to type
that equation as you see it in the
textbook and generate an appropriate
picture is a visualization for that and
that's a very broad space of problem
yeah they should
generation
and the question is that the original
graphing calculator 1 point 0 was now 12
years ago and hardware has improved
enormously in the last 12 years just as
it did in the 10 years between the
original Macintosh and the PowerPC and
have you taken advantages at the
improvements in the hardware since then
absolutely that's part of why I'm
continuing to work on it each new speed
bump in available hardware make enables
new kinds of visualization and I am
absolutely in love with the modern
generation of GPUs you often have far
more horsepower sitting on your graphics
card which is useful in a completely
general mathematical way as a general
simdi computer single instruction
multiple data to do vast amount of
computations quickly one of the features
I'm particularly proud of in the release
from in this release from a couple of
years ago it will take equations you
type and on the fly compile them into
GPU programs so that as well as using
the cpu to render the 3d image it will
use the GPU to texture that based on the
explicit equations that you've typed
compiling it on the fly for the GPU with
each new generation of hardware and each
new improvement enables new kinds of
visualization and enables new things in
the classroom so yes absolutely
the first question is do I know why
Apple stopped including our graphing
calculator and acquired grapher from a
Swiss company I can't speak on behalf of
Apple I could only speculate and I
wouldn't want to speculate I expect part
of the reason certainly it took us a
very long time before our Mac os10
native release was available um it was
actually available before they released
tiger but that was at least part of the
issue i don't know fully what was going
on back there I'm actually very much out
of touch with Apple I don't know what
goes on behind closed doors there
and what do I think the coolest feature
is there there's two parts to that
fundamentally I still think the coolest
thing is the very boring thing just the
entirely useful and 2d work that work
that you could do 20 years ago on old
hardware that you can just type sine X
and immediately get a useful picture
without a lot of dialogues without a
command line without a lot of interface
in your way that you can just focus on
the math and and say what's what's going
on here and that's not flashy or wizzy
and could be could have been done a long
time ago and worked fine on 68k machines
but in terms of act being actually
useful in the classroom what I think is
most cool about it is that teachers can
bring this up on an overhead and without
preparation type something in get a
pretty picture and then move on with the
rest of the lecture having spent 30
seconds on it without having to focus
all of their attention on okay I'm going
to use the computer now wait while I get
things set up perfectly and let's hope
it actually works being able to do
something that a teacher can use in a
hectic classroom with their attention
split and without having time to prepare
everything advance I think is it in my
mind that's what's most interesting now
as a technical person though the other
side thing is as a programmer there's a
lot going on under the hood to make
things fast because the fundamental
question is given the the fundamental
question I keep looking at is given
whatever today's state-of-the-art in
computer hardware speed is what can I do
with that speed in a fluid way what can
I do with that speed that happens with
with immediate feedback and that keeps
changing and most recently all of the
evolution of the GPU towards putting all
of this amazing floating-point compute
power in parallel hardware on your video
card lets you do really nice things
and so again if anyone who would like to
play with it just email Gregor I</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
