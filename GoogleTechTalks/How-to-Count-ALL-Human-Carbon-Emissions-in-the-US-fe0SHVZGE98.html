like to introduce to you dr. Kevin
gurney from a university of birth year
he has our impressive credentials here's
our bachelor's degree from Berkeley to
master's degree and PhD degree in
ecology he is on the IPCC panel which
has recently are taken a Nobel Prize he
has given us several congressional
testimony including arm one recently for
the Committee on Foreign Relations in
the Senate and he currently works at
Purdue his assistant director of the
climate change research center and
assistant professor and they probably
can go on longer the point is that he is
doing a work which i think is very
relevant to all of us and people working
in google w relevant because he runs the
project called the Vulcan project which
has started on organizing information
about the world carbon emissions and
he's trying to make in your selects
estable which should be familiar to
google and you put the problem this way
and from what i know he has completed
the most comprehensive and detailed
inventory of carbon emissions of the
United States not just for individual
sites but for the whole country on his
detailed level as possible using public
data and he plans to take this much
further so please welcome dr. Groening
thank you thanks better so thanks Simon
for having me out today and talking to
you all I'm going to what I'll do is
spend sort of maybe a third of this talk
talking a little bit about carbon
science sort of carbon and climate which
maybe you don't get to hear every day
and then sort of launched into this
Vulcan project and then sort of end up
with something that might be a lot more
familiar to a lot of you at least I hope
it is I assume it is and end up there so
a little bit of science and then some
sort of technology and then some sort of
mapping and imaging so it's
and said I've been doing this big
project called Vulcan and the sort of
overarching sort of motivation for doing
this project is really the recognition
that across a whole bunch of disciplines
this is research policymaking governance
public organizations there really is a
need for global quantification of
greenhouse gas emissions but not just
quantification in its zeroth-order sense
but actually with a lot of space and
time detail and probably more
importantly something that's processed
driven that is emissions or
quantification image of emissions that
are driven by the processes that make
them happen and do that in some sort of
dynamical framework in a potentially
coupled framework and I'll explain what
I mean by that and finally obviously
something that's user-friendly and
flexible so that we can engage not just
scientists like me but people within the
business community the public policy
makers etc so who needs something like
this I think a lot of people do and I'm
sort of in the upper or I guess I'm sort
of up in up in the upper right-hand sort
of bubbles here I'm sort of working in
this area I do a little bit of policy
work but I think all these folks need
something like this and I'll go into a
little detail while first start with
myself I'm going to tell you a story
about how i came across doing this work
as sort of a carbon cycle scientist and
then sort of try to track around all
those bubbles and explain each of those
as well so this is probably the most
famous plot and all geophysics this is a
co2 concentration as measured on top of
Mount Aloha 12 and half thousand feet in
the middle of the Pacific Ocean carbon
dioxide concentration of course has a
monotonic rise no surprise there we're
emitting lots of co2 because we're
burning fossil fuels it also has a very
regular seasonal cycle and that is a
manifestation of the biosphere that's
nothing more than the planet breathing
co2 in and out seasonally due to
photosynthesis and respiration every
single year so two big things monotonic
rise did a combustion of fossil fuel and
a relatively even
seasonal cycle due to the biosphere but
you can see there's actually interannual
variability if you were to take out that
seasonal cycle there's actually some
little ripples in here and those ripples
hold an awful lot of information that we
use to try to figure out what's going on
if you sort of back away from the global
carbon cycle and put it into sort of big
pots it looks like this the atmosphere
holds currently about 760 billion tons
of carbon in it almost entirely as co2
although there's some trace species the
oceans are probably the biggest
reservoir other than rocks rocks of
course have more carbon anything else
but they're not part of the dynamical
system the oceans hold about 38,000
billion tons the land holds about 2,000
billion tons roughly half of which is
above ground half of which is below
ground and here we are human beings
emitting in the 1990s on average
something like six to six and a half
billion tons of carbon every year from
the combustion of fossil fuels we also
emit this is a very uncertain number
something like one to two billion tons
every year due to manipulation of
vegetation primarily deforestation and
primarily tropical deforestation so all
told we emit about eight billion tons
into this this big sort of circulating
multi sort of pot puzzle the atmosphere
in the land exchange large amounts of
carbon every year as I noted in the
previous slide there's this regular
seasonal cycle and it is roughly these
numbers about a hundred and twenty
billion tons goes in and about a hundred
and twenty billion tons comes out every
single year and actually an amazingly
large flux of carbon something similar
occurs in the oceans about ninety
billion tons every year goes into the
ocean and about 90 billion tons goes out
on net prior to human beings interfering
with the system the bias here in the
atmosphere were almost in balance and
the oceans in the atmosphere almost
imbalance in fact the whole system was
relatively speaking in balance there
wasn't a lot of change in atmospheric
co2 unless you go back to place times of
glaciation there wasn't a lot of
variation but we know by measuring in
the atmosphere that we're raising its
concentration by three billion tons
every
year and if you look at this as sort of
a checking account if we're pumping in
about eight the atmosphere sees about
three that means there's about five
billion tons going somewhere else right
two of that we now know pretty
conclusively is going into the oceans
there's broad agreement on this there's
not a lot of mystery modelers
observation lists all agree about two
billion tons going into the ocean and
the reason for that is actually
something you all know very well plain
old Henry's law anytime you take water
or any fluid for that matter and a gas
that's soluble on that that fluid and
you increase the concentration of the
gas above the fluid more of it dissolves
into the fluid and that's exactly what's
happening with the planet we're simply
pumping the atmosphere with more co2 and
some of its dissolving into the oceans
there's probably a limit to that but
it's not too clear how what that limit
is this still leaves one big piece of
this puzzle which is the piece that's
motivated a lot of us to go out and do a
lot of work which is this last bit which
is if you take this into account which
we know pretty well we take this into
account what you know pretty well that
into account which we really no well
they're clearly must be about three
billion tons going into the bias for
every single year and the reason why
twenty years ago this was so surprising
is the conventional wisdom was that the
planet was actually getting browner it
was not getting greener turns out the
planet actually is getting greener that
doesn't mean it's a type of green we
like because we are deforesting and
manipulating vegetation but in terms of
just broad strokes it actually is
getting greener to the tune of about
three billion tons every year it's been
come to be known as the missing sync
missing because it's not still clear why
this is happening it's still not
entirely understood sort of know the
magnitude now pretty well we know
roughly where it's happening it's in the
northern hemisphere where we live but
it's not entirely clear what the
mechanisms are so the reason why this is
important the reason why this is emerged
as a very very important scientific
topic is sort of delineated by these
four graphs and these are a bit busy and
I apologize for that but what this is is
two models one is the red model one is
the blue model these are big models of
the atmosphere that have a carbon cycle
couple
them so you have a big atmospheric model
it's got a big biosphere model and the
two can work together and both of these
models are driven by the exact same time
evolution of fossil fuel co2 so we're
starting in 1850 going out to the year
2100 this is like a classic climate
simulation that you've probably seen
many many times in books and in
presentations but these two different
models respond very differently when you
actually put a carbon cycle coupled to
them so now fossil fuels go into the
atmosphere but the biosphere can react
it can either get greener it can get
browner the oceans can react in
different ways and what happens is with
these two models two very different
things occur this is the ocean to
atmosphere exchange one of the models
the blue model just keeps taking up more
and more co2 it just goes off into the
future we're pumping the head space full
of more co2 and the oceans just taking
it up the other model starts to saturate
at about oh four billion tons about the
middle of the 21st century it looks like
it hits a wall and it just sits there
takes up the same amount every year but
the amount going into the ocean does not
increase if you look at the biosphere
which is this the exchange between the
land in the atmosphere there's a lot of
noise of course because lots of
interannual variability in the biosphere
the blue model unlike what it did over
in the oceans gets to about the middle
of this century and it starts to flatten
out it basically stops taking up more
co2 it has a fixed amount and just sits
there the red model does something
rather surprising which is actually
concerned a lot of people which is that
not only does it stop taking up co2 but
it turns around and becomes a source of
carbon to the atmosphere so no longer is
it acting as a sink but it becomes a
source so this is this feedback that a
lot of people have been concerned about
that actually has only been recognized
in the last few years now I can't tell
you which of those futures is real
they're both possible but clearly this
one is of great concern to a lot of
people because not only are we putting
fossil fuel into the atmosphere not only
are we not getting help from the bias
here the biosphere is now starting to
admit co2 and the broader reason for
that is that as the planet gets warmer
microbial activity and soil
everywhere around the planet starts to
eat through all of the soil organic
matter and oxidize it right into the
atmosphere the difference between these
two models in terms of atmospheric co2
is here and as you can see it's on about
50 or 33 to fifty percent of the total
co2 effect here's a difference in
temperature and it's also about a third
to fifty percent of the total
temperature effect so this is not just
in the noise this is a massive feedback
that has serious implications so that's
sort of a motivating of motivation for
why we worry about the missing sing try
to figure out where it is understanding
the missing sync will teach us lots of
lovely things about biochemistry which
is a lot of fun science but this is
really the punchline to a lot of people
outside of science which is if if the
missing sync were to saturate or weaken
which that red model shows it would
effectively double the amount of co2
retain in the atmosphere so it would
basically make fossil fuel emissions
look a lot worse than they are right now
and have been for the last 20 years it
also has some serious implications for
the Kyoto Protocol because it sort of
mucks with the accounting in terms of
the terrestrial biosphere within the
protocol so it's got a lot of political
implications as well so going back to
the co2 map with our monotonic rise or
enter around your variability we can
actually start to take a closer look at
this map and begin to figure out where
the missing sync is and this is sort of
a blow-up up or I should say a more
space and time explicit map of co2 this
is what we refer to as the magic carpet
of co2 it's kind of nice it shows that
wonderful seasonal cycle in the northern
hemisphere it's really big up where we
live because we have a lot of land and a
lot of trees up here as you go down to
the tropics it has two cycles because of
a wet too wet and too dry seasons and
when you own in the southern hemisphere
the whole thing turns around 180 degrees
and phase because the seasons are
opposite in the southern hemisphere it's
also a weaker seasonal cycle because
there's much less land in the southern
hemisphere so it's pretty cool by
looking at co2 in the atmosphere you can
actually see a lot of what's going on
around the planet it actually there's
more information in this map this is a
model that we run at Purdue in my group
that actually is a model of the
biosphere so what we do is
were pumping co2 in and out of the
atmosphere as plants grow here we are in
the winter co2 is building up in the
northern hemisphere and as we go into
the growing season you're going to see
this rapidly decline as plants leaf out
and begin to move remove all that co2
from the northern hemisphere and of
course that's the seasonal cycle but the
point here is in addition to the
seasonality in addition to that gradient
/ latitude there's lots and lots of
space and time structure in the co2 of
the atmosphere and it looks like weather
and it is whether it's being pushed
around by weather but it's also being
manifested by sources at the surface and
in the classic sense it's a convolution
integral of those two things pumping
away at creating co2 in the atmosphere
so we actually attempt to use all that
space-time structure as a signal and use
it to figure out where carbon is coming
and going and we do that through an
inverse process and I won't bore you
with all the details I just put that I
know some people love to see
mathematical equations makes them very
happy I do too but really all we're
doing in this scheme is solving
conservation of mass that's all this is
this is just a conservation equation
time rate of change of a thing co2 is a
is a function of how it gets moved
around and sources and sinks at the
surface very simple and this is a
schematic of that so we go around the
planet we measure co2 in the atmosphere
and if we know the transport in between
those points if we know the flow of air
we can essentially solve for that we can
figure out what the answer must be what
is where is the sink where is the carbon
going where is it coming etc obviously
it's a very elaborate version of this
sort of simple inversion schematic but
this is essentially all we're doing
solving for an unknown here are I balls
on the system if you look around the
planet this is actually right now where
we measure co2 now for those of us that
do this this is a very sad picture
because what this says is that for as
important a gas as co2 is and it is
supremely important this these are the
only places that we routinely measure
carbon dioxide it's quite astounding we
basically don't measure it is one way
you could look at it
we hardly know where co2 is but these
are our eye bolts on the system we use
measurements at all those locations and
again with a gigantic transport model we
move things backwards and we figure out
where carbon must be coming and going
around the planet now important to this
which brings me to the real point of
this talk in a sense is that underneath
all of this we assume we know fossil
fuel co2 we assume we know it we know
where it is we know where it's coming
from and actually what we're doing is
we're solving for the part of the
problem that we don't know which is the
biosphere component because if you go
back to those big bubbles fossil fuel is
a big chunk in the middle and ends the
biosphere in the oceans and actually we
try to remove a fossil fuel part and say
that we actually know what that is and
go after the biosphere part so it
becomes very important to know where all
the fossil fuel co2 comes from in the
old days we knew it at very coarse
scales nowadays we need to know it at
much finer finer spatial scales and a
lot of the reason for that is there's a
satellite which is going to launch next
month which is very exciting because
I've been waiting three years for this
it's going to launch next month and it's
going to measure co2 from space finally
so instead of having 50 dots around the
planet we're actually going to blanket
the planet and co2 measurements we're
going to do it from space NASA is
launching this satellite it's called the
it'z actually the orbiting carbon
observatory it's going to measure
something on the order of about 10
kilometers okay on the ground which is
much finer than we measure co2 now it's
very exciting and it's going to change
everything we do but in order to be able
to avail of these measurements it turned
out we had to go back and figure out
what the fossil fuel emissions of co2
were much better than we knew them
before this is a map that all of us in
carbon cycle science used to use okay
it's you know no surprises right these
are the three big industrial bull's-eyes
of the planet the United States Western
Europe East Asia Southeast Asia Japan
etc right not a lot of surprises there
but if you look at this map for the
United States alone the
is what it looks like this was the scale
at which we had quantified fossil fuel
and this is much worse than it looks not
only is it in one degree skate one
degree boxes which are about a hundred
kilometers on a side but actually we
don't even really we use not even know
that we really knew what the total
amount of co2 was coming out of the
United States and we use population
density to distribute that into these
one degree boxes so it was horrible I
would argue we barely knew anything we
know the whole nation but when it gets
sounded like an individual state or even
an individual county no way we had no
idea so we set out to actually improve
this so we went to NASA and we said it's
wonderful you're spending all these
billions of dollars on the satellite
going up into space but unless you do a
better job at the fossil fuel it's a big
waste of money and fortunately they
decided that was a reasonable thing to
try to do so that set us down this path
of creating this thing called Vulcan
which I'm going to share with you now
and a Vulcan is the Roman god of fire a
lot of people worked on this including
Simon who introduced me who's done some
work which I'll show you lots of folks
at Lawrence Berkeley Lab's here in the
bay area etc etc a lot of nice support
from people out there so we decided
we've got to do a better job of this how
are we going to do it and we took a very
novel approach rather than doing what
had been done in the past we decided to
leverage off of something that's already
done which is we monitor pollution like
crazy in this country some people would
say maybe not crazy enough but we do
monitor it we've done it for 40 years
for local air pollution carbon monoxide
and knocks and so2 and lead and all
those nationally regulated pollutants so
we looked at that infrastructure and
took that information instead of
reinventing the wheel we decided jeez
were monitoring all these local air
pollutants why can't we use that to tell
us where fossil fuels being burned
because anytime you burn fossil fuel
whether it be a car a power plant a
factory whatever you make local air
pollutants and all that monitoring it
turns out was utterly comprehensive it
had actually covered every single fossil
fuel emitting source in this country was
inconvenient and it was took a lot of
work and it wasn't co2
right there not monitoring co2 nobody
does that in the United States we
monitor the nationally regulated
pollutants will probably be regulating
co2 in the coming years but not yet so
we took all these pollutants and in all
these different sectors we did lots and
lots of stuff at different resolutions
to try to downscale all that information
and create a map that was a lot better
than the one you just saw and we like to
think we've done that this is just a
little downscaling schema I won't waste
time on that this is what it looks like
this is our combined commercial and
residential sector these are co2
emissions and funny units they have to
be logged because the spread is so big
but much much much more detail we're
down now in this map down to 10
kilometers on a side and we do this
every hour now we've done it for the
year two thousand and two or planning on
marching that forward in time so a lot
of detail we've done this is electricity
production these are basically all the
power plants the United States this was
not such a mystery you know everyone
knows where these are but we've done all
the electric producing power plants this
is the industrial sector so these are
basically factories anything that you
know burns fossil fuel to produce
something is in this map and in some
cases we have to spread things over an
entire county because we don't have
information about the exact geo-located
point but most of these most of these
are actually geocoded they are it's a
building and we know where the building
is and we know how much co2 is coming
out the stack of that building we've
also put them on the roads so we have
all the mobile emissions in the united
states placed on to us roadways by
merging it with the GIS road atlas the
green dots are all the airports in the
United States we know how many planes
are coming and going we can quantify
those emissions as well this is sort of
a movie it started a little washed out
but the idea here with this movie is
that it shows the peeling out of the
time zones across the United States so
we're actually able to also not just
quantify everything but do it nicely in
time and show that part's the United
States wake up before other parts the
United States and this is very important
for people that are going to drive and
Atmos
model because you need to know very
specifically in space and time when co2
is being emitted into the atmosphere you
won't get an accurate assessment of co2
as it is in the atmosphere so we've
actually taken things and run it through
an atmosphere transport model and this
is mala called Rams which we run in my
group and we have driven the Rams model
which is a very elaborate meso scale
atmospheric transport model with our co2
emissions this is an isosurface of co2
and you can see big warm front there you
see this interesting bleed out of co2
down to Mexico which is a manifestation
of actually near shore winds in the LA
basin lots of interesting blobs of
tunneling thunderstorms in the Midwest
etc lots of exciting action and of
course all this blow off of co2 over the
Atlantic Ocean and over to Europe right
co2 travels around the planet now as is
being emitted from everywhere so this
allows us to do lots of really
interesting and fun science which I
won't again bore you with but lots of
neat things can be done with that we put
this actually up on YouTube and within
the first 72 hours we had 200,000 views
which I know is not a very impressive
thing at Google but you have to
understand for nerdy scientists like me
that's you know kind of astounding we're
not Paris Hilton right but it was pretty
amazing and there was a lot of interest
generated by this and lots and lots of
feedback and people interest in what
we're doing so we've also been
evaluating it compared to the national
totals that come out of the Department
of Energy and we do very well little
bits of differences here and there which
we're always exploring and worrying
about but generally speaking we do
pretty well we're going to do Canada
Mexico we're in the process of doing
Canada Mexico because our goal was
actually due north america we got a lot
of nice press this was actually a Sunday
edition of the Boston Globe so some of
the old media picked up on it New York
Times wired etc tons of blogs and new
media picked it up we had so much
traffic actually to access the data that
it brought down our server which again
it's not a very impressive thing here
but was a little surprising to me
because
I really had no idea that there would be
as much interest in this as there was
but clearly a lot of people were
interested in this information other
than scientists like myself I had emails
from just about every corner of the
planet more than I could ever respond to
so we've now with Simon's help been
gearing up to put this onto Google Earth
sort of an obvious thing to do with
something like this it's got a lot of
rich information our first cut at it
which i think is nice is in every county
in every state we can pop up a pie chart
which says how much co2 is coming from
the different sectors in your county in
your state we can do a per capita etc so
a very rich amount of information that
we can put in people's hands which i
think is really neat and I think right
now we'll probably get this all wrapped
up in January and have that out on
Google Earth we've also started to do a
bunch of other things which is you know
analyze things per capita bring some
socio-economic data and mix it with co2
to sort of make it a little more
meaningful to people other than carbon
scientists this is just an example this
is actually on senator Lugar's website
now they they were really interested in
it and they put it up on their website
as Simon mentioned i did some testimony
to Senate Foreign Relations back in
April and I was there talking actually
about deforestation and climate but
senator lugar surprised us and that he
showed up with a map of Vulcan and is
was very excited about it and made a
very nice statement and I highlighted it
because I actually think it is a great
indication of one of the powers of this
type of information is that as we go
into a carbon trading market which I
would argue is almost inevitable at this
point something like this could become a
crucial element in actually
operationalizing carbon trading to trade
something you got to quantify it you got
to quantify it with reasonable accuracy
right nobody buys a stock that's one
dollar plus or minus ten dollars that's
no one's going to buy that it's got to
be a dollar plus or minus point zero
zero zero one dollars so we like to
think that Vulcan has a role to play
far beyond what we had initially set out
to do right now we're doing an
interesting thing which is improving the
traffic part of this Vulcan we've gotten
data from over 20 states traffic count
information at individual locations
thousands of data points we're actually
talking to navteq where the people that
drive around in the cars and GPS
everything right and put it onto Google
Maps about the hundred cities that they
black blanket with traffic monitors
because believe it or not a lot of this
data when we contact State Department of
Transportation they send us analog
information they sometimes don't even
have it digitized so we have to sit
around digitizing books that thick of
numbers it's just unbelievable but a lot
of this information is not digital at
least not available to us in a digital
form so incredible on to labor but
interesting things are coming out this
is a classic sort of data element this
is a rural location in Utah this is a
weekday this is all traffic at an
individual location and you can see
because it's sort of rural it doesn't
really had a little bit of a rush hour
maybe you could argue in the early
morning but sort of that is just broad
hump that basically when people are
awake there's some commercial business
probably traveling out in this rural
highway it peaks in the nola day
declines at night you go to the weekend
at this location and this is what it
looks like which at first when I saw
this I was completely baffled does
anybody know what might explain that any
guesses
Church I mean that's that's my
explanation I don't know but I'm
assuming this is church service people
are rushing off to church women rushing
out and they're doing it for a morning
service and midday service is my guess
this is on a Sunday so really neat and
so we're taking all of that information
and actually going to put it in so that
our traffic our co2 emissions from our
traffic has all the fidelity of all the
rush hours everywhere in the country
instead of right now which is sort of a
course sort of climatologist is in a few
days this is this flu trend website that
has you know real-time tracking of flu
trends in the United States normally
this map has a lot of differentiated
colors when the flu trends are different
in different places and sort of we want
to do something much like this for co2
we want to actually start bringing this
so that you can dial out the actual
trends in co2 and almost real-time
state-by-state and believe it or not you
can you can do that because though it
has never been used the gioi produces in
incredible detail petroleum natural gas
everything you ever wanted to know about
fossil fuels sales and quantities all
over the country week by week and sub
weekly they put these out in these
reports because they're all interested
in spot prices and trading and you know
it's all about all about fuel and all
about trading fuel and we think we can
use this information and actually make a
product that looks much like that flu
trends for co2 so again building off of
the platform that we've built by adding
some bells and whistles we can actually
create I think some really neat things
so stepping back again now so vulcan you
know is has been relatively successful
product for science but i would argue
that actually to satisfy all of these
people we need to actually take a step
beyond
and and I believe to do that we actually
have to go even into finer detail and
down scale this idea even further and
actually change the way we do it instead
of delivering this out to the public we
need to engage the world as data
providers and data in gestures at the
same time which means we've got to
create a system that interacts with many
of these communities interacts with the
public interacts with industry interacts
with policymakers etc so to do that I'll
show you the all familiar Google Earth
zoom in we've named this project Hestia
Vulcan is the Roman god of fire Hestia's
the Greek goddess of the hearth fire I'm
lousy at acronyms so all my projects
have I use a Greek mythology or
mythology in general to name on it so I
have Tara Hestia aetna Vulcan etc so
what we want to do is take the Vulcan
idea and bring it right down to you know
the classic building 3d Google Earth
data layer want to bring it right down
into this landscape right so emissions
down into buildings down into roadways
that are right in a recognizable
landscape that everyone has access to
and in as close to real time as we can
make it so really dial up the
specificity and the fidelity of this
information and I think that this has a
lot of power for the policy-making
community right now as probably many of
you know there are well there's no more
bills now bubbling around in Congress
about legislating greenhouse gas
emissions this is not a new topic but
nothing's happened yet but I imagine
with change of administration that's all
going to change and we're going to have
probably some sort of national level
legislation there's of course Kyoto
which is out there and the rest of the
world is moving on without the United
States but it looks like we may reengage
there's also lots of independent us
action there's the northeastern states
have created a trading market amongst
themselves and it gets nine now their
cities all over the country that have
taken on
greenhouse gas mitigation targets on
this one probably has for all I know
obviously in the state of California
there are state level targets which are
pretty aggressive there's a Supreme
Court ruling which said to the EPA that
greenhouse gases are in fact in your
bailiwick they are not outside your
purview they're perfectly reasonable to
include in regulations and then finally
is this us cap which is a consortium of
I don't know it's now 20 or 25 large
industries that wrote a letter to the
president saying please regulate us
which someone a historian told me the
last time that happened was in the
middle of the 19th century with the rail
industry but pretty unheard of for a
bunch of big companies to ask to be
regulated but they did and the reason
they did is that they're actually
worried about the scatter of legislation
that actually might make their lives
harder rather than easier they would
rather one system instead of potentially
a bunch of different systems that are
different in whatever state you're in
and since many of these big entities
obviously are not just across many
states but across many countries this is
a potential headache for them so they
have basically asked the legislation
happened and happened sort of coherently
at the national level here's a map of
all the cities there's many many more
now so I would argue that right now
prior to Vulcan and prior to building
Hestia policymakers really have this
sort of blunt instrument in other words
they don't really know where the
emissions in the system are and they
don't know in a lot of detail in space
and time where they are why they are and
when they're happening and so we want to
give them this you know really a scalpel
instead of this hammer and the
policy-making community I think really
needs fidelity is the biggest thing
because in order to get smart efficient
economically viable policy all those
things we all want you do need a lot of
fidelity you need to know what it is
you're going after right now the sort of
canonical wisdom was well just regulate
power producers right there are big
Union point sources of co2 they're kind
of obvious we all know where they are
it's only forty percent of us co2
emissions from fossil fuel and in many
ways there may be a lot of other
low-hanging
fruit we all know it we've known it for
30 years right energy efficiency etc and
we engage in a lot of it from but from a
policy point of view the wisdom thus far
as well just regulate power producers I
would argue that's fine but you're
missing a big big part of the story
regional and local managers who are
going to be the people that are going to
operationalize this because even if we
have national regulation it always comes
down to some local county manager or
somebody on the ground in a County
that's going to have to do this they're
going to have to go out and either count
up where all the co2 is and
operationalize some policy that then
gets sent up through the state and up
through up to the federal EPA and so
these people need lots of information
and this is where they need a lot of
what i would call sort of technical
information obviously accounting no big
surprise there but the ability to assess
and the ability to build scenarios to
play games with their world right to
play a computer simulation and find out
well what if we change out the traffic
lights with LEDs what everyone's driving
a hybrid car what if everyone's doing
this what if houses are doing that and
find out where in the system the
fidelity is where the soft spots are and
of course everyone needs verification no
surprise so the public I think has a big
role to play and I would argue I
remember when the first time I got
interesting the climate change problem
was nineteen eighty one over in a
classroom across the bay in berkeley i
was sitting in a class and somebody gave
a lecture on climate change and I said
that is what I want to do but I would
argue that even in the intervening
period which is now almost 30 years but
even longer climate change has always
been a very difficult topic to
communicate to the public about it's
relatively abstract we talk about global
mean temperature which means almost
nothing to all of us because we don't
live in the global mean we live in a
place in many ways it's been very
difficult to create any sort of
transcendent imagery or conception of
what this problem is you know we've had
pictures of polar bears on icebergs I
mean I guess that's the closest we've
gotten maybe we have pictures of you
know
temperature profile or predicted
temperature profile but I would argue
actually we've had a dearth of imagery
we have nothing that really transcends
the reality of this problem into
people's everyday lives and I think it's
been an incredible barrier people doing
anything when I first started out doing
science I actually worked for a few
years on ozone depletion that was I
started out as a chemist really and this
is a picture of the Antarctic ozone hole
this was on the cover of Time magazine
and up until the late 1980s when this
image showed up you could argue the
exact same thing was happening with
stratospheric ozone depletion yeah
people talked about it but was this
abstraction and stamped the South Pole
who lives there what is this a lot of
confusion until this image showed up
until people saw on the cover of Time
magazine in a satellite image of the
problem and it changed everything I
would argue circa nineteen eighty-eight
1989 the problem changed it
fundamentally changed we had legislation
in rapid fire after this it essentially
reframed it it completely reframed it
from something that was abstract and a
bunch of nerds worrying about to
something that could actually affect
your life every single day because you
might get skin cancer or whatever so I
call this a transcendent sort of policy
convergent moment I think we need the
same thing for climate change and one
way to do it again is maybe to utilize
the infrastructure we already have both
through online visual mapping and
imagery and now the new fidelity we have
on a mission so this is actually a
picture of my neighborhood here is my
house a little bit old but I think what
we can do is place again through Hestia
place the information right into
people's neighborhoods and you can do
things not like not only quantify co2
but show what would happen if traffic
changed if you're driving hybrid cars at
an intersection ethanol whatever you
could do it in terms of dollars saved
carbon saved whatever you want all the
metrics that we already calculate we
just don't do in space and time to tail
we can layer right on to this
image and bring this right into the
everybody's living room you can do it
for an individual house may be swapping
out windows changing the insulation but
the idea is to bring climate change into
the living room of everybody and
leverage it off a platform there
everyone's now pretty familiar with
Google Earth or online mapping systems
so I'll mention a few attributes of the
system then then stop and let you ask
some questions so there's a bunch of
attributes that I think of when I think
of Hestia this system first of all it's
methodologically consistent and let me
tell you what I mean by that right now
there's a lot of work being done on
carbon footprinting right everyone's
doing it towns are doing it businesses
are doing it it's like a cottage
industry right there's a bazillion
little websites that tell you how to
calculate your carbon footprint which i
think is a great thing but I would argue
however that in order to really do this
that's kind of not the way we should be
doing it not that everybody shouldn't be
involved I do think they should but
we've got 20 methodologies we've got
everybody doing it differently it's it's
great for giving people a little bit of
information about where they stand but
it doesn't connect upscale it has no
scale transcendence because it can't
really be compared to anything at the
national level can't be compared to the
state level again everyone's doing
differently as a scientist I look at all
the differences and it completely
worries me because frankly I don't trust
most of it so I think we have the
opportunity at least build a system that
is at least internally methodologically
consistent and is built from science
first and then engages everybody to
become involved we can build a to a data
structure so instead of just supplying
this to the world we could actually have
people supply us with information right
now I cannot get the electric bill of
everybody in the country that's against
the law utilities won't give it to me
and frankly I might be uncomfortable if
I was told all my billing was being sent
to somebody however I should have the
opportunity to donate that information
if I want if I had a reasonable sample
of all the electric billing and all the
gas billing of people across the United
States I could do incredible things with
it so we need to build something that is
true date to a data structure
that is sort of a real modern web 2.0
idea where people become part of the
scientific infrastructure they're
supplying information and being a part
of it just as much as we're a part of it
it connects grassroots to the world
that's the scale transcendent idea that
things at the grassroots level now talk
directly to things at the global level
because the problem can now be connected
we have carbon cycle budgets at the
planetary level we've got them right
down to the individual building level
national goals can be connected to local
action I would argue it's much more
efficient to do things this way rather
than have every industry go figure out
their carbon footprint and redundant ly
do this problem over and over again we
should just do it once and do it really
really well you could do cool things
like compare different cities by that I
mean this will offer people the
opportunity to build context right
everyone wants to know how am i doing in
terms of my carbon footprint but how is
my city how is my neighborhood how does
it compare to the next city is there a
reason why it's different it should
Chicago and Indianapolis have similar
missions should they be the same per
capita maybe not maybe Chicago's cold or
maybe they have older buildings etc
people should be able to have complete
full context of the emissions and the
things that matter to them and I have
this dream of people you know showing up
at City Council meetings with this
information in hand and requesting
mayors and city councilmen and women to
actually do something because they're
empowered with the information they've
already quantified it they know what's
going on and it's all in vivid detail in
the communities in which they live it
opens up the possibility that everybody
can trade carbon we can trade carbon and
much finer scales with higher fidelity
which could mean a more efficient
trading market obviously there's lots of
assessment verification and of course
this visualization is key and ask me
visual and it's got to connect not only
the essence of the problem but it's got
a connected to the solutions so within
the landscape not only do we have
emissions we have all the opportunities
where x emissions could be reduced and
finally I would say this is not really
just an exercise in downscaling which
sometimes scientists that's their first
reaction is okay we're just downscaling
stuff right
I would say it's not downscaling it's
actually eliminating scale scale should
become utterly and completely irrelevant
it shouldn't be local and global it's
just scale independent right this
problem in its essence is scale in a pen
in a sense and we need to both quantify
it that way visualize it that way and
think about it that way so finally to
sort of stop I would say our first stab
at this Vulcan is here we're working on
improving it making it better more
accurate etc we're doing lots of fun
science with it our goal right now is to
make it accessible beyond just our
community open this up to people let
them look at it play with it use it in
whatever ways we can make it useful and
ultimately we want to do the world so we
want to take Vulcan and actually do the
rest of the planet Hestia the finer
detailed you know building level full
gory detail concept we've actually doing
a pilot on the city of Indianapolis
they're kind of a guinea pig because
they're nearby the university big enough
so they matter we want to build this
sort of web 2.0 idea where we actually
engage people and allow them the
opportunity to come into the system
supply us with information qa/qc it and
use it in various ways and then deliver
to them in turn a very powerful piece of
information that gives them all the
context they need we want to try to get
as close to real time as possible it's
going to require a lot of stuff to do
this in the type of the tale we want
clearly satellite remote sensing is
going to be at the core of this there's
no question to do this outside the
United States you have to use remote
sensing we don't have information like
we have in the u.s. everywhere around
the planet we need data data data and
lots of visualization and yes ultimately
to try to actually do the world and try
to not just do the United States or even
Indianapolis but actually attempt to do
this across the entire planet and
obviously to go from here to there
there's a lot of things that have to
happen but I think technically there's
no reason why it can't happen and given
the magnitude of the problem which we've
been talking about now for 30 years to
me it's actually quite surprising that
we haven't done this that's probably
what's more surprising to me than how
difficult it is to do is that we haven't
done it we haven't even really tried and
I'm sort of floored by that I mean I
forget about it but when I step back
this problem it's actually surprising
that we haven't really gone and done
this when we really should so with that
I'll stop thanks again Simon and
hopefully a few minutes for some
questions thank you if someone has
questions please step by to the mic so
people can hear you if you're in the
remote office unmute and ask your
question oh you have to
said one scientific question about have
there been any experiments at a micro
level to see whether the biosphere can
become a source of emissions as with the
way one of those scenarios might play
out yeah I mean there's a lot of the
there's you know so the classic one is
soil incubation right take a bunch of
soil and heat it up and what does it do
and yeah co2 comes out of it when soil
gets warmer microbes are awake longer
during the year and they do start to
work through soil organic matter but at
the large this is the problem in sort of
global ecology is it's really difficult
to connect individual plot sort of
experiments and sort of extrapolate that
across the planet just because the bias
were so heterogeneous it's just so
different from one place to the next
right it's the classic kind of
everywhere you go is different and it's
profoundly true in the biosphere and so
while in lab studies certainly show that
as you warm up the planet you have co2
coming out of soils the problem is that
sometimes plants will actually start to
photosynthesize more so if it gets
warmer some you know mid latitude or
even high latitude plants they actually
like warmer temperatures in the tropics
they're usually near drought stress but
in the extra tropics they're happy so
it's actually a balancing act between
more co2 coming out of the soil and
actually more co2 going in it through
photosynthesis so it's a subtle balance
between the two and of course where the
balance lies which direction changes
whether something's a source or a sink
and so actually understanding that very
delicate balance between the two is
what's so hard at large scales which is
why to this at least right now models
are the only thing they've really been
able to sort of look at this question at
the large scale people have done in
greenhouses and in incubation studies
but over larger scales there's sort of
no other way to do this other than
models right now
the data you have on your website the
the download is add is that
comprehensive is that all the data
that's being used for example and earth
now and always yeah so the stuff that we
have that you can grab on the website is
not again very friendly right now right
we just sort of put 100 gigabytes of
gridded hourly emissions up on our
website for people to pull down and
again the only people they're pulling
that down or people like me who are
interested in running a atmospheric
model but we are trying to sort of move
towards more bite-sized bits of
information that are useful to people
outside of my community and obviously
through google earth will it be able to
serve up some data actually the research
google site we're going to serve up the
data right now we have just the co2
information rather than the underlying
source date although we point people to
that because we don't generate that
comes from the EPA it comes from the do
e and we definitely point people to that
but I think the goal for us right now in
the coming months in my opinion is
actually to make the data more
digestible to people outside my world to
make it in smaller packets we'd like to
have the website serve update on the fly
in smaller pieces so people can zoom in
on app and gang stuff off rather than
having to digest the entire hunter
gigabytes of the data files so we're
sort of in the midst of making this
better than it is now
okay thank you very much you go girl
