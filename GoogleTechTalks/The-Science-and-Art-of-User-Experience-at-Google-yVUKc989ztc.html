coming to Google my name is Peter Wilson
I'm one of the engineering directors
here in Kirkland and i'm just going to
introduce what we were talking about you
but before I do I have a list of
announcements of an earthquake restrooms
located in the hole we're going to be
recording this and putting it up on
google video we only to be renewing Jan
on the slide so you don't need why not
give choir see and enjoy because
obviously they're so put the Nativity on
google video last week's talk is also up
on over there what we're talking about
google video is a chance to mention that
that is one of several Google services
along with maps talk site maps google
pad which is developed here in kirkland
and so after this you feel free to hang
out and talk us on the engineers who are
working on these things and we have two
events after the following this 10 jun
21st we have an interesting study of all
courage juice which is google social
network environment a lil June
twenty-eighth we have to talk about
security but Google so that's it for the
introductions sign filtered
announcements and today's talk the signs
and out of use expansion can go and
promise except inception Google's
focused on providing the past and the
simplest user experience Jen Fitzpatrick
is going to talk talk us through the art
and science between a group like behind
google's design process and give
examples of our design usability there
to come together to create Google's
unique culture and computing center
products jen is an engineering director
googling runs Google's user experience
team insertion ativa responsible for the
user interface design and useful
analysis of Google's many products james
also led UI design testing augmentation
of numerous features and changes to to
google.com and prior to that general
injury
vector for Google's AdWords on its own
systems group as she joined Google as a
software engineer is a graduate of
Stanford University so please join me
what we did with pepper thanks everybody
and welcome i'm glad to be here so as
Peter said Google's really always
focused all of these are experienced
really right for its inception so today
they've spent a little bit of time
talking you through how that philosophy
took roots in the early days of Google
and how we made how we maintain it today
as Google exponent too much more of a
global brands today we have you know
many tens of products that are used by
people in over 100 countries over other
languages and you know 500 million
people all around the world so one thing
that google is always recognized for is
the utter simplicity of our homepage why
is it mr porter there you know google
has all of these products nowadays why
aren't their links to more than one page
surely the homepage is some pretty
valuable real estate write what you know
why don't we choose to put a few ads up
there you know make a make a quick buck
for me that's grown as much as we will
has over the years its homepage has
actually changed from our model so well
jump back in time this one google
homepage look like back in that back in
1999 the story the origin of Google's
homepage is actually sort of an
interesting one as you probably know
Larry and Sergey were graduate students
back now back in the Sam computer
science don't want them and they decided
to spin out what was then their their
research project and informal company
Google and so Sergei gothy you know got
the past with building building a home
page for this new service that they were
that they were putting together and it
turns out that Syria at the time didn't
know HTML and he really wasn't all that
interested in learning what he was
really passionate about doing was
building a search engine building a
product that worked and so he put
together the home page that you see here
something very close to it really as a
way to get the service up and running as
quickly as possible in many ways the
Google home page that you see today in
some respects you can't even claim that
it was almost a happy byproduct of
laziness on his part right lively for
the bother learning HTML to create some
you know fancy polished looking homepage
when really all it needed to do was get
people going on the way to searching
from the information that they were
looking for so over time though I think
it's this way you know rather an empty
home page became something of a much
deeper symbol about about our philosophy
design at Google and that philosophy is
don't put things in people's way right
give people the most direct route
possible to find the information that
they're looking for and you accomplish
the task what am I one of my colleagues
at Google for us and I respond and
talking about Google as a Swiss Army
knife right Google is a tool that gives
you exactly what you want when you want
it not everything you can possibly ever
want all the time Google isn't over
longing with a lot of choice up front
but when you need the power it's there
this simple attitude not putting things
in people's way has over time driven a
lot of the decisions that we made about
consumable site accounts vault we try to
think really hard about what features we
ought to include and which ones are
we're really better off leaving out
right it's always easy to add new
features to a pond right you know I do
any ideas are a dime a dozen but we find
that oftentimes what's much harder is to
have the discipline to decide the meat
things out all right so we try to ask
ourselves if we're adding a new feature
and thinking about adding a new feature
do we really think that this is going to
be useful and used by a larger portion
of our users if not maybe we're better
off moving it out so even though Google
right from the start was a pretty simple
site we realized that there was a lot we
believe didn't know about our losers who
were they how are they using her site
what was working well what wasn't and so
in january two thousand we decided on
our very first user studies ever in
typical Google fashion we took a
somewhat cheap and scrappy approach to
doing this so we took a couple of us on
Saturday afternoon and headed over to
the basement of the computer science
department at Stanford armed with an
armload of t-shirts and a handful of
twenty dollar bills okay and we managed
to get a number of students to spend an
hour with us using the google site and
talking to us about what worked and what
didn't and we learned a lot of very
interesting things we talked to one
person who we sat down and asked him to
start doing a search SAT there
many sad there's more he said there's
more and we're starting to wonder what's
going on and so finally you know we're
thinking maybe he's you know thinking
really hard about exactly what search
terms you ought to be typing in the box
and worried about now impressing us with
them you know sheer brilliance of his of
his search terms right well you know
this goes on for long enough that we
start to get all worried abundantly than
mu SE lo I know so can we ask what
exactly you're doing said oh well I'm
waiting for the rest of it first we
didn't go to page to look how are never
in a million years crossed his wines
that that was all there was right and so
you'll know today at the bottom of the
home page it's actually a copyright line
that appears there that copyright line
was first put there as a way to
punctuate the end of the page as a way
to say that's it page is downloading go
on now start searching we learned a lot
of other interesting things we got a
common for purses i dunno a couple looks
like some random guys home page not
exactly the impression that we were
looking to convey for you know a young
you know young startup company that was
hoping doing is we're taking over the
world with this you know with with with
a wonderful nature of its product we got
a lot of people on the end feeling lucky
button we suspected that no one would
really have any idea what the i'm
feeling lucky button it and if i have to
study for that out people had absolutely
no food what happened a lithography
lucky but the interesting thing we heard
time and time again was that people
liked it anyways and what they liked was
it made us seem a little bit quirky it
made us seem a little bit human it made
it seem as though there was some real
people behind the scenes people with a
little bit of personality possibly even
with a little bit of a sense of humor
who are they are building a making
work I think that's what an important
aspect of of how we've tried to continue
approaching and designing our products
fort on the Google logos that change the
holidays rather rather special events
are another great example of this it's a
way to show our users you know hey
there's there's no people behind the
scenes right we're taking the time to
try to just for a brief moment in your
day make you smile I think that's
something that our users have really
appreciated we learned a lot of other
things we learned that we had lots of
confusing language all over the site
using alerts of engineer speak and I
think this is a great indication of
something that those studies really
drove home for us which was that the
people using google were not the same as
those of us who were building it and
that sounds like a simple lesson but I
think it was a really important one for
us to for us to see first hand and so I
mean what back from these that initial
set of users face with a renewed sense
of motivation to go out there movie
start making some changes to the google
site not huge drastic changes right
overall made a lot of things that were
working well but a small series of
targeted changes ain't that really
addressing some of the issues that we
have found so i'll talk more in a little
bit about how some of those early forays
into in the user experience in google
really helped shape our overall our
overall philosophy philosophy of how
those have helped translate into into
the Google of today before I do that I
want to make one thing very clear if
there is one thing that I believe has
contributed more than anything else to
Google's growth and success you know
over over the past number of years it's
the fact that the product we have
fundamentally works and by that I mean
it serves a real user need Google works
because it puts people in touch with
they're looking for and it does that
quickly and efficiently I think it's far
too easy when you're thinking about user
experience to just think about things
like do I have an interface that's clean
and cleaner does it look pretty right um
I think those things are important right
you know usability matters matters a lot
but it only matters if underneath the
surface you've got a product that
actually works and it works well and
it's meeting really user needs and I
think that if you don't have a
fundamentally strong product and your
users are going to have no reason to
come back and using your side or using
your product I think that attitude has
been an important one for us to remember
over time not only for the user
experience to many people but for
everyone that's involved in building
control so so user experience team
Google's grown a lot for those early
days of and basement of Stanford where
we did over those user studies but in
many ways I did a lot of the basic
principles and techniques that we used
to develop a liar very much the same
today as they were back then yep user
interfaces are very easy thing for
everyone to have opinions about right I
think that leak should be blue logic
there should be room I think the natural
hey I think the navigation should go on
the left well I think it should go on
the top right opinions are easy to come
by but how you actually decide right and
so one of the things that we try to do
as much as possible here at Google is to
really rely on data-driven decision
making we do a lot of user studies we
try to rely on log analysis as much as
possible I'll talk a little bit about
how we take feedback from from are you
sister corporate but I can use that as
an interesting place and we also oops we
also really try to make sure that we are
experimenting often we try to which we
oftentimes will warrant for products
even though it may not be you know
perfect as far as we're concerned but
getting that feedback early and getting
getting about real users who are using
we find this is really important so as I
mentioned all of our Google products go
through go through user testing at least
one some often you know often several
times we we sometimes there are small
things from these studies things like a
particularly supporting not being clear
or you know things like that sometimes
we learn really major things like the
fact that the quality of our results for
a particular product just really isn't
up to par in those cases we might you
know send the engineering is back to the
dr once a you know we've got we've got
more work to do before this is ready we
try to focus as much as possible in our
user studies on a few core things one is
really good observation skills right
working on observing what the users are
doing and interpreting that to really
understand what's what's working with
the products and what's not getting
people to explore all products without
leading them too much and also really on
I also really I'm good moderation skills
right being able to being able to really
not ask that not asking the questions
the one thing that we find is absolutely
key is getting our engineering and
product teams in and observing the user
studies as they're happening we try to
do this as much as possible there's just
no substitute as I'm sure many of you as
I'm sure many of you have experienced or
getting people in there watching real
people interact with their product and
seeing what's breaking and so we try to
do that as much as possible we actually
just this week are getting our first
usability lab here in kirkland up at up
and riding employed functional if that's
one of the things I've been talking with
the number of the teams here about is
how excited some of the engineers are to
be able to see their products being used
in an easy and accessible fashion so if
there's one thing we learned time and
time again during these studies as I
said is that we're not representative of
our users I thought I'd share one one
small example of something that we
weren't crimson user studies this isn't
revelo from the the google talk at gmail
integration now as Peter mentioned this
is something but a lot of the work for
that for this project was done was done
here in kirkland so in the google talk
in gmail integration for those of you
that have used it will recognize when
you know when you get a message through
through google through google talk a
little a little message card pops up in
the bottom of your browser window so
this was this was an early version of
those others little message cards and
what we saw in user studies was the fact
that people would get these messages and
they couldn't figure out how to send a
reply you'll note there's no send button
on these cards and that was for good
reason there's you know these cards are
pretty small there's not much to being
real estate and particularly you know
for expert users is not you know a lot
of need to have a button there you know
time after time especially if just
anything returnable to the job just as
well but what to do why this we saw in
the studies this was clearly a problem
if something we needed to fix so
designers went back to work um it came
for the version 2 we figured okay people
don't know what to do will tell them
type in the box and press the Enter key
to send the message that seemed pretty
darn clear right surely this Julius was
all wrong but what we saw was um this
big bowl bright yellow message that was
sort of screaming at them up you know
does it work for some people but for
other people then they thought well this
must be a pop-up right and so it
wouldn't you really read what was going
on and if they would just hit close
right go away stop interrupting me right
well that's not so great either alright
so back to the drawing board once more
and the the designer came up with this
approach which is a more subtle
treatment you might claim and isn't that
very similar to what you see in the
pocket
today and in fact when tested this in
the lab we saw did it work much much
better I mentioned we also do a lot of
log analysis to check with what's going
on with iconic so there's a great
example of this that has to do with
Google's spelling suggestions so maybe
whoever done a search on Google typed in
a word you know accidentally misspelled
it you know Google will come back with a
spelling correction don't say you did
you mean it would give you the give you
the correct spelling so initially we had
a we had a spelling correction service
that was based on some third-party data
and quite frankly the the quality just
wasn't very good so as an example you
can type in you know you could type in
turbotax and try and search for that it
would come back and very politely say
did you mean to rabat apps well no not
so much so the first thing we did was we
we went to rendering the excel beyond
we've got to fix this right we've got to
build a better song so sure enough
several months later this little
engineering team comes back he said okay
we've got a better spelling corrector
and they did this by taking into him out
a lot of the a lot of the context that
you can get by looking at the web and
the data that's they are in fact came
out with with his whole apartment is
really pretty amazing in terms of in
terms of its overall quality and so we
said well this seems great less but
notice this seems a lot better so we
rolled that out and almost overnight the
click-through rate on those spelling
suggestions doubled remember what I said
about pat you have to have a good
product first and foremost that was
certainly and that was certainly a case
in point but as we went through and we
looked at the logs and we looked at what
was really happening we were still
seeing an awful lot of cases where
people were typing in misspelled words
and not clicking on that spelling
correction and we know when this happens
that people are probably not having a
very good experience right they're
probably getting a bunch of lower
quality search results because there
they're looking for this film or so we
thought okay what can we do about this
we started the new UI changes so the
first thing we did was the first thing
we did was me we made it big and we made
it red okay seemed like a good way to
get people that was it so we rolled out
this version in July and surprisingly
not the click-through doubles again okay
so you actually just can also have in
the back but we're looking at the logs
and we're still seeing a lot of
instances of people misspelling until
all of lunch we went ahead and repeated
this five suggestion at the bottom of
the page and this is the one that really
surprised us the click-through rate
doubled again okay and so this is an
example of really doing some careful
analysis of what people are doing with a
particular feature you know in you know
in particular in particular situation
and really using a lot of log data to
support the need for more and more
change and it turns out that by by
having this I haven't is fine suggestion
to placate it on a page we wound up
getting up to you to more usage behavior
like you know like likely expected given
the high quality that i mentioned using
customer support feedback we found that
paying really close attention to the
emails that come into our customers park
views can be a surprisingly good source
of insight about what's going on with
our users now you have to take user
support input with a heavy grain of salt
right people are pretty good about
writing in and complaining
things telling you telling you when
things are going wrong telling you when
they're unhappy they're not necessarily
so great about writing in and giving you
glowing praise just because something's
working exactly the way they expected it
to write but we have sometimes get love
letters as well my my personal favorites
misses from point of all that but
there's a managed at the time right into
Google's users report about the fact
that several days back he had started
feeling chest pains generally no was
going on so he turned on his fists
computer typed in heart attack symptoms
into Google discovered that he was in
fact having a heart attack called 911
Gallup had to take you to the hospital
and they told him on the way that if he
had been a few minutes later in calling
you probably would have been dead so she
took the time to write to us and say you
saved my life now that's a pretty fun
email to get let me tell you but anyhow
generally speaking users take the time
to write in write in to us when they're
finding Google laughing at some point
sometimes the ranch is also about
features that they really want to see
when we launched Google News for example
by far the biggest requests that we got
for our universe poison so we know this
is this a new very product it's really
useful but what I really want is I want
the ability to customize this news page
to my own usage somehow and that was a
very consistent refrain of users and so
sure enough that became one of the
features that we really prioritized and
you go to google news today there are
there there is the ability for people to
you know customize customize the page
create their own custom size we also get
feedback when we accidentally have boats
on the site yes that does
time and our user support teams know
that if they see complaint spiking about
our particular issue they better go
ahead and warn me in here he's very
quickly that they ask something they
need to look into and in fact we found
that this sort of user support feedback
when things are going wrong has been so
important that in many cases we've
created very direct links from the user
support folks to our product engineering
teams because they act as a very very
effective or warning systems there's a
great example of customer support
feedback that all Fenella mentioned
quickly that comes from the gmail world
anyone out there use gmail a few unions
so when we launched email we knew that
there were some things that we were
doing differently than other other email
services out there you know we were
doing these threaded conversations all
sorts of you know crazy Ajax badness we
were giving users so much storage that
they would never need to do me another
email and
we took nearly dropped down to the
system or actions but we figured there
wasn't much need to make it more
prominent than right after all you don't
ever need to delete email why do you
need a big button to you know let you
let you do it well yeah we were turns
out that not only didn't people write in
in spades to tell us how much they
wanted a delete button in gmail find
anyone in Google who's ever worked as a
member of the Gmail team and they will
tell you stories about their family
their friends random strangers they
would meet at parties when they would
tell them that they worked on gmail the
common refrain was I want the delete
button don't you get it I want the
delete button and so that was an
instance word where we played over where
we finally really did listen to our
users and sure enough if you used to be
one back into the back of the giro over
over the years are our user experience
will get at Google has certainly
expanded so for example we now have that
we now have an eye tracker that we use
to for certain changes you know track
you know I gave movements when people
are using various products and use that
to gain insight into what's working we
disbanded in doing more early-stage user
research for some of our projects and I
certainly expect that over you know over
the coming years our toolkit so to speak
will continue to expand and grow and
change but i think that the core set of
tools that we use really the philosophy
behind how we appreciate the experience
has stayed remarkably consistent
here's one core principle that we really
try to maintain as I mentioned is that
we we expect not to get things right on
the first try all right I think it's
really one of the most powerful things
about the web right unlike the world of
shrink wrap software where you can you
know build a product and you have to you
know sort of fill the test and integrate
for you know for months or perhaps and
years on then but then when you watch it
that's it there's no pulling back
there's this great thing about the web
that you can launch something and you
can learn from that launched about what
works and what doesn't and then you can
change things and you can iterate and
that's something that we really try to
make use of Google Labs is one place
that we that we've really tried to use
as an environment to take some of our
earlier stage I things take some of the
things that we know might not be perfect
if I'd yet but to put them out there in
the hands of our users and the same hey
try this out give us feedback</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
