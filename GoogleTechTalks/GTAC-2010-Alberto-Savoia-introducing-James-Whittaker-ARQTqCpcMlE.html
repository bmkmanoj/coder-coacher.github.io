gives James Whittaker the optimum of
software test publishing a full hour to
peddle his books and his lame ideas and
meet the author of the much more
valuable testicles only five minutes to
record a video is completely
uncomfortable unacceptable unbelievable
and absolutely unfair if you know what I
think I think that you can take James
book roll it up
and by the way if you think you can cut
me off after five minutes you got
another thing coming
oh there this is a Alberto Savoia I'm
sorry cannot be there with you today but
Google sent me to some management
training
as part of my training I'm supposed to
make amends to the people who have hurt
as a result of my anger and so I'm here
to officially apologize to James
Whitaker I am sorry I called you a
b-list speaker I'm also sorry that I
called you the Octomom of test book
publishing sorry that I said that your
papers your books and papers should be
recycled and made into adult diapers
please accept my apologies I guess I'm
just jealous because you've managed to
write a ton of books that were published
by addison-wesley whereas my book let
the way of testicles was self-published
and printed by King Co you richly
deserve
that hundreds of dollars that you make
each year from the publishing of your
books so I hope that this counts as a
good formal and public apology so I can
go back to my anger training and also I
want to introduce you my former good
friend and colleague dr. James Whitaker
you're going to be treated to his
keynote presentation to close G tack
where I'm going to be treated with some
electroshock therapy at this point I'm
not sure which one of us is like here
bites again enjoy James talk and James
thank you for being a good sport hope to
see in mind of you soon bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
