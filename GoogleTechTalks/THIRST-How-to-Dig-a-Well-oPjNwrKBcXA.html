Bob humanity initiative which is a local
grassroots humanitarian organization a
nonprofit organization which focuses on
education cultural exchange between
western Africa and the United States and
human development projects and this
morning we are privileged to have with
us Antonio Gutierrez from northern Togo
originally Antonio is from Spain where
he studied history philosophy theology
and geography and he was a teacher for
over 10 years and he has spent the past
20 years in western Africa he has
devoted his life to the people there
working with communities who lack basic
living supplies the primary one being
lack of access to clean water he is a
living success story about how to
empower impoverished people to work
together to improve their living
conditions he has he has overcome
political and cultural hurdles to
accomplish projects with far-reaching
benefit for many people he dresses like
the people he lives with he speaks five
languages and he's learning another and
he is adept at identifying viable
solutions to complex challenges so with
that I would like to remind you that you
may feel free to ask questions during
the talk he'll be happy to answer them
during the talk and after the talk
anyone who would like to join him and a
couple other employees for lunch you are
welcome to do so and now I present
Antonio who will talk about thirst how
to dig a well
okay thank you to you and you know for
me speaking different languages from
time to time is really hard when I
arriving here sometimes I have a hard
time just to understanding you the way
you speak because you speak very quickly
anyway I think I have left from 10,000
years ago yes to come to hold the
situation today and is not 10,000 years
ago no is something that I'm living
today but I'm living over there same
that people used to live maybe 10,000
years ago in here you know the
difference is is really important but
for me what's happening and I went to
Africa and when you arrive there you
realize that the way in which you think
and the way things are happening are not
same thing your reaction and the region
of people is not the same then then you
have to sit you have to stay with them
and you can't be as quickly as you are
in here because usually you have a brand
new formula 1 racing car in the air on
foot unless you park your Formula One
racing car and work with them you can do
anything then the first thing you have
to try to do is to try to understand
them to comprehend why don't they do
this and this and this and after you
realize that you can work with them what
a do I try to just to see what they need
and after to answer to the needs they
can have and not only it's not possible
yes to say I give you IV that doesn't
work the way is you have a need we will
try to see it will try to see together
how we can deal with this thing doesn't
matter what digging a well building a
school within a bridge or doesn't matter
what yes to stay with them and to make
them conscious that it is their problem
not my problem then yes to help them to
grow in order to solve their own
problems well there are so many images
but you know when I am arriving here
I've signed something just saying this
you can use the images the year so
surprised when I take an image and after
i'm going to pass them with my computer
can you imagine the only computer or
around is mine can you remain things
like that and but what is the problem
that people over there can read all
right then then what can we do you know
their one end and the other hand maybe
today we are going to be able to
approach something and try to help those
people why because i think many times we
are thinking about ourselves and we are
not very conscious about how many things
we can do for the others and and maybe
today i can be the voice of those who
can not say anything who have no voice
yes to speak to those who are in the
other end well to dig a well is
something very important for them can
you imagine people work 34 miles to look
for water
well sorry I said people know women
women work then when I want to do to dig
a well fasting I say everybody in the
village has to be present why nobody can
tell me I don't drink water nobody can
tell me I don't half-ass hour a day even
you know as our is not something like
that is a packet in a glass and you're
going to pour what but everybody needs
it and you know first thing what I do is
a meeting a meeting with everybody with
everybody how many times 1 2 3 10 times
till the moment that I realized that
they are ready to collaborate that they
have realized that it's their problem
and after I try to look for the place
how do i do to look for the place well
if I tell you the reality I didn't want
to believe it I went to my country and I
spoke to somebody who is a very good
person to look for water and I told him
you know this year I have a tried and in
four different wells I will have gone
over 30 meters 50 meters is how many
feet hand of it and I didn't find what
enough he told me is up to you to do it
I was so surprised that he repeated is
up to you to do it well I can't tell you
today is up to me to do it with this
with this I try to look for water this
past season I mark 19 different places
and in all the 19 different places we
found water funny yes but is the reality
I I don't know how but I know that here
if I want to know where the water
you know I just asked easier what any
here right you know then I try to say
which place towards over there I can go
and I can find just the place you know
sometimes you don't see it why because
it's me who has the the the combination
da lapa photo camera sorry I you know
something i'm looking for the end right
way and sometimes is me who takes the
photograph people over there can I don't
know how to take them then you know
what's the problem if I look for a
machine and I come and I do every or all
the work they are not conscience and
they are going to be a little child that
is asking for I don't think is the way
if they say like this is it look we are
we have two hands and we are going to
work together is the way you know how do
you dig it I have marked the place and
little by little I do teams why I asked
all the people used to come and after
women know that they are not going to do
the work now the women are going to work
after then men are going to be there
young people who can work are going to
be there in teams to work but all people
are going to be there yes to control you
know is it something that unless you
know what is happening over there and we
are going to make many mistakes unless
you stay with them unless you live with
them and if you know the language is the
dress I'm wearing is something fun for
you I think but is the way in which
people dress over there then if they see
a white person dressing like this this
is
oh he is with us is the way he has to
please them and is the way to feel
comfortable with them and is the way in
which they are going to accept you if
you speak the languages is the most
incredible thing I remember once I used
to go to a village regularly to play and
a one day an old person an old man what
he has some and doing something and ask
me what do you do in here when you can
hear why do you come and I said I come
yes to pray with people and you know he
told me I'm going to pray in order you
will be as old as I am I no surprise but
I realized when they when a person says
something like this he is expecting an
answer from me and I say what can I
hands and this is good well i'm going to
play in order you will see me being as
old as you are he was so pleased that
they could understand that from that day
on he didn't stay there if he sees me
coming he was yes getting up and can and
to say me hello from then on we are very
very good friends you know is the way
you have to deal with them you have to
understand to comprehend their way and
then they are going to let you know how
you can work with them I'm speaking and
you know how they are doing and how they
work by hand why because machines are
not there then is not a possibility if
you do something for them they are not
going to be conscience too aware that is
their problem I usually go with a with a
bottle and I say you have problems with
water years we have I don't have
problems you know
I have a bottle in my car always but is
not yes to disturb you is just to let
you know that in the same way that they
have i SPECT one day you are going to be
able to tell me we don't have problems
with water you know and then unless
thinking there are several steps the
first one is to find water drink but
after easiest to think how if the rainy
season is four months who working for
months can eat 12 then if i can find
water enough yes to do gardens and to
grow vegetables they are going to
improve their a food and then things are
going to be better you know you are not
looking at this and but i can tell you
every detail even the name of these
people how i have worked together with
then how i have meetings i have had
meetings with them and he try to take
all the things that are happening you
see where he's asleeping can we do
something like that there are so many so
many funny different things that but you
know you get used you get used to them
and they get used to you for me one day
I remember was was really touching when
I was with the group of leaders in that
everybody could understand French and in
I'm working with them and I was telling
them you know I don't know how to deal
with you I try to do it in this and this
and this and this and I can't find an
answer and you know I would like you to
but and in the same moment somebody told
to his neighbor in his language this guy
he loves us I will show touch the take
wouldn't say a word after they said me
go ahead
is ok today I funder stood all that I
wanted why because I was just pushing
them but they were telling me it's not
possible for us to go quick just and I
know I have to stay with them I had to
take my time with that because usually
they say you have the worst but we have
the time mr. different he's the
difference and unless you try to come to
them and to stay with them and to live
with them ensure love them a good work
is really hard to be done this is the
rainy season finished and and what a
school what happened I want to join a
great a welcome is about two miles away
from here what happened 70 children that
came I was yes saying they hello because
I tried to make adult concerns that what
the important thing is children they
don't pay attention about children then
70 children couldn't answer to my
greeting I was so surprised that it was
happening the nearest school is four
miles away who ma you can work for miles
in the morning and four miles back in
the evening then what I try to do is yes
have meeting with the parents and just
make them very concerned that they have
to send the children to school and
that's the beginning of a school see go
ahead I think it there are you know was
that I tried over there no Dex no tables
no chairs I try to buy this hood is the
place in which they are going to be able
to write
because even if I can do it it's not
good for me to do everything is the
parents who must try to do it and
sometimes I have to wait I have to make
them do the effort just to do it well
see this is the classroom when this past
week I was just passing in here in the
school the children where various em but
I told her I i I've told them see is the
way is the way in which I try to deal
with them and and let them know that it
is their problem and it is them who can
go ahead with the situation see the
table can you imagine the benches over
there it's funny but it is what they
have a construct and you know over there
this is before that the children started
the school the parents were there we had
several general meetings this is the
project just to construct a school over
there since class school maybe about 600
children is not 1000 hundred dollars how
much is cool in here after this I have
prayed about building high school
because there are many primary schools
but we want to go ahead and it's going
to be hard but when we're there and we
try to do our best and you know I'm not
just thinking the best thing about money
or how can but I've just got in here and
I realize that maybe some many Ramon you
can help me
if you are able I'd be very pleased
after the general meeting they were out
you see everybody is happy the rainy
season is finished but does the the
parking lot the only have you seen the
only car is mind but Michael sure is not
for me is yes because they need the
things that I have and the car lets me
yes to be in here today and in the
morning and you have to another place
and being together in other cities and I
think you know that very near to the
very close to the school I try to look
for the wall using here when I was yes
ready to come somebody the director of a
school came with a letter he has to ask
for what to build who to dig a well in
his school but he told me and the other
five six schools around have the same
problem they have built the school but
no water then you know this past season
I I was dealing with 19 wells in 19
different places especially thinking
about the problem women have because is
up to women just to bring water to the
house but well in the same person in the
same situation that the 19 a we have
already done there about 150 more only
in the parish where I am but isn't there
are many other possibilities and these
three young people are the teacher what
was the problem then when I wanted to
start the school
I realized that people over there speak
a language and then I couldn't find any
teacher from their language then these
teachers that are going to teach in
French had to take a month class about
how no teachers yes to stay with people
yes to try to understand or to hear word
people speak a man before they have
started with children at the school in
order yes to understand something
because I lived in this period in it was
really her I remember one teacher came
to me to ask yes to help them with a
well and then when we have arranging
things I told him we have to change to
call a general meeting for the older
parents and he was just asking where can
I find somebody to translate it and I
told him myself I can you can speak the
language from here years and he was so
surprised when I was speaking to the
people in their language and they could
answer and he could you couldn't imagine
things like that but you know for me is
clear hockey is going to open a door
with the language you can open work the
head of people and therefore you do yes
to learn the local language is is really
important can you imagine your kids at
the school like in here you know how
I've told you that I come from 10,000
years you know the difference and you
see no books no books is a very big
problem I was just telling to the kids
how many folks do you have you see no
books only the little black birds in
which they write with a piece of chalk
but is the way is what you find over
there and it would usually do there's
not a sub in which as you can
bye you know we are doing a blackboard
how do you do it yes to paint you have
to deal with the things you have and you
have to try to solve the problem you are
going to find over there this is a
meeting with a the one who are a leader
of the parents what you have to do to
choose though who can speak French why
because otherwise is terrible that you
can't deal with them if they don't don't
understand what you speak over there is
a French biggest country the official
language is French there are from 10-2
tension that can speak some English they
have trouble maybe they have done many
years eh maybe in Ghana or maybe in the
area but can you imagine that school
does why I'm just thinking about
building a nice school I have been here
the project you see the black ball well
from time to time there are people that
come around and visit and I used to take
them you know seeing a in the beginning
was really funny because I used to
arrive and say good evening how are you
no answer little by little you know when
they start I yes Corey understanding
they are able yes to leave their hands
they wait to answer the books over there
the teachers book in notebooks and
seawater they come with water from the
house but from the house at sometimes
they have worked a 34 miles to look for
water
different teachers in different
classroom and evolve I was asking the
the pupils in here you know what does
mean to have a ball the day I arrived
with that ball and everybody was passing
like Odysseus touching the one it was
for them she was or everybody was so
pleased so happy those books over there
I was looking for they have written a
here it is not allowed to be sold anyway
I paid 1200 50 francs it's about three
and half dollars in three and half
dollars is the celery their parents can
and into were in today's work you think
what it was what does it mean to have a
book over there a lady asked me what can
I do how many books you can i send if
you want to send a container and maybe i
can give one book one boot to each one
of the thousands of pupils that we have
over there they love to play you know
now do you remember how in the beginning
was Green how now everything is dry how
fins there are two season but during the
rainy season they work in the fields and
you can go to this because see no was
fun no no possibility yes to go because
you are going to have a problem anytime
and I was just taking them to the well
and I was asking to the teary people was
that and I've told them does the school
bus how many people can go in
how many people can go in the school bus
I remember once I took them you know the
parents are really happy we have
finished the meeting see even when they
have nothing many times they are much
more happy that we are having so many
things why because I'm sure since dung
make you happy and money is not the most
important thing there are many more
things more important than money and
having things friendship is something
that and when you understand people he
loves us is really nice something like
that you know how many people how many
people can enter the school bus about
about dirty and they are so happy yes
the going in the same way that I'm a
working with building school dean wells
I've thought about the constellation of
them why because when the rainy season
arrives the water comes but if you can
stop it there I'm not let the water will
go things are going to change and I'm
thinking about changing what the way in
which people live in is not yes to bring
them a computer computer why because
they can't use it we have to go step by
step and just being with them and know
what they need because somebody came and
he told me I'm going to give you a motor
he has to bring the water from the well
I said no but I give it to you is free
is a present I don't want it why because
the women that work 34 miles
to look for water and have watery here
are very happy with it then then the
moment that the women are going to ask
for it I'm going to meet them I'm going
to ask them how much you are going to
give me for it doesn't matter if they
say five and it is 5,000 is not a
problem but is there collaboration in
each their situation here they have
built a bridge Hannah Bridget that you
know has gone and the best solution
should be yes not to build all the
average just to make Adam in order water
will stay there you know and against the
15 I passed across this this August
defeating i remember i passed across
this bridge but after i think three
different moments in which a heavy rain
came then everything went away and i
remember it was an engineer who came
over there and said this is a very nice
place because everything is to be done
you know nothing has been done and you
know this is the formal bleach the water
has swept it away yeah so a lot of these
people that
with do not have education and yet you
need them to do things that require
quite a bit of education so how do you
find people to do projects of this scale
how do you find people to build a bridge
one that requires engineering skills hey
well you want to know how I can find
people yes to do projects like this well
maybe you you yourself can find the
answer who has called me to come here he
who has followed a the situation you I
just tried to get me here to let people
know what I need and then if somebody
want to help me I'm just happy to
collaborate I am ready and to do what
they can do for me what not only for me
but for the people over there would they
get involved in a project like this
unless they are not involved there's
nothing to do you know we are just seen
the bridge it is a story that means the
disability there was a village that was
in two parts of the river and then then
there was an nonprofit organization that
came and said we are going to build you
a bridge and then they can build a
bridge people were very happy with the
bridge but you know the rainy season was
a heavy one and then came and took it
away the the earth in that they have put
yes around the bridge and they called to
those who have built the bridge you know
we have problems we we want you to help
us the arrival is very easy is only up
to you to put the air and they haven't
thought about it why because everything
have been done for them no no
is not the way what you have to do is to
involve them for example in de ganar oh
well you have seen in for example Adam
when you want to make Adam what can you
do for example you need stone you are
going to organize everybody in the
different villages just to bring a stone
they are going to be very happy just
saying it is us who have made it
otherwise if you bring the stones they
are going to think oh oh goodness no I'm
going to steal it and going to take it
away no no it's not the way the way is
just to let them participate to involve
them in the situation when I make a
school the young people working are
invited yes to say once you have built
your school you are going to come here
to learn to read and write is your right
because is you who have a word in here
then it's up to you to come you know
unless they don't feel that the theme is
for them and that it is them who have
participated is difficult and an
development is not to give a present
development is to chain mentality and to
help them to Stan if they are just
laying help them to stand okay thank you
for your question
you know the effects of the heavy rain
it's aight aight arrives and it arrives
what's the problem that when they are
constructing they are not really
conscience maybe maybe we don't have all
the different possibilities that may
happen and and when you see things in
here you can imagine that a heavy rain
the water maybe a 15 to 20 feet high and
it is a violas but a few hours is enough
yes to sweep the different wells I think
things are really different for me you
really have to imagine where I am but I
thing for you is really difficult years
to remain where I am to over there mid
but maybe we can bring things together
to realize you know I went he has to
visit the other place and I realized
that when a heavy rain came water has
gone over the bridge and see the holes
that they have dead when the water was
going through and we are going to see
see the bridge and where the water came
arrive yeah you know you realize that
the water has gone over the bridge and
two days ago things have gone c is a how
the bridge is now they are yes a trying
to repair but it was happening elysium
took place last
sunday then because it was the period in
which elation were going to take place
even the president k 500 miles away he
came over there and visit in a
helicopter I'm sure in for a year's time
nothing will be done then you have to go
across the water during the rainy season
nothing to do but but if I am able to do
something the government and the
authorities are going to be very happy
with the things you are going to do
because they recognize that you are with
the population that you are with people
and that you try to help them for
example this year I just started in the
little city where I am with a campaign
to let people come to learn to read and
write all the people that go to you can
say a vocational school but try to learn
something from a vocational school I
have spoken to all the Masters and they
said the the people who the young people
to touch the school he has to learn to
read and write I have about 500 in the
city but all around a well see how many
people are in the in the school mission
and there they come with the children
they are like this now some of them are
learning in the local language not many
because I prefer day to do the effort to
learn friendship because is
much more interesting because when you
are moving speaking French is the way
yes to communicate with the other you
know the that is a language called
mobile I'm learning it I was really
happy yes to when I went there to find
the meter and even coming here when I
have a little time I tried to learn your
pal a mobile and the books that I was
really lucky that I have found them but
immokalee is me well not only me but the
team that was working with me that we
have done this and additionally we have
made it from locally French and French
muckalee it is our group of that and you
know then when you have done it and you
realize that is the way in which are at
all is the language is not going to be
lost today he's going to they have come
to me with the number of those who want
to a led to to go to school to learn to
read and write go ahead see here which
number go yeah the total is 154 or 84
but that was a group and i have several
groups i think i will have about 500
coming to learn to our school in the
mission can you imagine i am in here and
they say who can read everybody is is
normal over there I can see who can read
many times is only me who can read can
you imagine the difference but but for
me the important thing is to to realize
what is my virtue and what is their
fault why we are here and we can read
right and we can have so many things and
why they are there and they can and they
don't have as many things as we have a
welcome what can we do he has to say yes
to share what our time our possibilities
our money just we do to be conscious
that is not up to us yes to run where
there were they too too young amen and
running like this where are we going I
don't know said the other in the other
said hurry up we are going to be late
many times we can have something like
this just to realize that people are you
know the meeting people need our help
and I've told you I want to be the boys
of those who have no boys over there is
really funny but nobody can speak French
hold it the teacher big yes yeah for me
through the problem I am speaking I'm
just speaking anyway if you want to ask
because you know and yes showing you
something but maybe the question you are
going to ask to me are much more
interesting because I what they want the
things you want to know better than the
things I I'm leaving anybody yeah
yeah he wants to know if they're all of
them have bites not even all not even on
having a girl in here is much more easy
than having a bicycle over there not
everybody has a bicycle not everybody
can afford it something we can imagine
the reality is there oh yes what what do
the people do during the dry season if
there's no yeah there are two different
seasons the rainy season in which people
work like the animals and during the dry
season nothing to do then is the problem
what do they do during the dry season I
try to make them conscience how they
have to work they have to prepare things
you know because you know the one who
can't count one two three many can't
organize things can and what you have to
do is just to help with them to organize
things how yes sending them to school
one of the things i have done is
planting trees in here i can speak about
good how to save a forest a tree for the
station is the weather i was looking for
thank you Here I am Telling You well you
know the desert is coming quickly then
we have to plant trees yes to stop over
there that is nothing but when you say
if you plant these trees in three years
time you are going to have food enough
to it and those who can prevent who can
count can't organize things and when the
crop has
it doesn't matter if it is 10 or 20 or
50 sites that have arrived they are
going to a and to finish it in four or
five months and the rest problems then
would I have tried to do is to put trees
cashew trees that can feed them the
moment that a corn and sorghum is going
to lack and especially what I would have
I done yes make things in order women
will realize how things are not very
difficult you see a Casio I didn't know
anything about about Cassie trees I
didn't know anything about planting
trees or about digging wells but what's
happening when I see that people have a
problem I try to be with them and to
solve the problem with them then I try
to be with then you know they are
throwing yes it but that a kind of Apple
has nine times the vitamin C that the
oranges have then if you dry it the
moment that there is still there are too
many you can dry them and after does
like a sweet for them then if women
arrive to dry it to put in a plastic bag
to three months later they can give them
to the kids and the kids are going to go
to school and they have found something
to eat and you know I was thinking about
a sending them yes to sell and but when
I realize trade that's terrible that's
the sea and the Sharks grf biting people
then then
I just tried to tell them you know you
have things in here to eat food enough
you don't have problems if you want to
start with a trade from time to time you
see a supper that says I'm selling here
things coming from South America or
Africa is something very very dangerous
difficult but at least for me if they
arrive to realize that things can happen
like that because you know this is 600
francs and they used to come from the
village with wood maybe maybe over a
hundred pounds of wood and they are
going to receive 300 this is not heavy
you can come with this and you're going
to find somebody to buy it he is the way
it should take a few more questions and
then yes any more question I think
you're surprised about something so
different can you imagine something like
that is funny yes the clothes
yeah yeah you know this is the the
clothes they usually use a bank holiday
or maybe on Sunday but usually they can
get second-hand clothes coming from
Europe or coming for America ed they're
going to buy it they were too worried
there are two different ways in day
dress the bank holiday they are very
well dressed and they day a work day
they usually well not everybody but
because some of them don't have even
money two were close I remember I was in
charge or depression and at least six
time I could find clothes for all the
300 prisoners I used to get a container
and then from the welfare in the in my
city they sent me clothes just to give
one to each one of those who are
imprisoned we'd like to thank all of you

here for a few minutes after the talk if
you'd like to come up and ask more
questions also we invite you to join us
