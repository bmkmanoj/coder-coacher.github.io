up in Ireland but at some point his
career moved to the east coast of the US
and I was taught in a number of schools
throughout Massachusetts and East Coast
he's currently a research professor at
some old dominion university he's
interested in the area of geophysics in
particular he wants to be able to
visualize stuff on the ground which
means google earth isn't an overly
useful tool for him in some ways however
rather than complaining about this fact
he's actually gone out and done
something about it so using google earth
in combination with sketchup he's found
weird and wonderful ways to bring those
visualizations above the ground and into
the users viewpoint and he's going to be
talking on this and some related themes
today thanks very much soon I'd like to
start by acknowledging support from the
NSF ccli and EA or programs for helping
me to develop these as teaching tools
and last year by at this conference I
showed people what I thought of at the
time is a hack of a way of looking at
the subsurface because geologists and
geophysicists like me want to see what's
under the Google Earth and so I'd felt
technique of basically lifting up blocks
of the Earth's crust to look at what's
underneath and then the more I use this
with students the more I realized that
it's actually a very useful pedagogical
tool even if we could fly under the
google earth surface it would still be
good for students to lift blocks up
because that enables them just to see
the data as for coming from below they
they've lifted the data up out of the
ground themselves that tactile element
is pedagogically beneficial so with the
title of my talk this year how would you
move Mount Fuji according to the the
author of this book by william penn
stone anyway this is typical of the kind
of question that you might have been
asked at an interview in Microsoft
maybe a decade ago Bill Gates apparently
liked asking people impossible what he
called the impossible question maybe
that's so to those to choose people to
develop software that's impossible to
use that's my own personal bias but
anyway I thought about this question and
thought a more important question really
is if you could move Mount Fuji why on
earth would you want to and isn't Mount
Fuji quite happy sitting there where it
evolved in Japan and budget as a
geologist the answer is immediately
evident and one initial answer that
question would be to look inside the
mountains see what the interior of the
mountain looks like and so if we want to
look inside mount fuji one idea will be
to lift it up and look underneath and
I've been developing this technique to
lift blocks out of the ground using
Sketchup so this is a USGS map of the
Washington State region and if we lift
up a Sketchup block out of the ground we
see USGS data models anywhere on the
side of this block showing how the one
the fuker plate part of the pacific
ocean crust is dipping down underneath
the continental crust of Washington
State and letting let you know if our
volatiles that then cause the magma is
sent to create mountains like Mount
Rainier and mounted and so on and this
block is it just one of a whole set that
I've developed air and I put my web
address in the bottom left here you can
go to that link and see dozens of
similar blocks for different plate
tectonic scenarios around around the
globe you'll notice the time slider at
the top of the image here I'm using that
time slider to adjust the altitude tag
of the Sketchup model here so when you
move the time
slider you're basically changing the
altitude tagging KML and that's what
causes the block to move up and down so
let's look at making a block like this
in Sketchup we start getting rid of the
guy there and pull out a rectangle
extrude that into a rectangular block
and I've see you notice that i extrude
downwards in the negative Z direction
because I want my block to start under
the ground and then I select a couple of
images here I'm putting a map on the
surface but you could actually grab a
bit of the google earth surface itself
and plant it on the top of the block if
you wanted to look like part of the
Google Earth surface here i'm taking the
USGS cross section dragging it across as
a texture across the side of the block
and sketchup and then we can manipulate
that texture is expanded scale it
rotated make it fit the block to suit
our own needs I've more work to do on
this one here but you get the idea so
then we save that as a a KMZ file and as
I said then go into the KML and and put
a time span in the placemark that
controls the block that's the basic idea
for a block and as I said I've made lots
of these but you'll notice they have a
flat or a smooth surface now that's okay
for the scale that we're looking at here
say if we were looking at Mount Fuji
from space from the space shuttle and
we're sufficiently far away that it's
only really the large-scale plate
tectonics were seen here things like
mountains aren't represented here by
more than the thickness of a line by a
pixel or maybe two pixels and so it
doesn't really matter that the top of
the surface top surface of the block is
is flat the earth is pretty flat on this
scale but if we were to cloak go closer
up in there is a view an oblique view of
Mount Fuji from let's say helicopter
elevation and at this scale it
a flat-topped block would be senseless
for it certainly would be useless for a
geologist to convey the three
dimensionality of the mountain so how do
we actually but topography on the
tougher are our block so let's start by
capturing some terrain in Sketchup so
the trick here is to get real close you
have to be at an elevation of 5
kilometers or less which means you might
have to patch together a few little bit
you can then import that terrain into
Sketchup there it is bump it into a
three-dimensional terrain using the
Sketchup tool and now we select it and
select all and explode the hidden
geometry the block so we get down to the
polygons that define this topography now
we could actually manipulate each
polygon one by one we could create
erosion by moving polygons down our are
a lava flow by moving them up are we can
change the location of this block either
an altitude or in latitude or longitude
so here I've taken a slice out of Mount
Fuji put a very simple student style
cartoon of the interior of the of the
mountain and and you see that the time
slider I've just set to loop forwards
and backwards so that lifts the altitude
of the block up and down and meanwhile
the student can rotate it around and
look at it from all sorts of directions
can even fly inside the mountain if they
want to have a look inside and part of
the project I'm working on with the
colleague Steve Whitmire at GMU is to
find out whether this kind of cartoon
cross section is actually beneficial to
learn in versus real data like geo
seismic sections cartoons are simpler
for students but but they're clearly not
real and maybe the real data might be
more meaningful to students well that's
say moving of the mountain in the
vertical direction what about the
lateral direction why would we want to
do that
why would we want to move Mount Fuji to
a different location well the reason we
would goes back to something that
Charles Lyell one of the forefathers of
a fair geology said in the 19th century
said the present is the key to the past
if we want to understand the past
geology of our planet we need to look at
what's happening on the Earth's surface
at present and use that as an analog so
here in this movie I'm about to run this
is I've taken just little chunks of the
continents put them back to where they
wear half a billion years ago you see
Africa and South America stuck together
as Gondwana in the bottom left and North
America in the top center of the image
they're about to hit into each other to
make a supercontinent we called Rodinia
and then they'll split apart again and
come together in a different orientation
to make Pangaea which is the
supercontinent most people know about so
we're going way back before Pangaea here
so let's let's roll it and I've marked
Western Massachusetts in the North
American block so here they smash into
each other drift apart create the proto
Atlantic Ocean and now you see a
japan-style arc drifting across that
ocean and smashing into at North America
that's eastern Massachusetts which came
along and hit into western Massachusetts
to create the state that I used to live
in up to last year and and so here's an
ideal opportunity for us we have just
down the road from where I lived in
Massachusetts we have these frost
shattered lavas they're called higher
class type but you don't need to know
that they're also pillow lavas these are
in the indicative that lava flowed
bubbled into the ocean and the frost
shattered lava shows that they may there
there was ice around that lava erupted
under an ice cap so we have paleozoic
volcanics in an arc in eastern
massachusetts today and the rocks
indicate that they were very like Mount
Fuji when they were formed so we can now
take Mount Fuji and represent these
rocks using using it as a model now lots
of people have put paleo geographic map
some draped them out to the google earth
surface particularly run blakey's maps
have been used and Valerie run of run us
off has animated them and that's fine in
two dimensions but if you if you
actually make this map semi-transparent
you look at the terrain underneath it's
the new terrain the current elevations
that are under that map where it says
island arc there if you if you pop this
into three dimensions you won't get the
mountains in D and they see in the right
place so in addition in addition to our
panel your geography we need a patio
terrain and so that's what I'm trying to
do I'm trying to take some like Mount
Fuji and replicate it in order to create
a a patio terrain I'm particularly
interested with my colleague Steve
Whitmire in the the upper right end of
this Japan like arc because it outcrops
in my home country of Ireland in western
ireland and there we see paleozoic
volcanics in the image on the top right
here in a place called Knockhill bride
and those rocks formed in an island arc
environment so let's take Mount Fuji and
put it there and because if volcanoes
grow in a self similar fashion it's a
simple manner it matter to to simulate
volcanic growth by simply moving the
volcano up out of the ground by changing
its elevation so here I'm taking a
volcano actually this one isn't Fuji
this is sick in Ireland from the
illusions but it'll do and it said it's
simulating what those and paleozoic
rocks in western ireland looked like at
the time that they were they were formed
now in addition to taking something like
Mark Fuji sometimes we don't want that
very recognizable Fuji and snow-capped
there for example we might want the area
to look more vegetated or less so we can
use the match photo tool in Sketchup to
drape any kind of image we wish over the
Fuji terrain model and so here I've
taken an image of Hawaii and draped it
over over the terrain to to create a few
gdm that will be suitable for example to
represent an island are in the
Cretaceous when it would be unlikely to
have a snow cap on it if we were looking
at a lower paleozoic volcano we wouldn't
want all that vegetation because it is
pre pre forests and grasses and so we
might take a volcano from the Altiplano
of chili for example and drape it we
could also take our own geological maps
I've put on the right here a geological
map that have just sketched myself and
draped it over the terrain watch the
volcanic structure grow and with the
google earth plugin we can now control
these models with with javascript so i'm
rotating Mount Fuji around three
independent axes here you might say why
on earth would you want to do that but
again geologists realize that parts of
the earth's crust get stretched and
squashed and smashed and broken up and
so we want to do all sorts of things to
to bits of the earth's crust and so I'm
very excited about the possibilities of
working working with JavaScript
controlled models and Google Earth and
on the using the plugin Oh carry her I'm
taking a map of the northwest part of
Ireland here restoring fault
displacements so that they set slices
of crust that ireland's made up of go
back to where they were in the Paleozoic
and quite you know quarter to have been
in years ago and and now we can do one
extra thing here and that is we can link
those palio places and that as they
existed on the Earth's surface a 400
million years ago using what are called
back to the future placemark we can take
those places and link them to the
present day evidence for that tectonic
model so in the pocket of a pop up the
image here you see the pillow lavas the
these volcanic rocks that flowed under
water and that we use as evidence to
suggest that this place used to be a
narc so if you like the present de mm is
key to the past een and we can use
samples of the present terrain move them
around to to effectively represent past
landscapes the ultimate goal beyond
today's Google Earth is is to represent
the landscape at every place on earth at
every moment in the past so for example
we can see Iceland John today's google
earth we'd like to see it three million
years ago seven million years ago 15
million years ago and be able to go
there fly around helicopter around it
just as we can with today's with today's
landscape okay so if you answer the
question how would you move mount fuji
by saying with google earth and the
macintosh or pc and then certainly with
sketchup you might not get yourself a
job and in microsoft but on the other
hand you might get yourself job as a
research scientist and Old Dominion
working with me and trying to change
google the Google Earth thanks very much
yes
test
stand
okay the question is and as I understand
it have we plans to test the efficiency
of of our animations and are moving
images versus static cartoons and the
answer is yes we we have a cohort of
colleagues lined up to test our blocks
and our paliotta reins in sections of
large intro classes and we'll have other
sections of those classes that use the
classical methods in order to make those
comparisons we're also using logging
software to check what the students are
doing how they are using the materials
to to learn</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
