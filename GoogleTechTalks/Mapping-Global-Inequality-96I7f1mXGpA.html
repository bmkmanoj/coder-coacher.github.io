about the UC atlas of global inequality
I'm going to talk for a few minutes
about giving a sense of the mission or
the vision Suresh loader one of my
colleagues from computer science will
talk a bit introducing a number of
people talking about the capabilities of
our atlas and then I'm going to talk a
bit more about some projects we have
planned and finally we're going to talk
about a conference which we're
organizing for December the project is
really a student based project that has
that's trying to map global inequality
in order to help illuminate the
processes and the causes of global
inequality let's go do we have this
first one yes so it's it's a combination
of visualization mapping summarizing
research and trying to explain the
background to some of the issues
involved in our global inequality google
has recently acquired Gapminder which we
think is an amazing piece of work
amazing set of animations we've not
tried anything quite as ambitious as
that though we're learning from
Gapminder what we are trying to do is to
provide an introduction illuminating
inequality for intermediate users
students journalists maybe some
researchers maybe some policymakers the
atlas has been built through student
labor so it's a bit variable but we
think we've got a pretty good scheme and
you'll be hearing some of the students
talking about the project as we go along
the project is backed by six of the ten
campuses of the UC system which means
that we have an advisory board and some
input from several other campuses but an
awful lot of the work gets done
at UC Santa Cruz hopefully that will
change over time so we're going to go
through some of the features before we
do that I'm just going to mention a
couple of interesting little insights
emerging from the Atlas work here's an
early graph of the sort that Gapminder
has animated a gross domestic product
along the bottom life expectancy at the
side what we're interested in is that we
can show some shed some light on some of
the outliers so there are interesting
outliers on both sides Sri Lanka and
China are have life expectancies way
above what you would expect for their
level of economic development we're
pretty sure that is because of a history
of public action that reduced inequality
land reforms and food subsidy programs
food support programs and state
anti-poverty programs at the same time
outliers on the other side Brazil and
South Africa very easily explicable as
being high inequality countries with
governments in the case of Brazil not
implementing anti-poverty programs in
the case of South Africa at this time
1980 implementing what we could call
poverty programs creating poverty
another little bit from the another
graph from the early stages of the Atlas
which is online in our Health section
this is a graph of life expectancy
that's the blue bars ranking their
countries with the highest life
expectancy this is it in two thousand
and then we overlaid healthcare costs
and what's interesting about that is the
adjacent appearance of the United States
and Cuba show it with virtually the same
life expectancy and being at more or
less extremes of
health care spending per capita and it
confirms at first we thought this was
just a statistical artifact it doesn't
seem as though it is it seems that the
life expectancy figures from Cuba are
perfectly okay they're robust and that
the Cuban health care system does indeed
provide very adequate health care at
extremely low cost compared to the u.s.
okay I'm going to hand over to suresh
loader who's going to talk about
introducing the Atlas as a whole ok so
I'm Suresh Lhota and teaching a graduate
class this quarter at Santa Cruz on
computer graphics so some of my students
are going to actually make this
presentation so what we are going to do
is to give you a brief tour of the
website of the UC atlas of global
inequality and introduce you to the
various features that we support so this
presentation will be supported by
propaganda VAR Danne Jack Fang Mike
Patterson ad Chandra and some members of
the UC Atlas team that has been working
with Ben crow introducing it to the
block so what we are going to do is to
introduce you to these five features of
the UC Atlas we support various themes
much beyond income inequality and then a
tour of interactive maps that you can
generate using the UC Atlas and some
work on specific country pages and then
interactive database will be presented
by Eddie and finally a discussion of
blocks which encourages debates by Anita
and Ellen so with that I will invite
profit to start this presentation let me
switch to the web
yeah I will get to that yeah get to
thank Suresh so I will just take you
guys to a brief overview of the teams
available in UC Atlas and the main maps
that I used here so as you can see on
the left hand side you get like six main
themes that you see Atlas focuses on
health income inequality gender economic
globalization connections and inequality
of course so just let's take a look at a
couple of visualizations available so if
you take life expectancy mmm we have
like Winston expectancies for each
region each country and in this map the
purple shows low life expectancy and the
dark green is of course high and if you
go through the move forward to the
decades you can see that as a global
trend life occurrences is of course
increasing but the exception is of
course in sub-saharan Africa due to HIV
epidemic in the last decade from 1990 to
2000 Life like presidency has actually
decreased so let's take another look at
the causes of death so if you look at
the developed regions and developing
regions this basically shows that
there's a much like very big difference
in what actually causes people's that's
as in communicable diseases are the most
like prominent cause of death in
developing regions as supposed to non
communicable diseases and at the same
time I'm like trying to show you all the
graphs that I will about currently in
you see at least two so this destroyed a
graph which shows a more specific
detailed view of what are the actual
causes of death and the blue line shows
the average for the world for each
specific category and say if you
to compare Western Europe it's indicated
by the yellow line you can see that most
of the deaths are due to cardiovascular
diseases and malignant neoplasms and on
the other hand we can see a heavy bias
towards infectious diseases and Esther
respiratory diseases in this Orange Line
which actually represents sub-saharan
Africa so using a particular kind of
graph this particular graph in this in
turn instance can make it really easy to
visualize what's happening in a
particular region as opposed to some
other parts of the world so okay so you
see Atlas also has information on global
trade flows so this particular map shows
trade coming in and out of each region
and the size of these arrows indicate
the amount of exports the blue arrows
and the imports in the red arrows so if
you take Japan for example you can see
there's a massive amount of exports
going into United States as well as
coming back imports coming back from
States
okay and finally I'm just going to show
a graph on the global use of internet
and computer usage something we're all
familiar with so yeah at the beginning
of the 90s of course there's all it was
almost non-existent but globally of
course number of Internet users is
growing exponentially but at the same
time the growth itself is not initially
equal this is in 2001 the number of
Internet users in North America is a
hundred users 61 percent whereas in
South Asia or it was one user for every
200 people so another interesting fact
about you see double atlas is that in
addition to the dispersant in data
discreet relation data there's also
under each team quite a generous
description about what causes those
differences and what the actual
indicators mean okay and with that i'm
actually going on to hand out a map mike
sorry to talk about individual countries
and the differences thanks Baba okay the
the country pages provide a unified
access to global inequality data for
more than 200 countries and uses about
60 indicator whoa about 60 indicators
over decade intervals from the years
1962 2000 and the state is visualized
using bar charts and time series graphs
and it also uses in you can also compare
with other countries using bar charts
and tables so if we're interested in how
New Zealand did during those years we
navigate to that country and we're given
some overview text and we're also given
a bar chart of some health indicators
for the year 2000 and we can see that
for life expectancy the New Zealand
ranks 18th out of 196 countries that
were pulled and for infant mortality
they ranked 165th out of 191 countries
pulled
and groups of indicators are divided
into categories that are accessible on
the left hand side we're going to check
out population and migration and you'll
see that we're given a new bar chart
with some indicators that are relevant
to this category and we're also given a
table of indicators that shows the
actual data points we can graph this
data by clicking on the link and for
this one we can see that new zealand
steadily becoming more urbanized as time
goes on you can also see that the world
in the blue line is following a similar
trend okay and finally we can compare
this data with other countries by
selecting some of the indicators that
we're interested in and then selecting a
country will check out Japan you can see
that now Japan has been interleaved into
the indicator rose shine right there and
the bar charts been updated with
side-by-side comparisons of New Zealand
and Japan and now I'll turn over the mic
to Eddie to discuss the interactive
databases excuse me jack hi I'm I'm not
going to talk about the interactive maps
functionality of the site
okay so from the home here you go to
inequality and growth and then follow
the link I'm in database and there is a
link on the top here to make a map so
let's try an arbitrary indicator
so basically you can choose one from one
of the many indicators and from one of
the years ranging from 1960 to 2000 ok
so here it shows a global inequality map
which compares different countries over
one single indicators in a specific year
and this map uses a pseudo coloring
scheme which associate each one of the
country to one of the six colors as
defined in the legend where y-you
percents no data and from the green to
red if it sends from the smallest value
to the largest value of indicators and
the user can choose to change either one
of the indicator of the year or both and
the map will be updated interactively so
that's so we can notice that there's a
lot of internet users in the United
States and not so many in China so let's
see how it does in two thousand
so here the indicator is remain constant
and the year has changed and you can see
that as a large increase internet users
in China over the five-year span from
nineteen ninety five to two thousand and
also you can keep the Year constant and
try to compare with another indicators
so let's try mobile phone users so
here's a map update again accordingly so
the user can also perform more
comparison between indicators in year
and the map will be updating
interactively okay so now i'm going to
hand over to eddie to talk about the
interactive database so things jack so
hi everyone i am Eddie Chandra I'm a
first year graduate student I'm doing my
master at the UCSC i will be going to
talk about the UC atlas database to go
to the database we just follow the
database link right up right here so do
you see alice database provide three
output based on the information that we
interested in they are data table line
graph or bar graph the step are broken
into five the first step we choose the
area that we interested on on the left
side we can see that the area our group
into countries and then geographic
region economic region or it lists
everything so you can either scroll and
choose the area that you want or you can
type the name of the area if you know in
in this box
so I will go ahead with choosing United
States and I need and then i will go
over a kannada
and Japan
okay so the next step is we choose the
indicator and they also group into
economic education gender hell
population technology and media or
everything so let's say we are
interested in in the butt rate and that
should be in the health category and we
click the right arrow and then the third
step is the data years it can they can
be by ticket every five years or yearly
and it begins from 1960 up to 2000 the
first step is relevant only if you want
your output as a data table so what so
what we looking here is the row of the
table can be by country by indicator or
by year and we can sort the data
ascending or descending lee on which
here and on which indicator for now we
only have one which is our the birth
rate so we'll go and submit query
so here we are looking at the data table
grow our country as we specify before
and one of the column which is named
this 1960 are sorted ascending lee and
for the birth rate data we can also
download the data as an xl-4 as an excel
file for our own purpose let's see how
the bar graph will look like so here
what we're looking is the horizontal
axis our country and the vertical axis
are the birth rate data and the color
represent the year for the data so it
starts from 90 60 up to 2000 the you
cialis database also provide a way to
have more than one indicator so if you
are interested let's say in economic and
we choose the trade indicator and i won
maybe just on a particular year you can
also do that so I'll choose 1990 and
we'll do a line graph instead okay so
what so what we're seeing here is the
row I mean I mean I mean the horizontal
axis are the same our country the left
vertical axis showing the birth rate
data and right vertical axis is showing
the trade data and the black line is
showing the birth rate data for its
country and the blue line is showing the
trade data for its country so the you
see our last database is very easy to
use and powerful
and that's all I can say about it and
the next topic Ellen and Anita are going
to talk about the web block of the UCL
a--'s database I mean issue of us thanks
um so my name is Anita I'm a
undergraduate student along here with
Ellen um sure hi my name is Ellen and
I'm a third year undergraduate UCSD
sociology major oh right I'm a fourth
year history and history of visual art
and culture major what we're going to
talk about are the blogs which we're
going to get up here pretty soon we're
going to go for why we blog what we blog
and the process that it takes that to
develop what we're blogging and like
choosing and then the peer editing
process and then Ellen's going to go
over an example hopefully technology
willing so basically why we blog is to
encourage debate and awareness among the
community that we're trying to reach
through the you see alice and unlike
other atlases of the sort we are trying
to going our goal is to engage academic
and scholarly audience although it's
open for everyone obviously so we're
looking to engage students professors
researchers to you know take a look at
this huge amount of information that we
have and what the blog provides is a
context in which you can see this
information so we look at articles from
the undp public publications the world
development reports we have a number of
journals that we consistently monitor
for relevant articles that we might want
to cover for example I just want to did
one on the Journal of economic
inequality which looked at regional
richest country Pacific poverty and our
goal is to get articles that are
relevant to the way that poverty can be
seen globally so we want things that
cover that fall within the range of our
themes of you know we went through some
of them some of our gender health
connectedness for example and what we
want are also unique articles that
aren't necessarily repetitive because
there's tons of articles out there on
globalization but we want our ones that
are bringing up new ideas that may not
have been discussed before so just going
back to the example the one I most
recently did we were looking at
region-specific poverty which is
something that the Atlas hasn't really
gone into too much because you mainly
look at cavity poverty based throughout
countries as opposed to urban versus
rural etc now Ellen's going to tell us
more about the process that we go
through well oftentimes we meet weekly
and we meet to discuss what articles we
believe are relevant and then we assign
people to read various articles and then
afterwards we spend time to summarize
them and summarize key points that again
would be easy for intermediate users
such as undergraduate students or just
journalists we try to see if they have
both unique and relevant concepts to
what we want to offer to the UC atlas
and as you can see above here we have
different themes of economic
globalization gender health income
inequality and region inequalities and
then I guess I'll go over an example of
one that i wrote personally about the
world distribution of household wealth
by devi Sandstrom shocks and wolf I try
to begin by summarizing the key points
and oftentimes we look for things that
have good visual visualizations as you
can see this one has various comparisons
of countries
in bar graph form and I just list a lot
of easy bullet points and such as this
graph which is showing a different
wealth across different regions between
rich and poor countries and I think that
by doing this this makes it a lot easier
for us to help them understand us to
help our intermediate users understand
global inequality and we link our
sources here and we also allow users to
comment on what we have blogged and so
we make it very interactive okay thank
you
garrison okay what I want to do in the
remaining 10 minutes or so is to talk
about is to talk first about thank you
some projects we have which are not yet
online but which we think are important
so I'm going to talk about two projects
ones on the environment one is on
poverty and understanding the causes of
poverty so one of the things we did
early on in thinking about the
environment was to map to views of
environmental sustainability we took a
standard one which is the ecological
footprint which measures the amount of
land particular cities or countries or
societies use then we took a more recent
one produced by Yale and Columbia
University's called the environmental
sustainability index this is an
aggregate of around 70 different
variables including pollution resource
use vulnerability and governance of the
environment these are the maps we found
so what the blue is high sustainability
the yellow is low sustainability this
suggests that the industrialized world
cannot be sustained but the third world
or the non industrial world can this is
the ecological footprint if you look at
the environmental sustainability index
it's almost the reverse so most of the
again blue is highly sustainable low
sustainability as yellow and what this
suggests is the industrialized world
with the exception of the US and a few
other places is sustainable but the non
industrialized world particularly Africa
and Asia is not sustainable so what's
happening here what we think is that the
ecological footprint is really
overlooking human creativity whereas the
environmental sustainability index by
default rather than by choice has
included some indicators of human
capacity
to modify the relation to the
environment what this suggests is the
need to situate these different views on
the continuum of contemporary views and
essentially we can do this on a
continuum between optimism and doom and
to go through this simply there is
technological ops optimism the people
that George Bush particularly likes to
to listen to fall into this category
there is environmental managerialism
which is the common way in which
international meetings and governments
think about the environment both of
these are subject to the the limitation
that they assume a technological
determinism that social change is
largely determined by an autonomous
Technic technological change very common
in academia and elsewhere is Malthusian
pessimism which assumes that humans are
the same as animals and face similar
crises and then again particularly in
Santa Cruz there is a deep green
pessimism which says we all have to go
back and live on the land now these
suffer from a problem that they apply
concepts from ecology directly to
humanity neither of these assumptions of
technological determinism or
naturalistic reductionism do we think
actually applicable one of the main
reasons why that the assumption that at
where the same as animals doesn't apply
is that humans are different humans have
what some people call emergent powers
our ability to speak and our ability to
coordinate Ann Arbor ability to reflect
upon what we do all of those things make
us different from even the most advanced
animals as a result we think that
there's a reality ahead on the
environment which goes which goes in
between this range of different position
of thinking about human relationship to
the environment and we think that the
environmental sustainability index again
that they didn't do it consciously is is
managing to negotiate between the two
extremes of doom and optimism and
between the fallacies of technological
determinism and naturalistic
reductionism as a result our project is
to think about how the world is changing
in relation to the turning points and
human creativity that is being released
across the world so here for example is
a mapping of energy intensity it's quite
a famous graph produced by two very
important third world environmentalists
back in the 90s and there are two things
what this is showing is energy intensity
which means the amount of the energy
used per unit of economic output and
what we see is hopeful it's not actually
a complete picture it's not energy use
which continues to climb in all these
places but what it's showing is that as
successive industrialization industrial
revolutions have occurred they've
occurred with a lesser peak of energy
intensity and after each peak those
societies have tended to reduce the
energy intensity of their manufacturing
as I say overall energy use Rises but
what this suggests is that it's possible
to do much more with less energy similar
things can be seen with water in this
case we've got a graph of the overall
use of water in the United States
between 1900 and 1995 what this shows is
that the two major uses of water the use
of water to cool power stations and the
use of water for irrigation in the rest
of the world use of water for irrigation
is generally the largest use but both of
these have leveled off after 1980
as the price of water the scarcity of
water and awareness of environmental
issues has risen so there's a reflex
reflexive process of humans is coming
into play there's a whole other set of
curves called environmental Kuznets
curves which show similar effects for
all sorts of air pollution there are
some also some sorts of relationships
which do not show turning points but
what I'm focusing on at the moment are
the relationships which show turning
points and what we want to do is to map
some of these country by country in
order to look at environmental change as
it's happening rather than by the the
unreasonable optimism or the
unreasonable pessimism of different
positions at ends of the set of views on
on the environment so this is a project
that's underway we've made a little bit
of progress but not a lot I'm going to
turn again to a different project which
is about poverty I've done some work and
written a paper on the how global
statistics have been collected and what
the gaps are in global statistics
basically global statistics start with
merchants account books in the middle
ages then monarchs come along and they
can see that they can gain power and
authority by showing how much wealth and
how much trade there is in their country
that's the beginning of statistical
collection in the early 1900's various
in the 1990s in particularly it gains
much greater strength as all sorts of
institutions from the World Bank to the
UNDP and many of the other UN agencies
and the World Health Organization begin
to collect data and from governments and
distribute it but by and large as I've
said on this
I'd there are gaps these include things
that or that corporations and
governments don't care about and think
issues they want to ignore poverty and
inequality come into this last category
so that there is very little systematic
collection of data on poverty and
inequality we think that there's a big
opportunity for distributed data
collection around some of these gaps
because corporations and governments are
not unless there is very effective
social movements there are social
movements worldwide which force them to
collect that data I don't think they're
going to be collecting it so we've begun
looking at poverty stats poverty
statistics and processes and getting
beneath the nation as a unit of analysis
trying to look at the disparity of
social outcomes for rich and poor
looking at maps and looking at within
country mapping we're hoping to
collaborate with an Institute at
Columbia University ceasing that's been
doing a lot of the work around this
here's an early example of an attempt to
graph some differences within countries
what this shows is the the orange are
under 5 mortality differences for the
poorest twenty percent in each of these
countries and the blue are under 5
mortality rates for the rich in each
country then that purple jagged line is
just the ratio of the rich the mortality
rate for the rich and the poor what it
shows is there's a lot of difference and
I suspect that these this data these
data greatly underestimate those
differences but that's a first attempt
at looking at some of the differences
between reach rich and poor this coming
from see sin is a much more
sophisticated attempt to use poverty
mapping what this shows this is the case
of Bangladesh which and i happen to have
done research in this area and up in
this area of bhangra so I know a little
bit about this what this is doing is
turp elating from census data in order
to make estimates of regional poverty
and I think it's hopeful it's not by any
means perfect the dark green is very
high levels of poverty more than fifty
forty to forty-five to fifty percent
falling below a district specific
poverty line the light green is a lower
level of poverty so it's a simple head
count of proportion of people suffering
from poverty what has not been done yet
is putting together this map with
processes that cause this the World Bank
has been funding some of these maps
because they want them as a check on
government policy we're less interested
in government policy than in the
processes the reasons behind poverty and
what we're thinking of doing is putting
together local household letter surveys
to which look at the process with
poverty mapping this is an example of
some work done by aneroid Krishna at
Duke University and he's done some
exemplary work looking at local ideas
about poverty and looking at escape from
and descent into poverty and here I've
summarized the findings from his study
on Kenya but he's also done a number of
sales in India Peru and I think half a
dozen countries and what this what these
studies show is very striking it shows
that while there is significant escape
from poverty a lot of people a lot of
households descend into poverty in any
period of ten or twenty years the
reasons for descent excuse me the
reasons for descent into poverty are
fairly consistent though they vary a bit
from one region to another health crises
are the main reason then social
commitments in this case funerals and
various sorts of vulnerability again the
reason
for escape out of poverty are also
fairly consistent usually it's obtaining
a job or establishing a small business
so these depend upon the reduction of
poverty at the rural level and probably
in cities also depends upon the
diversification of the economy so these
sorts of studies give us information
which greatly expand upon the poverty
maps which are beginning to be produced
I'm going to skip over this this is the
process that Krishna uses for
establishing poverty lines in order to
work out who's escaped from it's a very
interesting not perfect process but it's
it's pretty good the best that's around
at the moment what we're trying to do
then is to talk about putting together
poverty mapping with the causes of
poverty we think we can do this at least
through three processes aggregation of
household services surveys political
economy analysis perhaps through layers
of historical economic sociological and
environmental data we think there's also
the important possibility of using a
wiki perhaps linked to our country pages
which brings in global data this is
still in the early stages we haven't got
a really good model for doing this but
we think that there is the potential to
make good the gaps in corporate and glow
and governmental statistics by beginning
to bring in a more democratic style of
poverty mapping these are both early
examples and I got to turn over briefly
to Ellen sorry Erin Middleton who's
going to talk about our conference in
December hi my name is Erin Middleton
and I'm an undergrad in the
environmental studies and math
department a UCSC and I'd like to talk
with you and invite you to our upcoming
conference on global inequality
we found that the debate of the impacts
of globalization on poverty and
inequality has been too narrowly
conceived and in the media and academia
they focused mainly on income inequality
and on the national level so the aim of
our conference is to broaden this debate
by mapping global inequality at various
scales and also by applying a
multidisciplinary study to broaden the
debate to such topics as wealth
inequality health and migration of
equality so the speakers we have some
listed here will include Goran third
born from Cambridge University Tony
sharks from UN wider and Nancy Birdsall
from the center for global development
and in addition will be commissioning
papers that will be used in a few
different classes in the fall at UCSC
and at the end of the conference will be
publishing an atlas and also having
online presentations available we're
really looking forward to it thanks all
right let me wind up by saying just
mentioning two challenges that we have
this project has been sustained by
voluntary student labor and small grants
it's fairly difficult to sustain but we
think it's important because it has the
possibility of aggregating the brain
power of a whole university and the
university sector we think it also has
the possibility as I've tried to gesture
towards of bringing direct and
democratic data gathering in the way
that Wikipedia and a number of other
projects have have have shown so these
are the challenges but it I think it's
the project is going quite well and in
the autumn we're going to have three
classes working on different
commissioned papers producing
visualizations for the conference in
in December so thank you all for
listening and go happy to take questions
yes there are they're mostly not very
user-friendly we noticed that the World
Bank's database has adopted an interface
very similar to the one we put in two
years ago so they've improved their
database perhaps in response to ours
yeah and you know we have done a study
of a number of websites which discusses
global inequality and Bend as aware of
them and Gapminder nation master world
bank poverty websites so there are some
websites which has those datasets as
well none of what we're hoping to do is
to load data from many different sources
we've run out of money to do that at the
moment so we only have one set of data
up but in principle our database enables
us to load many different sources yeah
central bar graph
automatically looking for interesting
reading
you guys figure out oh there's a
correlation between
that's a project that we are just
actually beginning to formulate the
machine learning and petty pattern
recognition both for pattern recognition
and normally detection etc so we haven't
done that and to the best of our
knowledge and belief none of these other
websites have done it either so that's
the direction in which you are beginning
to move good question thank you
problems are about reasons why this
development is from here for example
sorry can you repeat the process can you
let me well the question is have we
thought about solutions to the problem
of inequality and the issues of changing
governmental and corporate decisions
that lead to inequality is that a
reasonable summary well certainly we
have and certainly that's an underlying
goal is to try to get towards that but
the reality is that there aren't very
simple solutions so what we're doing is
building up some background some
understanding and we hope we'll get
towards some solutions if we have as
I've sketched out the possibility of
poverty poverty maps that have processes
as well as outcomes then we think it's
possible that we can begin to say this
is the cause here we did an initial
exercise on Uganda I had a an
undergraduate student doing a thesis
looking at poverty maps for Uganda and
building in household surveys and what
we could see at the end of that was war
was a cause of poverty for large areas
there were other causes in other areas
so we're with we're plotting towards
that goal does that answer your question
okay great yes
yeah that's an excellent question so the
question is is there other data or apart
from census data and are we interested
in verifying the accuracy of the data
that we get is that a fair summary so
we've been very interested in this and
we have a a website up which tries to
summarize some of the international
processes through which data is
collected and we think we've got the
best summary of it it's not as detailed
as probably as needed but what I think
it suggests for us is that there's lots
of errors there are processes in various
international agencies to try and reduce
those errors there are systematic
problems to do with questions that are
asked and emissions and there is an
enormous reliance on census data so
there's very little apart from census
data so one of the advantages of a
global reporting system would be to try
and bring in other sorts of data so it's
that's not a very good answer but a
beginning of an answer do you want to
add to that does that meet your
what's happened is that over the years
since the particularly since the Second
World War international agencies have
developed relationships with government
where they lay down some more or less
agreed guidelines for what they want and
then they collect the data sometimes
coercively sometimes less coercively and
the quality of the data is then
subjected to various checks and
comparisons which are by and large
transparent so for example some of our
students believe that the data may be
systematically biased or systematically
manipulated we think that's less likely
than the omissions that happen and the
errors that happen but we're getting
some sense of how the data is collected
but there's enormous opportunities for
collecting better data
I think we're done thank you very much
