today to welcome to Google
John Yan Jim Janssen and Luke sang we're
going to be talking about information
seeking visualization and
decision-making and John's got me first
thank you Peter and from Penn State
College of Information sciences and
technology before we go into the
research I just want to say a few words
about the college the vision and what
brother's here we all know the
information explosion is the excitement
that we see in the Google campus as well
around the world and then you know the
transformation of data to info you know
all kinds of data to information
structural and structure or wide range
of media as well as translating that
into knowledge and for people to use to
make decisions in translating the wisdom
is the challenge we are all facing and
try to improve and help the users with
and of course global information is also
becoming globally accessible not only
easier but also in larger quantities
large volumes so our College is what's
created with this vision of bringing
information technology in the context
information technology which we usually
use the term people to capture but it's
actually more than just the people but
also involve organization and the
relationship between people and groups
and teams and organizations our research
involve human-computer interactions
information computational informatics
which deal with a great aspect of
research and cognitive science looking
at the understanding of human cognition
to improve information processing
knowledge synthesis and Sochaux and
enterprise informatics looking at the
issues well key from sociology
perspective as well as impact tools
enterprise global enterprise and finally
security privacy and Trust is also
important
in the strategic plan layout in the
college recently we identify important
drivers of the millennium including the
energy cost issues both energy costs and
also resources of energy which is
related global warming the new young
generation which is has interesting
characteristic and aging populations as
well as other characteristics such as
the growth of population in less
developed countries and so forth and
these are helped us to identify
cross-cutting research directions that
we think are important in for the days
to come including the use of web not
only for information search but also for
social interactions now we have seen the
trend in the virtual world which is what
direction that they were in that area
relational networks and which involve
convergence of network science and
social network and other kinds of
related disciplines extreme event has
been important both for men made and
natural extreme events and how do we
help to have better preparation better
principled analysis and not just
thinking about building systems but also
think about higher level science related
to understanding and analyzing all kinds
of informatics beyond bio and health
even security informatics energy inform
Eric and so forth a global
self-awareness how to help citizens to
be able to track events trends and to
better respond to it and finally the
impact of technology on the change of
culture in the work environment in
education in this particular talk will
focus on three aspect of our research
information seeking which we covered by
dr. Jim Jensen and then following that
dr. Luke Sam will talk about knowledge
visualization and I talk about decision
making and touch a little bit on data
mining
work-related and the context of all of
our talk is as any beyond individual in
a often time the collaborative a team or
group context so let me pass to dr. Jim
Jones well thank you thank you very much
for having me here in attending and my I
have three three daughters and my 10
year old daughter when she found I was
coming to Google
she said she said be sure and tell them
I loved all the Olympic logos that you
did on the website alright so I want to
pass that along my particular topic is
that I'm gonna be kind of addressing is
information seeking and it's it's a
research area that covers the entire
gamut of how people access and seek
information including cognitive and
affective things like my daughter and
that logo and also two very algorithmic
things that deal with information
searching a particular I'm going to talk
about is probabilistic user modeling
which is an important area in
personalization you know it really used
in all forms of a lot of forms of
human-computer interaction and ways to
make that dynamic relationship between
the user and the system better a lot of
the algorithmic techniques okay there
that are employed currently in this
aspect of Marlene do focus of some type
of State okay and these are our three
kind of examples of methodologies here
Bayesian classifiers Markov models or
engrams all right kind of an issue with
this approach is that prior work has
shown the states really break down very
quickly after two or three states you
really lose really the significant
predictability about what the user is
gonna do next and that's really what
you're aiming for based on what the user
has done what are they most likely to
want or do next
right and this has really been shown a
lot of prior work including the original
work from NASA and 67 with my Serge
Solomon
I think the first study that really
analyzed a user using transaction logs
all really all the way up to the present
so let me give you an example okay let's
say you you can take you can record user
interactions okay and say we have five
users here and we record a state
sequence okay and so each of these
letters A through F represents a
particular state and if you look at an
entire transition of a user system
interaction we have a search string for
example with four states three
transitions alright and so what you can
do and when this approaches and engrams
you can say hey based on these two
states what's the probability that I can
predict that user is going to go to the
next state and so based on the data we
have we can see here on different orders
of states we can come up different
degrees of accuracy okay how efficient
our modeling works okay now let's put
this into like a real example using a
search log we took about nine hundred
fifty thousand search sessions from a
working search engine composed of about
a half a million and a half queries and
we classified each the queries based on
how the user reformulated the query
query formulation is a classic area of
information retrieval information
searching so you know the initial query
then you generalize it or go more
specifics which content collections
whatever so eight states so if we look
at the accuracy of this Engram approach
and kind of the order of the model can
illustrate the difficulty of
implementing this particular approach in
growth in with real data each of these
orders of the models refers to the
number of transitions so a zeroth order
model is like no transition just the
user comes you know the user is at the
first state and so what we would think
is you know just a highlight of one of
the difficulties
you know the dropout rates for users
come in to search engines and it's about
40% 40% of the users to 35 to 40% of
users typically come to a search engine
and don't do anything okay and then you
know there's and they make some submit a
query and then not click on anything all
right so if we look at the different
order models we see you know the kind of
the best predictability we get is still
under 50%
in other words based on what the user
has already done and what can we predict
they're going to do next right and this
particular example is on query
formulation but it applies to a lot of
different scenarios contextual help use
of interface features searching things
like time okay and so this kind of led
to some research I'm doing it's looking
that maybe states are not the writings
paradigm to use for this type of user
modeling and so I'm kind of maybe a
different paradigm was looking at it as
the information stream where they click
logs these search logs these transition
logs are stateless so in this counter
example we have people all over the
world searching 24 by 7 accessing
multiple servers so if we look at that
entire record of interaction coming in
over multiple servers of
multi-dimensional different type of
attributes over time we can take that
entire stream of data ok break it up
into periods take each of those periods
slice them up into both vertical and
horizontal slices and so we really end
up with a multi-dimensional matrix a
series of matrixes that represent the
entire stream okay
so what this kind of gives us is a we
can view these logs as stateless and but
with volume mass momentum acceleration
so if we look at data that's in the past
what if we can take that data and at
some point at one slice predict what's
going to happen next
okay so really the same approach in
terms of modeling the user with some
degree of probability but a totally
stateless approach some kind of just the
research of art can have already done
i-i've looked at engrams and you know
state approaches really came up with the
same findings that other researchers
have came up with very very short models
seem to work the best decision trees
tried to do classification of user
intent informational transactional
navigational and also at different
subcategories and using a very simple
approach like a decision tree we came up
with a pretty good to grow degree of
accuracy and the advantage of simple
approaches are they can be implemented
in real time all right
clustering k-means clustering again it's
beneficial but still very state like
approach in terms of the temporal aspect
we've looked at time series analysis and
you can't come up with the pretty good
models of based on user characteristics
what results they're going to click on
that spreads the these kind of two areas
I focused on user intent and clicking
looked at neural networks and again you
can come up with in the entire stream
some characteristics of the user and
then predict future click-through rate
and finally look into some tensor
analysis which is so far it has appeared
to be fairly beneficial and we really
found there's multiple trends going on
patterns going on in these streams and
again some positive and negative
correlation between certain
characteristics and then user intent and
click-through however you know really
none of these methods are exactly what
we want
they they they they act they capture
part of the picture but really not the
entire picture that we're looking for so
I think we really need a different type
of methodology to analyze search logs
and we want think a method that can
handle a lot of data the kind of
temporal data multi-dimensional data but
also allows for segmentation you know
different user groups identify patterns
in the data not just one pattern but
multiple patterns and finally something
that avoids the kind of rearview mirror
effect any any method that lies relies
on prior data will work fine as long as
the data doesn't change but once
something happens to the data flow your
predictability suffers so we really want
some type of algorithm that can identify
really outliers that maybe kind of
harboring errors of future patterns okay
before they actually develop so this is
one one particular narrow slice of
information searching domain and with
that let me turn it over to Luke saying
on visualization I'm glad Jim Jenson
brought up the Google logo things
actually on the last day of the Olympics
I saw a logo which put the dragon on the
podium you know my Chinese name has a
dragon inside however due to cultural
difference I have to explain the
difference between the meaning of the
dragon Western culture and dragon in
China in China actually in Chinese
dragon a symbol power the yellow side is
not that important but that logo
actually shows o dragon can be lovely so
that shows one of the kind things we can
use visualization to explain difficult
concept which I'm going to talk about
today and my research area is in
human-computer interaction particularly
now and focusing on knowledge of
visualization and you may heard about
information visualization what I'm
trying to do here is to go beyond to
search information
and then look at what we can provide use
of more so I think about a scenario one
we try to find informations certainly we
can find the queries and throw it out
there Google well we got all this kind
of page right we have algorithm to rank
them people will pick those top pages in
most of scenarios but be good enough
however engineers like research like
decision making and what we want
actually not just this individual page
we may want some kind of structures such
as well.all this page can be organized
in this ways so that we know how they
are relieve each other however due to
different purposes we may have different
kind of structures or different kind of
the understanding of the structure we
may have another kind of ways to
organize the same set of information so
what this narrow told us that when we
try to understand what we have found
online or other resources we should
provide user not just the word
information but I also consider what
constructors we can help them to
organize information and under what
context user may need such information
that's why I'm thinking about we should
to think about the knowledge of
visualization rather than just the
information visualization of course
knowledge is a very broad term here I'm
understanding knowledge visualizing as
providing structures to organize
information and to consider
visualization of information within
particular context such as cancer
context in general my research approach
like this with massive data I'm trying
to use techniques to find out potential
structures or context and then visualize
visualize information as well as
structures later user can somehow
control the process of structure context
finding as well as visualization so
there are some challenges here however
first how can we obtain those structures
right and we can find information but
how about the structures this is a big
challenge here and one of the way we can
look at is to think about what people
have done in
sciences such as library science and if
you look at ACM digital library or
catalogs in libraries actually people
have done a lot of things by organized
information informally defying the
structures such as catalogs ACM
categories so we can somehow borrow
existing structure to help us organize
information another way to look at
structure is that how about those
scientific data where you may not be
find out semantic description and I have
another project is called
mmds a multi dimensional multi scale
data analysis and I'm not sure why I can
show the video let me show you the
figures so this is a site sense system
actually if you look at the overall
system we have a query window we have a
knowledge context window we have a
workspace window somehow in the query
window you can throw all kinda queries
and results will be displayed as as
trees the instructor possible this far
shows knowledge structures somehow in
ECM you wish you will know the
structures and you will see the
different nodes actually in our system
we allow you to drag knows to reorganize
in your workspace for example you know
not just as selecting individual papers
somehow by the end you can organize all
the search results in a way which allow
you to reuse in the future also allow
other people to reuse for in this case
these papers are organized as a
hierarchy we got the theory on the
theory have design theory we had a
Cartesian theory and so on so eventually
we hope this kind of approach will allow
us to go beyond search engine and think
about the search engine of structures ok
there are others challenged in terms of
the context what kind of talk context
we're talking about and again contact
the very broad term here I'm consuming
tasks what information is used how you
how people use information so there are
some dimension we can consider such as
how we can provide different
and Tatian styles so that people will
adapt their actions based on information
or the vice versa what kind of the style
of the representation going beyond the
static think about how we can provide
dynamic animated views or to think about
not just about individual users but also
about the collaborative decision-making
and so on so let me give you one example
about tasks to orientate information
visualization think about we finding
scenario where we try to plan our route
and drive to the destination in
cognitive science and geography it's
well know that people actually have
different kinds of tests in the whole we
fighting process we need planning where
people need to D actual centric Maps so
that we know where to go
however when we follow a particular Road
route actually people want to egocentric
map to show head up the directions and
what we approach your decision-making
point such as intersection so people
usually need to find those reference
buildings or sailing up there to help us
know where should I make a turn so in
this case visualization would not just
show you the 2d maps but also 2d and 2d
and 2.5 D eventually provide a immersive
3d environment so that you will see the
salient buildings where you can rely on
imposition making frozen care okay
yeah my future research will focus
sounds several things first we try to
expand the site science project by
considering collaborative sense making
right now one our project we are working
on is to provide a web-based services
which allow you to search ACM Plus
Google Scholar and we try to go another
direction about mobile we finding
research by considering how people can
use mobile devices the emergence the
situation where you do not have a time
you do not have the you know cognitive
resources to think about what rod Rhodes
you should have find out eventually this
will be a very important entry point for
us to combine mobile device
visualization and the geospatial
visualization another project I'm
working on right now is geo
collaborative decision-making process
project it's a web-based decision-making
system which is platform dependent
independent so this URL actually can go
to check this project as you can see
right now we have a to Google Maps one
is a private map another public map
actually people from different locations
can collaborate on decision-making they
can draw a diagram to show where are the
areas you have problems and different
the visualize and talking to show who
they are and what they have done and at
the bottom we got visualization tools to
help user to aggregate information and
then to help to see what has been down
by whom so eventually we hope we can
come up with design guidelines to
support this web-based geo collaboration
support system so that Google Maps will
be used not just for individual purposes
but also in collaborative
decision-making process if you are
interesting more about the project and
research you can go to my website to
find the details thank you
because this is odor okay
if I talk about decision-making research
I would like to kind of use an analogy
that motivate this research people who
study human team performance have
indicated that a good characteristic
okay basic of a good team
high-performance team typically is that
the capability members of the team could
anticipate needs of teammates and then
send information to them before they ask
and without overloading them and they
know what they need when to tell them
and so forth so the motivation of this
research is try to develop technologies
to help machines to be able to move in
that direction and an important
component in that direction that is to
have some sense about what people is
needed and be able to then use that
information to drive information seeking
behavior or provide knowledge
visualization and so forth so that is
the motivation and a vision of our
research and we look into cognitive
theories at all to draw inspiration or
research and because we are not only
interested in decision-making per se but
rather the linkage between
decision-making information seeking
behavior therefore we are interested in
this holistic decision-making process
not just decision-making point in the
decision-making paradigm The Naturalist
decision-making paradigm is capturing
has captured the process the holistic
aspect of decision-making of course
there's also rational decision-making
which focus on rationality bounded
rationality and so forth the so the the
research in naturalist decision-making
has developed resolving environments
model one of them is record recognition
prime decision developed by dr. Gary
Klein and so that has provided the
cognitive foundations for our research
so this is a graphic representation of
the RPD model the main idea there are
different several pieces of the main
idea behind a 3d model first of all our
PD is bothering decision making under
time stress obviously different kinds of
decisions environment will result in
different kinds of decision making for
example decision making for jury it's
very different because you have much
more time
so one element of the our PD is the
process of identifying missing
information the property involved
matching the current situation with
experience of the human decision-maker
and based on that process they may
identify say well what's relevant q and
I don't have information for that q and
that drive the information seeking
aspect of the our PD process and so that
Sena is well a very relevant to what we
want to do the other kind of information
requirement in our PD framework is the
monitoring the evaluation of different
options and to mental simulation or
other means to try to evaluate those
different options to see which way is
better and the third type of information
requirement is related to expectancy
monitoring which monitored the situation
after the decision is made to detect
anomaly to detect surprises or to detect
near success and so forth of course
especially when anomaly or failure
occurs that it may enable the human
decision-maker to adapt to respond and
so forth so our PD model is also an
adaptive decision-making model now our
PD is a quote cognitive model so taking
those concepts and realize it in a
computational model require you know
some
kind of a mapping the construct in
cognitions into computational component
and infrastructure and inference
capabilities and we created our cast
agent technology based on that there are
different ways to present archives
architectures instead of the traditional
agent of framework to use the sense
reasoning and action cycles usually I
prefer to present our cast by focusing
on how it anticipated information
requirements which is the top portion of
the architectures and how that info that
component interact with the
corresponding complimentary functions in
manage information requirement including
gathering information requirements and
so the two together result in a kind of
a smart push you may say that use the
context which is defined by the decision
process models together with the
relevant experience and that result in
different kinds of information
requirements the three I mentioned
earlier are the high-level examples then
there is an information manager which I
then determine whether information is
already in the system or in the in the
machine or needs to be gathered from
other sources using suit Communication
Manager so this indicate how different
pieces of the RPG is mapped into the
different pieces of our cast so the
information that's required can come
from multiple sources there can be no
already knowing the agent can be
inferred can be obtained from external
services or can be obtained from also
humans decisions or other agents so it's
inherently a collaborative very much a
service-oriented framework and it shows
that the inference technique actually
even though the inference technique is
forward triggering but actually the
information
need reasoning is backward inference and
we have developed a various application
including an application is the Navy
donors in terms of the future research
Jimmy you want to talk to your part so
I'm really trying to look for a maybe a
combination of Arts or of current
methodologies to really get away from a
stake based analysis of data stripped of
data and look at it more as a stream of
information and I really kind of
outlined you know kind of a method I'm
looking at and so that's that's where my
particular research is going and I'm
really closing on being able to some
type of not only descriptive model but
some type of predictive not that's the
first I can't predict what the next user
what the next users action is all right
and so Luke I just mentioned my future
research previously somehow I'm trying
to see how we can provide somehow
platform-independent in the web-based
user interface also look at the mobile
device for example for emerging
wayfinding right now we have iPhones we
have all kinds of the PDA phones which
allows allows to access not just a
Google map but also Google Earth which
can combine 2d 3d the problem is that
how we can tailor the presentation of
information to the cognition because so
far right now Google or the 3d stuff
sometimes it's too overwhelming for
people to understand what's going on so
how can combine together to adapt to
visualize into people cognition geo
collaboration as I showed and there's a
greater potential for us to look at how
we can use open resources to support
decision-making one of the plans of our
current research to get people from
homeland department homeless Perry
Department to look at how they can use
our system as well as Google service
because it's a Google map are not just a
proper writer service but also you can
collect information from other people
then the whole decision-making become
decision-making Stan becomes a very open
process rather than a closed-door
process
dr. Persinger Mitra is also doing work
in temporal and social mining area
because a tiny mutation I would just go
through this part relatively quickly and
hopefully he will if you are interested
please feel free to contact him he has
expressed interest also hopefully to be
able to visit Google also something in
the future and the problem he is looking
at is to detect overlapping events in
temporal and social text stream such as
blogs and his research involved three
components of three aspect of it with a
hierarchical topic clustering and then
the temporal segmentations
based on that clustering result and the
third is used social and information
flow analysis to help to identify
relevant event and topic and that this
is a graphical representation of the
three step I talked about clustering is
the first step and then temporal
segmentation is the second and the third
step is information flow pattern based
graph analysis for event detection so
the main idea here is try to combine
content and the temporal aspect and the
social interactions of the block all
together into this analysis for event
and topic and also the byproduct of that
is also the outcome in help to not only
see the trend or the change of event
interest over time but also how it
interact with the social network
involved in how so the interaction
between the tool
and therefore the problem involved three
dimensions the content dimension the
temporal dimension and the social
dimensions and the goal then is to
analyze this so that in terms of the
topic also can leverage topic structures
such as a hierarchy for better analysis
this is a graph based topic clustering
technique and temporal segmentations
technique and this is an example of the
outcome of temporal segmentation result
here we see a topic 6 which is shown in
blue and topic 16 which is shown in
purple kind of has a overlapping but the
slightly different life span and so
that's kind of the the outcome that his
research is is looking at and then Luke
talked about visualization and here is
another example where visualization play
important role from visualizing the
outcome of this event analysis and he
has apply this technique to two
different data set the Enron dataset
involve messages between employees a lot
of kdd research has been done in that
area his look has to look at that also
another area he is looking at which is
more interesting involved block data set
and this is an experiment result
indicating the outcome of his approach
it seems to be quite promising which is
shown in that the light blue line the
TRF indicate idea of line which suggests
a interesting result and these are some
of the related papers that he has
published
he and his team has published and and
then in closing the decision-making
researcher talked about earlier we are
also interested in linking the
decision-making
information seeking information
requirement generation to relevant
content on the web through so perhaps in
event detections and and trend
detections and other kinds of technique
that look at the all kinds of
information out there on the web and so
I close here and we'll be happy to
answer any questions you may have
thank you
yes please so my question is related to
information seeking yes I thought that's
very exciting and interesting thank you
so one thing that kept coming to my mind
when you were explaining it was you
never talked about user characteristics
or tasks anywhere in your presentation
so you were trying to decontextualize
your analysis so is there a possibility
that some of those characteristics are
confounding and mangling the patterns
you're getting out of it you might be
better off trying to separate those and
say oh look for this particular set of
users I can this can predict this
technique and predict one for the other
set of views that is not good so do you
think that would be a good direction to
move in are you planning to do so yeah
the question was about really segmenting
the information stream I think is a way
that I would if I understood the
question correctly and yeah you know you
brought some really good points there
and the that I think there are or I
think researchers pointed out there are
some different classes of users that you
know in just an area web searching you
know some very really naive users fact
finding things very ecommerce type group
and I would alter a little bit that it's
not really users but it's tasks that you
know at different times we all have
different roles that we play in
information seeking so yeah I think in
given those different tasks and context
yes certainly segmenting those tasks
into different areas which is a
beneficial approach yeah and I think any
type of robust methodology would have to
do that and the approach so the approach
I'm taking is the data that is collected
is very sparse I mean you really have an
IP address or cookie some queries maybe
some clickstream data you know and and
it's that's about it so you really have
to start all I think enriching the data
set you know and there are certainly
some approaches to that to do that in
terms
you know can you determine user intent
can you maybe determine a topic or
domain area can you classify some type
of commercial intent and so the I think
the richer profile you can make of this
task the better and then I think you
could really then narrow in on that
particular group of tasks and say okay
can what predictive models can't can we
come out of that and so yeah and and I
I've been really focusing on the
clickstream Act so can we predict
whether our user will click on an
organic link or a sponsored link for
example because I think that really has
some high payoff for for a lot of
reasons so but yeah III think that
really is the way to go what you
suggested
about visualizations let me go back to
the additional work by goldsmith and in
her work she looked at this text
comprehension ins and the point was when
someone reads a text then the three
perspectives going on one is a writer's
perspective what are they trying to
convey one is the readers perspective
what they are reading and the third one
is the perspective that comes out of
interaction between those two so my
question is while we have a nice
privatization systems do they take into
account those kind of interactions and
do this support building or you know
helping the one of those intellectuals /
user can what submit feedback into an to
better understand the system rather than
just taking the system or algorithmic be
of the knowledge structure which is kind
of how do you help support a Malcolm it
goes to perspective okay your questions
about the gap between creator
instructors and the user structure right
how we can address that issue that's a
good question actually in several
disciplines such as in philosophy also
well also in the information science
some people argue there kind of
difference between observers and the
creators and between it's called
observational structures or definition
structure or information size you've got
the categorical structure or situational
structure so in your case the creators
are more about you know definitional
structures or category structure are
formally defined but for users it's very
situated so it's the last formula design
and my goal is somehow to help users to
migrate from situational of the person
structure to more formally define this
categorical or definite structure you're
right it's it's a big challenge to help
us define such kind of Li we're very
well defined struct as well as useful
and the example I just show you is first
step to look at how we can obtain those
definition structures or category
structure right now we do not have
resources online about what you're not
instructors about a certain class on
papers
and as I mentioned our future to
research one of the ways to land use to
the store they are collection as well as
structures as I showed you the personal
connection you will see a hierarchy
structure and we are Beauty a service
service so that you know you can save
your results and then when people search
similar queries they will get
information about okay this is the
papers and these are somehow relevant
structure you might be interested and to
me this might be the first step to let
people to reuse others gradually we will
see kind of the activity to rebuild to
be the personal structures which are
available to all the communities or
society and from my opinion right now we
we can find some formula to find
structure however for practical
structures or situation structures we
still have a long way to go and my point
is that we have information over there
we have some structure over there but we
need a kind of the process and services
let people to do that
thank you
for the third so if you talked about
decision-making and one of the key
components in decision-making is the
knowledge you have the information on
the knowledge base and to me it seems
like from their presentation right now
you have already formal knowledge base
and you're trying to shift versus more
informal knowledge base with the recent
work that you presented so what do you
think is the right middle ground between
formal and informal knowledge base to
support these kind of decision-making
processes so the question is what is the
middle ground between formal and
informal representation of the knowledge
oh that's an excellent questions well I
think it goes there are two there are
two two aspect of your of your question
one is the the the Semantic Web a trend
and the meta tag help and the you know
event analysis trend analysis which
extract higher-level
knowledge structures out of your
structural you know semi structured
inflammations and so that provide high
level semantics to connect to the more
formal representation and then but on
the other hand I think the another
important trend these days for you know
let me use network as an example right
network itself is a knowledge structure
built on top of other information but
then it also serves as a kind of
information for extracting further
knowledge out of it so what we I think
Network example and just an example
where it's a I think a good another
candidate for a kind of mediator or
intermediate between the you know
conventional use of information and the
conventional reveal about the knowledge
it's really something in between and I
think it provides a very important and
rich construct to allow for another kind
of bridge that can be built between
informal and formal
representations but that's just an
example but you know it's a it's a great
questions I think the and I think the
Detroit and another part of this is
another piece that's also related is the
human eye your question also earlier
about human and users and so forth so
when a system make a recommendation to
the user and the user can has override
can interact with the system it provides
opportunity for the system to learn
about the interactions in fact another
research we are working on our related
area is also the trusted relationship
between recommend recommendation and in
the user and and so that's actually not
other kind of semi informal or formal
it's more at the relationship level you
know between the Machine and the user
and that is also very interesting area
now so if that loop can be enhanced
then the system can also learn not only
the user preference or possibly the
underlying user knowledge if there's
enough data available but also enhancing
the relationship a better understanding
how user view the system and then adapt
based on that
and you have a question
okay
I'm sorry I can't repeat the question so
I think this brings up another
interesting question is the rational
process that or the rational thought of
process the system goes through when
making a decision or recommending
something versus the blink process in
which the human makes dissonance part
with very little information or
reflection and sometimes those are
correct you know I don't know what the
exact percentage but a lot of time so is
there a role of that kind of a quick
decision process of decision suggestions
or support in the system and how do we
if there is a role of those kind of you
know support then how do we impact those
or you know integrate those kind of
decisions recommendation to the
well-thought-out knowledge based
recommendations so what is your opinion
on that thank you well it's an excellent
question - I guess so there are two
responses I can think of
first is the to some degree the
naturalist decision-making attempt to
model the more kind of a making
decisions on the spot can a blink type
represent your decisions and then the
way we realize it we feel actually kind
of closer to the rational type because
actually once we represented that it's
formal it was and the computer can run
faster so there's no less point of
saying well I just stopped on the first
solutions if I have tired then just you
know evaluate all of the options so if
actually could go into a more rational
like decision making so the the more
fundamental question I guess probably is
the deeper insight about human
cognitions
that is you know sometimes Richard you
know may involve
knows more kind of a
creative Muse this time creative aspect
whether it's a recall or a
problem-solving process and I think
that's an area hopefully there can be
you know groundbreaking breakthrough
down the line and I think that's an area
where neurologist cognition cognitive
scientists and computer scientists can
all collaborate and contribute and but I
think that's a that's a that would that
would be I think very exciting
directions because once we we can have
better insight about those and then can
can then realize some of those into
computational cognitive model that add
those element into it then the the the
reasoning or processing of
decision-making model then would be you
know even even richer of course then
there's still two competing or not
competing to two different goals here
why is modeling companies human
cognition versus supporting human
cognition so it will be you know
interesting to to model human cognition
other creative process but then it may
introduce additional challenge on the
trust aspect because if the Machine
become too creative you know it may
introduce additional challenge for the
user to to to doubt it and then get used
to its creativity and sort of flow so so
it's a two-way street but I think that
so that's a very important direction
because I I think those are all
interrelated creativity and kind of
intuitive problem solving and decision
