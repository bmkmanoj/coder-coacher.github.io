pleasure to introduce today Chris McKay
he's a planetary scientists over at NASA
Ames and his talk today will be about
the Phoenix Mars mission
I'll leave Chris to take off then when I
talk about is the Phoenix Mars mission
Phoenix is on Mars right now digging
away in the dirt it has another couple
months before it gets buried with carbon
dioxide snow and freezes up for the
winter what I want to do is just give
you a short summary of the mission and
update on its results so the Phoenix
Mars mission the P I is Peter Smith at
the University of Arizona Phoenix is the
first planetary mission that's being
operated for NASA by a university by a
university PI and it's really worked
very well and I hope NASA continues with
that precedent the University of Arizona
built a separate building all by itself
it doesn't have a security fence around
it which is nice and it's got ample
parking so thereby just overcomes both
problems of NASA centers and
universities my name is Chris McKay I'm
a science Kawai on the mission
Phoenix launched last May on a
trajectory to Mars landed May 25th
this year sorry long launch last August
and landed may 25th of this year here it
is being launched from the Cape here is
a view of Phoenix being assembled these
are normal-sized people so you get a
sense how big it is these are the solar
panels here's the lander deck itself you
see this bag
that's a bio barrier bag and within that
bag is the arm the only part of the
Phoenix lander which was sterilized was
the arm this is not well known but we
stopped sterilizing spacecraft to Mars
after Viking so the rover's the mirror
Beagle - none of those were sterilized
Phoenix is not sterilized but the arm
was because the arm is coming in contact
with ice and so for that reason the arm
was sterilized and so it's in a sterile
bag when it got to Mars it popped out of
the bag the reason it's called Phoenix
is interesting is that Phoenix is
literally reborn from two
previous missions in in the late 90s
NASA built two identical spacecraft with
the intention of launching one in Mars
98 and launching the second one in 2001
the one in mark and 98 crashed on Mars
it was lost we don't know exactly how it
was lost although we now have a very
good idea it was lost and there's a
result of that headquarters cancelled
the 2001 mission for obvious reasons you
have two identical spacecraft one
crashes you don't want that to happen
again a couple years later several of us
started pushing for rehabilitating that
spacecraft doing a test readiness review
and getting it ready to fly again and my
texts suggest that we called Phoenix for
that reason which we did was selected in
a competition among many other
spacecrafts many other mission designs
having a spacecraft already built really
put us a leg ahead of the competition in
terms of showing that we were ready to
go and so on Phoenix basically has four
science instruments on it it has a
camera to look at on the surface it has
what's called the tiga thermal evolved
gas analyzer which is basically an oven
which can heat up samples to a thousand
degrees and then a mass spectrometer to
look at the fumes that are released so
an oven and a nose it has a wet chemical
cell the series of chambers where soil
can be added and then water and various
electrolytes added to the soil that's
very important because this is the first
wet chemistry done on Mars since Viking
and then it had a meteorological station
a lidar a laser pointing up looking at
reflected light that was the Canadian
contribution to the mission so that
those are the the instruments Phoenix
landed and when it landed it was
photographed on its descent from the
Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter so this is a
photograph of Phoenix on the parachute
coming down to its landing taken from
orbit which I was amazed to see that
photograph almost equally as amazing is
the pictures of Phoenix on the ground
here is the lander here
it's heatshield here's its parachute you
can see as I've blown up that image the
solar panels and the deck there's no
privacy on Mars anymore
everything you do there is being watched
it's incredible
it Phoenix was supposed to land at this
little blue cross it landed at this red
cross the witch was just at the edge of
the three sigma era lips so it landed
off target it landed successfully but it
landed off target for us on the Phoenix
mission that's not a problem Phoenix
didn't have to go anywhere after it
landed it's only success criteria was
that it land on ice and covered ice on
ice and there's ice throughout this
entire region so as long as it landed
safely we were happy with it landing
anywhere but that is an issue for Mars
missions in general in that particularly
on the next mission we want to land near
something that we then Rove to and so
having a many tens of kilometers air
would be a serious problem it turns out
the reason it landed long was as it came
in it had a higher angle of attack than
expected and that was resulted in
generating more lift than expected and
so flying longer than expected so it
flew a lifting trajectory I was asking
the engineers just last week why did it
have a higher angle of attack and we
still don't know the answer to that why
did it have a higher than predicted
angle of attack so of course the first
thing Phoenix did when it landed was the
first thing Mars Viking did when it
landed it's the first thing I do when I
get off the plane is look down and make
sure you feet reach the ground so this
is the Phoenix looking down and it's
foot Pat and then looking out and
looking down it was really quite
spectacular looking out we immediately
saw that we were on the pattern ground
just like we see in polar regions on
earth and looking down we saw that the
descent engines had blown away enough
soil that the ice was visible right
underneath the lander so we were
certainly on ice cemented ground as
expected we it wasn't a surprise and it
wasn't unexpected that there was ice at
the landing site it was not a discovery
to find ice there despite some of the
press reports we landed there
there is ice this is the map that was
the motivation for the Phoenix mission
this is the map of the hydrogen or ice
distribution on Mars as derived by
Odyssey the dark blue indicates ice rich
regions which are here in the northern
hemisphere here in the southern
hemisphere that's ground ice on Mars ice
below a thin layer of dry dirt ice
cement to ground Phoenix was targeted to
land on that material and we did at 68
degrees north so we knew that there was
ground ice on Mars that site is
particularly interesting to us because
not now but five million years ago
conditions may have been like they are
in Earth's polar regions so here is Mars
today it's tilted at 25 degrees with
respect to the Sun so it's seasons today
are very similar to seasons on earth
which has a tilt of 23 and a half
degrees but five million years ago Mars
was tilted at 45 degrees which means its
seasons were exaggerated by almost twice
compared to our seasons as a result the
polar regions five million years ago
would receive twice as much sunlight as
they received now twice as much sunlight
is about the difference between Earth's
orbit and Mars orbit so the Phoenix
landing site five million years ago
would receive about roughly speaking the
same level of sunlight as the
corresponding point in the polar regions
on earth question here
the question was how do we know what to
tell was five million years ago no one
was there to record it obviously but we
have computers that could simulate it
obviously this is a calculation from
last Gardel it's a calculation of the
orbital is taking the equations of
motion for a planet and just integrating
them backwards Mars is a top it's got an
equatorial bulge that bulge is torqued
by the presence of other planets
principally Jupiter so we can solve the
equations of motion in this case employ
lers equations for a rotating object and
calculate backwards how the obliquity
and eccentricity and inclination would
have changed with time those
calculations are accurate back about 10
million years after which point the
solutions become chaotic in a
mathematical sense and it may also be
that the precise trajectory is not it's
not accurate but in terms of the rough
parameter space it probably is so that
we know five million years ago
the obliquity was probably 45 it may not
have occurred it exactly at that point
but for our purposes that's really not
not essential okay so why is why is this
interesting for me I'm particularly
interested in the question of the search
for life on Mars that's my area of
interest and the first step in searching
for life is is water well to get water
on Mars requires three things first it
requires ice as a source for the water
it doesn't do any good to have warm
temperate conditions if there's no ice
to provide the water which the polar
regions have that map of ice shows where
there could be water recently then it
requires temperatures above zero degrees
melting the ice that's what we're
familiar with on earth but a condition
that's also important on Mars that is
not important on earth is that the
pressure must be above six millibars
this is the so-called triple point of
water if the pressure is below six
millibars or even if it's close to six
millibars water behaves like dry ice
does on earth that goes directly from
solid to vapor and the liquid phase is
not possible right now we tend not that
is not part of our intuition
water on earth because on earth
everywhere the pressure is above six
millibars it's a hundred times above
pressure in this room is a thousand
millibars so we tend not to think about
that but pressure is just as important
as temperature in allowing water to
exist as liquid but if you remember your
basic thermodynamics a state variable
description requires two variables
pressure and temperature and on Mars in
fact the variable that controls the
existence of liquid water I would say
now and through Mars is history is not
temperature as on earth but pressure
when we look back this is sort of a
footnote to the talk but when we look
back in Mars as history and we see
evidence of water I don't think we're
seeing evidence of warmer conditions
we're seeing evidence of higher pressure
conditions our intuition that we develop
on earth which is focused on ice and
temperature misleads us a little bit
when we look at Mars
well the north polar regions on Mars are
the key place for liquid water because
Mars has a hemispherical topographic
dichotomy the north polar regions are
low elevation the south polar regions
are high the north polar regions have
pressures that are always higher always
above six millibar there's ice at the
surface as we discovered by landing and
as we knew before we went right now
those temperatures are always well below
freezing but five million years ago as I
said temperatures might have been higher
so the polar regions on Mars and where
Phoenix landed could have been or could
be a habitable place five million years
ago and that's what I'm going to be
talking about later as we compare it to
similar places on earth well what did we
find when we got there well we found a
lot of things that we expect even though
some of them were discussed in the press
as if they were discoveries Mars is rad
we see that it's cold minus 32 minus 80
we saw on the surface rocks dirt and
pattern ground just as we expected we
saw a subsurface ice table as expected
we would have been extremely surprised
if there hadn't been ice below us and
disappointed to at at and we saw salts
sodium magnesium chloride other salts as
expected these were all as expect
there were really no surprises in here
it's real color on my computer and it's
not it's projected reasonably well here
- oh yes the camera is a color camera
that's right
sorry I thought you meant the rendition
yeah there's a color camera that that
color that binocular camera is a color
camera and you see on this picture the
scoop that picks up the dirt and does
the sampling and you're seeing a solar
panel here
we also found things that were not
expected and this is the list of the
things that we find that were not accept
expected the soil had a pH of 8 this is
the first time we measured the pH on the
soil on Mars
hard to believe five missions and we
still didn't know the pH of the soil
we've now measured at one pop spot and
the soil appears to be buffered by
carbonate few percent carbonate well
this is really curious because as you
may remember the one of the rover's the
mural landed in Meridiani and it found
what appeared to be an acid soil found
Jerris site in the soil and jerry' site
is a iron sulfate mineral that forms a
pH around three and so there was an and
at the same time the orbiters had failed
to find carbonates large carbonates
carbonate outcrops hug crops on Mars so
there is a consensus in the community
that Mars was an acid world and that it
had an acid ocean and that the acid
explains the Jura site in the iron
mineralogy and the lack of carbonates
and so to land here and find alkaline
soils buffered bicarbonate did a very
nice job of puncturing that belief and
illustrating that Mars is a diverse
place and that finding one thing at one
site doesn't allow us to extrapolate
globally to the whole world
we also found at that site perchlorate
perchlorate is the most of the oxidized
forms of chlorine it's the most oxidized
and it was at a point about 0.5 percent
concentration these two conclusions are
fairly solid they're fairly
the ones that are not yet quite so solid
I put in yellow from the tiga results we
found no organics and no nitrates which
is interesting and a little bit
disappointing from a biological point of
view it would have been great if we had
found organics and nitrates also would
have been interesting as one of the
challenges for life is a source of
nitrogen question here the only rocket
that had perchlorate in a perchlorate is
used as fuel in solid rocket motors but
the only engines that had solid rockets
were the liftoff engines who strap-on
boosters the descent engines were
hydrogen peroxide so there's no
perchlorate in them the only possible
contamination from onboard might have
been the explosive bolts prior
technically activated bolts and that it
really is 0.5% is a lot of perchlorate
so it's not likely
no organics no nitrates this is a
preliminary result but I think it's
going to hold and that has the the rim
plication zuv that are still sort of
soaking into my head there's no organics
and no nitrates and that rules out one
particular energy source for life we
also found segregated ice which I want
to show you here and then I'll go back
to this slide segregated ice that is as
I said we expected ground ice which is a
table of ice ice cemented ground with
dry permafrost above it that's what we
expected we expected dry soil and then
abruptly - ice cemented soil and that's
what we see in the bottom of these
trenches and if you're in the permafrost
regions on earth you experience this
directly in the summer you dig down it's
soft soft and you hit which seems like a
basement of concrete that's the ice
table we found that but we also found in
the dry soil chunks of white material
they could have been salt it could have
been carbonate could have been ice after
a few days we saw that it was
evaporating if you look here and here
you see that it was evaporating so it
was clearly ice that was unexpected and
I call it segregated ice in that it is
not part of the ice table it's little
chunks of ice
loading icebergs in the dirt well what
are the explanations for this there's
three explanations that I've seen at
least discussed in the team one is that
it's buried snow simple but unlikely the
other is that it's also vapour deposited
like that ice table is below it that is
vapour from the atmosphere is condensing
in the ground and just forming ice
that's a good explanation for the ice
table but I don't think it's a good
explanation for this we don't see that
happening on earth
I'll show you places where we have
ground ice it's vapour deposited we
don't see that segregated ice on earth
if you see segregated ice chunks of ice
and dirt it's always associated with
action of liquid films and temperatures
cycling between freezing near the
freezing point of those liquid films so
I think the Occam's razor explanation
for that I segregated ice is that it's a
result of liquid films in this case is
I'll argue salty liquid films not fresh
water liquid films another interesting
result that's consistent with salty
action in the soil is the stickiness of
the dirt as you may remember when we
first put the open the ovens this is the
door to the tiga instrument and you see
the fine grain screen there that's to
filter the particles coming through so
that big chunks don't clog up the door
when we put the dirt on that screen
nothing fell through and the instrument
had a shaker on it and they shook it and
still nothing fell through there was a
couple days when we were wondering are
we gonna get any date at all it was
sticking there like mud and about three
days later it just started falling
through now one possible explanation for
that is that it dried out that it was a
mix of ice and salt and dirt and as it
warmed up it formed a mud mix of ice
salt and dirt and then as it sat there
in the dry Martian air the water left
and we had dry salt and dry dirt and
then it fell through all of it pointing
to the notion that there could have been
salts on Mars so it's useful to look at
the weather report here is the weather
for the first couple months the average
is minus maximum is minus 30 minimum is
minus 80 pressures above the triple
point but not not a whole lot the
maximum minimum
cross the eutectic of several salts this
is I think an interesting observation
the eutectic salts as you know our
antifreeze they lower the freezing point
of water which is why in places that
have winter they throw salts on the road
in the winter to cause a melting layer
on the ice so that the roads aren't I
see if you live in the US they probably
use sodium chloride but if you live up
in Canada it's too cold for sodium
chloride because sodium chloride will
only suppress the freezing point to
minus 20 if you want to go to minus 30
you need magnesium chloride and if you
live in some really inhabit
uninhabitable place in the far north you
want to put calcium chloride because
that'll suppress the freezing point to
minus 50 so these salts magnesium
chloride and calcium chloride will cycle
between liquid and solid in this
temperature range the minimum
temperature which the salt will suppress
the freezing point is called the
eutectic temperature so these salts in
if they were in the dirt and there was
enough ice and enough salt could go from
solid to liquid and back through that
temperature range and I think that is
part of the explanation for the
stickiness and that's also could be what
caused the segregated ice here's an
example of the model for the stickiness
is that we have dry soil with salts and
ice as we dig we mix some of the ice in
with the salts that formed a eutectic
brine and it's at there is a muddy salty
mix on the spacecraft and then when we
sat that it sat there it dried out and
went back to solid and then was able to
fall through and you you can do this in
the lab if I take salts like magnesium
chloride and mix it in with salt with
dirt Mars simulant third in water it
becomes muddy and sticky not surprising
the salts also open up the possibility
that there could be what I call a salt
active Zone on earth the permafrost
active zone extends from the surface
down to the point where a zero degrees
is reached and that is the active zone
the zone that melts in the summer if you
had salts for example sodium chloride
that could be suppressed down to minus
when he won the eutectic of sodium
chloride and so there might be a zone in
which having a salt allows liquid to
exist at temperatures below zero and in
fact one of the things I'm doing right
now is trying to find natural places on
earth where we have salt saturated soils
in polar regions and looking to see the
physical manifestations of this
phenomenon so far I haven't found one
but I got to go to the polls and look so
what I want to do now is talk about
putting the results for the Phoenix site
on Mars in the context of our
understanding of polar regions on Earth
and then make some discuss and then
follow that with some discussions of the
biology of these regions on earth so
this is sort of a diagram schematic
diagram of drier and colder conditions
and up here is Mars today extremely dry
extremely cold here on the other end
I'm putting the Arctic the Arctic is
relatively cold and wet permafrost the
evens can see a little bunny rabbit here
on this scale it's the most habitable
we'll consider from the Arctic going a
little colder and little drier is the
coastal Antarctic and then going a
little colder and a lot drier the high
elevation Antarctic and on earth we are
able to cross the boundary between wet
permafrost and dry permafrost in the
Arctic and the coastal Antarctic we have
what is called wet permafrost this is
permafrost that in the summer melts and
has a layer of water above it so the ice
boundary if you go digging in permafrost
in the summer the ice boundary will have
a temperature of zero degrees and the
depth of permafrost will be the depth of
that zero degrees isotherm wet
permafrost and that permafrost interacts
with its environment exchanging water
through the liquid phase but if it gets
cold and dry enough you reach a point
where the permafrost does not melt ever
and the interaction with the environment
is purely as a vapor and I call that dry
permafrost or vapor exchange permafrost
there's only one place on earth where we
find dry permafrost and that is in the
high elevations
of the Antarctic Dry Valleys I should
say there's only one place on earth
where we have found dry permafrost I
think there may be other locations where
there is dry permafrost where conditions
are cold and dry in addition to the dry
valleys
I think the next like weep a place to
find dry permafrost is actually an
earth's equator an earth's equator
but at high elevation on Kilimanjaro and
places like that that are persistently
cold and dry I think we also have dry
primer straps but they are less explored
than the Antarctic now if you think of
that continuum on earth from wet
permafrost and the Arctic wet permafrost
and the Antarctic coastal regions to dry
permafrost in the Antarctic high
elevations Mars is outside that
continuum Mars is colder and drier than
even that coldest driest permafrost on
Earth today but five million years ago
the model suggests that Mars was within
that continuum so right now Mars today
is an extrapolation of what we have on
earth but five million years ago Mars
would have been an interpolation between
what we have on earth
so these communities on earth bracket
what Mars was like five million years
ago and they may allow us to extrapolate
to what Mars is today so for that reason
we drag the Phoenix team down Antarctica
last jolt January here's Peter Smith the
PI of the mission and the rest of us
here I'm here as native guide to show
them around we were studying permafrost
in the coastal regions and in the high
elevation dry regions just to orient you
this is the Dry Valleys of Antarctica
the largest ice-free region in
Antarctica straight south of New Zealand
here is McMurdo Station on Ross Island
the main US bases there and here is the
dry permafrost zone now we're interested
this is the Dry Valleys and the dry
permafrost that we're going to study is
in these valleys up here Beacon Valley
and University Valley and Friedman
Valley the mean annual temperature in
these valleys is minus 20 centigrade
it's very cold the biggest difference
between these valleys and Mars is not
the temperature it's that the pressure
is well above the triple point in these
valleys here's looking down one of the
valleys
Lake Van Daan the onyx River these
valleys are the only place on earth
where it never rains it's not that
there's no hydrological cycle but
there's rain is not a part of it it's
only snow snow the typical hydrological
cycle in these valleys is snowfalls to
form glaciers which flow downhill
seasonal melting creates transient water
which flows and seasonal rivers to make
ice-covered lakes which then evaporate
to close the cycle it's the only place
on earth where it never rains
there's place on earth where it rarely
rains like the Atacama Desert for
example but even there any precipitation
that does come comes as rain here it's
only snow so the coastal what did we
find there here is our camp at the
coastal site where we find found
expected to and found wet permafrost
this is Lake Fritzl or camp there it's a
well established camp it's been there
for about 15 years solar-powered it has
wireless internet if you can believe it
we spent Christmas Day here and it was
really quite comfortable you see the
pattern ground just like we see on the
Mars Phoenix site and when you dig a pit
here in the middle of summer Christmas
Day the height the summer what we find
is as expected
soil that's dry then soil it's wet and
then a temperature is zero degrees and I
cemented soil above it this is classic
wet permafrost in the summertime now
moving up one and a half kilometers in
elevation straight up and 50 miles back
in to this site University Valley no
camp no internet no telephone no nothing
just sleeping just living in tents here
we found dry permafrost a very different
physical system we dig down through the
ground and it's completely dry bone-dry
as I'll show you I think it's a driest
soils on earth or right here and then we
hit ice cement to ground the
temperatures minus 10 and this is the
maximum temperature that this ice will
reach in the summer time in the winter
the temperature will drop to minus 40 so
there the this is the dry frozen soil
it's below freezing all year round it's
dry permafrost and
is the ice cemented soil beneath it this
is the Mars model this is what we find
on Mars is dry permafrost we don't find
liquid water in the transition between
the ice cement and ground and the dirt
above it so what I'm interested in is
the biology of these sites so this chart
is a comparison of the microbiology of
wet permafrost and dry permafrost as far
as I could tell from the literature this
is the first time that anybody studied
the microbiology of dry permafrost what
we find this is an Arctic site at 60 78
degrees north 78 degrees north 78
degrees south all wet permafrost to
arctic and one Antarctic site and then
this is the dry permafrost and the
colored bands indicate different types
of bacteria living in that permafrost
and in particular I want to draw your
attention to the yellow and orange
bacteria they're not really yellow and
orange but what the color code means is
that the yellow are sulphur reducing
bacteria and the red are anaerobic metal
reducers these are basically bacteria
that we find in every single soil we've
ever studied we find them even in a dry
oxidizing core region of the Atacama
Desert we find these bacteria they live
in little anaerobic micro sites within
the soil and those sites are generally
created by little bits of water creating
little tiny stagnant ponds microscale
ponds the only place we haven't seen
these yellow and orange bands and soils
is in this dry permafrost it was quite a
surprise to get back the results and
find no anaerobic bacteria in these dry
soils which is what leads me to think
that these are the driest most oxidizing
soils we've ever studied it's also
interesting that they're not devoid of
life there is a community here it's a
community that is basically
heterotrophic oxygen consumers they're
eating organic material they're
breathing in oxygen there's no anaerobic
component to it very very little
eukaryotic component to it it's a
community that's in equilibrium with its
environment but very different than the
communities in wet permafrost this is
not too big a surprise it's consistent
with what we would think
but it illustrates two points one is
that the dry permafrost and the high
Antarctic is habitable there's a
community of organisms living there
they're living on organic material and
breathing oxygen we're doing the same
metabolism that we humans do eat candy
breathe oxygen eat candy breathe oxygen
repeat they're doing the same thing and
it's very different than in the wet
permafrost so if we if you remember my
argument that Mars five billion years
ago is between the dry permafrost and
the wet permafrost it would clearly say
that five million years ago Mars was no
more harsh than the dry permafrost in
the Antarctic is that if life can be
supported there could life be supported
in the dry permafrost on Mars and so
that's the analogy we'll want to make
between the dry permafrost in Antarctica
we know that this boundary is inhabited
and the dry permafrost boundary on Mars
today we know that that temperature is
too cold with five million years ago
those temperatures could have been
comparable and I think that would allow
us to conclude that five million years
ago the Phoenix site was habitable with
respect to the availability of liquid
water there's enough liquid water
available in ice cemented ground at
minus ten to support life the water is
in thin films of unfrozen water that
exists down to temperatures of about
minus 20 on the boundary between ice and
any sort of other material but there's a
big difference between what we see here
and what we expect on Mars and that as I
said the energy source here is organisms
consuming organic material with oxygen
well we don't have oxygen on Mars and
now we know that there's no organic
material we also know there's no nitrate
which is the next most likely oxidant
that life uses in the absence of oxygen
but we do know there's perchlorate we
also know that organisms on earth will
use perchlorate as an oxidant if there's
no nitrate available so we in a sense
we've got half the answer for Mars
well step one we know that water
conditions have been suitable step two
is we know that from a point of view of
an energy source perchlorate would be a
thing if we can think of what would be
the reductant that the organisms would
be consuming with that perchlorate it's
not organic matter which is the
reductant that the organisms on earth
are consuming it's got to be something
else presumably some mineral phase so
that's an interesting question that
we're still working on then going down
to logic water check energy may be the
next step the next challenge that life
would have on Mars living at that ice
boundary is a source of nitrogen we
found what appeared to be known nitrates
in the soil the nitrogen in the
atmosphere is too low to support
fixation so that may be where we stumble
in terms of speculating what could these
organisms be using as a source for
nitrogen but I'm very excited about this
because up to now arguing habitability
of Mars stumbled at the very first step
is their environment with water is their
environment with enough water to support
life with a water activity in the
habitable limit we're able to push that
one and a half steps further we can say
yes there's an environment with water
and there's an environment that we think
almost has enough energy and we're even
up to the point of wondering about the
nitrogen capability so I think the
Phoenix site is confirming what we
thought when we targeted that this is
the most likely place on Mars to have
been habitable in the recent past I want
to end by just pointing out a few
showing a neat picture recent
observation dust devils we've seen these
from the MIR sites and this is but this
is the first one we've seen from in the
polar regions a dust devil out on the
surface of Mars what do we do next
well obviously the interesting thing
about the Phoenix site is the ice
unfortunately Phoenix did not really
have a instrument capable of sampling
deep into the ice it had an arm for
scooping up the dirt as I showed you and
it had a little rasp on the back of the
arm of this of the scoop to so that it
could scrape this ice and get some ice
samples but what we really want to do is
in the next mission a follow up to
Phoenix is drill down into that ice we
didn't find organic material in the soil
but there may be organic material
preserved
the ice itself the ice maybe acting like
a casement protecting the organic
material from what we believe to be
oxidants on the surface that would
destroy it so we'd like to get down into
it so the mission that we're trying to
focus on now is a follow on we would
like to have a ten meter drill that
drills down into the ice and samples at
a depth to look for organics and then
beyond that we'd like a mission that
drills even deeper a hundred to a
thousand meters down deep to get into
the ancient record of ice on Mars ice
and permafrost in general is a very good
way to preserve evidence of organic
material and past life we see that on
earth and go into the permafrost on
earth drill down and find organisms that
have been frozen for millions of years
if they're eukaryotes they're dead but
if they're prokaryotes if they're
bacteria they're still alive you can
recover them we can recover bacteria on
earth from ice samples that we think are
eight million years old on Mars we might
be able to drill down and find samples
that are several billion years old and
that's the end and maybe we now have
time for questions question here well
you're supposed to go to talking to the
mic because this is being recorded and
last I saw the conductivity probe hadn't
shown any conductivity in this soil
what's the expiration of that if there's
water with salts yeah the question
relates to the conductivity probe
there's a probe which has three prongs
and we can measure the electrical
conductivity between them it's a
standard technique we use on earth in
polar regions if there's ice at
temperatures that are less than minus 20
there's a thin film of liquid and
creates high conductivity if there's
salts in the ice and we can see it
there's two issues with operating that
probe on Mars one is if it's colder if
it's too cold you can stick it into ice
containing material and over-read zero
conductivity the other if it's got a lot
of ice in and it's hard you literally
can't get the needles in which is a
problem I had with it when I was testing
and in Antarctica a couple years ago in
places where there was no ice I could
get the needle in but it wouldn't read
anything because it was dry and play
where there was ice it was too hard to
put the needle in there's a there's some
practical difficulties with the with the
connectivity probe and make interpreting
it hard so I haven't I'm not yet aware
of any results from that probe that have
added to our understanding other
questions
so I've heard several times about the
sunlight failing and freezing the Rovers
there any expectation that all come back
out in the spring
yeah the the Rovers of course are near
the equator and so winter is not very
harsh for them they're able to survive
just by turning down operations and sort
of hunkering down we are in the polar
regions and where is going to come real
hard it's going to be totally dark and
we're gonna get buried in carbon dioxide
so the temperature will reach 150 Kelvin
so we try this at home take your laptop
dump it in liquid nitrogen and then see
if it works
if it does send me an email let me know
what you did that's a really tough on
batteries and electronic components so I
bet the engineers will ping it next
Martian spring just just for fun but the
expectation is that it will be as dead
as a doornail so related to that at
temperatures like negative 30 Celsius
and below metals tend to get very
fragile I don't mostly useless how how
did you solve that engineering problem
well the on the spacecraft the only
things that move is the arm and some of
the actuators on the instruments and
those are kept warm in particular the
biggest problem that in general we've
had my understanding from the engineers
is the lubricants on the joints and the
motors and this is being becoming a big
problem for the next mission MSL it was
originally designed with a lubricant
sort of a dry tongue stand lubricant was
how it was described to me but it ended
up failing at low temperatures and so
they had to go back to another lubricant
and as a result the mission is
constrained to land near the equator
because it won't operate in the polar
regions because it's too cold because
it's designed lifetime is a year so it's
got a Martian year so it has to survive
the winter so that low temperatures is a
serious engineering problem and the
focus of the problem seems to be on
lubricants for for joints and motors
the mission cost overruns were pretty
widely publicized what do they end up
being total and how much do you think
that affected other Mars missions
well the celebrated mission cost
overruns are for the mission that's
being built right now MSL and that one
is Janet the mission cost overruns on
that have generated a lot of heat and a
little bit of light and they are
seriously impacting the whole Mars
program and MSL may get delayed a an
opportunity two years and if that
happens it's really very unfortunate for
the program and it could mean that that
ends up pushing back the whole program
for five years so MSL which is a much
bigger mission in Phoenix the cost
overruns are serious and I understand
the problem one was this lubricant
problem and then the other was the
sample acquisition tool MSL is a huge
Rover it's about the size of a
Volkswagen bug and the front of it it's
got a huge tool for collecting and
processing sample and as I understand
they've ran into a lot of complications
with the operation of that which is also
delaying delivery and if it does slip
and have to go another two years that's
a big problem
you may remember about a year ago there
was a big hoopla from NASA headquarters
about cutting back on missions on
instruments that were over budget for
that and for that mission MSL now
Phoenix had some problems with cost
overrun but most of them were driven by
a testing a expensive maybe over
extensive test schedule based on
concerns about the landing and the
failure of the previous mission but the
real the real problem with cost overruns
is MSL the new mission that the rover
mission coming up putting planetary
protection protocol Society for the
moment is there any organism on earth
that could leave on conditions that we
found on Mars today no we don't know if
any can place on Mars right now we're
any organism from Earth could live so
that's a scientific assessment so in
fact we try to find places on Mars where
an organism could live
that's a goal from a science point of
view from a regulatory point of view
though they take a different perspective
they say is that can you rule out the
possibility that there would be a place
where organisms could live well we can't
rule that out so they take a much more
conservative approach so the Phoenix the
ice at the Phoenix site from a science
perspective that's not a habitable spot
but from a planetary protection
perspective that's close enough to have
ability that we were required to
sterilize so it's a question of whether
you believe it
versus whether you can prove it's not
possible for planetary protection we
have to prove it's not possible to
publish a scientific paper you have to
believe and that's that's the difference
so you you end up with the sort of dual
perspective I say it's not habitable the
planetary protection says you've got to
sterilize the rover in case something
can grow and those two are only
consistent when you have those double
standards you sort of just answered my
question but I was surprised to learn
that we don't sanitize most experiments
that we send can you talk about that
yeah that's a good point I always bring
it up because everybody is surprised to
learn because there's a general
perception that we sterilize spacecraft
and NASA actually continues to propagate
that impression that we sterilize
spacecraft but we don't
after Viking landed the National Academy
of Sciences and the Committee on Space
Research following the recommendation of
national counting on science said stop
sterilizing spacecraft to Mars it's not
necessary and so there's a cleanliness
standard so we know that the spacecrafts
are pretty clean
you know cleaner than the kitchen in my
house but they still are have bacteria
on them we know that the two Rovers each
went to Mars with about a hundred
thousand bacteria on those each of them
and most of those bacteria have been
killed by being exposed to Martian UV
but any bacteria inside the spacecraft
they're still alive they're not growing
but they're viable they're dormant on
Mars so we know for a fact it's not even
conjecture we know for a fact that there
are earth bacteria viable on Mars
inside Sojourner over
finer Lander and the 2m ers inside
protected from UV they're still viable
but they're not growing and they won't
won't ever grow unless they come across
an environment with liquid water which
may not happen naturally on Mars but who
knows so it's a it's an issue as we
start doing more ambitious missions like
drilling we have to worry more about
that because in a drilling mission
drilling down we might hit liquid water
and then if we contaminate it it would
be a serious problem which is why things
like the arm or a drill would be
sterilized because they're going
separately so this whole question of
cleanliness and planetary protection and
for contamination are issues that we're
still working and when you imagine
sending humans to Mars
you certainly can't sterilize them how
do you take that approach
so Lake Vostok is a place on earth where
we worry about that as well yeah so you
mentioned that Phoenix is gonna get
buried in snow can we expect photos of
like the lander feet covering in snow do
we expect the instruments to break down
before that happens yeah that's a good
question we will we be able to see the
snow coming or will we die in the coal
ready scene snowflakes right no we swell
high in the atmosphere the lidar
detective snow falling but we haven't
seen any white stuff on the ground sort
of like living in San Francisco you know
you can hear about snow and you know
theoretically it's snowing but the
ground never actually turns white and
that's what we're experiencing so far so
I think if it my guess is that we will
see snow pictures before the we lose the
spacecraft in time for Christmas
certainly in time for Christmas yeah you
know by Christmas time she'll be dead
you know because it's Qatar we're
already getting sunsets and darkness and
they're already talking about shutting
down various parts of the spacecraft so
by Christmas we'll probably be no longer
talking any other questions
hello
the recent observations of ice lenses in
the soil as long as well as the liquid
water around them begin to constrain the
mechanical properties of it is what does
the team's thought on that observation
with the local landscape geology that
they see so here are the here are these
ice lenses in the soil this is this I
think is a major mystery and was
unexpected what is this ice in the
middle of the dirt layer and how did it
get there
and how long has it been there it's much
softer at least in parts then this ice
cemented ground below it and I was
mentioning that on earth we can go to a
place where there is vapor deposited I
cement a ground in the Dry Valleys we
don't see this included ice we don't see
ice in the dirt above it and the dirt
above vapor deposited ice on earth it is
clear and dry so we're not sure what's
causing this there are several possible
explanations that it's buried snow vapor
deposit or liquid films
I think it's liquid films but in any
case I would like to find a place on
earth where we see a similar phenomenon
so one of the things that we will do
next time we go to the Dry Valleys now
armed with this knowledge of what
Phoenix saw is looking the dry
permafrost on earth to find a similar
phenomenon a place where there's a
basement of ice cemented ground and then
dry permafrost and in the dry permafrost
there's chunks of ice if we find that
then we have a model here on earth of
what's happening on Mars and that puts
us way ahead of the game I don't
remember seeing it but I never looked
for it because I didn't know we were
gonna find it on Mars so we never looked
for it but next time we go to the Dry
Valleys we will we'll look for it and
hopefully we'll find something like it
or conclude that it's a phenomenon
unique to Mars and it doesn't have a
counterpart in those limited regions on
earth where there is dry permafrost
