slight change of title this one it's
I've just heard it's surviving without
generics this is very much a go
experience report of writing a library
and having geospatial types that was a
bit about that
in Scenario we're having generics would
be very helpful and I would have written
it quite differently had I had them so I
only talked about here the problems I
encountered and the ways I worked around
the lack of generics you can go the
library itself giome it's for how many
geospatial data this is sort of thing
you'll use if you're going to write the
back end for Google Maps Google Earth or
you want to develop something like
Stryver week you're gonna analyze GPS
track logs over time that sort of thing
this is something I do a lot for fun I
wanted to create a nice usable library
with a clean API I was less worried
about an implementation I want it to be
easy to use these kind of different
types of geometries I'll talk about
those it converts things and various
common formats like caramel and GPX and
igc and wkb and so on
and it provides a number of operations
on these geometries underneath the hood
sometimes I'm handling quite a lot of
data for example I use this in a project
where for a big race called the
redblacks Alps where we have people
racing across the Alps for 12 days with
data coming in at 1 second from 30
different teams and I want to do very
much analysis and presentation that data
what's he doing is using OpenGL like
OpenGL consortium style geometries this
is the open source geospatial world they
have actually three different types of
geometry points lines and polygons which
can exist in either single individual
items or as multi things example a point
might be the location of your friend or
a multi point might be all the water
fountains in Zurich a line string like
your Road and multi-line string that
could be separate things or it could be
something like this driver how a river
would be with all its tributaries as a
single object as a multi-line string
polygon
into the building a multi polygon think
of a country with many many islands and
multi polygon with holes we've you've
seen a map of Switzerland you know that
there's little bits of Germany inside
Swiss and little bits of Swiss ins push
off its wits inside Germany but it's
definitely not it's a little bit
complicated so overall we've got many
different these different types there's
seven basic types they're linear ring is
just a component of a polygon is either
the outer ring or what holes inside they
also defined something called a geometry
collection which I'm not going to talk
much about it's just weird and doesn't
behave like anything else and it's
definitely way beyond not having
generics the sort of things the library
includes is operations on these
computing bounding boxes convex hulls
and etc etc the geospatial stuff there's
a few different dimensions here's this
problem so people might have this so
needs to be generic useful library so
people are gonna have different types of
data 2d 3d 2d with a measure and
measures typically time
think of your unning track for example a
running track log we've got someone's
positional evolving over time maybe 3d
with time which would be so next time
you jump on a plane and fly you take
your GPS record your flight to Berlin or
something you're evolving in 3d over
time you might want to add it's very
convenient to be able to add extra per
per coordinate numerical data in the
case of running track log it might be or
your heart rate for example on top of
that for efficiency reasons people might
want to use different types as that
particular coordinate float64 FC covers
most things but maybe you wanna use that
float32 s4 for efficiency or safe space
requirements or you might want to use
intz if you're using this in say a game
world where you've got much more control
over the coordinate system so this is
our first dimension of the problem is
the different type we need to cover
different coordinate types and if we had
generics with this would definitely be a
template parameter combining two we've
got this four six seven different driver
two types we've got a different
dimensionality
like to D 340 are different types of
class of actual ordinates it gives us
multiple combinations and this is really
where it would be nice if we didn't have
to write 72 bits of code or code to
avoid this of course my first attack was
cogeneration this is what it looks like
at the point if I abandoned it this is
just doing points with either 2d 2d with
a measure 3d and 3d with a measure this
is goes text template library before my
thing is a little bit weird because I
wanted the output to be valid go from 2
code that's why you're so multiple
things on on line here this quickly gets
becomes very very painful particular
problem it's not particularly flexible
this is only adding one dimension to
those three dimensions of the problem I
have this is only coping with limits of
type system this is still fixed on flow
64 that's not a parameter of course you
can't extend it but it just gets worse
it's hard to read it's hard to write
it's hard to modify this code this is
the implementation for points if I'm
doing it the line strings and polygons I
duplicate this code six times and
whenever you come up with a better way
of doing it you've got to modify it in
six different places it just doesn't
scale so not fun so having a person -
this is the crux of the talk really so
trying to do this without using code
generation and actually the zero code
generation till about a few weeks ago
where I found a very cool library the
three different approaches I took to
work around lack of jarek's simplifying
the problem moving type information
compile time to run time to be this and
then exploiting common structure in the
in the nature the Proverbs the library
I'm solving and I do use a little bit a
limited generation I'll talk about so
firstly simplify the problem I mean this
is kind of it's silly to just say I'm
just going to support float64 but if you
cut off one dimension it really helps
and when you're developing software a
lot of develop
the problem comes from having complex
software if you if you can make your
problem simpler you can massively reduce
the development time just massive make
it massively easier so executive
decision I'm just going to float 64's
it'll be okay
the second aspect is moving type
information from compile time to run
time so particularly for the particular
ordinates where you have multiple number
of dimensions
instead of having this a parameter
that's checked at compile time I now
represent coordinates as a variable
length slice this is not exactly the
code that's in the library the reasons
were going to later but it gives you a
rough idea of what's going on a point
now it has an accordionist only length
is only known at runtime a layout which
tells you which elements of the array
correspond to which dimension that's
right in a moment the implementation of
layout we then have to do runtime checks
to let's interrogate with that a point
does this have a set index you can see
the simple switch here based on given a
layout it'll tell me where to find the z
coordinate if this particular coordinate
has has one the stride is so that we can
pack in those extra numerical dimensions
like the heart rates might example that
I talked about
now you can pack it into that same array
and by having stride that's longer the
number of dimensions you need just your
layout you get your extra data in there
well this does what it means it changes
the way the code looks the now instead
of getting the compiler to catch think
when things are mismatched we have to
actually check for errors ourselves at
runtime the top level code is still
reasonably nice but you see these are
all now runtime parameters these sort of
errors that you get here is if I don't
supply an a sufficiently large enough
array if I want an XYZ and I've only
give it two elements or if I get there
only four elements then there's going to
be a runtime error which of course you
need to handle
but this on its this this approach was
helpful
the final one it perhaps were fishing
one is exploiting common structuring the
problem if think back to the different
types that we have I just go back to the
slide what you can observe a point is
just a single coordinate line strings
and multi points both have an array of
accordance or multiple coordinates you
take a polygon in a multi-line string or
are the better of polygon with holes and
a multi-line string in this particular
picture the polygon with holes has got
one ring defining outside which is a set
of coordinates and actually ordered set
of coordinates and a hole which another
what is set and this is the same as the
multi-line string which also has two
sets of corners and so on and so on so
taking half a step back and thinking
what we've actually got here we see that
there is commonality in the in the
different structures themselves how they
what they're how the date is represented
underneath you can see their point a
single coordinate lines like strings
nearing success an array of coordinates
and so on with different nesting depth
so the approach then is to reduce this
from having to write the code seven
times having to write the code four
times kind of is to in then implement
this common code in privates trucks
which are internal to the package and
then we the exported types embed these
privates trucks which have methods
implemented on them and with a little
bit of wrapping week actually get a
reasonably usable API what does this
actually look like this is I'll go
through step by step so the top-level
coordinate contains a single
n-dimensional point this has the layout
in the stride from before flat cords I
explained a moment but for a single
coordinate it's just the values of that
particular coordinate then where are
actual we are Aleph exported type just
anonymously embeds that particular
structure John one which is this one
level depth we use the line strings and
multi points actually doesn't need much
more than what's in John zero but now
instead of having just one coordinate
embedded in our flat coordinates array
we have them sequentially one after the
other in the flat coordinates array
every stride elements we can work out
how many elements we've got because we
know the overall length of the slice we
divide that by the stride that gives us
our number of points in our multi point
or our line string for the next level up
multi-line strings here we use the same
we embed all the coordinates into the
single flat array that has some
advantages but now we need to know which
set of coordinates or range of
coordinates within that array correspond
to which particular line string and so
we maintain an extra ends slice which
tells us the end of each the index at
the end of each each line or each
component this embedding into flat cord
stuff has a couple of nice effects it
means that we can write some code that
operates on John's zeros I'll give an
example of that a moment and then we get
this code also used for the other
geometry types it has nice performance
effects by embedding it into a single
linear array C is very cash friendly
CPUs are really good at just churning
through data when it's already in the
cache lines ready to load if you use
nested arrays even though it's often
easier to write the code these the
actual memory used ends up scattered
over over your memory you might get page
faults
that's not necessarily in cache and in
some benchmarking I found that by lining
up every start everything out linearly
in memory I've got about a 30% speed
boost from that which is quite
significant when you're dealing with
large geometries and it was nice because
even though go is not the fastest
language around it gave it a good
performance good usable performance
what did this funny look like so three
different examples here firstly
computing the bounds I haven't given a
code intention because basically if your
account computing the bounding box of
any particular geometric object the
actual structure the object doesn't
matter at all you just care what the
points are so you could just iterate
over all your coordinates compute the
minimum maximum in each dimension and
you get the round so this single
implementation of bounds now works for
all seven geometry types all and no
matter how many dimensions there are in
the coordinate type in the ordinate time
this doesn't quite work all the ways
particularly it comes to return values
so this example of set chords and line
string which replaces the coordinates
set in an existing line stream we need
to return a line string type from this
this is useful for what you just thought
you want to keep track the types is
useful for method chaining but if we
write this method on GMT on one which is
our sort of underlying data structure
for things which have arrays of
coordinates we cannot return a G on one
and just then use it as a line string
elsewhere so we have to write an extra
wrapper function which calls the
embedded set cause which is the common
code and does the type of e return stuff
of the correct type that works I assume
and massively reduces the amount of code
I had to write now I've got actually it
turns out for core John types supporting
seven different publicly exported types
the final one which I'll talk very
quickly about just very briefly about
it's not my project but it's very cool
this is the only bit of cogeneration I'm
now using it's a project called go
derive and open fully person
next-generation code cogenitor go
the
what this does is affect yet analyzes
your go code ahead of time sorry
offline generates common methods which
are either annoying or difficult to get
right for you the way you use it is
actually very it's very straightforward
this is my deep copy method which I want
every every type to support all I write
is I return derive clone line string
what matters here is go derive will pick
out this derive clone section you know
hey okay I need to build a a clone
method for this it does it works out the
types and then it generates the actual
save clone method from this this is
actually goes a little bit recursive
there's the code with deep copy to which
is all auto generated code this it has
full structural analysis so that this
just works I found it to be much less
painful to use and writing these
repeating these methods myself now it's
one line rather than multiple lines and
of course it's much or much less
error-prone for example here the
generator code includes a proper nil
checking it it just works so I'm using
go derived could then cover these basic
examples and that's it basically
so surviving that generics the three
approaches I think simplifying my
requirements to just eliminate one of
the combinations of the causes
complexity we can compile time checks to
run time yes this is a little bit
painful but you know it works exporting
to stretch the problem to reduce the
code I had to write and a little just
cogeneration here and there that's it
