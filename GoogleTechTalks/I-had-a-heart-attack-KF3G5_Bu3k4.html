electrical engineer here at Google and
on September 9th I had a heart attack so
i just thought i would share the
experience and the stuff that i learned
so we'll start out with the symptoms
which is quite freaky because i didn't
have my chest on fire or anything like
that i went i came to work regular
Tuesday after that had a bike ride with
my friend Dave actually quite a long
ride more than an hour for sure and came
home feeling kind of like made me the
beginning of a cold which turned into a
little bit of a chest tightness and
shortness of breath i also had hurt my
finger in the lab that earlier in the
day so i was having pain in my left arm
but i thought it was because of my left
thumb so my wife took one look at me and
said Nina he don't look very good let's
go to the hospital and I said no and he
goes well what are your symptoms and I
say well tightness shortness of breath
and my left arm is uh yeah that doesn't
sound get this so she called my dad
which is the cardiologist and he said
you know get in the car now so so this
is like a good first point because it's
the the symptoms can be very deceiving
and they say when you have a heart
attack that first hour is like the
golden hour because if you can fix it
before a whole bunch of damage occurs
then there's not you know it's not a
huge problem but if you wait or in a
inaccessible place and whatever then
things can get pretty hairy so I went to
the goods good samaritan hospital in los
gatos excellent hospital my wife dropped
me at the emergency
in said I'm going to go park the car by
the time she came back I was already in
the gurney they already had done an
electrocardiogram they already knew I
was having a heart attack so the
response was phenomenal so I'm not going
to do an explanation on EKG because that
would take probably several hours and
it's it's a a complicated exam to
understand but where we can would the
one thing I want to communicate is that
the EKG has these paths electrical paths
so eat in EKG will have 12 blocks of
information which are different paths
through the heart and depending on the
one block that looks bad the doctor can
determine which area of the heart is
suffering in my case was the v3 which
was the bottom part of the left
ventricle so the doctor knew that was a
problem there so most of this
presentation is going to be going
through the films that the doctor gave
me for the procedure the actual
procedure of unblocking the heart and
putting the stamp but I think you you
know just to have a point of reference
is going to be good to go through a
couple basic concepts that you know at
least for me was forgotten from high
school days and everything so forget
about the blue part just look at the red
part because I was having a problem on
the left ventricle the heart has four
valves and there's two here that are on
the on the red circuit and you have the
mitral valve and the aortic valve so
from the previous beating blood fills in
the two chambers then the atrium
contracts increasing the pressure on the
left ventricle once you have the left
ventricle nicely filled the mic
valve closes the aortic valve opens and
then the left ventricle contracts so why
was I having shortness of breath the
shortness of breath happens because when
cells are dying the dying cells can
initiate a beat each cell in the heart
is capable of contraction and after the
contraction there is a period of time
out like what they call a rest time and
then there's a window where if you're
excited you will be it will you will
contract so if some bad cells are
initiating a beat at the wrong time then
you have a contraction of the left
ventricle that occurs while it's not
completely filled up so you have like a
week beat going on and then the next
beat will have more time for it to fill
up so he's going to fill up a lot so
it's going to be hard for it to to push
and since it already has some cells was
damaged it starts beating irregularly
and and then back blood starts backing
up at the lung so this is like a weird
sensation because I could not take deep
breaths that could only do like short
fast breaths so on because the area was
the bottom of the left ventricle that
was having problems chances were that
the problem was on the left anterior
descending also called the la d so the
left coronary that starts off right at
the top there branches off into into the
circumflex in the left anterior and then
that branches the circumflex branches
again into into a diagonal and then the
circumflex itself that has three or four
branches depending on the person i guess
it's important to kind of remember this
as a map because with the film
that's what's going to be showing right
and so here's another view of going over
a little bit to the right where you can
see more of the circumflex and and the
LED so let's start here so this is the
very first film that the doctor did so
at seven twenty was when I felt bad in
and went over to the hospital and this
is happening at 953 so two and a half
hours later I was already getting some
some good attention so what these films
are going to show are the following the
doctor is going to put the catheter
right where the arrow left coronary
artery is and he's going to throw some
dye which is this liquid iodine base
that shows up on x-ray and he wants to
see that map there so if there's parts
of it Missy that's what the problem is
so you got to have an educated I in
order to be able to see this stuff so
over here he's seen the diagonal and the
circumflex and there's no LED this is
not the best angle so he lets go to the
next one
this is also a not-so-good angle so I'm
just going to flip through all of them
and so on this one here you can see that
there's a huge part they're missing
which yes so this branch here right
there is the the circumflex in the
diagonal artery the the LED should start
a little bit lower than where the the
catheter is yes
so we should be seeing something like
like coming down here so actually what
do I do this let me go to a number ten I
believe let's see what number ten shows
us and then I'll come back so he the
doctor is trying to find where the LED
is so he's another picture she forget a
little better and so the catheter is a
piece of plastic tubing that gets
inserted in the crotch and by using a
guide which is sort of a guitar string
that has a hook at the end the doctor by
pushing and pulling and twisting and
since he knows the map he knows how to
get there so once there he uses the
guide to look for the missing artery so
in this case here we see the tip of the
cauda the guide here and we can see that
he found he found the VLA d so the the
first pictures are all trying to take a
look around so let's let's go real quick
through them because the doctor also
wants to see if there is other things
that are wrong so here's a good picture
of the circumflex and there is a problem
I'm use the mouse there's a problem
right here the last branch of the
circumflex has an obstruction here of
about ninety percent now this is not the
time to fix that one the doctor will
determine what has a hundred percent
blockage in this causing damage fix that
wait typically three to four weeks to
get that area to heal nicely and then
schedule another procedure to take care
of whatever else is wrong that he can
see there
let's see what we can see on this one so
on this picture we can see better how
how there's very little flow from the
circumflex the last branch here well
there's still some so nothing is dying
but you know this is definitely
something that needs to be fixed
another picture of the same now on these
takes obviously we can see the the
problem with the circumflex but what
he's doing is he's using the guide and
in looking for the LED he wants to get
the guide inside the LED scott number
nine now this picture is great because
the LED should come out and we're going
to see after he unblocks it should come
out here so this whole area here is not
getting any love whatsoever at this
point so on number ten again you can we
can see that the guide is now inside the
LED so this is another interesting
picture so now that the guide is inside
the LED and you can see the two markers
there what is going to try to do is to
open up the obstruction by using a
balloon that's smaller it's two
millimeter diameter smaller than what
the final stamp which is three
millimeter will be just kind of feel it
first also to determine what is the
location so of the obstruction so if he
inflates in one area then he can see
what the effect is and if that doesn't
do the trick or it does partially then
he moves a little further down and then
do it again and that way he can
determine that's how you determine where
the obstruction is so here he's
inflating the balloon on take number 12
now on this take now we can see that the
LED is beginning to show but it's still
pretty weak so now he moves down the
balloon a little bit and inflates it
again
and now it's looking a lot better
so this is a interesting while i was on
emergency you know the nurse kept asking
me okay what's your pain level from one
to ten and i said not really feeling any
pain i'm kind of hot like a a discomfort
right sort of like a tightening
tightening sensation is the he goes well
you know what it is it is it zero I said
no it's not zero maybe it's a 10 k
morphine and as a please no more
morphine I want to kind of be awakened
and be able to see the doctor doing this
stuff and anyways I was not very I was
not myself when I when this was
happening I so I can see
so the the stance that they put in the
two stance that out the replaced they
were three centimeters so one inch is
2.5 for all right so it's a little over
an inch in length and 3 millimeter in
diameter so over here he is rotating
just to make sure that he's got a nice
angle see what 18 shows no change there
so I'm not positive about this but I
think that is the case after the doctor
puts the balloon and up until nineteen
ninety something that's all the day they
did right they would go in try to spread
the plaque around the vessel and there
you go a lot of times that plaque kind
of has a memory and then comes back and
obstructs again in this case it happened
really quickly I mean on the previous
film it it got blocked again just a few
minutes later so now he would we see
here between let me stop this between
this point and this point is where the
stent is going to go the stance maybe I
should talk a little bit about stance
but let me just finish this so here's
the the balloon with a stent be inflated
I want to take number 20
and here's take 21 and let's say 22 that
there you go this is the end of the
first procedure you can see that he
makes a sort of a an angle here where
the end of the stent is but the statute
is going from here to here so see here
so the idea of the stance and the the
picture up on top is the old-style stand
basically you get a metal tubing of the
diameter that you want its final
position to be in with a laser or some
other method you H out the holes then
you compress that into the catheter and
with a balloon inside the stance are
getting very high-tech this is like a
mechanical marvel the standard they were
put in me was the cipher which is this
guy here and I even have a little
animation on on when you inflate the
balloon what happens to the stand so it
goes in compressed like that and it's
put in place and and then it opens up
and that's how it works
see what else i have here
yes right yeah she did have to sign it I
was conscientious when I came in so I
don't believe I had to sign anything
myself though I think she did sign
everything but
so so this is it the as far as the first
procedure this happened on a Tuesday
night so by friday afternoon i was sent
home and I was having as the heart scars
in other words the cells that had
damaged the doctor estimated it off my
left ventricle he had a six to eight
percent damage and that and you can
determine that by by several things one
of which is the amount of enzymes that
the dying cells put out and they can
pick up pick that up in the blood so the
the idea then was to send me home don't
do anything just be you know very quiet
and and then and I after four days I
could start walking and the plan was to
wait three weeks come back to do the
circumflex to do that that guy there
that that's a ninety percent so Tuesday
one exactly a week later and I was bored
out of my mind and my dad is a
cardiologist and it was here so I said
you know that let's go to the mall or
something right let's walk around a
little bit and and I walked a at
valleyfair from one end to the other and
by the time I got to the other end I was
not feeling well at all I was having
sort of the same tightness shortness of
breath again told that to my dad he ran
over to pick up the car and I walked to
the street to have him picked me up and
by the time I walked from the mall just
like I don't know 30 yards the street I
was looking for a place to land and that
was a chair there so I'll let it on the
chair and my dad picked me up and I said
yeah let's go right back to the hospital
sorry
so they what happened there was I was
taking a drug called metropole wall
which is a drug that it's called a beta
blocker and has the effect of slowing
down to heart reducing your blood
pressure and so you can faint I guess
and and and not have the blood being
pumped up so they do to another
electrocardiogram and everything and I
said you know everything looks good it's
not really a problem but since you're
here why don't we do the other one right
now so I said sure and I kind of I
actually wanted to just get it over with
right so let's go so you give me a
minute here
we'll go for the second one the second
one is actually very interesting because
I think I have to do this
okay there we go I agree
so from the from the first film we see
that that ninety percent obstruction is
right at a junction and actually the the
middle branch is actually bigger than
the smaller last branch so there's
something called the snowplow effect
which is you know if you unobstructed a
plaque over you may block see if we can
see this so what we don't want is
putting a stint here and then blocking
up this guy that's healthy and there's a
very high risk we can nice picture of
the of the stand that was put a week
before over here so he's going to have
to do a pretty nifty trick in order to
to prevent that from happening and the
trick is is going to put one guide going
this way one guide going this way is
going to inflate a balloon here and then
inflate the stand with a balloon here so
this is actually two and we're going to
be able to see this in a second here
let's see no it's two guides so the
guide is a like I said a guitar string
the interesting thing about see here
let me go to the next one so here's the
first guide so the guide is a guitar
string no imagine a guitar string guitar
string has a solid core in a wound part
outside if you make the solid core
smaller slightly smaller than the wound
and then you solder the tips you're
going to cause a hook that you can
actually shape and the doctor has a
pallet of different shaped tips in in
his disposal right so over here you can
see the they also coat the the tip of
the guide with these cobalt thing
whatever so he gets a little bit darker
so you can see where the tip is so the
tip of the first guide is over here
that's the one that we want to do
obstruct and here's the the tip of the
second guide and that's the one that we
want to make sure that stays open so let
me play that again
where
so I have
14 is going to be let's see so I guess I
guess you guys can't see right so at
first again he's using a smaller balloon
just to get things going make sure that
nothing explodes I guess on on the area
that has a problem and then make sure
that it does the trick and it looks
better but I don't know if it looks
perfect it looks better and you can also
see the little cobalt markers where you
know the balloon is going to go from
here to there and then the another one
from there to there
okay I I think this is that I don't know
if it's possible to see one is repeating
but there are two balloons one on the
middle one and one on the last branch
okay here here's the yeah when you when
you use the balloon but it's just for a
few seconds so it's certainly no problem
to stop the blood flow for a few seconds
so on this one you can clearly see right
you can see where he placed a tiny
balloon here on the one that he doesn't
want blocked and here is the stent being
placed so this is actually the stent
being placed yes you have to because you
have a balloon on one in a balloon with
the stand on the other one a guide is
what they call it and then here is just
going to be some more pictures to make
sure that everything is nice so here it
is with the stamp looks really good and
here's my led with a standard goes from
here to there the LED is going on the
other side right now the foreground is
on the the circumflex and the LED is the
other side but you can see the the sharp
turn here is where the end of the stent
is and then this guy here is going about
from here to about there so
let's see the conclusions on this yes
yes the coronaries are the arteries that
provide blood to the heart muscle and
for some reason they have this tendency
of getting blocked up really be great if
you've got blocked up in a finger or the
leg or something and you know
unfortunately is in there so well I mean
brain is done another one right stroke
so my first question was you know why me
I exercise I'm a little chub you but I'm
not dad overweight and I don't smoke and
I don't do drugs so I not diabetic so
and I don't have high blood pressure
either so all that i have is high
cholesterol and family history so my
grandfather from my mother's side died
at 59-49 and i would have died probably
if I didn't have this procedure that I
just showed done so the answer then is
definitely jeans and my diet was not
perfect so this little scare sir there
to fix my diet actually real good so now
it's like salad and fish and chicken
things that I could have done
differently it's maybe have a little bit
less stress and be a little lighter in
weight but other than that I don't know
what else and I probably would have had
something eventually I'm taking two
kinds of drugs actually three if you
count aspirin but I know I take an
aspirin a day that's going to be for the
rest of my life I'm taking plavix which
is a
blood thinner so when Stan's started
being put in in the early 90s there was
incidence of restenosis which is the
reblocking reblocking exactly where you
put the stand of about depending on
which study on who you ask between 25
and 35 percent so that's a pretty high
percentage of failure and the problem
with that was that when you have a heart
attack on most cases is you have some
time because you have an obstruction
that kind of progresses to you know like
a ninety percent to ninety-five percent
and then you start getting some some
some symptoms so you have time to act
when a stent goes through the restenosis
or reblocking usually it's fatal so it
was a bad bad odds a little bit on the
beginning of the stent age so this stint
that was splitting on on these two
procedures is called a drug-eluting
stent and what what that means is that
the the stent is made out of steel 316
steel but then they coat it with a
anticoagulant that gets released at a
course of six months and during six
months the tissue of the artery will
grow over the stand and then greatly
reduce the risk so my biggest risk is in
the next four or five months and that's
why I take plavix plavix use a blood
thinner it makes it I got to be very
careful not get cut I mean I cut one
time shaving on a friday on on Monday I
was still bleeding so it's a tough deal
there but I'll get off that soon enough
so it's not forever and then the other
drug that I'm taking is simvastatin
which is a statin and a statin is a drug
that is
very recommended for people that have
high cholesterol because it prevents the
body from making cholesterol so in a
case like mine where my cholesterol was
about 275 even if I had a diet of a
hundred percent lettuce you know the
body would still make a bunch of
cholesterol and my cholesterol will
probably go to a reasonable level but it
would be incredibly difficult to control
my cholesterol level just by diet so
with the Staten we're hoping that is
going to go from 275 my doctor wants it
to be below 150 so and another thing
that I'm going to have to be differently
is exercising no more of the super
strenuous bike rides i was doing
sometimes Dave and I were going on
weekends and doing like three our rides
on places like heart-attack hill and I
don't think I I'm going to be doing that
anymore unfortunately because that was
fun I am supposed now to control my
heart rate when I exercise and never let
it go above 128 130 this is a good thing
to this rule of thumb is you get to 20
minus your age that's your one hundred
percent level and then if you're above
50 you shouldn't go above seventy
percent level so seventy percent of that
is around 128 so now I have one of those
polar things and when I'm exercising and
making sure that I'm not going over that
amount this is pretty much it questions
did I feel anything before this happened
well I did know that because of my
grandfather died at somewhat early age
that I need to keep a tab on it so every
two or three years I do an
electrocardiogram and I've been
measuring my cholesterol my dad has been
giving me a really hard time because of
course it's not happy of me having a 275
level he wanted me to start statins
about two years ago and i said i'll try
to get my diet better i don't want to be
taking pills yet but heart attacks is
one of those things where one minute
you're good next minute you're not so
the nice thing or the next or the
positive of this is that in about five
or six months I'm hoping to be actually
better in better health than I was
before
yes the aspirin every day is is for
blood cleaning purposes in addition to
the plavix yeah I'm taking both because
they want a real thin right now to not
have the blockage so just to finish off
on what I was saying on on on the drug
eluting stent the drug eluting stent
caused that 35 twenty-five to
thirty-five percent of failure go down
to about seven to eight percent and and
what my dad told me is that if I am
absolutely religious about not ever
missing apply fix so I have to take that
everyday my risk is really around two
percent so that's what I'm hoping that's
true right so it got multiply those
those percentages in fact you find me
thank you um a constant a question first
i'd like to point out that nearly thirty
percent of all heart attacks or silent
heart attacks meaning that the only
symptom that you ever get is they take
an EKG and they say oh you've had a
heart attack at some point in the past
so I'm an example of one of those but
the question was you mentioned the
golden hour and the fact that you had
six to eight percent damage does that
mean the golden hour wasn't long enough
for you or that you didn't make it in
time no I mean with what that means is
that you if that procedure was done five
hours later I would have had a lot more
damage Annie food was done actually one
hour earlier i'll probably have no
damage at all so the amount of damage is
proportional to the amount of time that
you have your cells not getting any any
blood so that is why it's so important
to if you have the symptoms to go and
get an EKG
but can you yeah we were I think what's
really kind of interesting here is that
when Cairo and I riding on that day that
he had his heart attack now I didn't
know about it because I'd already left
his house when he called me later i
guess the next day and said hey I had a
heart attack I'm going holy crap but
what the interesting sign for Kyle was
the fact that he complained about being
tired now we've been riding a lot for
about I guess six months or maybe longer
probably a couple times a week and so I
got to know pretty well he was
constantly the whole ride and start I'm
tired I don't feel good so we actually
turned around early which is kind of
thankful because usually as grant knows
we're over there what's that air he
called over there saratoga gap and you
can get pretty far out and saratoga gap
so it's ironic that at least this time
because he was you know really tired I'd
have to say definitely more tired than
usual the sukkah part is he still beat
me back which is kind of odd but you
would think I'd get an advantage there
but so it seems it was the precursor at
least in his case is the fact that
fatigue I mean more so than what you'd
normally measure so I guess if my
barometer moving forward is if I'm ever
feeling that tired I'll definitely keep
an eye on myself that's for sure well i
mean i hope i have given you a good
perspective uh i don't want to freak
everybody out although tomorrow is
Halloween so i guess i'm entitled to so
do they have anything to basically drugs
to eat a white Clark I'm sorry to have
drugs to eat away plaque is the answer
is no but are they working on it no I'm
not aware of that TPA is example of one
but I think one thing that happens with
those sometimes they'll dissolve pieces
of the plaque which will didn't get
loose and just go plug something else up
but in particular they can cause a
stroke if they go up into a murder in
your brain and so they usually don't
like to use drugs like that unless you
know there's no alternative
yes on the on this picture you can see
that you you restore the diameter of the
vessel the artery is kind of stretched
up and that's why the doctor uses a two
millimeter first and then a 32 kind of a
you know gently enlarge you know the
outside diameter of that vessel is
enlarged and of course with time as long
as doesn't it doesn't rupture when
you're doing it if you he ruptures while
you're doing it then I would have being
wheeled over to open heart surgery right
then it would have to do a bypass but as
long as that doesn't happen then you
know you will recover with time and so
but the but the plaque is still there
and it's it's it's it has pushed out oh
it's pushed out here yeah oh okay out
against the wall alright well thank you
very much we're happy that you're here
Kyle we're happy that you were here me
too</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
