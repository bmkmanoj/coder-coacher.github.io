going to have a talk today from the
folks from IntelliJ from jetbrains we've
got two two topics they want to talk
about the first one is a new product
called team server and that's going to
be given by Dimitri and then after he's
finished Mike's going to give us a talk
on the new features we can expect in in
IntelliJ IDEA this has been filmed and
it'll be put on the Internet so if you
have any confidential questions if you
could wait until the film film in has
been completed ok so thank you so first
of all it said Dimitri so good afternoon
ladies and gentlemen my name is mr.
Jenner off and I work in the st. Peter's
the office of jetbrains amen software
developer in the team that develops the
IntelliJ IDEA and the team server
products so okay so what I'm going to
tell about today is a our new product
called JetBrains teams team server well
in fact team server is not a final name
is just a preliminary name but and albus
is another code name so we are in lovin
of having many names for our products
well mi mind so the product is currently
in development it's planned to be
released in this summer so this
presentation is also one of the chances
to give us feedback on what what should
we include in the final race of the
product so let's get started so this is
an overview of my talk so first of all
I'll talk a bit about where where the
product came from why have you started
working on it and then I'll cover the
main feature areas of the product so the
areas so the areas are first of all is
this continuous integration support so
of course there are many existing
solutions for continuous integration but
it turns out that there are some things
that we can do a bit better a bit
smarter and the end result is the same
is improving the productivity
the team then I'll talk about the
server-side code analysis for java code
that we can do in IntelliJ IDEA and team
server it turns out that moving the code
analysis to server to the server can
give quite a lot of new possibilities
and to extend what we can do with a code
and finally I'll talk just a little bit
about the collaboration features that
are also provided as part of the team
server solution the collaboration
support is mainly is leave it leave
mostly leaves inside the ID itself so I
just talk a little bit about that and
finally just a few words about extending
the team server to specific build
environments like the one I guess as far
as I know that they'll build environment
that existing Google is quite different
from many other environments so if
Google decides to introduced it it will
need some customization it of course
it's all possible with our product so
first of all I guess many of you know
about our flagship product the main
product of our company they IntelliJ
IDEA and he started his life at simply
as a Java ID for individual developers
but of course real world that people
have to do in a project it involves much
more than simply typing Java code so we
extended our initially we extended our
support to other languages so we support
HTML CSS JavaScript well in the second
part of the talk Mike is going to tell
you about much more about that part and
more time I'm going to tell is the new
dimension in which our support extended
their support for team productivity and
the goal that we want to achieve is to
improve the team productivity as much as
we have already done for Java
development for individual persons and
in doing that we are following just a
number of basic principles so the first
one is don't work against people in
every team there is a set of established
practices decided by the team how people
work so people write unit tests or
or this some other kind of tests people
write comments when checking in code to
the version control system and so on but
in day to day in the day-to-day work of
a team it sometimes happens that people
break the practices and it doesn't
happen because people are evil or
because they want to subvert development
or anything just because they are human
and the goal of our project is to make
it as easy or as natural to follow the
rules as is to break them so we do we
don't just put barriers in the in front
of people so that they simply can't do
things the wrong way we just guide them
into doing things correctly and another
principle is dog food so it's a non
strength of our company that of the
power products work best when we are you
when we are using them ourselves and the
problems that our teams face are very
similar to the problems of other
development teams so if the solutions
work for us then they must be also good
for other people and the development of
team server was self hosted like from
the almost from the very beginning and
as soon as like the team server became
capable of building and running tests
remove the IntelliJ IDEA development to
eat and recently removed our another
product of our company there resharper
it also moved to the team sir and it's
interesting because unlike IntelliJ IDEA
resharper is Outen in.net so we support
net as well as well as Java so this
picture provides a bird's eye view on
the overall structure of the product so
in the center there is the main server
there central server which manages all
the work and all the stuff done in there
all the stuff done by the beautiful the
analysis procedures and so on so the
team server has a web interface
naturally which can be used to manage
the server to monitor to configure
things and it also integrand of course
eats into it integrates with the version
control system where the sources of the
product to be built are stored and
so on and what's interesting is the
agent part of things so the team server
does not do any actual bills or work by
itself instead it builds a queue over
the things that need to be done the
bills or analysis requests or things
like that and it manages a pool of
agents which are separate computers
which can richer have a specific
software installed to do the work and as
an agent becomes available it gets a new
request of work to do from the server
and performs the work and repose the
results the server so this allows the
system to be scalable as much as needed
so in the simplest case the agent can
run on the same computer as the bills at
the server machine so you can start with
just one pc and if you need to expand to
scale more than you simply add more
agents and they do the work and if you
are really resource-limited which i
guess google is not you can use
developer machines to as build asian so
they run builds when the developers are
not work on them and the last part is
the IDE integration so initially we
provided integration with IntelliJ IDEA
but later we get we are going to expand
this to eclipse and two other
development environments so now let's
look again at what we actually do so
there is the distributed build
environment with the central server
which and the agents and the server
coordinates the work on down on agents
and the server the this part of the
product is ID independence so if even if
you don't use an ID at all you can still
make make use of the server through the
web interface to review what's happening
with the bills to look at the results of
the build and so on so the server-side
code analysis is also it also can work
either with an ID or with the web
browser so the engine for the analysis
is intellij idea but you can view the
results in other environments as well
and finally the collaboration support
done in the which leaves in the ID it
allows you to exchange to see
exchange messages right within the ID
you can also send things to the source
code you can say you can exchange
changes by passing the version control
system and so on so i'll talk about in
more detail about this later so the
first major part of the product is
continuous integration spot ok so i
guess most of you already know what two
continuous integration is so just a
brief look and the article by martin
fowler can give you more information in
case you need so the continued is the
continuous equation is the process of
running it will script which is
triggered either by timer or by version
control chicken the script gets the
latest version of the code from the
version control system then it builds
the code runs the test and send the
report whether the tests have passed or
failed the benefits of that are are
simple so you always know the current
state of your project whether it's red
or green broken or not in case something
breaks you get to know about this
immediately so that you can investigate
the problem while you still remember the
context while you still remember why the
change was made and so it's easier to
debug while you still have things in
your head and you don't have the big
productivity loss which happens when
someone checks in broken code to the
version control system then all the
other team members get out get this
version of code it doesn't compile and
people just sit around waiting for
someone else to fix the code and not
able to do any work by themselves so the
continuous integration can catch these
situations much faster and get them
fixed so now let's have a brief brief
look at the web interface of the team
server so you can see that the remote
the build server the team server can
build multiple products and for every
project there are multiple build
configurations so for example different
test suits or one for release build and
not another for test and this screen
shows that one build over of the build
server project is called a roni what's
interesting about this
so first of all we keep a statistics on
how long fields are running and the week
so we can show like the progress bar the
estimate and the estimated completion
time of the build we also show the
notification the results of the build
immediately as it runs so the the
counter the best estar is it updated as
long as as the build it runs and if some
test fails then you immediately get its
immediately shown in the interface and
the artifacts link is the this link is
shown for the last successful build and
it a lot the artifacts are the specific
group the specific files that have been
built by the build process I the
installer of the product or something
like that and the server manages them as
well managed their storage and so on so
now let's see the details of a specific
build so this is like one bill that was
run sometime so what's interesting here
this shows that the build server is
capable of taking then statistics of
tests between builds so it not only
shows that one test has failed it also
shows that the test failed also
previously and the changes that broke
the test must be not the changed in this
build but some older ones so this shows
the specific time when the test started
to fail and this screen shows simply the
list of changes that meant when they
built nothing really interesting here so
the developer named the check-in comment
and the list of changed files oh cool
quite simple now what do we build so of
course we build our project says like
IntelliJ ID itself we build our net
projects and by writing 3rd party
plugins the build server can be extended
for building software with any other
build platforms so with so the Google's
build system can be supported as well so
for Dava we don't didn't invent any or
flag built engines or anything like that
we support what they want everything
what everyone else supports
so we so the build scripts themselves
can be written with ant or with maven
and if you don't have a build script but
simply have an project for your ID then
you can use it as well so you simply
point to a project or idea or netbeans
or eclipse and the server's picks it up
and generates a bill scrip from that so
for that net also I also nothing
interesting an anthem as built and
visual studio solutions and the build
server does not require any
sophisticated configuration so you
simply unpack the archive specify the
version control server CBS / 4 source
version specify where exactly in the
source control so that the bill script
is located and get the server run and if
one server doesn't handle the tests very
well then you can simply install
additional agents so what's interesting
about our builds what specific problems
with other tools do we solve so the
first problem is build administration's
anyone heard anything from our test
machine so in many cases there are there
are many bills too many kinds of bills
that in tiburon for in a single
environment so many maybe there are
multiple projects or multiple source
code branches for a single project or
different destitute and so on and of
course you can load them on a single
machine and it just you it can run the
bill sequentially but because there are
so many different things to do it all
takes a long time to to get the results
of any individual build and if you have
multiple machines then managing them
becomes a problem because the tradition
systems do not provide this a unified
interface for managing them so some
machines like and drop out of the system
and people will notice that so our bill
grid or the distributed build
environment provides a solution for that
because there is a central interface for
managing all the bills
so it allows to add more agents if
required this software of the agent is
updated automatically and so on so the
screenshot shows the administration
interface that should for the agents so
that the next problem is testing
granularity so with traditional systems
if the bills take a long time which they
usually do and test and the result is
that check-ins are more frequent than
builds and if there are multiple changes
in a single built then it's unclear
which of the changes broke the build so
with the team server because there are
multiple agents that can run the built
in parallel so every checking can start
a new instance of the build and all the
bills run on different machines in
parallel and the result of this is it's
it's a becomes very easy to see which of
the specific changes broke the build so
this one or that one or any other so the
next problem is that people do not
always run tests so it can happen for
different reasons maybe there is a
complicated environment setup needed for
the test maybe that has simply take long
to run a long time to run or maybe you
simply can't run all the tests suit on
your machine because they just need to
be run under different operating systems
and the end result of all this is simple
that people check in code without having
run the test first and the solution that
we suggest for that is the code remote
run so instead of running instead of
needing to run the test on your machine
you can use the server to run the test
for you so you send your changes to the
server the server manages the changes
with the version from the VCS then thus
the usual test run compiles and runs the
tests and send to you the report and
while all the process is going on you
can work on something else or
or anything else and your machine is not
busy running the test and a further
exacerbation of the problem is the
what's called five o'clock chicken so
you check in you go home and the bill
breaks and the your colleagues cannot
work because the code is broken and
while you are dining with your family we
get a phone call colleague why the
things are broken go fix them
immediately and it's you're displeased
with that naturally so the problem this
what's what we suggested a solution it's
called delay chicken the delayed chicken
is an extension of the remote run
feature so after the usual process of
build and test if the test feel it goes
the usual way you get the report and you
can fix you can fix the things like when
you can come to our next date and if
everything goes well the changes are
checked checked in automatically to the
version control system and because it's
known that the code comparison that
there's best then the your colleagues
can start using your code earlier than
if you had checked in your code like
next morning so now let me show you a
brief demo showing how it works in
practice so because the laptop laptop is
not really a good target environment for
the build server so I decided to record
the demo owner on our real live
production environment our real build
grid so it's recorded but should be more
interesting this way so before you start
using the tin server ID integration you
need to make sure that you are logged
into their team server so when you are
logged in the indicator in the status
bar can be used to view the state status
of the bill grid so all the bills that
are running the status of each of them
so there are all the projects that are
that are on our server the results of
the last successful bill for each of the
projects and you can also see the bills
that are currently running
so for each of the builder even for
those that are running you can view the
crown build log and you can view the
tests that have already been executed so
now suppose that I have written a new
unit test for my code and I want to use
the team server to run the test so first
of all I need to ensure that sorry I
need to select the change list where the
change is located so the change list
feature allows allow me allows me to
spray different sets of my change of
stoic I can work with work with each one
separately so now I press the remote Run
button ensure that the correct file set
of files will be sent to the server
write a comment describing my changes
and select the build configuration that
will be used to write to run the test
and these flags still that my changed
should be checked in automatically if
the tests pass so now I click the remote
run button and I get a notification
showing that the remote ron has indeed
started now I can switch to the web
interface of the team server and the
seed are now the change the changes have
been moved to a different change list
the witch will be committed
automatically if the if everything goes
well and I can switch to the web
interface to see the building progress
so here is the personal build icon here
is the estimated completion the
estimated completion time of the build
and these are the list of changes that
went into the build so you can see that
my changes were made to be the leaders
changed by some other developer
so looks like i don't have the latest
version i'm over here so after this so
unfortunately sorry for that i wouldn't
be able to show you the end result but
after the build is run I I will get a
notification I will be able to view the
list of tests and I will be able to see
that the test did indeed fail so let's
proceed to the next problem the next
problem identification spam so you
really expect me to read all the
notifications so the usual continuous
education environment generates a lot of
a lot of verbose notification for each
build and so you can see that
notification can take an entire megabyte
and of course it is hard to extract the
useful information from scientific ation
and as a result people people simply
stop reading identification and they
learn learn about bill failure not from
the front not from them but from a
manager who comes in yelling at them at
why aren't you fixing the build so we
have a better way to notify about this
so first of all there is a separation
between stages and notifications so
unlike some other environments we
probably always provide a clean
information about the status of the
build so you have the indicator in your
ID showing that the current status and
you get notifications less frequently
than with our other environments so you
get you are notified only when a bill
fails only when the build contains your
changes and if no one is currently
responsible for fixing the build the
responsibility is the topic that I'll
cover a bit later another advantage of
our notifications is that they are sent
earlier as soon as the painting test has
been detected so you can start fixing
the bills the while you have fixing one
test as soon as you find out that it
failed while some other tests are still
lining on the build server
and the diffusion are simpler so instead
of an email you have an indicator and
you can also get notifications by jabber
and if you need to get more details then
there is a very nice web interface that
you can use to investigate the complete
details for the build or you can use the
IDE integration which is even simpler to
use wait so sorry so now to the
responsibility issue so it's a common
situation that that some developer that
a number of developers fixed checked in
some changes and the build started to
fail and no one is working to fix on
that but because of course it's not the
guys fault and everyone points fingers
at each other and no fixing actually
happens so how do we solve that we
provide the the interface provides a
feature called take responsibility so
you can explicitly mark that I take
responsibility for the deal fail I am
currently investigating it and it is
shown to all other developers and so
they can it's easy to see whether
someone is working on the bill or the
bill broke but no one no one has looked
at that and looked at it and failure
with no one responsibility of course a
much more severe situation and if you
check in your change then the bill
starts best then well there's John
Oliver responsible it's the flag is
cleared from you so if the bill starts
to fail and if it's clear that it's you
who needs to investigate then you need
to find a find out what exactly failed
and why and it can be difficult because
the the notification a tip are typically
received in another application which
doesn't have to do any specific features
with that so you just get along stack
trace and just a long message in someone
in the message there is a stack trace
and there are no links to the source
code and even fighting the stack trace
can be a problem in it in a megabyte
long message
so what is just instead is to is the ID
integration so the IDE can show you the
results of tests that will run on the
build server exactly in the same way as
if you have run them locally so you have
direct links to the source code of the
fail location and if you can't figure
out why the test failed by looking at
the stack trace then you can rerun the
test locally under a debugger and get
all the information that you need to
investigate so to summarize what our
continuous build continuous integration
solution provides so the distributed
build environment allows you to get
faster and more specific notifications
for the fast faster more specific
detection of incorrect changes so the
remote test run and the delay check-ins
help you keep the version control system
code clean and if you do need to
investigate the failure you get a
cleaner interface for that and the
cleaner interface that lets you lets you
find out about the failure so the next
part of their functionality is the
server side code analysis so it's a the
analysis that we have in IntelliJ IDEA
right now is a one of the stronger
points of the ETA e IDE and probably the
most highly used feature of IntelliJ
IDEA is good inspections good
inspections are static code analysis
that are run in the background while you
are editing a source code file so you
can immediately get an tification for
example for method can be static or
private method is not used and things
like that and the results are showing
two are highlighted directly in the
editor and for many of the problems we
can offer quick fixes so that you can
fix the problem with just one you press
alt enter and the problem is gone but of
course that is not the limit of our code
analysis features we have much more than
that we have for example very powerful
projects wide code analysis so you for
example it can allow you to detect
public methods that are not used
anywhere or for example if some method
an argument that always receives the
same value we can detect that as well
and there are many different analysis
and more moreover them even more than
that with support dublicate good search
in the entire project so there if there
are two methods which have very similar
fragments of code we can detect that and
you can replace merge the methods into a
single method there is also code
coverage support and there are diff
there are different other analysis tools
from third parties that can be
integrated with the build process but
all of this is great but very few people
use all the used advanced nicest
features and there is a very good reason
for that because the additional analysis
requires you to break your workflow so
you need instead of getting the results
right as you are writing code you need
to have a fault to specially think of
aha I need to run the duplicates
analysis you need to allocate some time
for that because the analysis is quite
time consuming it will use much of your
machines resources and so on and for
many of the analysis the report you will
get is a disconnected from the code so
you just get a bunch of HTML files file
somewhere and you need to find out
what's written in them and how it's
related to the code you are editing and
many of those limitations can be avoided
by using their server side analysis so
first of all the analysis is to get
automatically so either by chickens or
by timer in the same way as a deals are
triggered the analysis runs on the
server and does not use any time of your
development environment and it's there's
the results for the analysis are also
collected on the server and as you open
some file for editing the ID requests
the latest analysis results for that
file and displays them right in the
editor where you are editing the code
and even if the file was modified after
the NSS was run there is also our
adjusted so you still get useful
information and useful you can use that
for
to fix the problems so as a result just
the feature that you have right at your
hands become much more powerful because
they are augmented by the agent agent
support so finally a little bit about
our collaboration support so there are
many situations when so of course
talking by words is a very efficient way
of to communicate it's the way that I'm
using right now so it's multi not too
bad but there are some situations when
the communication involves code and
right now such ways to communicate are
not at the top efficiency for example
can you explain what the code is at foo
Java the line 230 is about and the other
person is trying to struggle down what
file what line sorry could you say that
again please and it's just not very
efficient so there are like other
utterances commonly shared in
development rooms instead of that we
just do instead of that we provide a
collaboration solution to great directly
in the development environment so you of
course you can use simple messages and
even even he'll get an advantage because
you do not have to grab the list of
contacts that you need to talk to
because all the project participants are
automatically added to the contact list
and because we are using a standard
protocol the jabber protocol you can use
google talk to communicate with with
people so that you can use the ID talk
to communicate to people who use google
talk because it's the same protocol and
where this becomes interesting is the
features which are integrated with the
code so you can see send links to source
publications you can see send entire
stack traces that are all clickable and
navigatable and another plan feature
which is right now not implemented is a
what we call auto follow me navigation
so it's a
you can connect to another to some other
person which is like for code review so
and your ID will automatically show you
the same code that the other person is
looking at and you can review the code
together and the next interesting
feature is the possibility to exchange
code fragments to between different
people so we can see what I'm doing
right now is I'm viewing the difference
between some file at my computer and the
same file on the computer my colleague
so that Michael E granted me the right
to view the files that she's editing
right now and so I simply click click a
button to view the version that she
currently has an her machine which isn't
even even checked into the version
control and if I need to synchronize to
that version to test these changes or on
my machine or to help her make the help
her make some more changes then I can
synchronize to the version that she has
right now and again I don't need to use
the version control for that I don't
need to zip up the source code are given
email it to to myself and some like that
so as you can see the communication
which involves cloud and not simply
words it becomes more efficient by the
ID the ID integration features so
finally some words about extensibility
so the core extensibility scenarios that
we support are the following first of
all we can add other ways to notify
about build failures so the standard
ways our email and other and you may
want to add more for example
notifications by SMS or by some special
messenger that you have or anything like
that the next is more build runners so
this means the integration with other so
this means two things first this color
support for other build platforms like
make or s console whatever so you write
a runner that executes the required the
build engine and gets results gives the
result from the build engine in a form
that the sir can handle and send the
results to the server and I think
everything else is covered by the server
and the tekken second part of that is
the additional kinds of code analysis so
for example if you have developed it
developed a customized code metrics to
then you can integrate it into the team
server by writing and build runner that
runs the tool and gets results from the
two and the third main extensibility
point is support for additional version
control systems so I know that Google is
using perforce so it's probably not very
not interesting for you cube but it can
be useful for other people so let's
summarize so the team server is a
solution which can improve the team
productivity and it's not tied to any
particular it ide so even if you use not
IntelliJ IDEA but some other development
environment or even Emacs you can still
make use get benefits from the team
server installation so that continuous
integration that we provide the solves
many many problems that are present with
other continuous education tools on the
market the server-side code analysis
makes a great addition to the tools that
are already available in many ideas it's
very much empowers the the analysis
features because you get older you get
the you get the power of agent machines
to run the analysis for you and finally
the collaboration features help
communicate help communication between
team members when the communication will
involves much more than words when it
most code as well so the team server is
currently in IEP so you can download in
the early access preview so again you
can download the better version on this
of the software to play with it yourself
or you can access our public
installation of the team server which
currently runs bills for some open
source projects so we can see how it
works without needing to install
anything so if you have any questions
I'll be happy to answer them
sorry I've decided yet yeah
no I
yeah okay so the price of the team
server is not currently decided we are
still look the product is not released
so we still have the possibility to
change our mind yeah
mhm
yes for the current version we don't
provide any many other specific support
for code review so the question is
whether we have any support for code
review other than the auto follow me
navigation that was mentioned the answer
is that we will consider adding such
features in future versatile product as
we get to know the customer requirements
that
sorry well basically it's handled in the
same way when you so the question is how
change is made by other people while the
remote run build is running how do we
handle that in fact it's handled just in
the same way as the conflicts which can
happen when you check in code from the
ID so you can also sometimes you check
in code and you get notifications that
someone else has much has changed the
code and you need to merge so in the
case of delay chicken if someone else
has modified the code and is there is a
version control conflict and you simply
get report notifying you that the
chicken field because of the conflict
and when you come to work later you need
to merge with that no with automatic
merger the check-in goes through yes
right now it's worked that right now it
works this way that way
well mostly it so the question is what's
the difference between delayed check in
Ender's stage branches so basically it's
a different way of solving the same
problem so indeed it's possible to to
give an individual development branch
for for each of the developer developers
but we think that the late chicken
solution is more flexible because it's
valued it allows you to test different
sets of changes in parallel and you
don't need to do any version control set
up or something
so the check in itself is done by the
developer machine so it's so the
developer machine gets a signal from the
build server that the chicken is allowed
and performs the chicken automatically
so did yes
test
well the currently the each of the bills
is so the question is whether they delay
checking tests are our atomic yet so
what so if there are the the tests done
by each of the developers so the change
is done by each of the developers are
checked in independently so there is no
no check to ensure that they don't
conflict rather than the chip other than
the regular version control system
checks so there is no special provision
for automate or atomicity
so the question is a the butcher what is
the largest project that we currently
have running under the team server so
right now because the project in is in
the EAP we don't don't have any external
deployments of the team that we know of
in but the project that we have inside
our own company there are pretty large
suit intellij idea is about 30,000
classes and the world the number of
developers won't impress you much I
think but it's about 15 people i think
well can't wait on the project so any
more questions
right now we are starting work on on the
visual studio integration and it should
become available in a few months and
Eclipse and netbeans integration is
planned for like half a year time frame
like that so it will not be in the
initial release but they release after
the initial one so i guess i will pass
the my pig to Mike hi I'm Mike I hope
you are not tired yet because we are
going to talk about or really important
thing we are going to talk about
pleasure unfortunately not any kind of
pleasure but about a particular pleasure
you can have when developing Ajax
applications since Google is a web
company we think that this kind of
pleasure is very relevant for you when
we have started to talk about a JAX
application and IntelliJ IDEA we are
being asked it why intellij idea isn't
it a java ee d well it actually started
is a java ad but soon we realized that
developers don't you don't do jazz java
they do javascript HTML CSS xml and
every possible technology those around
and Ajax basically is just the set of
the same technologies like JavaScript
HTML CSS and probably some server side
code so when you have ID enhance and
you've got to do some magic development
you've got the jacks with pleasure since
development with ID is always plural
well what I'm basically going to do
today is to make a short crash course of
those little idea wonders we have for
HTML CSS and JavaScript so that you can
start using them either today or just
tell your friends to try it out so let's
start from HTML well first of all some
basic stuff for
years we have live templates life
templates which work for any language
this life templates do have expressions
which can be filled in there are
different functions you can use for
expressions which can be evaluated by
themselves you can have several
expressions connected so that when you
type in one place of code in other
places a place of code is automatically
modified like in this sample of entering
tag like you see this automatically
typed in to close it okay then we have
as always as in Java as an XML have a
code completion we know pretty much
everything about HTML that's why we can
complete tags we can complete their
attributes attribute well as we even
know about file references from you HTML
files like when you're doing an href we
know that href usually points to a file
or IMG tag points to an image so we can
give nice pretty completion so that you
are not lost in your site your typing
right reference you don't get a 40 50
here it is then you've since we know
that much we can spot your errors in the
code to we have highlighting for almost
everything you've got in your HTML our
goal is not to be as good as tidy but we
can spot lots of and lots of errors for
you you can spot wrong text neuron
context which is not allowed to put
black tag inside the P we can spare if
we can detect your own file references
so that you detect them before pushing
your code to a server side we even have
a quick fixes for all the servos like
you can instantly create a file if you
are sure that you need it so that you
can like do top-down development not
bottom up and we are pretty sure that
most part of their days developer
navigate around their code they are
looking for some specific place they are
finding what they
have to do and that's why we have put my
efforts make navigation around HTML as
pleasant as possible you can navigate to
files you can from your references you
can navigate even two images and have
them preview it in right in ID you can
navigate to end curves I can navigate to
pretty much everything if you don't want
to break your workflow by navigating to
another place you can quickly look up
what's going on in bed file or in that
image you're referencing right here
here's a quick look up of a true anchor
you can even have lookups in your
completion list so that when you are
inserting the reference to an image you
are not sure which image that should be
just hit one shortcut and you see it
instantly what will be shown here of
course we have find usages like in every
idea place I find usages for files
you're example from our life site which
is actually working on jetbrains com
which has thousands of pages and idea
finds all the places instantly like heat
out of seven you've got all the places
your file image or anchor is going to
use after you have found all the places
you can easily refactor them you can
rename your files and have all places
changed accordingly you can move your
files to different directories and have
all references correctly you can try to
save delete a file if the file is not
safe to delete since it's used somewhere
else idea will warn you that it has some
usages you probably don't want to delete
it right now if it doesn't have any
usage this idea will silently delete it
for you here is sample of usages after
files who named it just to make sure
that we are not lying like Reddit under
school and it was renamed everywhere
we're trying to delete a PDF file from
outside it doesn't matter what we are
deleting as soon as we have references
idea one are that we have four usages
you can preview them or ignore them or
just preview them
to make sure why that happened that was
just a quick look at HTML design HTML
coding features but hTML doesn't cause
us so much trouble as other parts of web
double of web development are I'm
talking about CSS CSS is quite a complex
stuff it looks like it's very simple but
when you are trying to dig into it we
find out that it has its own complicate
things well for those of you who don't
like to remember everything and to keep
all in your head we also have a code
completion it can complete pretty much
of everything you can complete tags you
can complete HTML properties you can
complete even colors as it was shown you
can complete even IDs as soon as if it
as soon as it as soon as you have used
energy in your CSS file we can manage
and complete it so that you don't type
run IDs in your CSS if you are going to
reuse them of course all this stuff
works in HTML sometimes we do have to
type in styles right into HTML tags and
we do have to use CSS classes and ID's
in your HTML code that's why all this
stuff is usually is completed here you
can complete IDs which can be sport
either from HTML from the same file or
all your website can be scanned and all
IDs and classes will be gathered from
your CSS files and you've got nice
pretty code completion of every possible
class already which can be applied to a
place of course we have our highlighting
we can't live without it we highlight as
well as warnings like unused selector we
can support that you are not using it
anywhere you can safely delete it we
also highlight syntax errors we
highlight run well as we highlight even
when you're over right in one property
with another one we just show you that
one
property is redundant and another is not
like you should just make your mind what
the margin should be 12 or 15 pixels
like so that you don't do many mistakes
and for many rules we have like quick
fixes and besides click vehicles they
have like convenient ways to create
large parts of your site from usages
like you just type ID hit one key and
will generate selector for you
automatically so that you don't spur
your time locating your CSS file enter
an ad trying to remember what is it like
hit create selector from the place and
we've got it for you just type your site
don't spend your time or on ultimate
easily automatic things when you have
all the side done probably by your
probably by somewhere else it's quite
important to see what's going to apply
to this place with this thing you just
select an ID hit one key and go to
selector which can be applied here
modified return back see another one you
can quickly navigate between different
selectors all your CSS files use small
sample if you are not keen about
switching your tabs and switch near
works workspaces you can always look up
their content context of the rule like
in place get one key and see all rules
which might which might be applied to
particular HTML line particular stand
outside tag here it is it's it's really
convenient our web developers our web
designers who are creating outside have
nothing to do this java but they still
use an idea just for this purpose you
can also find usages of all your classes
all your IDs across all your site like
hit altar server and the same way you
fight this reason your java code you can
find usages of your selectors ids and
pretty much everything you see we've
just put it out
unused class in our own website always
just found also you can quickly
highlight just using one your file
quickly navigate to read quickly look up
but see all this stuff we have working
for Java is working for CSS it's amazing
that people don't notice it but we have
it and it really helps you develop your
webpages either they're static or not
and the most useful feature is just to
see all the rules which might which
might be applied to a given that Y which
will be gathered throughout all CSS
files in correct order you'll got all
the properties which will be applied to
your text so that you can easily spot
why your label is really red in your
website so which property has ever
ridden this one we are aware of all the
rules of CSS cascading CSS applying of
course we are not aware of your
particular browser bug but if you stick
to stand up we can find out what applies
here and you've got your factors of
course we can't live without your
factories you can rename everything
class ID doesn't matter I one use one
heat of the key click preview of usages
do refactor and every usage is changed
here it is like you see it's change
everywhere well now we are moving to our
most wonderful stuff we think we have
right now we are moving to JavaScript
well javascript is really conflicting
nobody supports it's in a good way
beyond basic syntax highlighting we have
done lots of more we've done lots of
more for you to have your code written
with real pleasure first of all we have
code completion but we don't have just
keywords code completion we can plead
pretty much of everything here you see
just dojo toolkit my
it just drop it into my web application
and all the DOJ's staff is completed
where I can hit that hit control space
and they've got everything there might
be after that God you don't have to
remember all all the things you can spot
it right from the place and it's worked
for JavaScript without binding to any
particular framework just I'm pretty
sure if you drop your own JavaScript
files it should be working okay then
we've got your highlighting but not just
in text highlighting with not just
highlight you the wrong syntax
constructions like missing brace missing
bracket mission center column we also
highlighted the usages of wrong symbols
like here is initialized function which
doesn't exist we are highlighting
implicitly declared variables which are
probably box maybe not but they're
probably bugs we can highlight lots and
lots of things in JavaScript which we do
try to understand your code and we do
try to highlight it as good as we
highlight javaone of course we have
JavaScript formatted like we can suit
almost every coding style white imagine
we have hundreds of options for brace
placements for spaces wrote in for just
for anything it's been driven by the
same java coding styles you have in your
project so that your code will be
looking the same as java and we've got
actual working find usages in javascript
code you can hit a function or a method
or property or variable perimeter hit
alter stalin and you've got all usages
across all your site across all your
javascript files of your of the given
function so that you are not lost
anymore in your JavaScript you can even
rename all this stuff which you don't
like with the same automatic rename
which is safe convenient and
here is a sample like preview over name
just hit do refactor and everywhere it
will be named without any troubles they
also have small reflections for
JavaScript like introduced variables
they don't have big ones like object
oriented refactorings like in extract
class and so on but have them coming in
we have they're actively thinking about
them and we are pretty sure we'll have
them sooner than anyone we've got the
same highlight usages which is really
convenient when you are pretty sure that
the usage is right in this file you hit
one shortcut always edges are
highlighted on the gutter a highlighting
source code you can quickly navigate
between them and you're the king of
navigation you are moving with a light
speed in your source code very important
thing we have a go-to symbol which
navigates you to any symbol in your
project if in your JavaScript files in
the matter of second the set the same
way you have got used to heat control
and and navigate to class you now can
navigate to anything in JavaScript you
can navigate to functions classes
properties everything that is global we
of course support camel humps we support
regular expressions with a port all that
stuff which we support for java all this
is possible in your JavaScript
development you see lots and lots of
stuff in my project but you can quickly
find the one you need and if you have
already found a source code you're
working in you can easily navigate to
the things you are using right in your
code either it is yes HTML or JS file
you just hit control be and you're at
the place of definition of the given
function to check it to fix it or to
select anything else here is a sample of
using jQuery all across presentation
very quickly looked up instruction view
you can net
get to structure view from structure
view to your code well anything else
well actually all this stuff I have
shown you is already present in the
shift version of IntelliJ IDEA 51 you
can already use it you don't have to
wait for any major release but of course
we have some stuff coming in the sixth
version which will be doing several
months and which will be freely
available at this do I first of all we
do know about gom we know about dome we
know about various dump properties and
even more the more about browser
specific dumb you see those explorer
icons Firefox icon you know that this
thing is present only in Firefox only
explorer you don't have any more to have
those references on your death and so on
even more we are doing some sort of type
inference we know that note just was a
selection right now it will be an
element so that if you pitched an
element by ID now we'll show you only
the things don't know it can have not
all the staff and Joseph if we know that
this is adam note so show you nice
precise look up we also up building
knowledge of special functions and
different conventions different
libraries might have for example we have
a plug-in which supports dollar function
prototype it help it can be pretty much
everything so that with dollar you know
that this is dollar items and dom node
you know that dollar parameter is a ID
or class selector so that all references
all the stuff is working and even if
your name an ad in HTML files all get
element by ID will be renamed
accordingly what we've also done is
so-called smart completion you know that
javascript is a highly dynamic language
and developer can make sure that pretty
much everything might be hope from
everywhere like from unexpected place
that's why we are showing huge lookups
of everything possible after the dot but
in most cases you've got a statically
deducible methods properties and so on
that's why we've created a smart
completion which shows you only
statically deducible ones here you see
after that all the stuff which is
present near project and that's why it
can be called there but after invoking a
smart completion which shows smart small
completion list we also have lots of
additional JavaScript intentions coming
there are more than 70 of them we have
detections for common bug patterns we
have detection of probability cancers
you see document Oh probably used for
platform detection you shouldn't do
documental in your JavaScript files if
we are going to do cross browser
development we even against part like
potential places for optimizations
unreachable code code box there are
plenty of inspections and amazingly
every JavaScript library you can
download from internet open an idea and
you see it all yellow it has plenty of
and plenty of errors unreachable cause
like even box every major library has
box and we have seen it with our two
we've just shown some bugs to library
developers at veg ax edge x conference
and they were amazed at wow I've never
thought well that kind of things can be
found by ID we also have lots of
JavaScript intentions coming not just
quick fixes for common problems or quick
fixes for optimization patterns but also
lots and lots of code aids which after
you've been used to it you can't live
without them you can flip if else you
can change boolean expressions you can
change all to Anton vice versa so you
can lots and lots of stuff like adverb a
lot of things after you've been used
to eat there just one keystroke away and
you are much more productive with all
these things well we've done lots of
cool features for JavaScript but I
should tell you that we've got major
problems with JavaScript just because
JavaScript language is really dynamic
one we can't reliably detect all the
usages they might be present because
javascript is basically has like maps
and hashes going around everyone can
modify them so at first we thought that
we can do anything without it but
fortunately most of JavaScript code is
statically deducible all the places
which exploit JavaScript dynamism are
compact concise and usually JavaScript
developers don't do lots of things with
dynamic features that's why we thought
that Id should detect those patterns of
dynamic usages like dah jalan extent is
a feature which uses dynamic mechanism
but ID can detect them and provide user
with the best experience it can by
analyzing those features so actually we
have several ways of going first of all
a user can choose a used patel like we
can have several patterns built into ID
and user when he starts his own project
he just said that i'll be following like
prototype conventions for cloud
development for object-oriented style ID
will knowledge it and will analyze all
his code according to that he also had
can use like annotation issues in his
code to show that this one is really an
extension of the class or this variable
is expected to be like CSS rule and CSS
selector and so on and we are also in
any case we are going to implement an
open API we should allow everyone to
hook into his own style of work with
javascript so so that you have your own
library which explodes dynamic features
you can write
I I think not that much code and tell
idea about your usage patel's what we
are also thinking about before
javascript to is coming to the scene is
type in JavaScript language what we mean
is not that you have to put some types
in your code but first of all lots of
things can be deduced by by ID itself
they already have basic stuff and we
have been working for a while for much
more advanced it type checking for
JavaScript but also user can help us a
lot by embedding some source of
annotations either Jeff duck or any
other standard there might derive or we
may create in collaboration with other
developers or other ad well vendors so
that if you write those notations in
your code we can read detected and give
you lots and lots of hints have
refactorings recognize them have our
completions and help features those
annotations annotation enabled so that's
basically our collaboration why we need
to collaborate like ID vendors I think
there are no I'd event is present here
but library or source library users
everyone should collaborate together to
create some sort of mechanism for
JavaScript to make it more pleasant to
work with and everyone will well
everyone will use these features and
idea and clips and probably any other
JavaScript ID that might come around
that's basically all about our
javascript stuff well I have also
several slides about our other features
they might not be of great interest for
you since you're already IntelliJ IDEA
developers but we have a good example
support we are not an XML studio like
specialized for XML production but we
have
off one of the best support available
for XML DTD and xml schema we have over
highlighting we have code completion so
that if if you have a DTD or schema you
can check that your XML is ok we can
guide you through your XML creation we
even can give you an XML completion for
your XML files even if you don't have a
DTD or schema defiant we can analyze
your XML file and guide you to create
xml file with the same structure you
have just written we also have quite a
few jellyfishes you know just to
remember them have refactorings
validations g3 support version control
systems we have open API we also have
GSP support I guess you don't do NE jise
be here but still everything I've
presented here works in GSP files like
HTML features CSS JavaScript Java
features everything works in GSP and we
have lots of things coming in idea 60
it's yourself support it should be three
like visual HTML editor which can allow
you to preview your files like we
cleared them we have code coverage and
Countess of other improvements we also
have some more features we are starting
to talk about first of all we have for a
while in development a python plugin
which will be open source i think pretty
soon don't know when but you can expect
it to come I think you're already using
it in house and we have started to work
on Ruben rails in case you're just
interested in like it should be I think
interested in in every web technologies
regular out so we have started to work
in it and if you ever decide to write
google in Ruby on Rails it will be
possible sometime all these plugins will
be open source so if you want to
participate take a look or anything else
just drop me a line and we'll have all
this stuff coming
well that's brutal I think we have any
questions thanks a lot</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
