I am quite passionate about competing
and collaborating in China with by
cultural competence is especially
meaningful for me to be in a Silicon
Valley with Google's today talking about
this particular topic because this is my
first visit to your campus as i walked
in i see a global village at work I see
a global village with people full of
idealism and passioned and a deep
believe in building a common world for
Humanities but we are deeply divided
today as human beings but they be
divided today and partly because of the
fact that the east-west culture is
diametrically opposed and it's is
polarized and we don't know how to
reconcile them I did not learn about my
cultural competence or we call it
sometimes trans cultural competence
until I study at Cambridge for my
doctoral program with dr. Charles
Hampton Turner I call in my beloved
teacher Cambridge scholar and a Harvard
ph.d and he and his consulting from
Trump announced hampton turner and
amsterdam they both did a lot of work in
the areas of dilemma theory and
cross-cultural competence and much of
the work much of the presentation and
make today is a lot of Charles work and
I use the dilemma theory which is
cross-cultural competence to do a new
product development research work in my
in my in my field of research i'm
currently a professor of technology
entrepreneurship and innovation at the
Nanyang Technological University and I
live in Seattle Washington mmm
I was wondering ladies and gentlemen
what do you see in this picture let's
just spend 15 20 seconds to look at the
picture what do you see wow that's an
Angels okay well what else do others see
what do you see soon that's an angel
what do you see okay and man what do you
see that's okay could you see the Angels
all right okay so does that really not
see both bets an angel okay did anybody
see anything else with sex bet mention
angel a plate that's the holistic view
right let's do that's the composition of
the bats and angel in a very nice
display all right so the displays
actually ultimately right about an angel
baton angel so I think that one of the
one of the problems you about culture is
that that we tend to see each other the
way we like to sometimes we see see
ourselves as the angel and the righteous
angel and the people of the other
culture of the other camps are other bat
so and we want to make this whole world
either All Angels this in this picture
was recomposed to be all angels then the
question is what would it look like it
was all enjoy what would it look like
exactly there will be no picture
whatever it's all bad there'll be a
black ball so I think there's a
philosophy there's a deep philosophy in
this very simple picture it's a Dutch
painter who painted this that it it
resembles the two polarized culture of
the east and the west
and it is when the east and the West the
values come together and synthesizing
reckon song in a systematic way it is
when we do that where we then have a put
a very beautiful picture and a bed up in
a very good world to live in and and a
lot of the things that that I've read
about Google's is very idealistic and
much of it is also the synthesis of
these two values but let us let us look
at what is one of the major differences
between the East and the West if you
look at the left hand side I think that
and the West we tend to be more
universalistic this is where we invent
loss we invent a standardization this is
where we want unify everything by rules
I produce everything the same way and
consume a hamburger the same way we want
to do that across the world that's just
a cultural orientation that we tend to
be more inclined to to do that but in
the east people are polarized these are
the cultural values they are more
particular listing you know we were
going to be talking a little about China
and we find that the Chinese people have
difficulty in obeying the laws why
because they are the cultures more
particular listing particularly stickies
exceptions they always like to deal with
the exceptions ok this is the law this
is the route but it doesn't apply to me
we have a local situation with this
which deserves some executive exceptions
so but if these two cultures and these
two values will polarize we insist on
one way and everybody has to be here
there in that stand of way and another
culture says that no it doesn't apply to
me I can always be like there will
always be an exception you know we don't
have to go by
lecture property law signed by the
whatever convention then then these two
will will always be polarized and it
creates a lot of conflict between us the
West Israel is we are more
individualistic here in America and the
West especially in english-speaking
anglo-saxon culture and the east is very
much more of a communitarian and that is
why when people do business each other
and okay no problem why because the
Chinese government wants you to transfer
technology want you to teach them how to
do different things before they start
doing a lot of business with you
coca-cola for example had to build a
bottling factory alright cover cloth
supplies concentrate and they have to
build bottling factories and literally
give it to the Chinese and say this is
how you do a modern age bottling factory
for coke for beverages and then the
Chinese to all this is how you do it ok
this is war standard this is the state
of the art but in exchange the Chinese
government grant coca-cola all kings of
privilege ok so license to be the first
in China over Pepsi Cola or Pepsi Cola
why is it the Volkswagen is is ahead of
everybody else's in China again is
because they understand that the Chinese
culture is a communitarian culture there
are certain things that the Chinese
value more so then then when the West is
what do you do for us as a community and
in the East in the West we are more
specific Newtonian science we are more
specific we take things we take a lot of
things and we try to break them down
into pieces or put them down into
categories like you do here right so
that your search will be much easier
much faster and then we try to reduce
down them down to the very small unit
and we try to find relationships so we
converge we are we come from a culture
of specific specificity and in the
Orient people always really do feel
you do business in China or in Japan you
ask them a specific question whether we
could do it or not and the answer is hi
hi okay okay but it doesn't mean that we
can it means that I'll think about it
but you know what it is not that they
are dumb now that they're stupid they
could be a graduate from Ching hua
university Beijing University which is
the top 0.01 percent of the talent but
they'll tell you the same thing but
culturally they don't want to converge
so quickly all right because do you come
from a very diffuse culture just look at
the painting break right thing look at
paintings in the West we paint in the
West pictures portraits as close to the
real person as possible the east you
look at the painting is always very
diffuse you know landscaping and whatnot
and and and and the painter will finally
before he finishes the painting spray
something and make it really really
foggy the whole scene is so
froggy and the mug is up on top of the
hill meditating he forgot to come down
it's always so abstract I always so
diffuse are we so foggy are we so like a
specific details lesson the Western
painting we painted the mall and the
eyelashes living in detail but these are
about cultural orientations and they do
need to the way we strategize our
strategy in business it's affected by
the way we think and I'll cultural
values next thing is that we are more in
an inner directed I think it's because
of the judeo-christian culture we are we
in our God we are more in a directed in
a way we think about values and in the
West is there more auto directed the
first thing to think about is if I did
this what is going to happen to the
society what's going to happen to the
societal environment at large because it
is a communitarian society and how many
and and don't rock the boat and peace
this is the highest sense of value for
them here in American and in the West we
write to the precedents and we tell the
president that we are angry with the war
we angry with his policy right because
we come from a society where status have
to be achieved prove it to me proper to
media this is right you don't you have
to earn this is the hard-earned thing
you gotta earn it if not you're going to
lose my votes for years from now but in
the East that is not the values if you
have been elected as the president of a
of a country or you are the Emperor or
you are you know whatever the Prime
Minister people are scratched the status
to you and you will call it the fullest
respect and the fullest cooperation and
with that stature and the state has come
a lot of convenience that people will
walk to you you don't have to prove
yourself because by virtue of that
stature and the status you are being
worshiped it's just the culture of
different we're not saying that which is
right or wrong so we have a problem here
we have a business people going from San
Francisco going to Shanghai he thinks
about time as the sequence I have one
week in Shanghai this is what we grew
the first day second day you know I got
off the plane I'm going to go to the
company i'm going to visit the climb
going to visit the supply chain i'm
going to go look at the stores fourth
day i'm going to talk about details on
the contract the 50 i won my order
because the sixth day i'm going to get
on the plane come back to San Francisco
so we think about time linearly as a
sequence but then in the West in the
East people think about synchronized
time we're not going to do business
until your timing my timing and the
timing of the earth and the timing of
God the heaven comes together time is a
circle it's a synchronized time like
just jit it is not your calendar month
it is not your linear thinking about
timing my friend that's why we get so
frustrated
these two cultures clash these two
cultures come together and they are more
imp they even more polarized and the
attention and they create okay so
dilemma for us as business managers so
these are the six culture dilemmas
cultural dimensions but you know what as
much as they are polarized and they're
different if you flip it over there
truly mirror image of one another it's
just it is just like saying that when
you look at the you scan your book from
left to right or you extend it from like
the left it's just a different way of
doing it you can't say that which way is
right which way wrong because it's just
a different way of doing it they are
just different so these values are just
different they are differences it is
like saying that in the East we in the
West we like to say that what we want to
do is to benefit ourselves first and the
society will benefit at large because
each of us satisfy our needs and each of
us take care of our own interests but in
a different culture especially in the
east they like to say that no we will
look at because we're comunitaria we
have to do things the benefit of society
first and the society progresses then we
as individual will do well but what is
the difference it's like saying that you
know look at this for the work of
function well we need both we know you
both to come together nicely if not
we'll have a dilemma if we always see
you know if I we see a certain culture
as the black back and we are the angel
this will will be in trouble or if they
are we see our sister but bad and they
are the angel we have a problem we have
a dilemma so if we see that we're we're
always going to have if we are polarized
and there's this tensions like a
straight line you got two values and we
pull it and there's tension to the
middle we're always talking about you
win I lose you know so these are the six
different how do we reconcile that let's
take the
look at the various cultures if look at
this slightly on the left hand side you
have this eggs right they are all the
same this is very much how we thicken
the weather universalism and you have on
the right Farber Jay French egg that
that is nicely crafted for the father
for the Emperor that is just 11 only one
and the only one everyone is different
so one is more particularly sticking one
is more individualistic now I'm sure now
here in San Francisco is very
multicultural you go to Western
restaurant you've got oriental
restaurants you find a major difference
if you go to the Western restaurant the
way that comes along and say what would
you like to have today and the manual is
about dinner min is about that thin you
can have fish today you can have seafood
you'd have chicken or we have very nice
lamb chops and it's it's just one thing
and it's done and it's universalistic
but if you go to your a Chinese
restaurant for example you order a fish
chicken vegetables maybe a soup dish you
have a variety of things they cater for
you tell me what you want you can have a
dish of every different thing you don't
have to eat freshest fish today so that
itself tells you that we're actually
quite different the way we think all
right now and our strategy effects this
this is a affects the way we think this
is the question that we ask in order to
classify people into these two cultures
we ask this question about universalism
and particularism I'll show the result a
bit later we said that this we tell
people the story that you and a very
good buddy friend of yours when for a
night out hang out at the bar and you
drank both of you drank and you came
back and your friend was driving the
weather was a bit you know foggy out
there and he had a bit too much to drink
it was growing a bit faster than he
should hey
pedestrian district the pedestrian died
so you're the only eyewitness are you
have to testify in court if you testify
the truth in court you're very good
buddy friends going to go to jail for
many years and he has two kids young
kids at home and you know the family
very very well so are you going to does
your friend have the right to expect you
to tell the truth to testify the truth
you know that's the question we ask or
that's your friend have the right to
have you protect him because of the
friendship there's a tough question you
know so think about that question er I
don't want to embarrass anybody to think
about that question and we ask this
question to a bunch of executive in the
east and they gave us different answers
let's look at the ansys these are
numbers Anna West wit Celyn
english-speaking New Zealand Australia
you were scanning even UK majority of
people say that the friends don't have
the right to expect them to testify you
know to protect the tell lies to lie to
the coroner to protective to prepare to
protect him West many countries in the
East said that sure as good friends the
pedestrian is already dead all right you
didn't do it on purpose yeah you have a
bit too fast but you didn't do it
intentionally you got two kids yeah I'm
obligated to protect you because we're
longtime friends for 25 years so that's
desti answer and I just did another
survey about four weeks ago with a bunch
of executive from all across the world a
French company called Eddie ki jai 11
billion euro dollar company Eddie kid
about 35 students in my class they're
all general managers and asked this
question in all the French people of
very communitarian that much among the
Anglo people the French people are
culturally most aligned with the east
and that's the reason why we
all the time that we have problems right
on international issues with the French
people they are always taking opposing
sides it's not that they want to
antagonize the United States but because
that six dimensional cultural values
they're quite different from from the
Anglo speaking people surely if you look
at all this this data so it's
interesting that we come from both
different sites different aspects so
this is particularly the and and and and
a cuban universalism a display of
particularly universalism these people
expect the english-speaking the the
nautic people expect us to have a
unified way of looking treating law but
what is interesting though is if we
change the relationship we see that it
was your brother who was driving the car
then the answers begin to change even in
the West because that relationships much
closer people begin to waver a little
bit ago my brother I know what area jail
okay now from a business standpoint you
can take these to let values one is a
universalistic value where
standardization law rule of law mass
production everything is the same and
you can actually and this is if you look
at the dell model they'll produce
components ordered ms and they give you
a customization program where you are
empowered to select whatever you want to
give you a solution so so this
customization customers choices is a
particular listing mentality this is the
more of the instant type value right but
what do you want you choose to go you
design your own while you design
computer but here they have a lot of
marginalized components among the what
you choose their produce a very high
speed a very low cost and they have a
standard modular platform so so when you
begin to look at this this
mass customization model which value
society to support it I'm sure many of
you are very familiar with its really
the synthesis of the two values so so
long attorney says that there's a
dilemma for companies to be totally
low-cost oriented high volume and wanted
to customize customize and customization
is very expensive so these two what do
we think that why do we tend to think
that way most of the companies in the
Orient tend to do a much better job in
customization but not high volume
customization low volume customization
and then in the West we are very good in
mass production but now the winning
formula is not that is high speed mass
customization so now you're joining the
two values which is in tension in
dilemma from a strip but it two ends the
end the two ends of a straight line we
put it into a circle and we are spinning
them in a spiral so that every every
computer that you receive from down is a
synthesis direct translation of mass
customization customization which is
what you ordered you design it plus the
components are produced at high speed so
that itself is a cross-cultural
competence so it's the way you join the
values of these two extreme cultures
together does the same thing with Lexus
so we're turning this culture of the
company into a strategy toyota has uses
the basic Chessie's and on top of their
basic chassis which will appear in
millions the amount or this special
customized part am on luxury parts or
compadre running for the luxus model to
give you this customized superstructure
on common platform this is how to your
top and built its lexus car
which is much cheaper and much low cost
compared to mercedes-benz right and BMW
but again this is a perfect example of
using the east-west are by cultural
competence to craft strategy it has both
the Western value of standardization and
mass production and unification and and
and also the Eastern value of
customization now the other dimension is
is individually blizzardon versus
community realism and if you look at
most of the economies are in America in
particular and certainly the UK in 18th
19th century which is the pioneer
capitalism a lot of inventions a lot of
enterprise would build right now in this
silicon valley we are more
individualistic and therefore we involve
ourselves in dealing in innovation like
what I can smell innovation creativity
as I walk into this beautiful campus of
yours and that's culturally we we have a
culture of high near capitalism whereas
in the East because more communitarian
and they're involved in catching up
copying fast correction fast copy just
to catch up with the West they are more
comfortable doing that because of the
culture orientation because they're more
communitarian this way is lower risk
much less risky all right more to
emulate but it is more communitarian
because the communities cheering society
talks about harmony in general how many
is very important not know huge
disruption when you want to change there
must be plenty new with ish and that's
the reason why China and did not diss
mentor his political system when he
switched from a planned economy to a
market driven economy whereas the Soviet
Union just given up everything so there
was no continuity and disintegrate this
is another survey that we do we asked a
question about the importance of
individual freedom
and again the english-speaking Anglo
countries and Israel also bring very
high and again even Singapore you know
ranks quite low in this research now
France look at France again
interestingly a month is in the same
category is that's the east so they're
much more communitarian than we think
such approach could be translated in the
strategy IBM for example has a strategy
of rewarding the people instead of
forcing people to compete the more
individualistic way there is this
cooperation but too much of cooperation
can become colluding you can collude you
know rather than cooperate and also but
this was an internal competition that
they did some time ago by rewarding
people so okay whoever teaching the most
sales of the month is rewarded with a
big bonus so people go out and close
sales and window dresser sales and try
to get the numbers in as much as
possible and it don't cook they don't
collaborate there is one extreme of
individualism if we cooperate too much
only without much of a competition than
you collude so they came up with the
weather with a method of measuring to
synthesize these two extreme values
these are cross cultural values is that
they say that instead of competing for
sales why don't we say that we compete
about what you have learned from the
customer this quarter anyone can come
out and tell us what you have learnt
from the customer and the panel will
vote on the lessons learned the group
that has a higher score on the lessons
learned from the customer will win the
competition so these kinds of synthesis
cultural competence joins the
individualism in the community realism
approach in creating a strategy that has
a
and y chromosome in its in its helix so
in every winning winning contests that
is collab competition and there's and
there is cooperation same thing is a
motorola does that also in the total
customers satisfaction competition we
think more specifically in these in the
west and in the east to think Monty few
Slee forecasting for example forecasting
is a way of forcing ourselves to
converge very quickly right and scenario
planning is to think about very scenario
much divergent approach much more widely
so the specific culture tend to think
about the text more and the more
diffused culture thing to think about
the context a little bit more you see so
we tend to polarize ourselves but good
but it doesn't mean that if you're
already entered you tend to you you
don't you don't think about tax and if
you are western person if American you
don't think about contacts at all we're
not saying that we're saying that a
successful person has just cost cultural
competence of the specific values as
well as the diffuse values the time to
diverge and the time to converge so the
if you join these two together you are
cross-cultural person is what we're
trying to say so and we think we tend to
end up doing this that in the West we
tend to think from ourselves
individually I'm in a cell and out and
and for Chinese and Japanese and Korean
it was from outside in what does that
mean to the society how does it mean to
the corporation what does that mean to
the family and what does it mean to me
you see these two cultures are coming
from different directions but we're not
saying once inside I was outside in
we're not again we're not saying which
which value is
correct or the best we're saying that we
need work ah this is an interesting
question let me just ask this question
we asked a group of Western and Eastern
people that how many of you would pain
your boss's home for him over the
weekend let's do like what weekend this
is interesting hobby we would volunteer
to pain your boss's home over the
weekend July 4th weekend anybody kidding
what i express this this is the results
whoa again the Scandinavians all right
and the Europeans and the
english-speaking people say no we were
not paying their bosses house now this
is for this particular question of Frank
people came out to be quite on the top
it's a no-go but look at China look at
singapore singapore look at China we're
talking about China today look at China
a lot of them think about outside in
Phest why because they are a bit more
diffuse they think that okay in the in
each we tend to think that you know what
we don't think that hey wait a minute i
have a contract with the company and
there's a contract within me and the
company and the work that I do I do for
the company I don't have a car during my
blog so painting his house it is from
monday to friday or whatever it takes to
finish my work but painting is harvest
is how set the contract so we think very
specifically but we didn't mean it now
in china in the East people don't think
that way they say that we really not he
says that my boss is a one who writes my
appraisal at the end of the day of the
other day and he takes care of my well
being here he can meet me really
miserable and my livelihood depends on
him so if he needs a little help what is
wrong for me to sacrifice one weekend
and go have him paint the house so who's
right who's wrong it's like that it's
like the
the accident the guy who dropped the car
in hit you know hit this pedestrian so
the Americans tell that the Chinese and
the Japanese that you know we cannot be
friends with you because you had a bunch
of idiots who don't obey laws we will
lie to the court of law and then the
Chinese in the job mr. and we can't be
friends with you Americans because you
guys told you guys betraying your
friends up to 30 years you betray our
friendship so who is Ryan who is wrong
so we all have different values you see
and our values a difference there are
differences they're not right and wrong
sometimes now we take this diffuse and
specific consummate turn them into
strategy will look at ikea for example
ikea produce specific parts furniture in
CKD in a knockdown form all right and
then they've also a very diffused is a
specific parts specific furniture they
have a more sophisticated swedish design
for a setting like a lounge set and they
display them in a diffuse in a very
holistic specific pieces within diffuse
holes they take all these pieces and
they put them into a living room setting
we walk into their display wow you were
going to buy a piece of you're just
going to buy a table a dining table
you're not going back again to buy the
chest you're not going back to buy the
Tablelands you're not going but the
whole entire system ah you see that's
where cross-cultural competence thinking
about the fuse or specific when you join
them into a circle and they become a
strategy innovation so nobody could now
it has been rough for a long time i work
for a lecture last ad for many many
years there's a Scandinavian company but
you know what up to today nobody has
been able to duplicate ikea why when you
have a single dimensional strategy it's
very easy to duplicate just low-cost
easy to duplicate if you are just a such
company period you know what might be
easy to duplicate too if you're such
company as well as a portal you develop
deep competence in your such a
technology and as you go into a deep end
deeper you might find Q believes that
you can apply to enhance your portal
business your ecommerce so this is a
very interesting way to join cultural
values into a holistic strategy and it's
now two dimensional strategy mass
customization we talked about dell
computer is two dimensional because if
its mass production is easy to copy it
is customization at low volume is easier
to copy but when you have mass
customization look at HP try to do that
fail look at compact try to do that fail
like Novus ball of IBM is they're trying
to do that too i'm not sure they have
any great success not yet at least it's
very difficult to duplicate if you are
able to come up with these kinds of
strategy joining two different dilemmas
to paradoxes and it's the same as you
know you guys go out and do planning the
retreat i don't know how you do it here
but some managers are so hooked on a
design strategy you know you went away
for a REIT evo you know and the end of
your licks it is how we're going to do
it hey minute you come back meaning you
put your plan in writing it becomes
obsolete because the environment changes
some people just react to emergen
emergence strategy they keep reacting to
the emergence try to keep reacting to
the competition and the you know at the
end of the day they forgot about the own
vision they forgot where you're heading
to so these two again are different
value cultural values put them together
you craft strategy designing out of
emerging success so a good set of
strategy is crossing culture joining
these two dilemmas into a circle so you
have a plan strategy and you always
adjust a pen strategy using what is
emerging and eventually approaching your
vision now I think these are very
motherhood for many of you who are very
very smart
intelligent but many of us today still
cannot join these two values and we are
still well will polarize we are well
drown in in this polarization we can't
get out of it next one is in a director
versus outer directed again if you look
at the research we find that people from
the Oriental of the East China in
particular at the bottom there they
don't believe that what happens to you
is your own doing question in the West
we believe that what happens to us as a
whole on doing this is like what happens
to me is a lot of reasons to society the
policy of the nation you know born into
which family I didn't ask to stop them
on doing well that's here we say you
know live the American dream you know we
don't care where you come from go I live
the dream you could be a Russian
immigrant but you can build Google's
some example of Singapore using so go
back to this inner and outer directed
Singapore has in our users inner outer
directed cultural competence very well
first of all it has an inner directed
Singapore is a country where you know
Google's is I'm sure you are you have
people traveling in that region a lot we
have graduates working here to render
and main so but Singapore is one country
the way they eat this is small four
million people no natural resources so
it decides what itself in a directed
League what kinds of industry wants to
build an excel in with high value add
contribution and then it sources it from
you bring in the type of industry that
they they feel that they need from
foreign from from from across the world
and then then he has an outer director
policy where it produces its own
engineers and it's singapore uses a lot
of foreign talents a lot of foreign
talents you see a lot of foreigners
working in singapore very qualified
foreign talent and
it has the most liberal policy to
encourage foreigners with deep technical
competence or managerial competence to
work there is an outer directed our
philosophy but a lot of the less
developed country attract they are only
into direct that their only focus this
way so they cannot transform the country
but Singapore does it very well is an
intelligent Island very well wired I
wouldn't talk about that one okay then
the next one is achieved this is
described the interest of time achieve
mrs. subscribe again we talked about
that one we ask this question again most
Americans and English speaking
anglo-saxon disagree with acting as
really suits you right but in the Orient
people act in a job as though it is it
suits them there are people but the
society has cracked them the stature
whether it suits you or not I this is
the I'm in the right place in the right
time I'm going to assume it so so
they'll agree with that and the last one
is sequence versus a synchronized time
and this is interesting let's look at
this we asked we asked people of
different culture about time this is how
they look at time Americans we look at
the past is the past all right now and
the future is slightly intertwined but
let's focus on the future that is why a
lot of people in the Orient can
understand why America will go back and
build and implement the marshall plan of
how Japan rebuilt up to Japan attempt to
bomb try a pearl harbor and and lately
they found that the shrine that the
Japanese my mother was visiting included
some of the generals who mastermind of
the bombing of the per hour but you know
what in America we tend to sit it the
past is the past forget that let's let's
let's focus on the future the Japanese
are wearing
now the Japanese and the Chinese is the
same the pass and the color in the
future all intertwined that's why China
and Japan and quarreling about about the
Second World War because Jack the
Japanese have not clarify the situation
clearly to the Chinese at least they had
not and history is not written properly
so so you wonder so Americans are
scratching their head why is it that you
guys can't get over this thing see we're
a minute because this is how we think
about time it's related ah the UK think
about overlaps a little bit maybe this
is because of imperialism I don't know
colonialization it always left a little
bit the Germans the French tend to
relate those three space concepts and
look at this one I like this this is
manish you think that the future let's
not worry about that too much is this
not related but it is when we easily
when we synchronize and with when we
synthesize means joining or Arkansas
time as a linear concept of sequential
timing and a synchrony where we use just
in time just in time and flexible
manufacturing you know is this cultural
synthesis of these two values so we take
synchronized time all right and we take
sequential time I will put them together
we do small volume flexible
manufacturing so what we are saying up
to now is very much that cultural values
are different it's in west from day one
tend to think differently because of a
society of a cultural background and we
have a problem if we insist that we're
right and others are wrong this work
cannot function but if we can think
about these two values which are there's
a pension in between is a dilemma we
call them as dilemma like reconciliation
if you can join them together in these
steps in
make them into since this is our string
all right since this is our string is
like a string you pull if you pull it it
will break ok these are there two
polarized values why don't we just make
them into a cultural space and then we
can join them into a circle then we can
twist them and we can spiral them we can
use exceptions which is particularly
them to test the rule or keep refining
the rules and the rule is the West the
exception is the east if you can use
exceptions to keep refining the rules
the rules would get better and better
better better and that will be a
cross-cultural there will be a bite
cultural competence a manifestation in
others we have just reconciled the
dilemma so we could use their for
strategy and we can also use that for
innovation innovation is also why why
should people who cross cultures
interesting innovation and creativity
there's some reasons he ran through very
quickly creativity unifies diverse ideas
and perspective I don't have to say that
because you all you're involving in
innovation and creatively all the time
what you're trying to do is you're
trying to join two thought two variables
a thought matrix that are seemingly
unrelated you know you don't see any
relationship between these two variables
but when you join them who all of a
sudden increases it creates a splash it
creates a significant meaning now you
have a relationship now you have an
innovation so so people who cross
cultures are also involved in innovation
and therefore innovation occurs in in
very diverse culture San Francisco is a
big is an example of this innovation
effort where you have a lot of diverse
culture immigrants foreigners strangers
I was just visiting my daughter who just
graduated from the Entrepreneurship
program that that ran took in Singapore
and she's an industrial designer
she studied use a Washington in a she
went to China to study Mandarin for one
year in patient University and went to
nanyang to take this technology
entrepreneurship innovation program and
I went to visit her at the ideal she's
just a first job that I do it and they
have an office in san francisco de by
the bay by the by the pier it's very
interesting that the team that she has
is just flew off to New York this is a
second week to do a project innovation
project for them herself American she's
American too but herself an Anglo person
up as a designer from Dutch from Holland
and another person from Taiwan American
Chinese from Taiwan for the very diverse
culture and they all have four different
expertise they are not all computer
engineers or designers where it went on
to poly anthropology major very
interesting background so diversity is
important diversity creates creativity
diabetes diversity nurtures creativity
but diversity with that inclusion is no
use you guys us culture but you don't
include people then it's not in the
decision making but it can also be very
scary look at this diversity you can be
over also very scary because you know
people don't look alike you have to get
used to it this is very scary a
situation so I don't want to spend too
much time on this and this again this is
a cultural the these are the luma
reconciliation methods of thinking about
things you got unity diversity
Association remoteness and now we use
multidisciplinary approach to create a
new strategy a new discovery of new
creativity so we're constantly in
innovative work trying to reconcile
between these two values rock will order
disorder fixed dynamics vertical lateral
conscious and unconscious nurse these
are the two extremes they were
constantly trying to deal with and
creativity is the shock of recognition
we recognize all of a sudden that they
are all components are all elements that
could be recombined to create very
interesting relationship various
interesting synthesis and this
particular slide talked about creativity
and it starts from arts and then ended
up in science and back in our today
because I think creativity is you gotta
have the vision and the leadership these
are social sciences and arts fest think
about certain ideas and then you use
technology and then come back again you
have to use the leadership and your
coaching and mentoring and to make it
happen and it's helped customers solve
problems okay now very quickly I want to
make a very simple and very quick
hypothesis all I have said about talked
about earlier to summarize it easton wes
is quite different but in order for us
to be successful we can we don't have to
compromise we can join them together
right we join them together we solve
reconcile the dilemma we can create two
dimensional strategy out of it so we
don't have to try to change the Chinese
in China and they don't have to try and
change this here in America but we need
to appreciate each other's cultural
differences we need to design a model
like that like the spiral to come
together to use each other's strength
back and forth back and forth back and
forth to synthesize now there's a lot of
conjecture out there whether China will
go through continual not and that's very
important for you and dr. Josh Hampton
turner and I made a presentation at
xiamen university in China and march and
our hypothesis is that China's economic
growth will continue and there are eight
reasons why we say so and I will not go
through every one of those but just very
briefly education is the key in China
and they continue to I was just with the
Education Minister in two weeks ago in
Beijing this office you continue to tell
me how important education is and
they're going to the eighty percent of
the budget in China is going to be
spending the village
to bring the basic education up to 10
year level eighty percent so they're
going to privatize a lot of university
they are going to promote 100
universities the rest of them is going
to be merged and whatnot but each year
they're 150,000 Chinese people go
outside the study graduate school
undergraduate graduate school it's about
close to 10 to 12,000 phd's studying
ph.d program across the world they're
coming back ninety percent of them are
coming back to China to contribute so
education is going to continue and
therefore China's Chinese advanced and
economy was sustained because of the pro
education approach now the this point
number two is important change in
continuity again this is to cultural
values conflict in the what change is in
idealism continuity is it is practical
it's now it is conservative conservatism
is magnetism but in China they use these
two values together to reconcile
therefore they did not dismantle the
entire system plan economy they
introduce what they go they call an
open-door policy and a market driven
economy they use the market driven
economy the invisible hand to slowly
dislodge the inefficiency of the pen
economy so there is a continuity there
whereas the Soviet unit is this
dismantle everything and everything went
bust there is no more survey unit so the
Chinese people have an inherent ability
to reconcile dilemmas they believe that
for a change to succeed you must have
some level of continuity the third
hypothesis that we say is that yes China
has been week has been quite weak in
technology in the last couple of hundred
years because of the disruption
political turmoil and a foreign
domination and whatnot but if you go
back and look at the history to Chinese
people invented a lot of things paper
printing at all China you know ceramic
binary binary numbers compass you name
it so so and
and if we go and visit some of the top
universities ching wan beta i judge
young university for other the students
are very very strong mathematics and
physics sciences are very good the
community community and culture is very
important now for China to sustain it
can order massive effort and mobilize
the people to do something for the
common good so this is going to help
China sustain and also point number
seven I want to talk about point number
seven is that the Chinese people believe
in playing the infinite game rather than
a finite game I want to talk about that
a little bit in my conclusion ok so
these hypotheses that we said ok
concludes that our sit our thesis that
we think that China's growth will
continue to sustain rather than
disrupted because it has an internal
mechanism to feel the growth of the
economy I want to go on and talked about
one of the P Chinese attributes one of
the key Chinese mentality is to play the
finite game not not the infinite the
paid of infinite game and not the finite
game and what do I mean by that an
infinite games as defined by James
cursed is that a infinite game are
subtle our market different economies
with purposeful leadership in the later
stage of development the finite game has
a fixed rule it's a win-lose situation
the infinite game changes rule by
agreement or who wins the shot contest
is less important than who improves the
mastery of the game in along in a long
term so the finite game as we like to
play in the West many a times is the
purpose is to win improves through
fitness surviving witness extrude
loser's winner take all Eames identical
relatively simple rules are fixed in
advance which is very different in China
rules yes we talked about loose in
advance but they change as the situation
emerges current yes we have a contract
no why
don't like to use contract in China
because a shake of hands because if they
believe in your word and the pride and
and the trust is with the breathing
right at all I put this in writing
cultural is because they don't like to
play a finite game where rules are fixed
in advance if I promised to buy a barrel
of oil a millon barrel of oil from you
in the next three years at fifty dollars
I expect you to allow me to break the
law the rules to break the contract
because oil prices has gone through the
ceiling I'm not going to be able to
supply a fifty dollars anymore because
if I did i'll go broke so so don't come
sue me because you start doing that we
won't do business with you so the East
believed the Chinese believe in an
infinite game we don't we don't really
want to fix the rules in advance we want
to play as we go and we don't want to
just a short term this decision you know
so the infinite games is to improve the
game improve the game through evolving
winners teach loser to play better if
you win you teach losers to play how to
play the game better winning widely
shared aims at the worse relative
complexed rules are changed by agreement
rules resembles grammar of original
utterance grow new markets and be long
term in your thinking now this is very
important the companies that did well in
China in the last 10-15 years since the
open door policy a la coca cola
Volkswagen Audi AIG these are the
companies that have wieners teach losers
play better which took in Chinese
scholars back in 80 1800s they are
training all the legislature their
training the law of the the the the
attorney the top attorneys the judges
the legislature and Yale University in X
in return was it was given the right to
purchase a class shares in China
nobody is allowed to do that you can buy
BB flat stocks in China for foreigners
by yale university is given the right so
we nursed each loser coca-cola as i say
earlier right built the bottling factory
and give it to the chinese and solely to
the Chinese say okay this is how you
build a world-class factory so they
teach the loser but in return the
Chinese gave them right AIG bought a lot
of paintings and national treasures that
were stolen by the West during the
boxing revolution and now been option
across the world they bought them and
they returned it to the Chinese they put
in the museum's it this is belongs to
china in return the Chinese say wow you
love you love us you love our culture
you look for society we want to be
friends with your new pictures you
forever that is the way to do business
in China and that's the way you crossed
culture and that's the way you become by
cultural so it is important for you to
succeed in the world with a duality of
strategy now let me conclude by saying
that what I'm saying now is like the
traffic light these are the last few
slides if you look at the traffic light
there are two major likes to major
colors like the red and the green and
the amber is just the warning that it
was going to switch so which which color
is better which do you prefer what would
you prefer you prefer the green okay why
don't we have green lights all over bang
what happened to our traffic system
we're going to crash into each other
we're going to die so if you say you
prefer the wreck the whole city comes to
a standstill so one is the Western
values and once the eastern value but
how do you create a by cultural
competence how do you create value in
this world where we can become like that
painting the angel and the bat so if
it's red light we crash
so the way we create value is for the
green and the red likes to switch in
sequence right so the green and red and
green and red and the traffic flows
automatically you can obviously
synchronize the timing but green signals
one type of cultural values red signal
another type green signal mess customize
a customization red signals are a mass
production low cost but it is in the
switching of these two values where it
creates sorry these two lights colors
that it creates true value for all of us
but if each of us insists that our value
is the best and the rest of us must
follow us that's where we have a traffic
crash or a traffic congestion situation
so I want to stop there by saying that
that America is blessed with
multicultural people and but knowing how
to speak once language doesn't make you
doesn't provide you with a by cultural
competence it is understanding these
values these six dimensional values that
controls the way we do things and the
controls the way we think about strategy
and business and controls the way that
we we execute our our our plans in a
global world so if we can come together
and synthesize these dilemmas it will
create a much more sustainable strategy
for you or Google's it'll make a much
better world for all of us thank you
very much
if you have any question I would be glad
to take a few yes breakable of college
crafts I mean it that's extremely
susceptible to a defective right you
gave us some examples of successes where
a ID you know the car over it seemed to
be there would be vintage many more
cases of failure where a company in an
overture and then they allowed it cutter
violation and then there's never any
repayment other side yeah and I keep
going forward I don't see that is that's
a sustainable option because you know
people who honored contract I mean
eventually it must converge it seems
like a must revenge on our system this
is obviously the Chinese also
understanding that more and more Chinese
people returning from the US and from
the rest of the world are innovating now
as they're innovating they are going to
the government say that we're spending
all this money creating this IP we
wasn't the government to protect us
because if you don't protect our IP we
were now in a way so the pressure
because of the red and the green light
coming together they are building
internal pressure for China itself to
rise to the occasion and say hey you
know what intellectual property
protecting intellectual property is not
only good for microservices alone in
innovators for one company and we must
do that if not nobody will invest so it
is asked teaching them and they're
teaching us let me give you a case this
is the case where where Charles
Huntington book was translated in Korea
by some song without permission so they
were going to send song to give a talk
and all of a sudden samsung handed them
this book with this korean translation
and was circulated all all over this the
the corporate corporate people so so the
question was asked did you did you talk
to the publisher about translating this
book this is what what publisher no we
just treasure in the korean but that's a
violation of law so what do we do sue
them no they didn't do that these are
cost culture people they say what I mean
how much does it cost for you to do
translation Oh cost fifty thousand us oh
okay mm-hmm so they set down and you
know what they negotiated the way out ok
you have a publishing house in a samsung
group of companies why don't we make a
deal it will cost us $50,000 get
something to translate my book in Korea
you publish the book for us and we have
the rights to sell it all over Korea
thank God they got a very smart way out
of this thing first of all they didn't
have to spend a 50 downloads the blue
translation they did not embarrass the
Korean the Korean were embarrassed that
they forgot to to seek approval from
them first and then the Korean state and
they're not being there distributed for
the book and they got the way out of
this thing so again I'm not saying that
having a contract is the wrong thing to
do but I'm saying that you go into China
understand this differences and there
are people who are willing to work with
them on these differences until until
they themselves learn what is a better
way of doing things but if you're not
willing to do that then you'll be
letting much later and the barrier of
entry will be much higher so Google is
also running some problems in china for
example freedom of speech blocking
certain news and whatnot website why is
it you can understand because it's a
communicative society in how many social
harmony is the biggest thing not
democracy now you can say that it's
wrong but you know what they have
billions of people to feed and they are
worried about another term another
cultural revolution another another
foreign invasion but this is the culture
we can't change them so they place much
higher values on the social harmony and
therefore they want to control these
things but we're not trying to defend
them we're trying to say please
understand if you don't understand it
could be very difficult for you to make
do business there and and the other
alternative is to out don't play the
game but can you not play the game there
are people who toughed it out and
eventually Excel and do well okay sorry
I probably didn't answer your question
fully but purchase legitimate ok hey
Mary more question
right if that I thank you very much for
coming this afternoon to share with us
on the issue of the particles</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
