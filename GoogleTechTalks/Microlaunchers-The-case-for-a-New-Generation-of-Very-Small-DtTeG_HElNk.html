Benjamin and also Keith who couldn't be
here for this opportunity I've been
aware of google techtalks for a long
time and that for a long time we wanted
to have the privilege of being here
thank you this is the talk the case for
very small space craft you see we are in
the mainframe era of space exploration
the systems for space exploration grew
out of the Cold War 50 years plus back
and were an outgrowth of the military
ICBM technology and culture and were
very large-scale very expensive launches
tend to be very infrequent the
consequence of a failure was enormous ly
expensive and so on
access the participation was extremely
limited you could get a job with one of
the major companies but that was about
it and the progress the technical
progress was actually rather slow if you
compare the evolution of rocket engine
technology with say that of the piston
engine in an equal number of decades the
piston engine technology evolved ten
times faster than rocket technology and
that's because of the culture and the
cost structure in which both evolved as
I said it was a very very expensive and
we are still living in that same
environment today except that we have
lost the driving force back right after
the Sputnik 2 the decision to go to the
moon that's done it's over with and now
things are just coasting and it's not
going to change
it was this way with computers too they
were very big and expensive and the only
people getting get their hands on one
would be large corporations or
governments or universities and so on
and those who could learn to write
programs and applications for them would
be computer science students or
employees and so on and they were few in
number extremely expensive and there was
no large body of people working on it
then this happened
an explosion resulted this and it's
kinda changed everything quickly
suddenly many could afford the actual
experience of playing with water I
subscribe to that magnet this magazine
and oh yes it was an explosion of a kind
a social explosion the whole new culture
Cait grew up overnight people were very
excited about this there were computer
fairs user groups magazines and books
and new ways to make a living new
industries manufacturing of the hardware
grew up very quickly
one was called Apple a new community of
people were inventing new uses and
applications
there was VisiCalc there was a word star
there were games
one was called doom new class of
businesses grew up one was called Apple
and another one called Microsoft cost of
communications collapsed to near nothing
an evolutionary pathway the most
important thing about this is that it
came with an evolutionary pathway from
this to that and that's a very important
feature of
the world we know wrong button
the main thing that happened with the
computers is that it was a cultural
revolution it has transformed the entire
world this very president's all you
people are a part of it and a result of
it
a rather quickly a kind of a critical
mass was reached and we're living the
result and why I'm here is to say that
it's the mission of micro launchers to
do this in space and it can be done now
the core technologies to do this are now
available it is possible to with a
sufficiently small integrated launch
system that is sufficiently small that
you have a kind of an evolutionary
pathway that could then lead to more
more sophisticated systems bigger more
functional and so on just like from that
to this and the business opportunities
you could start with eventually when you
can evolve to the point of bringing back
regular samples from the moon or from
asteroids you could just sell lunar
regolith by the milligram put it in
jewelry or what have you
space burials all kinds of ways to make
money plus actual exploration of space
the components for doing this are here
one of the patients that triggered the
microcomputer was the appearance of
certain chips from Intel the 8008 and
8080 and so on and that kind of was a
kind of a triggering event the parts to
do this kind of thing are here now
major motors are now being used in model
airplanes that weigh less than one gram
they're very cheap CCD imagers are now
very cheap and better than what NASA was
using not that many years ago and MEMS
sensors both gyroscopes and
accelerometers are quite cheap now a
three axis accelerometer I think costs
three dollars in something cents each
diode lasers can be used for
transmitting data there there's just a
whole lot more the raw hardware
components are widely available so what
might the first kind of spacecraft be
like the the sort of baseline design
that I've been studying and pursuing is
a spacecraft wing perhaps once 200 grams
consisting mainly of a solar cell solar
cell facing the Sun there and this is
the back side of it in the shadow of the
solar cell would be a can hermetically
sealed can with the electronics in it
rather than trying to design electronics
to work on a hard vacuum just can it
that's the way the earliest satellites
did including the split neck and then
this would be a telescope that's
terrible in the laser beam which doesn't
show on this picture oh yes it barely
does - I chose a spot on the night side
of the earth for receiving the data and
that these things these wings are
radiation pressure solar panels to
maintain the orientation of the
spacecraft once it's been positioned by
an initial supply of
water in a little balloon inside here
then these panels can maintain
orientation indefinitely the panels can
alright for scale this is meant to be
about 3-inch aperture telescope the
panel's might be manipulated by
actuators similar to those used in the
one grand model airplane rudders they
weigh 20 milligrams can either be
homemade or purchased you might want to
google the term 1 gram model airplane
you'll see a community of people
building these oh there's one guy up in
the Bay Area that his I think he holds
the record at 495 milligrams
that's a motor battery two channels
steerable redder and it flies I'm sorry
yes well the reason that that's
interesting is because if you can do
that you can do this also some of the
parts piece parts and methods are
directly applicable you can buy tiny
neat neodymium magnets now there aren't
a whole lot bigger than a grain of sand
or any size bigger than you want so you
can make little actuators in a zero-g
environment it's very simple to engineer
actuators for the joints to rotate and
deploy these to maintain the orientation
this is another diagram with just the
parts labeled total power budget need
only be a couple watts to maintain a 30
milliwatts about a quarter of a water so
and there isn't a whole lot else
required in terms of power earlier on I
was using the figure seven centimeters
as the aperture in reality it may turn
out to be seven point six three inch
because that's a common size of silicon
wafer that you can buy rather cheap
silicon is an excellent material for
making mirrors and their light you can
buy them from in thicknesses up from a
couple hundred microns up to three
millimeters anywhere in between
the parts are available this is just a
schematic a notional drawing of the
mechanism of the baseline type of
satellite the telescope would rotate
with the mirror parked behind the solar
cell and then in deployment it would
rotate out into the operating position
the angular separation between the earth
and the Sun would generally have to be
more than five degrees or so it would
initially expand out to say twenty or
thirty degrees then narrow it down for
reasons that will become apparent a
little bit later and then could open up
again the idea is for this to go into an
orbit that's slightly outside that of
Earth so that you can have have it
appear in the night sky all the time
easier to deal with that background then
later through a process of evolution you
can pick a laser signal out of the
daytime sky this here beam is if this is
three milliwatts that's 10 to the 16th
power per second photons and you can
send a lot of information with that more
importantly if you're in doing the
business you write your own specs and
you say how much the data rate has to be
not somebody else I'll answer to be more
than zero and be capable of evolving
this is a deployment process of that
original notion of the spacecraft where
the telescope has a kind of 1/2 tube and
the mirror can be positioned initially
behind the solar cell and ahead of the
electronic package and then the
deployment process it rotates around be
driven by a little knot gear reduction
but a speed reduction motor that turns
in the opposite direction and there
would be a very tiny fly wheel on the
motor so the net angular momentum of
this and the motor be 0 and then the
only rotation of the motor of the the of
this is to maintain the sun-earth angle
and then the spacecraft itself would
rotate around the Sun axis to keep this
trained on the earth a CCD that's part
of
we'll be maintaining the earth image
location and that will be apparent
shortly the schematic of the initial
notional form of telescope this would be
a silicon mirror when I first worked out
the numbers I arbitrarily chose out of a
catalogue two millimeter thick ground so
that the depth of the parabola was 1
millimeter but you can actually cut it
much finer than that this would be about
an f/8 and then 7 centimeter diameter
silicon has a very high thermal
conductivity so it'll be pretty easy to
prevent thermal gradients from appearing
across the mirror which is helpful and
the idea was to have maybe very thin
metal shell around the back everything
back here painted black and then you
pump heat in or out to maintain whatever
the temperature you wish it to be
perhaps that the temperature of the
thing was ground at so that's why I
wrote 300k right there front surface of
mirror will of course be silver door
aluminium and have a very low emissivity
so the temperature of the mirror would
be almost precisely the internal
radiation there would be a 45 degree
dichroic mirror which acts as a
Newtonian telescope to take the presumed
infrared light from the earth
and I was choosing 780 nanometers
because that's a common wavelength for
fairly high-powered laser diodes you can
now get them up to several watch and
this decorative mirror reflects anything
longer than about 700 so it would be
directed to the CCD which then images
the earth and that's used for steering
and positioning the telescope then
mechanically aligned with a chosen quad
of pixels of the CCD would be the laser
position and the task man of the system
is to maintain the laser at a chosen
place on the night side of the earth
from a typical distance of 0.12 typical
near-earth asteroid territory
the laser spot might be say 150
kilometers across let's see what else
here laser itself I was assuming 650
nanometers that may be what this one is
most of the cheap pointers are 650 and
the original generation of disks optical
discs are 615 then here's the numbers a
little bit of number crunching from
alayzard downlink assuming 30 milliwatts
10 times this and that's 10 to the 17th
photons a second and resolution limited
7 centimeter aperture would confine the
beam to about of being width of around
to our seconds that's about 10 to the
minus tenth of a stir idiom and then
when you work out all the numbers you
can get down to the earth with a half
metre telescope which is ambitious
amateur great telescope over a million
photons per second and after all the
losses in the telescope and the kind of
diode being used you may be able to
count two to three hundred thousand
events per second and then you build
your data right out of that first you
would start with something very crude
and simple perhaps several hundred
counts per bit and then later evolve
more sophisticated ways of interpreting
float on two bits and there's a lot of
technology out there and a lot of people
are good at it but the idea that start
simple with an evolutionary pathway for
the uplink I was assuming about a
quarter of a lot coming from the earth
same to arc second beam width and and
then there would be after a filter
somewhere around 10 to the fifth counts
per second given that see CDs that are
now available have a noise background or
a leakage dark current of less than one
electron per second per pixel it's not
very hard to
the background is what the earth might
look like from the camera with the vow
to actually be an infrared color not red
oh there is the typical initial class of
launches is going to place the space
spacecraft slightly south of the
equatorial the plane of the Earth orbit
so the part of the earth will tend to be
mostly on the southern hemisphere and
then the Sun angle is going to depend on
as how it is as the earth is passing it
and then the the task is to decide where
to plant the beam for receiving the
camera since it's the device for
detecting uplink data its entire area
can receive data from anywhere on earth
and then with an appropriate password
you can then instruct the beam to be
moved over let's say that's cloudy in
Denver and you have to shove it over to
Flagstaff and you send up the
information and you good oh they're all
over the map typically on the order of
10 microns
what matters is a number of pixels in an
array oh yes well the pixel of a CCD
might be 10 microns of square that's
typical
yeah that's not important the the CCD
would be imaging the entire earth and
using a little bit of either secretary
or software to read the outer part of
the earth Crescent to accurately map any
location on the night side of the earth
and then you would have mechanically
assigned a the intersection of four
pixels that are somewhere near the
middle of the CCD there's mechanically
built-in at the time you fabricate the
laser and CCD holding the fixture and
the with fairly simple circuitry you can
identify the spot which would be smaller
than the dimension of a pixel locate its
position to within a tenth or so of a
pixel so that the pointing accuracy of
the system will be half an arcsecond or
better and then the gross position of
the spacecraft would be the course
pointing several and then a finer servo
could be something similar to those used
in those cd-roms those are precise two
positional accuracy of a few tens of
nanometer and they're very simple to
make
notional initial family of launches that
would be toward the east and the late
afternoon using the Earth's horizon and
the Sun as the references for guiding
the direct descent to escape and that
would put it on a an orbit that is a
slightly exceeding the speed of the
earth at the time of launch so its orbit
will be entirely or mainly outside of
the Earth orbit going out toward Mars if
you exceed by I think it's around four
hundred meters per second the escape
velocity and then you will pass the
orbit of Mars it doesn't take very much
beyond escape and the idea is here's
monthly line of sights to the spacecraft
six months after and the
the implication here is that for the
better part of the first year after
launch it's in the night sky and easy to
track an actual encounter for
photographing an asteroid would probably
be engineered so that the passing is
done fairly soon after launch within a
month or so I didn't get to read it but
there was an incident posted a couple
days ago where an asteroid came very
close little asteroid came very close to
here and of course we've got Apophis to
talk about the one that could
conceivably maybe who knows hit in 2035
anyway
this would be a typical thing if you go
to the website that JPL runs which is
linkable off my website more than one a
day they list the new ones as they come
up and the Miss distance has listed
either as kilometers excuse me fractions
of an astronomical unit which is in
round numbers 150 million kilometers or
multiples of the lunar distance and
there are plenty of them to shoot at so
whenever the equipment is ready there
will be one to shoot at to take pictures
up and then as the technology evolves
and and you have a low thrust propulsion
capability built into the spacecraft
then you can attempt to rendezvous with
one and then orbit it and then be taking
pictures of it for weeks or however long
the electronics will last
while it's orbiting and maybe invent
little tiny spider like things that
could be kicked free of the spacecraft
by a spring with enough velocity to
counter the orbit velocity so it'll drop
straight down and you have something
quite a few years ago back in 93 when I
was president of a rocket amateur rocket
club called the Pacific rock society
some people in NSS National Space
Society put up some money to fund the
development of what was to have been the
first amateur rocket to reach space and
at that time they set the limit at 50
miles
later our calculations show that this
would exceed 100 kilometers and this was
a rocket using lakhs and 75 percent
ethanol the to fuel and it was to be 2/3
by a mass propellant in other words the
takeoff weight was 67% propellant and
the tanks were a set of six irrigation
tubing tanks tubes four inch diameter by
15 feet long and they held altogether
200 litres of propellant and the
hardware worked this is the rather ugly
engine this is regular four inch
scheduled 10 steel pipe and inside of
that by fortuitous accident of pipe
sizes and whatnot copper pipe fits
inside that with just enough radial
clearance inside to make a fairly good
set of passages for the regen cooling
using the fuel as the coolant this
engine looks a bit funny because there
are three inlets the original design was
to have a valve on the bottom of each of
the tanks and an independent connection
to the engine and each valve would have
been regulated to see that all of the
propellants drained equally from the
tanks so that no tanker ran dry before
others that helps with the rocket
performance because the engine will tend
to quit if either of the propellants
runs out first and then whatever's left
they call it residual and it's dead
weight this works
unfortunately the organization cants at
launcher with the help of some friends
running some calculations we went
through some sample designs of two or
three forms of micro launch air vehicle
and one was to be directed at the
population of people who are making tam
sets that's this exact size and shape
and maximum weight of 350 grams which
happens to be the weight of a full can
of beer so I think that's where the
inspiration came from
one of the criteria was to see that the
vehicles at least first age would stay
under a certain total size that's this
size Newton seconds of total impulse
this is how the FAA classifies rocket
size it's under that it would be called
now with the new regulations a class
three high-power amateur rocket and if
it can be kept under that size the
regulatory situation is much much much
simpler so that's where to start and
then when you're able to operate this as
an amateur rocket and stay within the
limits imposed you can build launch
experience get the hardware working well
each launch me on that cost about a
hundred dollars mainly the Expendables
and if you recover the rocket it is if
if the rocket has to get bent then of
course would be a little more and then
later scale up the size of the rocket a
CubeSat rocket would be somewhat larger
our calculations showed between one and
two hundred kilograms to place a 1
kilogram CubeSat to elio or about 100
grams to escape and that was to be
defined as the entry level ml one entry
level micro launcher vehicle then
something new came along and I'll get to
that shortly the end prize calculations
spreadsheet calculations for planning
the ascent of the first stage we're done
and the what this plot shows is two
different circumstance one where the
engine was simply run at full throttle
all the way and this curve here is the
cue or dynamic pressure
one of the main stresses on a first
stage of a rocket as it's climbing and
then the other was where I would use
that pitot tube to serve all the engine
to flatten the cue to some arbitrarily
chosen maximum value the one for this
calculation is 33 kilo Pascal's which is
equal to about 450 knots a coolant
airspeed at sea level in the aircraft
they call that ki AS that's not
indicated airspeed
it's what a p22 would read on an
airplane regardless of your altitude and
then this curtain this peaky curve here
is the velocity and then this curve here
is the ascent to peak ascent he didn't
bother plotting the return in both cases
the peak altitude exceeded 100
kilometers that's 100 right there and it
showed that Oh in both cases this rocket
was 60 percent propellant at liftoff or
a mass ratio of two and a half and it's
eminently practical in scaling down the
size of a rocket various ratios of
physical processes change and one of the
things that impairs some of the
performance of very small rockets is Air
drag being a larger fraction of the
total energy required but it turns out
to be quite doable and quite manageable
the upper stages would be working in a
hard vacuum and rockets of even 10
Newton thrust one kilogram thrust worked
nearly almost as well as larger engines
this might be a typical trajectory for
the first stage and staging where the
first stage would accelerate as quickly
as possible at maximum engine thrust and
then at some point when the pitot tube
showed Q rising to the point where it
had to be limited the engine would be
throttled down to maintain the q to be
constant then at some point the engine
would gradually be throttling up as more
and more of the load was due to
acceleration then at some point the
engine will return to 100% thrust
continue rising to thinner air and then
the Q would diminish and then at around
thirty kilometers altitude the main
propellant would be depleted and this
would reach a velocity of around 1,200
meters per second and then in this
particular design it would be desirable
to maintain the engine running at a very
low level just enough to overcome the
dry residual drag plus maybe a tenth or
one twentieth of a gravity so the
propellants you know all the stages
remain settled on the bottoms of the
tanks staging would take place perhaps
at 60 kilometers and it's substantially
a vacuum as far as engine performance
goes and then it's the two additional
stages the second stage being designed
to produce a fairly high acceleration
let's say beginning at twice gravity and
produce a total velocity increase of two
or three kilometers per second and then
the balance done by a lighter
constructed third stage at lower
acceleration by aiming to the east you
can take advantage of a free ride
courtesy of Earth's rotation and the
initial motion was to have an eastward
horizontal component to the trajectory
being up around 600 meters per second at
the peak added to that would give one
kilometer per second of eastward
velocity at the time of staging so the
to go to escape the pair had to exceed
10 kilometers per second not 11 and the
a recovery plan was being considered
which involves having cruise missile
like wings sprout and have it glide and
then be picked up taken in tow this
method might make sense for somewhat
larger stages that are contemplated here
a simpler method might be to use a
parachute
in either case air brake like panels
will be deployed while in very thin air
up here and they would produce enough
drag so that when it got down to fairly
low altitude the indicated airspeed
would be under 200 knots which is a good
enough for parachutes or the deployment
of wings
it's economics some people are into
recoverable Rockets in some or not in
the case of I'll get to that shortly the
N prized vehicle it may turn out to be
better to let it go because the hardware
cost of each four stage I'm estimating
at about two hundred dollars and if it
has to fly out out to sea it's more
expensive and risky to go out and fish
it then let it go but an expensive first
stage then the economics might go for it
doing something like this there is a lot
of interest in making stages recoverable
strategy for bringing this about means
involves a whole lot of things other
than just the rocket science one way to
think of working environments is a kind
of entropy some environments like here
or in a shop or your office or your
fiddling with one of these is cheap and
there's no regulations practically none
and then the most exotic and expensive
of the environments would be when you're
doing launches somewhere because it you
have to have a license and oddly enough
in this country you need an export
license because you're exporting
hardware to space go figure
but there it is anyway the micro
launcher work could be reduced to four
locations I'll enumerate them later and
then also the design of the equipment
and the procedures could be designed to
fit the regulatory situation as it is
now and then another key thing to work
for is a low entry threshold a because
the barrier is getting started once the
barrier is over there's going to be it's
going to be a whole lot easier for more
people to get into it making a community
good example might be what
right brothers did people work for some
time trying to make an airplane
heavier-than-air work finally they did
they invented something more important
than the airplane they invented the fact
of the airplane and that's what god
aviation started not the airplane itself
so what we need is a fact of little
launchers doesn't matter how small they
are they have to be a fact four
locations could be the shop where all
the design and fabricating and ground
tests can be done
no fa involvement whatsoever nothing
flies then the next location might be a
nearby adjacent place for low altitude
tests in uncontrolled airspace called G
airspace in aviation partners the the
requirements for flying rockets in
uncontrolled airspace amount to a 24 to
72 hour notice to the nearest air
traffic control that's it there's no
permit nothing and then a location 3
when it's necessary to fly to higher
altitudes staying within the amateur
rocket regulations you can go as high as
150 kilometers now and there are some
places within the United States where
you can do flights this high the amateur
rocket rules require that you have clear
radius around you equal the 1/4 of the
peak altitude and there are some places
in the US where you can get a 25
kilometer radius around your launch site
the Black Rock Desert in Northern Nevada
is one of them then the most exotic of
the locations would be the Space Launch
presumably it would be done on the East
Coast because the FAA would probably
require it but that's not a given it
could be that they might and allow
inland launch in the western US or West
Texas would be attractive for a vehicle
this small they may allow it but it
might be safe just to assumes you have
to launch out over the Atlantic from the
East Coast the regulatory environment
the simplest that
I should have maybe had it a separate
item up here none if it doesn't fly the
FAA doesn't care the simplest set of
regulations has to do with amateur
rockets which has been defined in fair
detail rather rigorously and it's now in
the Code of Federal Regulations and it's
also available off the FAA website that
defines that the now requirements for
hobby type rockets and they're using the
word amateur not necessarily
characterized the kind of people doing
it but it is a technical term that
refers to non-professional
non-military or non-commercial vehicles
and no longer is the time of burning of
the engine restricted used to be
restricted to 15 seconds now it is not
at all and they have set a new altitude
peak where the rocket cannot reach 150
kilometers altitude night that's 92
miles and there isn't a whole lot else
involved in this if it rises into
controlled airspace there is a procedure
where you have to file a notification 45
days in advance
then the next thing is the launch
license by the FAA which is a close to
six month long procedure somewhat
tedious and manpower intensive but it's
done and and the procedures are
precisely defined and already published
and then the oddball is export license
why they care of about exporting
something to an asteroid I do not know
yes that's a requirement of a launch
license and it depends on the
circumstance and the FAA tells you how
much you have to get vehicle this small
it'll probably be close to the minimum
that it's available it's a significant
budget item it's an annual expense
it's like car insurance
and I know people who are buying it and
yeah it just has to be on the budget
it's probably the most expensive single
item in the development project but
hopefully the small size will permit it
to be at the bottom of availability the
the weakness of the whole insurance
thing is that the government tends to
mandate insurance without mandating that
it be available and that's been a
hang-up yeah but are you gonna kill
somebody with a rock that weighs less
than a pound or reentry is another whole
kettle of fish there's a separate
licence for that so they're ahead of you
know you
oh there's in 1986 they published in the
CFR all the regulations required to
quarantine material brought in from
other planets that's done they're ahead
of us regulations well you know what
what really has to happen is that there
has to be a market for insurance then
companies will provide it there this is
so rare and done so infrequently that
there's no established market for
insurance and I think that's the main
problem I think early entry threshold
the going from power points to hardware
is a barrier few people have crossed it
and that is the main problem and that's
why people are doing it yet
a low entry level threshold that my
friends and I have been looking at it
was the CubeSat launch service there's
roughly a hundred or so in the United
States alone keeps house waiting for a
ride
somehow University built ones
the students who collaborated and
building them had will have generally
graduated long before the thing flies I
tend to term these table top spacecraft
they look great on the coffee table
and that's often as far as they get
something new came up called the end
prize a doctor Paul dear from England
proposed a kind of a whimsical thing at
a website called brain freeze it'll come
back to me
the it'll come back me to the website
it's a site where people propose strange
ideas and then the people on the site
vote for this of that ID being clever
they like the Emprise idea so much that
he decided to actually announce it as a
formal prize and he he to him he himself
is putting up the money ten thousand
pounds what happened oh I see I actually
have any bump the thing the previous I
let me see if I can go back going back
and price space burials is an
interesting possible way to make some
cash revenue back in 82 there was a
space company called space services
incorporated set up by wealthy real
estate guy in Houston area and some
others and it didn't work out very well
but in the meantime some funeral people
got together and and organized a company
designed to Purdue to place into orbit
one or so gram samples of cremated
remains for a fee and a company is now
operating call either Celeste US
incorporated or space Services
Incorporated they're using both names
interchangeably I think in their entire
history of 17 or so years they have
placed I think it's 85 sets of remains
in three of four successful satellite
launches always as secondary payloads
contracted with a launcher which I
believe has been in each case orbital
science but I'm not sure anyway 85
divided by 17 years it's not a volume
business and it will never be unless you
unless the venture owns it so launch
means and then a micro launchers vehicle
could place perhaps 100 sets samples a
way of gram or so each to escape and
perhaps reasonably charged a fee of
perhaps 10,000 per and so there's a
growth of approaching a million dollars
per flight and we seem not to be running
on a dead people so this may work it's
been studied economically and it looks
like a serious business model good work
yes
the problem with secondary payloads is
you have to find somebody with a big
expensive rock and a big expensive
payload
willing to take them on oh very small
market and I've already been talking to
some of the CubeSat
owners yeah basically they're saying
okay get the system working and then
we'll come in buy rides well that's nice
but it'll be a very small market and
again it's the low Earth orbit and it
won't be in very high volume and due to
a recent event not so long ago there's
going to be increased resistance to
populating low-earth orbit with
frivolous payloads yes
oh yeah well CubeSat ordinarily would be
coming down in a month or two because
they're not they're not putting very
high up and they're a very low mass
frontal area drag all that an end price
satellite by the way it would be lucky
if it stays up two days anyway
keeps that launch service Emprise is
this interesting low level thing where
the satellite has to wait less than 20
grams and a preliminary vehicle design
is that it could weigh 60 kilograms or
less total off the ground weight in
their rocket parlance of glow grouse
liftoff weight and that's model rocket
size the model rocket people have been
flying Rockets much bigger than that
space barrels first stage marketed as a
sounding rocket people that want to fly
experiments 200 kilometers there's a
very tiny market some people are
pursuing it and the first stage
developed as a launcher could simply use
the lifting capacity of the upper stages
as payload and flight as and signing
rocket this would make especially good
sense if this were recoverable
then it's just wear and tear for flight
and the per flight cost to lift say 10
or 15 kilograms 200 kilometers might
only be a couple hundred dollars that's
the cost it's not what what one would
charge of course what did I do
vehicle growth okay and price vehicle 60
kilogram glow and it's only an estimate
right now based on the performance of
the third stage engine there is such a
large multiplying effect with rockets
where the lower stages have to carry the
upper stages that any slight improvement
in the performance of the third stage
engine greatly permits greatly reducing
the size of the base vehicle
I made an estimate of a particular level
of performance in a vacuum of two
hundred and fifty seconds specific
impulse and the engine weighing 50 grams
and that resulted in this estimate it
should the engine specific impulse be
slightly better than 250 then this can
be actually quite a lot smaller perhaps
even half of that the next level the
so-called CubeSat launcher or the ML
entry level was to weigh between one and
two hundred kilograms off the ground
and be able to take either one kilogram
to elio or one to two hundred grams to
escape there and if you scale up the
size of the vehicle the fraction of its
gross liftoff weight they could be
payload can actually increase greater
than the ratio of the vehicle itself if
they were scaled up by a factor of ten
one to two tons of thoth weight two to
three kilograms could be taken to escape
which would permit landing one full
kilogram onto lunar surface as a rule of
thumb two thirds of the mass would be
the landing means and glxp is something
worth talking about some of you may have
heard of that
and there are I believe now 18 entrance
to this the top prize is 20 million
dollars and I think only one or two of
the entrants are thinking in terms of a
vertically integrated system with their
own launch means who knows but being
able to land little things on the moon
there's a way to do business with that
some years ago I think was around the
year 2000 there was a company formed
called Luna Corp and they had some kind
of a deal with RadioShack as a sponsor
and there we're going to rent time on a
rover running around on the moon or
something
if a landing system could be as light as
a kilogram each there's nothing to stop
you from putting hundreds of Landers in
different spots on the moon we've won it
looked at eighteen I forget the total
number of sites being landed upon
there's things to be learned even if you
have two or three hundred or a thousand
sites landed upon who knows okay we've
seen this getting into this business of
how to proceed and one of the items one
of the elements of a strategy required
is to recruit various forms of health
this one in 10,000 is just a notional
figure meaning to find among the wide
population of people with wide interests
and beliefs and all that a few people
who like the idea to the point of being
ready to commit to making that happen
and I just call them one in 10,000 I
have no idea what this ratio will be
seek sponsors and angel investors
several slides back when I was showing
that spacecraft image the electronic
package of that spacecraft could be a
beverage camp they weigh 13 grams and
they're fairly well built and if they
happen to have
label still on the sides there's a
sponsorship possibility okay SBIRS
they're rather difficult and tedious and
very difficult to prepare but quite a
few companies are doing them and various
components of the system could be
subjected SBR in particular perhaps the
laser comm link and also testing the
third stage of a mm prize a vehicle
would entail building a basically
tabletop test and that's small enough so
you could be sitting right in front of
it just put on a pair of goggles and
push the button and measure its
performance and then offer that as a kit
for educational purposes or what have
you
various that could be the subject of
SBIRS also spin-off companies to market
components again the laser datalink the
engine testing kits and so on and a
spin-off company not only provides
income but it provides an opportunity
for seeking investors some of the
components that might be developed as
parts of the input of the Micro Launch
System or technically adjacent Toback
recovery method itself might be
marketable there's always been
interested in recovering drones and the
like can satin keeps that launcher for
fee the wing recovery of the stage one
could be a recoverable sounding rocket
which could be used over and over again
and money with that turboprop engine
which I've not discussed this part of
the metal launcher effort because as
rocket science goes a turbo pump engine
for the first stage doesn't make
a lot of sense unless you're trying to
make it quite a bit bigger than
initially thought about but I've been
working on a turbo pump engine design
not helium nah that's too expensive
these days there's other ways to do it
the 93 design was going to use liquid
nitrogen and a little heat exchanger and
it turns out the Russians had been doing
it for 50 years at the time I wasn't
aware of it
the Soyuz is pressurized with a liquid
nitrogen pressurizer laser datalink
optical guidance method the guidance for
both escape velocity and in prize
entrance will be entirely optically
based and I don't know to what level of
detail I'm going to be publishing that
I've decided
but anyway components could be
themselves products so the idea is that
we can try to create a community of
people a population of people with
interests who would coalesce get excited
about it work make things happen just
like with the computer and then they
would develop and improve in their
skills at making designing and operating
spacecraft and flights or missions I
prefer the word flight mission sounds to
militaria and we can open access to the
inner solar system and then to the lunar
surface nice thing about the inner solar
system is that the spacecraft are not
going to be running into each other
there's literally trillions of times as
much volume of space out there then
they'll do and based on everything I've
studied I don't think any other means of
opening a space age as such is going to
work the present large-scale systems are
going to perform as they are now meaning
basically just churn along in a kind of
a stasis where one program feeds on
another
and they're just eating each other all
the time so the idea is bring back to
70s and the hardware to do this is
available now off-the-shelf not
expensive and the key is to design this
so there can be an evolutionary pathway
so that it barely works this had four
kilobytes I think of RAM couldn't do
much except become that and then
stimulate interest and involvement
people are bored about just reading
about space and paying taxes for it
participate directly as with this and
then create a start-up venture
environment just like this was a
fountain of companies being started this
being one you know can happen so the
idea is to move past the mainframe era
of space and other questions yes
each
well okay here's the answer to that one
if you're generating the acquirements
you're free to generate the requirements
period who says that it has to be out of
line of sight why not simply build a
system that is line of sight and deal
with that for now
you don't orbit things you send them out
to between Earth and Mars and they're in
sight every night all night long yep no
way it's for a class of business
opportunities anything to do with the
moon loose high altitude lunar orbits
that are highly elliptical are energy
wise very very easy to achieve that is
you barely exceed escape and you can get
into a put something into a lunar orbit
which zips down too close to the moon
and then loops out far for initially and
then later when propulsion improves low
lunar orbit and then landings orbiting
any O's and so on a lot of things to do
why not if you're looking at Mars don't
you wait until it's up there again when
it sets you wait
yeah but why not first just make the
business work at all cross the threshold
and then build things in other words
evolve yeah yeah so excuse me the place
to walk is line-of-sight restrictions
imposed by this this method and then
evolved from there a way to get around
the line-of-sight problem is of course
to design and deploy someday some kind
of a space floating relay for that might
be in a halo orbit beyond the earth-sun
system and be able to relay any time
something from far in the solar system
but all that as far away there's no
point in even thinking about it except
to create now in the
an evolutionary pathway it could lead
there well okay this whole elio
satellite business all they are are
collisions waiting to happen
and besides okay here's one remember
Heinlein's famous remark you get to
low-earth orbit and you're halfway to
anywhere in the solar system well get to
low Earth orbit in you're only halfway
to anywhere in the solar system space
exploration
no longer there's nothing to discover
within the gravity field of the earth
yeah but support services meaning what
are you trying to integrate yourself
with it
yeah or collide with things or they
collide with each other and generate a
field of debris that threatens
everything in any case low Earth orbit
is okay but fixating on that is to me
pointless because there's really nothing
much to discover in low-earth orbit and
all you do is well it's just limited
things you can do space begins beyond
escape velocity or onto the onto the
moon which is basically beyond escape
velocity so why not just start there
yeah it's alright maybe one way is
finding a paying customer who would pay
for this or that service involving
low-earth orbit
absent a paying customer it doesn't seem
to make much sense at least that's the
notion that based this on and low-earth
orbit again the satellites are hidden
from view ninety-nine percent of the
time and then when they are above the
horizon they're zipping right across the
sky in a way that's hard to track
whereas something in between Earth and
Mars is moving so slowly across the sky
than any astronomer can reacquire and
point his telescope at any telescope
with this big and after jerk can take
the data down you can have data parties
just like they have star parties and you
could maybe even have contests where
they would have coded data sent at
various rates and whoever gets it all
gets a prize or something on earth yeah
the only hardware project that I've got
into was that old 93 design but
unfortunately the organization came
undone the design is going to be based
on extrapolations of that technology and
forward and that's basically it even
though I'm located in Mojave California
the opportunities to fly things there
aren't very great
I've not been bothering to fly amateur
Rockets as such because they don't
contribute to the level of technology
needed for this kind of thing oh I'm
sorry
to reach the threshold when the shop can
be built somewhere in the United States
and one of the possible locations might
be Southern Nevada and then developing
on the ground some of the critical
hardware components and then beginning
to fly them in the previous slide I
can't look at it quickly
the one where I showed the set of
environments for working the ideas is to
design the the work the project so that
you start in the simplest environment
first and a certain amount of commercial
products could be to develop without
flying something and encountering the
regulation problem then the next step
would be the amateur rocket rules which
are pretty simple to cope with any other
questions yeah
I'm sorry I'd miss okay there's been a
lot of proposals for trying to
rendezvous with space junk and bring it
down in the orbiter I would think and a
lot of people also think that the
expense and difficulty doing that is so
great and there is so much quantity of
little bitty parts there's no way you
could make a business plan of trying to
pick them up it's very difficult what
the only efficient way to use a rocket
is to build all the all the velocity as
close to the ground as possible just
clear of the atmosphere so you have a
vacuum and then close the rest of the
way doing any of these kind of maneuvers
we have to take quantities of propellant
it gets to be very expensive for example
geostationary orbits are required almost
as much propellant and landing on the
moon and definitely more than a lunar
orbit
No oh yeah because you could do orbit
something and drop in yeah and reach the
earth but again what's there what does
that lead to okay
a grant why not I've heard several
proposals that Elio proposed it might be
worth thinking about one was to be able
to develop a reusable say five kilogram
re-entry vehicle that you could place
into orbit run experiments for people
for a fee then have it come back several
weeks later I suppose but you'd have to
charge a lot for it and you have another
special license for a reentry vehicle to
deal with yeah you mean spacecraft not
satellite yeah
Ferenc a good question the fairing is
part of the first stage so it can be
fairly heavy and it only goes up 60
kilometers the the notion there was the
spacecraft would fold itself up in some
way and I don't know what the f number
of the telescope has to be whether it
might be worth grinding mirrors that are
f4 or something I don't know but you can
I I've seen listings of off-the-shelf
product that's up to three millimeter
thick oh the mass isn't the question the
estimated mass for the two millimeter
thick one was 15 grams in other words
that's not the the real issue I agree
yeah I'm not sure it's really that
necessary to have f2 or f3 what's wrong
with f8 yeah
what except the easiest way is to have a
flat silicon disk that your car polish a
regular parabola shape and why not start
with what simple and then evolve from
there and the amount of expertise in
making small telescopes is vast that's
yes but what vibration that's the deal
is it should be done nothing's moving
nothing's crawling nothing if the
telescope's is designed right I was
thinking in terms of a drive mechanics
that has a certain amount of gear
reduction or but probably not using
actual gears let's say a thousand to one
and then have the moment of it and have
that says the motor rotates in the
opposite direction to the telescope's
rotation and have a small flywheel with
enough inertia yes
why would the structure change shape
yeah buddy if the mechanics is designed
right on the first order there will be
no angular change in the spacecraft
position at all you can cancel it
all right this is a level of detail
that's not necessary to get involved in
right now but the minor pointing of
shifting the in spot on the night side
of the earth from say Arizona to Texas
is such a small change that a second
level servo that I was assuming was
going to be part of the mechanism not
shown here was that for a given
spacecraft position the CCD or one of
the optical elements can cause a image
to divert Bay maybe an arc minute and
that would take out any disturbances in
the spacecraft or whatever especially if
it happened to have onboard propulsion
which so far yes the radiation pressure
is ample in terms of the amount of force
it produces for this in fact it wasn't
the first of the Mariners didn't they
use radiation panels on the outboard
ends of the solar panels there were
angled little paddles I believe that's
what they were for in 1964 okay I think
it was yeah okay thank you so much I
