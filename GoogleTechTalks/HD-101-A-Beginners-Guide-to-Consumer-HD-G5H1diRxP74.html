company called advanced systems group
and we're one of the contractors here on
campus and our primary responsibility
here on campus is helping design and
build facilities for the video
production group sometimes known as the
media kitchen and then we work quite a
bit with the events production team in
gym bastola will be speaking with me
this afternoon on the larger venues and
recording in the integration of those
types of facilities maiko speaker today
will be Brian ruts who's from a company
called aja and aja is a vendor to us and
to Google and they make all kinds of
devices that help record and interface
various types of video here at Google
but Brian is an excellent speaker and
will be speaking on some of the topics
regarding compression and formats and
those types of things and and we even
give him a little bit of credit because
he's Canadian so all right so what we're
going to talk about today primarily is
it is HD in consumer formats this
morning this afternoon will be doing the
talk more about professional formats and
acquisition and post-production but what
we want to concentrate on this morning
is how does this affect at home what am
i doing if I if I want to see HD there
or in a venue and so we're going to
cover some interesting topics like
aspect ratios things like what is 16 by
9 vs 4 by 3 mean or what is progressive
besides an insurance company and what is
interlacing and things like gops or
GOP's as we call them and then one of my
favorites which is you know is plasma
something you only get at the hospital
and of course the last part is you know
what is an acronym if you work at Google
you probably know that already
so one of the things that's facing
everybody at home is that digital
transmission here in the United States
is about to be not only a reality but
the only reality that's going to be a
very different world for a lot of people
who have television sets sitting at home
with rabbit ears on them for people who
have cable boxes it may not they may not
even notice but for the people who
actually do watch what we call
terrestrial TV it's going to be very
different because the FCC has decided to
finally repurpose what was the original
analog television channels so we're
finding a lot of people are pretty
interested in this because the world's
going to look pretty different
digital transmission in the United
States or terrestrial transmission as we
call it is a subset of the possibilities
of things that can happen in high
definition these are the formats that
are legal to broadcast over the air
today as today and in February and as
matter of fact come februari a smaller
set of this even ATSC is the American
television standards committee which
replaced a committee that was disbanded
roughly in 1961 which was called the
NTSC which was the national television
standards committee or in our industry
usually call it D never twice the same
color committee the HD in our world for
broadcast purposes comes in two
different pixel aspect ratios 720 x 1280
and 1080 x 1920 everything that we've
known up to now has been in a raster
size that's basically been what we've
called for 3 which is 480 pixels by 720
pixels more or less we also have
different frame rates that are going to
be affecting us in the ATSC standard
then we've had up to now all television
in the United States that's been
broadcast in any way shape or form has
run it basically 30 frames per second in
fact it's really 29.97 frames per second
but that's been the way it's been the
ATSC standard actually will give
broadcasters the ability to if they
choose to broadcast different frame
rates for different types of looks and
different types of reasons including
possibly controlling how much bandwidth
they're using sit here
alright so how many of you have HD TVs
at home and have seen this great thing
where the picture goes wider narrower
wider there or sometimes there's bars on
the side and this is the nasty
transition point that we're going to be
dealing with for a while between the
aspect ratios that are part of the 80s a
high definition standard versus what we
have been used to which has been the a
four by three standard HD when they
designed it was decided to be make it
more like the aspect ratios we were used
to when we go to a film house or a more
of a theater type experience this has a
lot of benefits in from a production
point of view especially it means that
as they shoot film or the shoot HD it's
a lot easier to repurpose material
between seeing it in the theater and
seeing at home up to now we've dealt
with a lot of what are called panin
scans so you're watching a show at home
on cable TV and it's four by three and
you know that when you saw it in the
theater there was another character it
was off to the side here that you're not
seeing now so the idea was to
rationalize that and make it fit better
so HD all the HD formats that are
brought legal under ATSC are sixteen by
nine as an aspect ratio and at a raster
size of either what we call 1080 which
is 1080 pixels by 1920 pixels or there
720 as we call it which is 720 pixels x
1280 pixels so this was to kind of
illustrate what I was talking about with
the issue of the sixteen by nine vs vs
43 and what we've been dealing with for
as long as television has existed so
wide screen is typically sixteen by nine
and in their spectra show as I was
talking about one of the things that's
really different and was taken into
account during the 80s see design is
that all the formats today in broadcast
HD are
we're pixel formats and that was really
done to line things up better with the
computer world so that we would not have
this issue of things looking wider and
narrower wider and narrower then in the
older standard everything was 720 x well
we used to say 480 but it was really 486
it's just that six the lines you don't
see most of the time because they're
over scanned the pixels were non square
which meant that if you do something in
Photoshop or then pulled it into a
television application like you're any
editing application it looked strange
and stretched and then the other thing
is you know today for a long time we're
still going to be dealing with this back
and forth world you know there's
millions of hours of material in four by
three and people are going to have wide
screens so how are we going to deal with
that how are we going to see you know
accommodate that is it going to be black
bars down the side there's what's called
up conversion and scaling which would
take that image and scale it up but now
you have to crop the top and bottom but
I filled the side to side so it's a
little more visually appealing other
than the fact that you might be missing
the top of the character's head and then
we have the inverse of the problem that
we've had all these years with four by
three TV with video with film acquired
assets which was the pan and scan issue
so what they did to accommodate the fact
that this character was off to the right
when I'm in four by three mode is they
would have literally moved the camera
across the film that was turning this
into video so that I could see the guy
over here well now we have sort of the
opposite problem when I scale that four
by three material up to fill the bars on
the side on 16 by nine now I have to pan
and scan up and down to make sure I'm
not missing the tops of people's heads
and things like that
so this is something that I think a lot
of people don't realize when you talk
about HD it's really kind of a scary
thing because HD is kind of like saying
tires all that tells you it is a round
thing that you might put air in HD is
almost as wide when we say those words
all of these formats that you see on
here in some place are considered HD
with the exception of the very top line
and so that's a very confusing thing
especially if I go to out to bestbuy and
go buy myself an HD camera and then I go
shoot some stuff and I start downloading
it on my computer and now I want to play
it back on the LCD in my living room the
results may not be what you expected as
a matter of fact it may not even play on
your television set because you might be
out of raster from what the formats it
supports and that's a very common
problem and you'll notice that some of
these are kind of different aspect
ratios as well some are new one right in
the middle the 1035 x 10 x 30 is 17 x 9
in an interlaced format and we'll talk
about interlace and progressive in a
moment the point being that any time you
do anything in HD you kind of got to
know what you started with and what
you're going to display it on whether
it's at your home or whether it's here
at Google or whether it's in a
professional application because there's
no guarantee of what is what's got what
it's going to look like depends on the
LCD you buy oh I'm sorry the question
was what is raster height and width on
an LCD it can be almost anything there
are lcds that are 640 by 480 and lcds
that are 2048 x x 9 x 1280 again you
actually really have to look at the
specification for the one you're
thinking about buying and one point that
does bring up is that there are very few
displays that you can buy today that are
in fact really 1920 x
1080 most of them are some other pixel
aspect quantity hopefully in the right
aspect ratio because of manufacturing
constraints it's very difficult to
manufacture a display that has that many
pixels still so most displays that you
buy today that are HD are still not
actually that many pixels there will be
less they'll be 1366 x 768 or 1280 x 720
it's only the ones that actually have
1920 x 1080 that are what we call pixel
for pixel does that enter your the
question hmm I'm sorry let me go back
here no to view the last format in its
native resolution you would need a 1920
x 1080 display to see that the full the
full resolution pixels versus a raster
hard raster with are slightly different
it's confusing isn't it
and it's different than in the computer
world because you're scanning every
frame I'm going to let Brian do you want
to that's kind of if that's advanced
maybe you disaster yeah it is something
we're going to cover this afternoon
okay so one of the big differences as we
move to the new world of digital
television is that everything the old
system was all Hannah log signals moved
from place to place as completely analog
channels all the way from where they're
required to how they were recorded to
how they were played out over air when
we moved to the world of HD in
particular but anything that's DV
digital video in any way we have a
process that has to go on to be able to
record it we have an original sensor and
the center in every camera today is
analog which most people don't know and
then it goes through a process called
sampling and quantization which is
taking little samples of the analog
information then taking and recording
those at a certain rate for all for all
of the formats that are digital video
today that creates more data than we
know how to record in any physical
mediums today other than directly to a
hard drive array so the last step almost
always includes some compression codec
and we'll talk about compression codecs
in the sense of consumer delivery in
Brian's part of the talk okay how many
of you ever have heard the terms of you
know 1080p seems to be the thing that
everybody puts into you know their their
best buy a door the radio commercials
1080p so what is progressive vs.
interlaced all video up to now in
standard def that you've seen in
broadcast has been in an interlaced
format progressive frames are where the
entire frame has captured or played out
at once in an interlaced frame they
alternate this was done effectively as a
compression method in analog TV
and if you look at the composited frame
at the bottom row at 32 second that's in
fact what actually is played out but
your eye doesn't perceive that your eye
sees that put back together
so the reason for using interlacing our
that they were it reduces bandwidth the
reason to use progressive is it in blue
improves vertical resolution probably
most people here don't remember when we
actually had interlaced displays on
computers but let's just say moving to
progressive was a was it was a very nice
leading to where we have graphics that
we can actually see today on screen
progressive has less motion artifacts
progressive reduces compression
artifacts which when brian gets talking
about MPEG will be pretty apparent and
progressive to interlace conversion is
easy whereas interlace to progressive is
not so easy now this comes back to both
what you'll see in broadcast today one
of the slides i didn't put up that I
should have those the world of broadcast
TV today is split between progressive
and interlace formats as you saw in that
table both are possible so some of the
major networks such as ABC and fox have
chosen to go with progressive formats
others such as CBS and NBC have chosen
to go with interlace formats and that
has to do with how they want to use the
bandwidth that's available to them and I
think that's one of the biggest
differences that we see as we think
about delivery of television to homes
today that there is it's all about
bandwidth and as you start to look at
terrestrial TV you'll find out pretty
soon that most of these stations have
the option of broadcasting multiple
channels simultaneously now so they're
going to choose what their broadcast
main format is in order to save
bandwidth so they might be able to run
two or three channels at the same time
now up to now we've talked mostly about
what's ATSC formats which are what are
legal for broadcast in order required by
the FCC the other part of consumer HD
today is what we call non-broadcast or
things that are that wouldn't
necessarily be legal to run out over the
air
that we've been experiencing for some
time if anybody's got a DVD player at
home most of the formats that are on
DVDs that you ranted blockbuster through
Netflix would not be broadcast legal
they are in fact encoded progressively
the DVD player has the option to play it
out with interlace and but if you try to
put that directly up on a television
transmitter you'd have a problem and
then we've continued that tradition as
we move forward into the wonderful world
of hi-def so what kinds of things would
we have at home that might be not
broadcast legal well we have blu-ray
discs finally we have a resolution in
the high-def DVD war blu-ray discs can
contain many many many different formats
and virtually none of them are broadcast
legal except for the few that you saw on
the table we have what's called DBS or
Direct broadcast satellite which would
be things like directv or dish we have
on demand over cable because there's no
requirement for the cable companies to
do anything that's 80 s illegal we have
on demand over the internet and we have
internet streaming all of which can
provide high definition formats that
wouldn't necessarily be broadcast able
what are the data rates the data rates
are actually not locked to any of those
so in other words you could do any of
those at data rates that range anywhere
from 10 megabits a second up but to in
sort of a general way blu-ray discs are
generally going to be at in the realm of
20 megabits a second atsc is around 20
most of the DBS people today are varying
the depending on their programming
between 20 and or between 12 and 20
megabits per second per channel I'm
sorry I didn't repeat the question the
question was what kind of data rates are
these different types so and of course
internet streaming could be as big as
your pipe
so why why did it why did we end up with
this again especially after spending all
this time trying to you know it took the
atsc committee over ten years to come up
with a the standard that we're rolling
out and that's because broadcast formats
are constrained because they're meant to
work at a certain point in time you
sorta have to stick a stake in the
ground and say this is where we are we
can make things that work here today and
this is what we're going to do going
forward the world of non-broadcast
doesn't have to do that they can move at
any rate that deployed technology feels
like going they don't need to adhere to
standards that that are regulated by the
government necessarily so this is one of
my favorite slides that I know you can't
read and for anybody who would like this
PDF I'll hand it off so that it can be
posted with the presentation from a one
of event a vendor called Miranda but I
wanted to give you a sense for how
unbelievably flexible and complicated
television is today that in the middle
are all of the possible aspect ratios
and conversions that every television
station has to deal with today the
bottom left are the plethora of formats
and their data rates and up on the right
are various codecs and their compression
schemes and then in the upper left are
all of the possible rasters that exist
today that are currently in production
someplace and this is completely
different from the days of when we had
ntsc television here where that entire
poster would have been less than one box
of this question in the back
that is worldwide but but it in America
it compasses roughly three quarters of
that the question was as this just in
America or worldwide all right so I want
to talk a little bit about different
display technologies and I'm going to
this is sort of a fifty thousand foot
view one of the but we get questions all
the time about various display
technologies that can be used to do HD
the big ones that everybody sees today
are plasma LCD and projection and they
each have advantages and disadvantages
so plasma was one of the first really
widely available HD formats what the big
advantage of it is that it's extremely
bright it has very low motion artifacts
it has very low latency because of the
way the display actually is built and
that it's easier to achieve what in the
consumer world is black ratios if you
look at different kinds of displays and
you'll see in the shadows where you
think God something ought to be black
and it's gray that's that's what they
typically talk about when they say you
know three thousand to one black you
know black ratio well that's the ratio
between the brightest pixel and off
that's displayed in theory and so
because a plasma is not black backlit
and doesn't have a filter effectively
when it's off its off no downside to
plasmas are that they because there are
large gas charged too they use quite a
bit of energy if you leave an image up
on them for a long time they will tend
to burn in in the way CRTs used to burn
in which we've kind of learned to not
have to deal with and they don't come
into what in a very wide variety of
sizes although some of them are pretty
amazing they don't get very small but
plasmas get very very large their
plasmas today I think the largest one
that's currently shipping is 108 inches
diagonally and they've announced 153 I
can't imagine what it weighs but lcds we
see lots and lots of LCDs everybody who
has a laptop in this room right now has
an LCD LCDs can be made to very high
resolution the energy consumption is
very low generally they're backlit with
either fluorescent tubes or about to
beginning to see LED backlit which gives
us better color imaging they don't have
burning issues because of that and
because of the type of technology they
can be made very small we've all got
them on our cell phones they use and now
the downside is that because of the
latency of the pixels and how an LCD
changes its colour they tend to have
more motion artifacts so for instance if
you go to the big-box TV store and
you're watching a soccer game and you
watch closely you'll see on the most of
the LCD TVs you'll see some amount of
image smear if you look at the plasmas
you won't see that and that's because of
the amount of time it takes for a pixel
to turn from on to off or off to on in
LCD technology also lcds are effectively
a filter what you're when you look at an
LCD you've got a light behind it and
you've got the display in front of it so
how dark and off can be or black can be
is a very tricky thing in LCD so they
tend to not display blacks as well as
plasmas especially in very large screens
and then we have projection displays
projection displays are kind of a
mismatch because they internally have a
lot of different technologies that they
use like for instance the one you're
watching right now uses a technology
called DLP and dlp uses these little
tiny microscopic mirrors to focus the
light but there are also LCDs that go in
in projectors and they're also beginning
to be what's called L cos which is
liquid crystalline silicon to
splice the nice thing about projectors
is that they can they're designed to
make very large images so if I want to
have a home theater at home and I want
to have you know big theater type
experience projectors are really nice
they can be very high resolution because
of the types of designs and the fact
that they can use processing on the
image displays and generally they're not
subject to burn in not in today's world
on the other hand as anybody who's
seeing directly below that projector
knows it's makes some energy you might
even be able to feel the heat coming off
of it uses energy they can be noisy they
have to be cooled because you've got a
very bright light source and they have
the highest cost to maintain because you
use high energy lamps that degrade over
time and eventually burn out so
projection has that cost as a trade-off
so which one works best for you is
always a question for your venue in your
personal taste the last part I wanted to
talk about before I tub Brian talked
about HD acquisition what happens if i
go buy a camcorder today was how does
this stuff get interconnected in the old
days we had composite video and we had
one you know one wire went from here to
there and it carried the whole signal to
do high def requires at a minimum that
we have an analog component connection
there is no in there is no composite
multiplex together HD signal today other
than if I'm running it in a HD in a
broadcast format and you can transmit
audio over an analog format and I didn't
cover audio a great deal in here but
that's really for another day but
suffice it to say that all of the HD
formats are capable of carrying
multi-channel audio in the same way
you're used to with your DVDs the
primary ways of moving HD today in the
consumer world are either DVI or what's
called HDMI which are the digital in
turn X that we see on almost every
display today and DV is of course very
prevalent on computers part of the
reason for moving to 82 digital
interconnects was for quality to be able
to move things without the degradation
of analog transmission but the other
reason there was a much bigger motivator
for the content producers was copy
protection and this will come up a lot
as you look at things that you would buy
for home and this content this concept
of what's called hdcp hdcp is the high
bandwidth digital content protection
specification it was originally from
Intel it was it's what we call it drm or
a digital rights management scheme it
can be incredibly infuriating to deal
with and I would recommend that as you
look at things to use in your deployment
of HD you be very very aware of hdcp in
the design of this room hdcp became a
very big issue in order to keep piracy
down everything that is broadcast
digitally today has drm built into it
whether it's coming over the air whether
it's coming off a blu-ray disc whether
it's coming through your directv setup
and this allows the content rights owner
to control what you can do with it can i
record it what kind of display can it be
played on can i record can i duplicate
it if I've recorded it can I make more
than one copy and this is built into
blu-ray players it's built into your
comcast box and it can really be a
problem especially the one that you run
into most often is you go out and you
buy a projector and it's only got an
analog set of inputs i hook it up to my
friendly blu-ray player and all I can
see is 480 standard def now I can see it
in progressive or I can see it in
progressive but I can't see it beyond
that
and why is that it's because of the fact
that they have limited that blu-ray disc
so that it will only show
high-definition output on a legal
display so you cannot make a copy of it
they know that analog is easy to capture
these digitally controlled formats are
almost impossible and so this is
something that I really want to caution
everybody about it's something to pay
attention to it's easy to go buy it TV
or display get it home and find out very
quickly that you can't get from here to
there or my AV receiver that I wanted to
use only has component analog through it
and all of a sudden you're like I have
to buy a new receiver these are these
are major issues but they're done to
protect the rights holders because
piracy is a major major issue question
here I have a question about the plasma
displays do they still have the
brightness issue where over time gee
degrading yeah not as much but yes it is
a you know it's a charged particle
environment and over time they will
degrade we're seeing much less of it now
than we used to and generally some other
part of the plasma fails before the
display itself does any longer like the
power supply or something like that but
but yes it's you know it's part of the
physics of the display but they have
improved a lot along with the burning
issue and they deal with the burning
issue but now by having DSP watch what's
going on on any given pixel and if it
stays there too long they move them
adjacently back and forth a couple of
pixels to keep it from burning I I was
wondering about LED technology will
there be you know will they be making
LED monitors as opposed to LCD or LED
displays exist already and you see when
you see them when you go to large venues
like if you were to go to I was going to
say Pac Bell Park but I guess
this week it's AT&amp;amp;T Park and you looked
at that lar very large HD display that's
using very very large LEDs actually so a
lot of digital signage that's very large
as LEDs we don't see LEDs yet in any
consumer displays other than for
backlighting LCDs although it is being
highly touted as probably one of the
next technologies to come particularly a
format called o le D which means organic
LED other questions now I'm going to
turn it over to Brian ruts and Brian's
going to speak to you on codecs and
compression schemes and how things
relate in that part of the world amazing
thank you good morning still everybody
thanks Dave everybody wide awake because
I don't take prisoners never have never
will so we're going to condense
something dramatically condense it down
from what we normally do on these kind
of presentations but it's an idea to get
to give you an idea of just what the
heck's going on I don't know I've only
worked in television for 40 years I have
no idea what's going on now imagine 40
years my first experience of nonlinear
editing was actually cutting and
splicing quad tape while I was going to
that's two inch wide by the way tape
going while I was going to college okay
David's referred to the interlace and
progressive thing just to remind you
progressive is a full picture every time
the entire resolution you see in each
frame as you look at it interlace as
Dave mentioned was a form of compression
so that we can incorporate color the guy
hundred years ago is that an smpte in
New York and a guide to find ntsc color
never twice the same color he described
it as buying a one-bedroom condo on
Central Park West in New York and
finding out your mother-in-law is moving
in permanently and we had to had to
accommodate color on
our existing television system and
that's what they did created this whole
interlace way of doing it in Britain
they did basically what we're doing now
for next year and saying your TV set
isn't going to work you got to get one
of these new ones when they went to
color because it was an entirely tirely
different standard interlace versus
progressive scan as Dave said well this
go you can read that faster than I can
so that's why we like progressive so we
have frame bound and non frame bound
compression and I see that calf staring
at a new gate look all over the place in
here what's he talking about now all
right frame bound compression means we
address each frame individually and we
hear terms like 4 11 that's DV 420
that's hdv for 22 and 4 for 4 and even
for four for four at the very high end
what we're looking at is a ratio the
first number refers to the luminance
samples that's the brightness and
darkness and the most important part of
our picture that's where our detail is
the color is just window dressing okay
so in this particular case for every
four samples of the luminance video we
have one each of the red and blue
information because in television that
television has to have that luminance
information RGB doesn't have that so we
don't record RGB in television because
this is a subtractive process if we were
to add the luminance which is the letter
Y designation if we added that up we'd
have our gb everybody got that correct
responses and out of the head and a yes
Brian all right so what the heck does
that mean so this imagine if you will
we're looking at a CRT here I guess it
could be an LCD or plasma but we're
looking at the extreme magnification of
the upper left-hand corner okay so each
one of these black squares represents a
picture element or pixel so in the first
pixel and there
pixel there after we look at the
luminance information there's our for
luminance samples everybody got that
good good okay got some of your rate
we're awake so in the first pixel we
sample the red information and the blue
information and that's the way we sample
the color so you can see that the color
information is shared across four pixels
that in a way is a form of compression
because we're loose reducing the amount
of signal information we have and 420
this is a when jvc introduced the hdv
format how many years ago was that Dave
for maybe 45 they they used a 420
sampling structure which is the same as
DV is in the PAL standard countries like
Europe and or England primarily and all
over the rest of the world so this is
how we did that we have the same amount
of color but the color information comes
from two different pixels to our eyes we
see no different we see no difference
whatsoever alright so mpeg-2 we've heard
that a lot right and PEG mpeg-2 mpeg-2
is not one thing Dave referred to saying
tire I refer to saying car that's what
mpeg-2 is and basically when you go to
the mechanics you're gonna get your car
worked on what does he do it wheels up
this great huge red toolbox right you've
all seen those things they starts
opening doors and he starts pulling out
drawers and mixing around looking in
there that's what mpeg-2 is mpeg-2 is a
number of profiles and levels that can
be mixed and matched and twisted and
turned and screwed up really badly and
that's what it is it's an editor's it's
a developer's dream for those of us in
television it could be a nightmare
anyway so it's interframe compression
going to explain that and the profiles
and levels that's the Cooper mutate
and combinations that can be done there
and we called a group of pictures or got
we have three three components to that
an iframe the iframe is everything we
know about that picture is in there okay
then we have B frames which are
generally bi-directional comparators
they look back and forth and the P
frames predict what's going to change so
basically all the information is in the
iframe what is in the P and the B frames
is only information having to do that
that which changes okay so that's an
extremely efficient way to transmit a
signal and to record a signal and there
are seen the bottom they're transporting
program streams in HD V so if we look at
the original HD view which is 720 30 p
it had a group of pictures of 6 that's
still considered a long gob structure so
we had an iframe followed by to be
frames a p frame to be frames and an
iframe transmission has been using
mpeg-2 for quite some time now because
it's again very efficient to take up
less bandwidth on the satellite and I
was watching for about the 7 million
time John Wayne and Rio Grande and John
Wayne was walking across the jail and it
was a three-quarter shot of the jail and
he walked from right to left across the
frame and Scotty was having trouble
beating him up because he was all
pixelated something wrong with the
transporter beam at that particular time
the floor was fine the walls the ceiling
everything else was great yeah in Rio
Grande taking place in what 1860 that's
what it looked like it looked like
because you know how in Star Trek they
went all that pixel thing when is you
know slid the sliders up made of wood
which was kind of interesting and that's
what was happening the the mpeg-2
encoder the MPEG encoder they were using
at that moment at a hiccup and because
there was so much still data in
picture the moving data got screwed up
all right so yeah then a great now after
jvc introduced the 720p version 30 p
version of hdv the interlaced version of
hdv came out and that's used by Sony and
Cannon and they used a longer group of
pictures because it's interlaced a group
of pictures of 15 so you can see here
you start to get an idea if I want to
edit here there's not enough information
there for me to commit my edit is there
there's only some data having to do with
things that move I can edit on an iframe
no trouble at all but I don't want to
add it on an iframe plus or minus 15
frames editing accuracy is totally
unacceptable plus or minus one frame is
totally unacceptable so what do we do if
I want it if I want to edit here that's
where I as an editor made my choice that
I want to edit and remember i'm editing
in the codec and code decode the hdv
codec in this particular case so I say
okay that's where I want to edit so now
i turn the cpu loose to reconstitute
that entire group of pictures to give me
15 video frames now this is obviously a
whole lot slower than what it would be
but one of the most common complaints we
get from people say oh you know I'm
editing hdv or i'm editing h.264 or
whatever it is taking so cotton-pickin
load while they're editing in the codec
which is one of the reasons at aja all
our cards have no firewire connection
you come in HD SDI high-def component
analog SDI in a real baseband video
signal because then everything's in
iframes when it goes in and you can hit
it anywhere you want and the drudgery of
waiting for all this to happen has
already been done for you
there are other ways the manufacturers
compress things for example the this
particular version of hdv actually
records 1440 x 1080 pixels not 1920 x
1080 1440 x 1080 and then on playback
subsampling brings it back up to 1920 x
1080 digital magic digital magic
panasonic with their their dvcpro 100 or
dvcpro HD they actually record 1280 x
1080 subsample on playback to bring it
up to 1920 x 1080 so it's all this magic
going on I'm a big fan of progressive
scan by the way as long as 60 frames so
we talk about film I love film guys
particularly graduates of a film college
because they buzzed with a beauty of
film and there's no question about it
film has a number of wonderful and
amazing attributes I don't believe 24
frames per second is one of them because
the image jerks because we're only
seeing 24 pictures every second when we
watch ntsc today we're seeing 60
pictures every second albeit half res so
if you can get that progressive skin
image all those images to a faster data
rate so we got seeing more pictures more
pictures 30 frames has a lot of motion
shutter in it so if the camera isn't
moving it's fine it's interesting that
when we go to the movie theater very
often the movie is being projected that
double flashed at 48 frames a second or
even 72 to reduce the motion judder we
see with our eyes so wait for years we
used to have this big thing called a
telus inning it was great fun because
when you change it from one projector to
another you can hear it all over the
building oh god question over there
sorry go ahead about double flashing is
that going to be changing anytime soon
what I'm sorry double flashing in
theaters with the well we go to digital
television probably our digital digital
sin
right i know but buying for years and
years and years we go to this the movie
and they have these really slow pans
because they don't want our eyes to go
crazy yeah it's actually funny if that
if there's a if they're actually going
to be fixing that with all the it's hard
to say there's always going to be the
purest that are going to want to shoot
on film they're not going to want to
shoot digitally I would be the last
person on the planet to say video is
going to replace film that's one of
those arguments you never want to get
into the religion and politics no I've
been a video guy on my life so the last
time I shot film was with bollocks in
college I tell people have worked in
television law is longer than the
invention of electricity when you had to
watch TV by candlelight so what we do
what we did in order to get you've heard
the term three to pull down this is a
very simple diagram of how that works we
take one film frame and the first one
goes to two fields in an interlaced
video signal the second frame goes to
three fields then two fields and three
fields hence three to pull down buddy
got that good good ok so what Sony does
in the field is they capture the camera
sees at 24 frames per second they record
to a hard drive to tape whatever mostly
harder in two fields so they do what's
called progressive segmented frame
progressive segmented frame that's a way
of getting progressive into an
interlaced look so that's just what they
do and panasonic has another way of
doing it they call it very cam recording
and what they do is they record at 60
frames progressive skin and flag the
appropriate frames digitally so that
when it plays back we see it as a 24
frame playback
variations on a theme okay so formats
will go through this really quickly
because this is mostly very high-end
stuff we've got from Thomson Viper this
is 444 you remember from the beginning
we've got four luminance samples for our
minus y our B minus y its huge amount of
data has to record to a hard drive and
this would be largely to go to a film
out go into a digital intermediate in
the post-production process and then
printing to film at the end or going to
digital cinema which is coming on like
gangbusters this is a sony version of
444 and their inner HD km format
Panasonic's 42 HD 422 these are coming
down in prices were going along here but
none of this comes into the probably
worth more than my house these days and
the HD cam format which is very popular
I mean there's all kinds of people using
HD cam for acquisition now we talked
about compression way back went way back
when when compression when I first heard
the word compression I said well what
the hell does that mean this has got to
be in the early 90s I guess and guys say
well if you take a piece of paper and
you fold it in half you fold it in half
again you fold it in half again you fold
it in half again it'll fit your pocket
so we've compressed that piece of paper
down so it will fit in the back pocket
now when we unfold that piece of paper
is it exactly the same as it was when I
went in there nope because now got
wrinkles in it I thought that was a
pretty dapper full way of describing
compression we have now got so many
different codecs and ways of making it
much much cleaner that it becomes
virtually transparent hdv editing in the
codec you can but then we get into that
group of pictures structure we talked
about excuse me so uncompressed or an
intermediate codec there's
name escapes me Dave the kodak company
which Oh down in southern continent it
doesn't matter anyway they developed a
codec that you could feed hdv into and
then edit in that codec and intermediate
codec or you could use apple's prores
422 codec or dvcpro 100 codec or
whatever the case may be so that's
pretty much it do you have any questions
on it so I know we've gone through this
at a that extremely fast rate but it
just gives you an idea of the choices we
have and all to get us to ATSC okay
thank you for your attention okay thanks
