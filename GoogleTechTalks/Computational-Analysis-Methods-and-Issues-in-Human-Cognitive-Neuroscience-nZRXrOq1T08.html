coming if you remember a couple of
months ago we had a speaker here
Aubrey Gilbert from Berkeley who was
talking about the brain and after that
talk there was definitely a lot of
interest here and she put me in touch
with one of her colleagues so today
we're really excited to have Bradley
Voytek here from Berkeley he's well he's
finishing up his ph.d and in a few
months and he's also a neuroscientist
and he's going to talk to us a little
bit more on the computational side of
how they do you know some of the work
that they do I'm not going to try to
talk a lot about about his research I
know he's going to do with justice to it
if you have questions please try to use
the mics of people in other locations
can hear you and also for the YouTube
video so with that Bradley okay so
thanks everybody for coming I'm gonna
talk a little bit now today about some
of the research that I do at Berkeley
like Ray as I said I'm finishing up my
PhD right now hopefully here in the next
few months and some of the research that
we do at Berkeley we do a lot of human
research as well as lower level like
neurobiological type stuff like I was
mentioning before the talk started so
I'm in the neuroscience institute
there's no actual department at Berkeley
for a PhD there's a Neuroscience
Institute and the research that's being
done kind of spans a wide range of
different topics so there are some
people within the Institute that are
studying like ion channels within single
cells and their structures and then
there are people doing some of the
research that I'm doing which is human
level cognitive types of research and we
run into a lot of problems in the types
of research that we do so I'm hoping to
sort of start a little bit of a dialogue
here with with people who are
experienced in some of the issues that
that may help us in our research but
before that I'm gonna talk a little bit
about my background I guess I initially
as an undergraduate was studying physics
at the University of Southern California
and I was a physics major for two years
and worked in an ultra low temperature
physics lab very briefly and after a
little bit of time in that field I
realized that wasn't exactly what I
wanted to be doing College kind of
happened and I got more interested in in
the brain and brain function and
so I ended up switching majors my junior
year to psychology because at the time
USC didn't have a neuroscience or
cognitive neuroscience type of degree so
in my junior year I switched and started
studying I took a bunch of classes on AI
programming philosophy of mind
psychology sort of a gamut of different
topics and I worked in a laboratory as
an undergraduate and as an undergraduate
RA one of my first projects was to code
a bunch of data that they had and it was
all these old text files that they'd
acquired over the years hundreds of
these text files and then I was supposed
to type everything in to an Excel
spreadsheet from the from the text files
and I thought ok this is kind of
ridiculous and the guy that was that I
was working for said oh this should take
a couple of weeks and I said no no so I
wrote a quick little C program scraped
all the data out of the text files and
then dumped him into a spreadsheet and
it took like a day and a half and I
handed it to the guy and I said ok I'm
done and it was like I may as well have
done a magic trick the guy was like
totally blown away by this and that's
when I realized that the field of
neuroscience in general could use a lot
of help and so that low loving low-level
type of programming acumen ended up
landing me a job as an RA after I
graduated at UCLA in a brain mapping
Center and I was hired as a pet
technician for those of you don't know
what that is that's positron emission
tomography which is neuro imaging
technique where they actually inject
some sort of radioactive isotope into
the body and watch the decay and they
put a person in the scanner and then
using this method they can sort of
localize function in different brain
areas and the main radioactive tracer
that was being used at the time is
something called fluorodeoxyglucose
which is basically radioactive sugar
with the idea that if you watch the
different rates that the brain takes up
sugar sugar being the main fuel for the
brain and neuronal functioning you can
get an idea of what brain areas are
working to do a certain problem the
issue with that is obviously you're
you're introducing radiation into a
person and so in order to reduce the
overall effective dose of radiation that
a person receives immediately after the
scan we had the people use the restroom
because this radioactive glucose
actually gets cleared out of the bladder
and so
when I was first hired I thought this is
really cool this is like a very
technical job I'm going to be running
this scanner and I assure you that in
the job description
the next part was certainly not listed
and that was after the people used the
restroom I had to go in with a Geiger
counter and gloves and make sure that
they didn't miss so basically I had to
go into the restroom and clean up
radioactive pee as part of my job and
despite that I still thought okay this
is a really cool field and I ended up
applying to Berkeley for a ph.d program
I actually flied to several schools
Berkeley was the only one that even gave
me an interview and I ended up going to
Berkeley and I've been there since fall
of 2004 and I'm going to talk a little
bit about my research but first a very
basic introduction this is this is my
wife and I M R from the MRI scanner at
Berkeley and it's sort of it's sort of
interesting that I think people have
these different kinds of views of what
neuroscience can and can't do and what
it currently is first of all it still
kind of allows me if I sit and think
about it that I can actually look at a
scan like this like this is actually my
brain right this is my wife's brain this
is my brain and yet that's somehow very
blase that we can do that at this point
all right like people like oh that's a
brain I've seen this you know in tons
and tons of times right and I think
that's pretty surprising still now when
I give a talk some kind of public factor
or something like this it's a very
interesting topic right it seems that
for some reason that captures people's
attention neuroscience does and so I
find it's very easy to give an
interesting type of public lecture that
that can capture people's attention a
little bit I remember watching a TED
talk about statistics right I think that
guy had a much harder time making an
interesting unit he did whereas here I
could you know throw up a couple slides
of like brain pictures and stuff like
that and you know general audiences will
go ooh neat right so I sort of have to
try and not be a little bit lazy when
I'm talking about this stuff and and I'm
going to try and talk about a little bit
of the technical side of things and
still make it interesting hopefully now
like I said there's different
conceptions about what neuroscience
isn't isn't and there's kind of
different conceptions about how the
brain works and everybody has this or a
lot of people have some sort of model in
their head of what the brain does and
how it works in psychology this
phenomenon work
people think they know how their own
psychology and psyche works that's
called folk psychology so there's also a
little bit of folk in neuroscience right
this is an article from the Atlantic I
think 2008 is Google making us stupid
and this guy was writing about the woes
of using internet searches because you
don't remember things as well as you
used to right
we're relying on search engines and
technologies and things like that and
there might be some truth to that but
you know in to certain extent this is
this represents a type of folk
psychology now a bigger type of folk
psychology that I get a lot when I do
more public lectures are certain things
like the 10% myth all right we only use
10% of our brains I hear that a lot
that's not not true if you remove 90% of
the brain I guarantee you're gonna have
some problems there's also the big
questions that I get a lot from the
general public are saying things like oh
my grandfather or grandmother has
Alzheimer's disease right what can you
tell me about that also like our men's
brains really different from women's
brains or we're listening to NPR and the
rive down here this morning and there's
a guy talking about left brain vs. right
brain right and that that like these
things might have a little bit to do
with the actual neuroscience or might
have a basis and an actual scientific
fact but for the most part there there
may be useful metaphors but they don't
actually reflect real things about the
brain but you know there is this kind of
futuristic sort of notion about the
brain is a computer and though we're
figuring everything out really quickly
and pretty soon we're gonna be able to
have as my friend keeps poking me and
prodding me specifically saying when are
we gonna get Google in our heads because
he's sick and tired of having to look
things up and not knowing things on the
fly alright but this kind of idea of
these like brain commuter interfacing is
really popular topic right now and you
know direct neural interfaces is a term
that people use right can you like
directly jack into a computer like kind
of neo whoa I know kung fu right that
stuff is really hard and I don't think
that's gonna be coming anytime soon so I
just want to kind of set the groundwork
right now and said that's not actually
what real neuroscience is like right
it's not like this it's not like you
know soon we're gonna be all jacked into
some sort of like worldwide network of
the Borg like whatever I don't know
conceptions people have you know you
have cool things this isn't actually
what happens in the lab it doesn't look
this awesome this isn't what the data
actually looks like
we're nowhere near to being at the level
of like Neuromancer or snow crash right
I think randall munroe from xkcd put it
really well in a comic a couple days ago
actually where he showed a movie science
montage where a couple of scientists are
sitting around and they're like messing
with lasers and all this high-tech
equipment and at the end they say okay
paint flecks from the killer's clothing
match an antimatter Factory in Belgrade
right and they're like if they run off
and they capture the guy right bottom
panel more accurate reflection of what
we actually do right they start
something they wait they wait they wait
and then they say okay we've determined
that there's neither barium nor radium
in the sample probably that's really
what we can kind of do yeah when you say
not anytime soon could you you go to
quantify that laughs I will not play
that game right because I might say oh
it'll be 20 years and then we'll figure
it out in two years and I'm gonna look
like a jackass alright so right these
kinds of prediction prediction
prediction problems are always an issue
right it's uh was a Bill Gates thing
like 128 kilobytes is you know surely
enough computing 640 kilobytes is surely
enough for everybody right I don't know
he didn't say it okay well right but you
have all as a scientist you hear these
cautionary tales all the time so I'm
gonna try and step back
I mean afterward I'd be happy to talk to
you about it actually though so I
encourage people to ask questions during
the talk I want this to be a little bit
more of a dialogue but and you know some
of the stuff that I will show it might
actually seem really impressive it might
seem like we're really close to this
kind of stuff and if I delve into the
methods that are being used in
neuroscience to do some of the stuff
that we're doing like breakbeat
interfacing and things like that they're
actually ridiculously simple and the
issue isn't the can or can't we it's how
are the systems in the brain actually
doing what they're doing right we can
sort of jack in a little bit and hijack
the signals and you know not know what
the signals are actually doing or
meaning or anything like that but we can
still make use of them right so it's a
friend of mine who's grad student his
name is Lovisa Kunda Berkeley and we
sort of go back and forth a little bit
about this because you can use the
signals to drive an arm or something
like that and that's an engineering
problem right it's taking a signal
an input signal and making it do
something useful but it still doesn't
necessarily tell you anything about the
brain and so we sort of go back and
forth about what does that mean right
yeah question yeah I read an article
recently about speech synthesis from
brain signals right you know anything
about that
yeah and that's actually the same
general kind of kind of problem in
solution the question I think everybody
heard was about synthesizing speech
using brain signals so I'll show you a
little bit of research that's related to
that towards the end of my talk and I
can address that a little bit more so
like I was saying you have the science
the like movie science kind of view but
in okay this isn't actually what real
science is like so I thought anatomy at
Berkeley for a couple of semesters and
we had a lot of access to real human
brains I was considering maybe bringing
a human brain here but I ended up opting
against it UCLA had an issue a couple
years ago or I think they lost a body
part or something out of their morgue
and so very nervous about taking any
sort of human specimen off of off the
site now so I didn't even ask anybody if
I could I just I left it there and
didn't even bother okay so this is
actually more real neuroscience looks
like so I have in this picture on my
head an EEG cap this is recording 64
channels of electro and stuff of mine
electro encephalogram which is what EEG
stands for and all that is are the
aggregate some of the of the potential
of hundreds of millions of neurons right
so in the brain you have 100 billion
neurons more or less it changes you know
depending on the person and things like
that and each one of those neurons has
anymore on the order of maybe 1,000 to
10,000 synapses which are connections
right so you're talking anywhere on the
order of 100 quadrillion to 1 trillion
interconnections within the brain and
this leads people to say things such as
the brain is the most complex thing that
we know about in universe which is one
of those other statements that always
seems kind of ridiculous because our
brain is part of our body and if you
count the body as a thing then
inherently the brain within the body is
more complex than brain by itself so
anyway you have these kinds of
statements that people like to use but
you know who knows it doesn't really
make a lot of sense but nevertheless it
is a really complicated problem and so I
can
and using that metaphor yeah same
numbers for the chip of neurons no I
don't actually know I don't do any work
with monkeys or anything like that I
don't I don't study I would guess it's I
don't know maybe one twentieth one tenth
I don't know how about sure real life
science also not nearly as glamorous
these are reviews I had from the same
paper that I tried to publish just last
year first one really nice the findings
clearly clearly merit publication the
second reviewer admittedly I find this a
very poor state of affairs for a
manuscript and as a reviewer also at
least a mildly irritating this is what
the peer-review process is like right
and I have a paper that's out for review
right now and this is a graph of how I
feel about it on the x-axis it's the
number of days review on the y-axis it's
the number of milliseconds before
checking my email in the morning and you
actually notice that as a number of days
interview increases I actually start
checking my email before I even wake up
in the morning like I just I notice I'm
laying there with my phone in my hand
and you know like really anxiously
waiting to hear back about this paper
right it's a very frustrating process so
our field that has sort of an
interesting history this guy on the left
is Santiago Ramon Iike Hal and he's
really kind of the father of modern ways
of thinking about neuroscience he won
the Nobel Prize in 1906 for what he
called or what not he actually what was
called the neuron doctrine which is the
idea that there are individual cells
that make up our brain and those cells
aren't directly connected this is in
contrast to reticular theory which was
that all the cells in the brain are one
continuous network that are all
interconnected and what's interesting is
he actually shared the Nobel Prize in
1906 for medicine and physiology with
the guy that was a huge proponent of
particular theory and so they both won
joint Nobel prizes in the same year for
opponent theories and apparently the
sky' Santiago Monica Hall was an
interesting dude when he was like eight
years old in the town that he grew up in
Spain he built a homemade cannon and
blew down his town gates and got
arrested and was actually placed in jail
as an eight-year-old for doing this and
there are similar stories I read his
autobiography and yes stories kind of
like this all growing up and so he was a
very outspoken a very confident kind of
guy and apparently the 1906 acceptance
speech for the Nobel Prize was
interesting and there's a little blurb
on me Noble website about this sort of
opponent Theory thing but I'd like to
point out this drawing on the right is
actually drawing that he made of the
neurons in the chicke retina so a little
little check and it's actually extremely
accurate but right now currently in
modern neuroanatomy what's done is
people looking a microscope the
microscope simultaneously projects an
image onto a page and they sort of trace
the image either by hand or just sort of
take a photograph digital photograph of
it
however in 1906 in the late 1900s or
late 1800s Early 1900s they didn't have
this technology and so in his
autobiography talks a little bit about
this what he actually would do would be
sit and stare at these images for hours
on end and then you could walk down to a
local Spanish cafe and sit there and
drink absinthe and then once he was sort
of nice and good he would draw from
memory so like I said again very
interesting dude but extremely accurate
in his drawings here is that drawing
again on the right this is a drawing the
drawing on the left is from the
neuroanatomy textbook that I use when I
teach showing the same exact system and
you can actually see how very similar
everything is right you have all these
different kinds of neurons in these
different layers down here matches down
here you have these sideways sorts of
neurons they're laterally connected here
and here right I mean it's extremely
accurate drawing and the neuron doctrine
is this idea that we have all these
individual neurons and these neurons
send off action potentials which are
these sort of they're thought of is
binary on/off right yes no types of
signals they get information and the
cell body of the neuron actually
integrates that information and then if
there's enough activity it sends an
action potential out of the neuron again
it really doesn't look like this right
this is nice cool little graphic
unfortunately science that we do isn't
nearly as cool right they're thought of
these these little transistors in a lot
of ways right individual neurons they're
on/off switches right and they send
these action potentials and the action
potentials are thought to be the
messages
used to communicate between different
brain areas and so this led a lot of
people early on to do recordings from
individual action potentials individual
neurons record the action potentials and
this method in neuroscience is known as
cellular electrophysiology all that
means is it recording the electrical
signal from from either one cell or
group of cells at a time now this has
extremely good timing you know exactly
when a signal comes in you know exactly
when a signal goes out but you're
limited only to at maximum using current
technology maybe a few hundred neurons
at a time and usually within one single
brain area it's hard to do multiple
brain areas and in an awake behaving
animal at the same time so to kind of
give a little bit of an analogy I don't
like the brain is computer analogy very
much because I don't think think it's
very accurate but to sort of build on
that analogy a little bit salió
electrophysiology is like having some
sort of alien computer right that you
know nothing about right you know what
has transistors you know you know that's
that's how it works so I'm not talking
about something like what was the
Independence Day it's not like a alien
computer that Jeff Goldblum can figure
out in 20 seconds and write a virus for
it right like some alien computer that
we know nothing about it's operating
system programming language anything
like that and yet all you can do to
figure out how it works is record from a
few transistors and you can press
buttons that you can have all these
alien symbols that you know nothing
about and see if a transistor fires or
nod or opens or closes or whatever
that's it that's like trying to figure
out the brain doing single cell
neuroscience right it's really hard now
in contrast one of the things that one
of the techniques that I use is small
macro scale electrophysiology in this
case EEG scalp EEG recording electrical
signals off the brain I'm recording 64
channels off the brain the skull
unfortunately is opaque or semi opaque
to electrical signals so the electrical
signals coming off the brain hit the
inside of the skull and smear out and so
I have no idea really where signal is
coming from within the brain but I have
really good timing I know exactly when
something's happening right like timing
is only limited by my sampling rate of
my analog to digital converter so I have
really good timing but really really
poor spatial resolution now again try
and understand how this alien computer
works using this is like holding some
sort of you know recording electrode
here's my laptop here
sort of out here with the wall on the
way and trying to figure out how the
brain works or the computer works based
off of that the analogy that's used
actually for scalp EEG is it's like
trying to figure out how a car works by
measuring the vibrations coming off of
its hood right actually so speaking of
scalp EEG you can use these signals a
little bit for something something
interesting so I have a buddy of mine
Richard warp and a colleague down at UC
San Diego on the Schwartz Center for
computational neuroscience UCSD who are
using they're doing this really strange
sort of it's a concert where they're
recording EEG from the sky at UCSD and
transmitting the G signals to a computer
Bank in Huddersfield UK well my friend
up here is conducting the music and the
signals that are coming off of my
friend's brain from San Francisco and
they're using that to play music in in
the UK and they're actually doing it
through Google Voice chat so my buddy in
San Diego is hearing the conductor who's
playing the music over Google Voice chat
in San Diego and that's altering his
brain rhythms and then it's playing some
sort of instruments in the UK and it
kind of works it's interesting if
nothing else another method this uses a
lot of people know about this and
neuroscience in neuroimaging is
functional magnetic resonance imaging or
fMRI and this is actually the magnet an
old magnet this is a 44 Tesla scanner at
Berkeley that's no longer in operation
they've closed it down they now have a 3
Tesla scanner scanners are rated
basically by the strength of the
magnetic field and that affects the
quality of the signal that you get and
the image on the right is an image
activation map in a group of people so
in fMRI analyses you have really good
spatial resolution that's limited to
maybe 2 or 3 millimeters on a side
throughout the entire brain but the
temporal resolution is awful because
fMRI is actually measuring blood flow
and so the brain activates a certain
region and uses up a little bit more
blood and then a few seconds later you
get a rebound as more blood comes in to
fill the missing blood need that's a
very low level of type of explanation
but this takes a few seconds and so you
know exactly where something is
happening but you have no idea when it
happened
right and again using the alien computer
analogy this is like being able to kind
of you can really really precisely
measure the electrical flow throughout
different components in the system where
they are but you have no idea when it
happened like it's like summing the
electrical flow over a few seconds right
and so you have horrible timing but
great spatial resolution and so when you
see these kinds of things in popular
science you see these offensive images a
lot of news and stuff like that and
you're like well this is I know the love
area of the brain or something like that
right again not not not really very
informative not nearly as informative as
we'd hope now the other issue with fMRI
is an EEG as well is that you're
averaging activity across so many
different repetitions of some sort of
stimulus and across a group of people
and now an fMRI if you want to look at
compare one brain to another brain what
you have to do is everybody's brain is a
different shape so they actually
spatially work all of these brains to be
the same shape and then average them
together so actually losing spatial
information so the power of fMRI knowing
where something is happening is actually
reduced because you have to average
across people there are some people at
Berkeley for instance there was a paper
a couple years ago where they had two
people two graduate students get an F
remind themselves looking at different
images and they would do from AI over
and over and over again show them all
these different kinds to show themselves
all these different kinds of images and
use their individual brain anatomy and
activation patterns in the different
rein areas as sort of a statistical
model to try and figure out what brain
area is activated when you showed a
brighter spot over here versus over here
or down here versus over here right and
they did this so many times that they
can build up a rough statistical model
of the spatial distribution on the brain
of activity when you saw different
levels in the visual space and they use
that to reconstruct what they were
probably seeing right so it's you can do
really good single subject malice ease
as long as you keep it in the native
brain space right like a person's actual
brain shape but most analyses are done
averaging across people and warping the
individual brains to this template brain
another thing you can use these MRI
scanners for is actually this is a
diffusion tensor imaging this is
scan of my brain at Berkeley and it
actually measures the flow of water
through the brain and so the brain is
like I said connected by these neurons
and the neurons are connected to each
other through these long words called
axons which are interconnecting fibers
and these axons constrain the flow of
water in the brain right these long
fibers and so based upon these water
constraints you can actually build
connectivity maps of what is connected
to what within the brain and this is
called diffusion tensor imaging in this
image the front of the brain is here the
back of the brain is here and we're
looking down from the top and all of the
green colored fibers are fibers that are
moving from the front to the back all of
the red colored fibers the ones moving
from left to right right to left and all
the blue are moving in and out of the
plane so you can actually get these
really cool connectivity maps so if you
want to know how strongly our two brain
areas connected and use that as some
sort of weighting some sort of weight in
determining connectivity functional
communication between brain areas you
can do that too but this is really kind
of the forefront of neuroscience right
now this is really difficult people
having a hard time incorporating this
into functional brain data now like I
said the the scanner at Berkeley the
Forty scanner was recently closed down
and they have built a new 3t scanner and
these scanners actually operate using a
superconducting magnet and these magnets
are actually kept cooled using liquid
nitrogen and so when they shut down the
scanner they actually quench which is
release all of the liquid helium they do
that an emergency if something like if
somebody brings metal into the scanning
room and or you know in a hospital if
somebody's on a metal gurney this I
don't think it's ever happened but this
is something you're always warned about
you know you bring a metal grainy close
enough and it goes flying across the
room and pins the person up against the
scanner because a magnet so strong right
so if that happens that quench the
magnet which is release all of the
liquid helium that heats up the magnet
and then releases releases the person
the unfortunate person if that were to
ever happen but when they close down the
scanner they quench them back to anyway
and we took a video of it I think it's
just kind of cool
this was last year
at least half an hour to an hour of that
like it's a ton of liquid at this point
gaseous helium so those are the tools at
our disposal right and one of the big
questions within neuroscience is
functional localization so where does
language happen where does vision happen
things like this and this is actually a
lot of these things are pretty well
known at this point especially for some
of the lower-level functions like vision
somatosensation which is the sense of
touch movement etc and really I mean
cuts in a way a lot of these ideas come
out of ideas not not the roots album
phrenology but phrenology which is the
idea that you can actually figure out
aspects of a person's personality by
feeling bumps on their head right this
has led a lot of people or some people I
should say to refer to your imaging in
general as a new phrenology right all
you're doing is you're figuring out
where does something happen in the brain
but knowing what is happening and where
something is happening doesn't tell you
how it's happening right it doesn't
actually inform you of how the brain is
doing these computations or how it's
creating ideas of memory like how do we
maintain memory how do we access memory
to to do behaviors things like that but
we can again hijack some of these
signals and use them for certain kinds
of purposes for example vision works
through the eyes right obviously yeah
signal are coming in from the outside
world into the eyes and the I send these
fibers back to the midbrain which is the
middle part of the brain in one synapse
back to the brain and then from the
middle part of the brain back to the
primary visual cortex which is an area
in the back of the brain if you cut any
of those fibers then you are blind
because you're not getting the optical
signal from your eye to the brain if you
destroy parts of the visual cortex in
the back of the brain the person will
report that they were blind if I hold up
fingers and say how many fingers I'm
holding up they won't they'll say oh I
don't know but if you put that person in
a room in a hallway for example a full
of obstacles and ask the person to walk
down the hallway they will actually
avoid all the obstacles in the hallway
and walk the other hand you say why did
you walk that way and they say what do
you say I walk down the hallway like you
asked so this is called well this is a
neurological phenomenon and this occurs
it's thought to occur because damage to
the primary visual cortex the actual
outer parts of the brain damages your
conscious awareness of the visual input
that you're getting but not the actual
lower level communication between
incoming vision and like movement and
the body so you can report that you're
beat you're blind but you won't actually
and you won't be able to read or
anything like that but you can still
navigate a little bit around the world
now if you destroy the first relay in
the middle part of the brain where the
vision first comes in out of the eyes
then you're blind you're actually lied
you can't see anything like neurons
don't respond in different later parts
of the brain to a visual stimulus right
you're cutting the you're cutting the
relay out if that makes sense
if you record from the middle part of
the brain and an animal for example and
again use the recordings and the firing
properties of individual neurons two
different kinds of visual visual stimuli
in the world around them you can
actually use those recordings to then
reconstruct a rough guess of what the
animal was looking at and there was
actually research at Berkeley that did
this a couple of years ago and so what
you're actually seeing is on the right
side here you're going to see a video
that an animal is seeing and on the left
side is the researchers reconstruction
of what they guess the animal was seeing
based upon the firing properties are the
groups of neurons that they were
recording from so it starts off not a
whole lot happening
kind of see some similarities and you
can see a guy sort of come in and out of
you here right it's really rough it's
black and white
it's getting general shapes and things
like that and sort of picking up a
little bit of motion and shading but you
know if you think about it this is kind
of really impressive we don't know how
the brain is decoding this information
right we don't know how we have this
conscious sort of perception of vision
and the world around us but we can still
get some useful useful in certain senses
information out of these different
neurons right and this is this is the
sci-fi type level stuff right where you
think about like being able to take a
picture of your world around you or
something like that just by having
electro defined at your head and like
linking or something who knows right
yeah so could you tell what is the
resolution in brain by let's say
counting how many cells are there
because they don't think you could
compare to resolution on an image what's
the right so somebody's actually
somebody's actually measured the the
bitrate of the visual information
estimated the bitrate I should say
visual information coming out of the
coming out of the eye and you can start
doing some analyses and discussions like
that but there's a problem with that
actually the next slide will sort of get
to the heart of that so for every axon
for every fiber you have coming out of
the eye and coming out of this middle
part of the brain and connecting to the
to the actual cortex of the brain the
brain sends ten fibers back to the lower
level of visual areas so every one true
signal you're getting from the outside
world the brain is modulating that with
ten of its own signals back onto itself
right so you might be able to get an
estimate of of the resolution but who
knows what the brain is doing to its own
act like activity patterns right and
this leads into the importance of groups
the importance of context this is kind
of like a mini Rorschach test here can
anybody tell me what the image is on the
left the black the black spot any
guesses as to what that might be
block test monster what is it
UFO right
you can't really get any kind of idea of
what it is what about now what is it
it's a car wish to change why do you say
it's a car right somehow by accessing
your memory you can take a noisy visual
system very blurry such as one that
you're seeing in the background here and
you can interpolate that this is
probably building and probably Street
and therefore this is probably a car
okay I'm supposed to ask the folks at
the video conference to mute their
microphone possible okay anyway so you
can take the same image rotate it what
is it now it's a person you have a lower
level the the little lower level visual
image the black image here hasn't
changed right the raw input is roughly
the same I've just rotated it right and
this isn't just important for vision
this is Auto also important for
different different senses and different
modalities so I'm going to play a really
grating sound right now but try and pay
attention to what is being said who
thinks that they understand what that
sentence wise this is heavily filtered
sentence by the way and this is actually
from a research paper at Berkeley from
Frederick Unison's lab this is pretty
nice yeah what do you think awesome he
got it very few people get it and it's
statistically one or two people in a
room that the size will probably get it
a few people will probably will
understand about one or two words most
people will probably understand about
one or two words I'm gonna play the same
sentence now unfiltered she writes to
her brother every day close enough okay
now you've heard it once you know what
the actual answer is listening to the
sentence again you can't unhear it now
so when I was first doing this we were
taking all these sentences when were
heavily filtering them and all these
different frequency bands actually we're
filtering in what was called the
modulation spectrum trying to figure out
what parts of this modulation spectrum
are important for speech comprehension
and I was filtering all of these
sentences and everything and I was like
I can't they're all okay like I
understand all of them
so weird so I'm going to demonstrate it
one more time with a new sentence the
two children are laughing right it's
been removed of so much information to
the point where I can I can actually do
it even more and remove it even more in
a move even more and it's amazing how
well you can still understand the
sentence despite the paucity of
information in it because you have all
this memory information that's sort of
bolstering and feeding on top of the
actual low-level sensory information
yeah I'm just curious if it would work
also the other way if you tell us the
sentence and then play something
modulated what is not that sentence
would people still think that that's
what they hear that's actually really
good question I would I would presume
that if I told you for example the
sentence actually says she writes to her
mother every day brother every day but
like he's you heard mother if I said she
writes to her mother every day
if it's close enough you probably would
never be able to figure it out right
because at that point the sounds are so
similar and the sentence like the word
mother and brother even though the
phoneme for MA and BA are very different
if I remove most of that information
content I'm still using my understanding
of English grammar and syntax and just
experience with individual words and I
know that a word of a certain length
like mother and brother they're very
close to the same length right they take
almost the same amount of time to say
and if I remove a lot of the information
in individual phonemes I wouldn't be
able to maybe differentiate them in this
in this context if I filter them right
so that's actually an ongoing research
question though is how much can you
filter and still pick out individual
phoneme sounds and use that to inform
the rest of the sentence and I think
there is I don't know people saw a
couple years ago there is a an example
of a sentence somebody contracted in the
written word and then took all of the
middle letters in that sent in every
word in the sentence and just rearranged
them and kept the first and last letter
the same and you can easily read it
right and so apparently when you're
reading once you become an experienced
reader you're not really reading you
don't sound words out anymore when
you're reading you actually sort of pick
out whole words at a time and match the
word sort of length
beginning an end to an internal template
and you're very good at this right so
it's more of a template matching rather
than sounding everything out and looking
at the individual phonemes which are
individual like letter and sounds right
so in this case actually the filter that
we're using is also is also getting rid
of phase information but you can so
we're actually scrambling some of the
information that's there and then
filtering so it's I remember the actual
algorithm it's been about five years
since I worked on this algorithm in this
case but you can I'm sure do it actually
remove it's actually a good question I
don't know well can we talk about it
after cuz yeah so again going back to
this idea of functional localization a
lot of people may have seen this I think
I'll be probably talked about this case
before this is a very famous case in
neuroscience Phineas Gage poor guy was
working at a he was a foreman for a rail
railroad company and they were blowing
out a big rockfish to make room for the
railroad or something like that of time
and one of the one of the sections of
dynamite that they drilled a hole pocket
with TNT and then they're gonna blow it
up it didn't it didn't explode so we
went in with a large tamping iron and
went to tamp the carefully dynamite down
a little bit more and it blew and shot
the tamping iron right through his head
and the guy actually this is in the
1850s 60s actually amazingly survived to
this and afterward the guy was like a
family man he was a foreman at this
company very well-respected his
community etc afterward he became kind
of a drunk he he totally changed his
personality wildly changed became a very
different seeming person and this is
really one of the first cases that
started making people think that oh you
know maybe these different brain areas
are actually playing different roles in
and behavior and another classic case in
neuroscience is this case from Broca
this was back in the 1860s and this guy
was trying to disprove the idea of
functional localization and he had this
patient that had come in in the patient
was aphasia which means that they aren't
really putting the other words in any
kind of meaningful way and this patient
was referred to in the literature as
patient tan because apparently one of
the few things you could say reliably is
the word tan in literature it actually
turns out that the guy also was able to
curse pretty well but apparently having
a scientific paper talking about patient
ass isn't very
very well thought of so I guess in the
1850s it might have been like patient
rapscallion or scoundrel or something
this anyway so the guy had this issue of
being able to put language sounds
together speech sounds together
and so I'm actually gonna hear me I'm
running out of time here so I'm gonna
skip a few slides but anyway this
patient had damaged this specific brain
area and this guy was trying to disprove
ideas of speech or functional
localization and turned out when he
looked at several different patients who
had this same kind of behavioral pattern
and waited until they died and then
looked at their brains postmortem they
all had a lesion and very similar area
their brain right and so this area the
brain in neuroscience is now known as
Broca's area and it's the area that's
responsible for the motor motor motor
connections for speech so being able to
put sentences together with your mouth
and this led a lot of people to do
stroke induced neuroscience so you
actually or lesion neuroscience so you
actually make lesions in different brain
areas and animals and people or they
don't actually make them in people they
make lesions in animals to see what
happens and this is 1950s neuroscience
right this wouldn't fly anymore with
ethical procedures but anyway they
actually lesion this cat in bilaterally
so both sides of the brain in the same
region and this led to something that's
called kluver-bucy syndrome and
kluver-bucy syndrome is marked by hyper
orality hypersexuality things like that
and so this is a way that a lot of
people started thinking about what brain
areas are doing what is actually taking
animals and lesioning different brain
areas and seeing what they can't do
anymore right and so if you have a
lesion in your primary motor cortex you
will be paralyzed if you have lesion and
primary visual cortex you will you will
be blind or have blind sight which is a
phenomenon where you you report being
blind things like that and this is
actually a video of my adviser talking
to somebody with aphasia so you can kind
of get a little bit of an experience of
what it sounds like
or not at all what happened to the sound
anyway
okay well let's give it that's
interesting
this ad was working before right Oh
so this idea of using brain lesions to
discover certain aspects about brain
function
has been used a lot in neuroscience and
I actually do research with stroke
patients who've had brain damage because
of very specific types of stroke and if
I work with these patients behaviorally
and I say for example I look at the
prefrontal cortex which is an area at
the very front of the brain that's
thought to be responsible or important
and attention to memory and things like
that now again like I said if I lesion
primary motor cortex I will be paralyzed
if I lesion prefrontal cortex I I or
patient or other has a lesion in
prefrontal cortex they will have
attention problems and memory problems
but it's not like they can't pay
attention to things anymore it's not
like they don't have memory anymore
right so it's not exactly 1:1 mapping
right these higher level cognitive
functions aren't as cleanly distributed
and one way that we test in in human
neuroscience attention is this is an
example of a task that I use where I ask
you to keep your eyes focused on the
center cross here don't move your eyes
and you will see a stream of images on
the left or right side of the screen and
every now and then you see an
upside-down triangle on one side of the
other if you see that upside down
triangle I'm asking you to consider that
a target press a button when you see
that upside down triangle only if it's
on this side of the visual field not if
it's over here and we actually make it
take advantage of the anatomy of how the
visual system is set up so if you see an
image on the right visual field over
here that actually goes back to the left
side of the brain if you see an image on
the left over here that goes back to the
right side of the brain and so if I look
at somebody and this is actually a paper
that was published back in 2000 out of
our lab that really prompted me to join
the lab that I was in if you look at a
normal healthy controlled brain and I'm
using scalp EEG and I present a triangle
to this side of visual space you'll see
activation within a hundred milliseconds
and the back side of the brain on the
opposite side this reflects incoming
information from the visual field being
processed by the brain on the opposite
side however if I look at somebody that
has a brain lesion on that same side in
the front then this increase in
visualize this this increase in visual
activity in the back of the brain
actually disappears and this is known as
a top-down at
attention-deficit top-down meaning that
there's some sort of template concept
I'm holding in my memory that I should
be looking for a certain kind of
triangle all right now I have to
remember okay this is the triangle I'm
looking for wait for it wait for it wait
for it wait for it
aha once I see that triangle then the
signals enhanced in the visual cortex in
the back of the brain however if I have
brain damage on that side then the
signal enhancement goes away right but
what I found interesting about this
paper was that people were still able to
do it even with these brain lesions they
were slowly will actually perform the
task they didn't do as well as normal
healthy people but still well above
chance right and so one of the areas of
research that I actually specifically
focus on is how are people who have this
kind of brain damaged still doing as
well as they do right and there's this
idea of recovery or compensation
so if I have damage to the frontal
cortex here then maybe the side over
here is actually picking up the slack or
assisting the damaged cortex and so one
of the studies that's currently getting
rejected at various journals as I'm
trying to publish right now is exactly
looking at this effect so if I take
somebody with a brain lesion here and
present a stimulus over here and compare
them to a normal control this is the
distribution of activity in patients
compared to controls you'll see that
blue is more negative so there's less
activity in patients than controls on
that same side right however if I
present a stimulus to the bad side right
remember crosses to the brain I actually
get an increase in activity in the good
side of the brain and based upon what we
know about the timing of information
flow in the brain right within the first
100 milliseconds of receiving a signal
over here to the back of the brain over
here it actually then crosses across the
other side of the brain and then that
allows this side of the brain to sort of
assist it given that if I actually
present noise so here let's say I'm
presenting stimulus here to the bad side
of the brain the good side of the brain
is helping out after the after the
information crosses if I can actually
then present noise to this side of the
brain to prevent that information from
crossing in a different group of
patients
oh and I should explain what this image
actually is then I can actually reduce
this behavioral boost that these
patients get from this information
crossing so we can sort of use the
timing
of the official information and present
noise stimuli at just the right time
taxi readers performance reduces
compensation these maps actually here I
forgot to mention I'm used to talking to
neuroscientists in this kind of context
this is an average brain template and
the the brightness the color the more
red these regions are the more number of
subjects that we studied had a lesion in
that brain area right so purple down
here means that one subject out of the
ten subjects that we studied how to
lesion their green means approximately
five subjects had overlapping lesions
here red means almost all of our
subjects had a lesion in that spot right
there does that make sense
appreciate forward to hopefully okay so
I'm actually gonna do a little bit of a
warning here and talk about the last
kind of bit of research that were
running out of time which is
intracranial recordings from humans who
are have undergone brain surgery so like
I said the signal quality on the scalp
not very good but if we can implant
electrodes within the head then we know
very well where signals coming from so I
can actually show a graphic image here
in a video in a second of this kind of
brain surgeries where we do some of
these recordings so look away here for a
minute I'll let you know when you can
look back if you don't want to look at
this but this is what it looks like in
the operating room these are pictures
that we took during the operation this
big mounted device here on the right is
actually mounted it's called a
stereotactic mount to keep everything
still so you can put the electrodes in
these a crowd locations and these little
numbers are actually numbers that the
neurosurgeon places directly on the
cortex so these people are having
surgery because of intractable epilepsy
which means that they have a lot of
neuronal firing that's abnormal and
they're going into seizure a lot and
nothing is really helping them so they
go in have brain surgery er to move the
abnormal firing areas and in order to
figure out exactly where the bad tissue
is the surgeon actually has to go in and
figure out what different brain areas
are spiking showing this abnormal
activity but to ensure that they're not
cutting out brain area is important for
language and movement they have to also
do brain mapping so use a little
stimulator during the operation and
stimulate different brain areas while
the person is awake undergoing surgery
and the person will be sitting there
talking and if you stimulate an area
that's important for speech then they
might repeat a word so if I'm reading a
sentence and suddenly I during
stimulation the surgeon marks that area
of the brain directly with a little
piece of paper now if you're paying
attention
these people are undergoing brain
surgery because of abnormal neuronal
firing the surgeon is going in and
electrically stimulating different areas
this can actually cause a seizure during
the operation if that happens the
surgeon reaches over and grabs a little
bottle of ice water ice saline actually
and squirts the cold saline directly on
the brain because if you cool neurons
down they fire less effectively so this
is the same neuro surgical technique
that's been used for about the last 50
to 60 years this hasn't changed persons
lying there awake for about 45 minutes
performing a task while a surgeon is
electrically stimulating their brain and
sometimes the electrodes are placed
within the brain for about a week so the
person kind of gets sewed back up a
little bit they have these electrodes
implanted and then they're sitting in
the hospital room and while they're
sitting in the hospital room with all
these electrodes implanted for the week
waiting for them to have seizures the
surgeon is waiting for them to have
seizure so they can see exactly where
it's coming from we go in and we talk to
the patients and we say hey you know
we're doing this research do you want to
help us out and so sorry I'm going to
show a video again sorry very bloody I'm
gonna show a video of the actual oh our
and you'll see actually the brain
pulsing key needed in the video
Chane the brain is pulsing because it
gets 20% of the output of blood from the
heart so it gets so much blood it
actually pulses inside the head and this
is actually using electrodes every dot
here represents an electrode on the
brain we can use these electrodes to
actually map activity flow across
different rain areas so you'll see the
person right here is hearing a word at
172 milliseconds after the word comes on
and you can see activity my cursor is
not working right here red represents a
lot of activity right in the speech
comprehension area and the hearing word
and their task is to think of a verb
that goes along with the noun so if I
say ball you might say kick something
like that right chair sit something like
that so your word then you have to
process the word and then you have to
speak and so you see activity early on
now here they're processing the frontal
part of the brain is thinking about a
verb that goes along with it
now they're just about to respond and
now you'll see all these electrodes in
the middle part of the brain here
turning red that's the motor cortex as
the person is making the sending out the
motor command to make the Latin mouth
move and then you'll actually see the
same brain areas in the back activate
again because the person is hearing
themselves speak the word that they just
said right so we can actually track
information flow across the brain and we
can also use these signals to then track
movements so if we look at motor cortex
and electrode activity over the motor
cortex and the ride you're going to see
a reconstruction of movements that
people are making on the screen and in
the green is using the brain activity
trying to reconstruct those movements
you can see it's much noisier it sort of
bounces around a little bit but it gets
the general general gist right it
follows pretty well anyway so I have a
lot more slides but I'm running out of
time so if people want to actually come
up and talk afterward or something like
that I never actually got to talk about
the computational issues that we run
into when are doing the analyses that
we're doing but really quickly in these
kinds of instances now we're recording
from sometimes up to 250 electrodes
simultaneously and every electrode that
we're reporting from
we can decompose into like 50 to a
hundred different frequency bands of
interest and each frequency we might
record for like half an hour of data so
we'll have like 1800 seconds of data
recorded like 3,000 samples per second
at 24 bits per sample and we can
actually do what's called cross
frequency or inter electrode coupling so
we can like maybe 2 to 4 Hertz frequency
in brain area a is driving a signal and
brain area B in like the 50 to 70 Hertz
range or something like that like so
there's all these different permutations
and computational problems and
combinations that we can't get in right
like you have to really limit the kinds
of research that we can do because we
just don't have the processing power and
really all this just equals a big head
explosion it's mine it's just really
annoying and frustrating problem anyway
so if you want to talk a little bit more
about this afterward I'd be really happy
to and answer your question a little bit
more as well and your question but
before I stop talking I want to thank my
wife Jessica and she knows she's been
really helpful at with helping out some
