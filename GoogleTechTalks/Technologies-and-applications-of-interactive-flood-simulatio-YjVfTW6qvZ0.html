Tech Talk today I'm pleased to host the
you know the stock count Tech Talk let
me introduce him
his name is Satoshi Yamaguchi from
Hitachi central research laboratory so
he's going to present us about the
interactive flood simulation system on
the ASP you were pretty welcome Satoshi
hi thank you for coming my Tech Talk
today I want to I will talk about the
technology and application of
interactive rod generation Latvia Thank
You photocell it's great opportunity for
me and our team to make a presentation
here so at first let me talk about the
motivation of this study we start the we
started the study because rather serious
disaster now as you know strike on
nuraghes attacked NEMA or Numa last two
weeks ago and about 30s for sappy host
hardened people were killed by the
cyclone about autobus brother cut in the
world according to the Red Cross 93
thousand people killed in this decade
and economic loss is also huge 20
trillion u.s. dollars lost in Japan only
in 2004 in addition higher chance of
flooding is expected in the future
because of climate change
according to IPCC there is a high
confidential a high confidence in the
increase of extreme weather event
it means droughts heat waves and
droughts
increase of temperature increase in
temperature cause increase of humidity
and increase of precipitation but the
increase not the change not all cut in
temporary and especially even I mean
extremely weather will be increased so
last week
I attend the International Conference on
flood defense at the conference fraud a
climate change is very hot issue almost
always such a focused it on climate
change flood will be more serious
problem what should I do
I think commercial will good will be a
good sir to mitigate flood disaster to
mediate a flood disaster we need
preparation and evacuation before the
flood we should prepare for the flood
and in case of a flood we should
evacuate but to act correctly accurately
we we need precise information on floods
summation is good to generate such
information and I believe to mitigate to
build awareness of the flood risk flood
risk convenient for general public is
needed that's why we create the our
product the name is do beasts the wisdom
acceleration easy to use the Vista
maximization easy to understand too easy
to use and we make automatic settings
functions and to make simulation easy to
understand we provide interrupt
intuitive graphic user interface I will
show you some of our application this is
a product do beasts you can see the
group and you can see any went anywhere
in the world but it's not our viewer but
also a simulator now we are going to a
city in Japan
this is Fukui City and 2004 in 2004
there's a huge water how that happened
you can see let the roads here this is a
relief area point so from this red
section the water spread into the city
now I will simulate the situation on
this my laptop computer I start I just
okay I start I click start button then I
click start button again now this
simulator calculating flood flow on the
city color indicates a water depth so
you can understand how complex water
flow is death railway label on the bank
here so water stops here and there's a
big street and waters flows along the
street and there's a car but on the path
here so water floats through the
underpass
and go another area like this Avenue
flood in urban areas very complex
problem so we needed simulator to assess
flood risks and to make evacuation first
decision Hashim Rita can simulate still
a lot of situation on this computer like
this now I add another conditions I
break this revealed so water floats is
ready like this
so you can understand how easy our
simulator
shimrit complex phenomena and how fast
our simulator is ok any questions so far
ok I will go ahead I don't show this
list now but if we connect this
generator to house database we can
generate this kind of list in this list
you can see owner's name address and
water depth and you can understand the
number of damaged house in this
simulation so it's very convenient to
assess damage or flood i bided evaluated
the flood result using a comparing site
investigation and simulation red line
indicate the site investigation and blue
line indicates simulation related to
flood area covered 91% of investigated
flooded area and investigated flooded
area covered 87% of simulated to flood
area it means very accurate to use a
practical use okay
I will show you another application of a
fraud simulation before previous demo I
showed the levee failure simulation but
in this image in this demo I will show
you a whole process from rainfall to
overflowing for the smell shock we use
give a data like this this sheet
transversal cross section of river and
this is cross section of rivers upstream
each year and downstream it here and
lateral is distance from the origin
point of river using this IVA data and
we also use a rainfall data I will read
the whole process again I will generate
the scenario the flood
now this computer calculating the
catchment area catchment area means the
area in which rainfall goes to this
river now you can see the change of
river water level in the river as time
goes on
timings indicated here all the processor
calculating now and flooded so idle back
destination you can see Krakus going
back and now at this time Grado card
with the mean the overflowing point
you can see right across here this
indicate overflowing point and along
this river flooded area spread this is a
flood situation done by us okay now I
will talk about technologies behind the
simulator in the simulator we use three
modules simulation modules mapping
modules and user interface module all
the modules in though in each module we
use different coordinate so it means in
each module we use different X Y Z and T
because we use four dimensional
coordinate and to integrate or the
system will convert it coordinate in the
air time so generation module time are
converted to mapping modules time and
vice versa and in the Malaysian module
we use four motors plan of model IVA
model levy model inundation model
so using these models which simulate
Rome rainfall and flooded area this
figure indicate the schematic view of
our simulator run of models used for
mountainous area if our model is in the
river
levy moderates in used in live TV and
inundation models used in cities in each
models we use different kind of
equations like this in the land of model
with a so called the kinematic variables
I think nobody knows
is equation but and the setting of the
random model is a very complex because
for each each drop of mountain we should
generate the network of model I mean in
this figure you can see the shrubs and
the rinds
this range get tips Direction fixed
direction throat so wrong this rain
water goes down and finally goes to
river this red rain indicate river so
all the slopes connected to his liver we
need to generate this kind of networks
its toll its soda work and in the river
model we use different kind of
simulation equation so-called one
dimensional unsteady flow equations like
this and from pivot city there is a
living or die core some artificial
structures to similarities we use
overflowing form here agrees and the in
the city will also different kind of
equations like this so-called shallow
water equations using this equation we
calculate water depth and water speed
for each grid you can see the grid
so as time goes on each grid water depth
and water speed on each grid is
calculated like this using ground
elevation and ground roughness but it's
not enough for shimrit in our area
because in our area there's a lot of our
shell structures like labels wide street
carbot etc as
I think I'll show this before so I so I
should shimmer it order this kind of
artificial structures using other
equations it's so difficult simulations
so what we did is automatic automation
of a setting of whole process of
regeneration use the main technology
it's a dynamic domain definition method
or a dynamic DDM this technology is used
for knowledge model and run of model
usually which need a grid for simulating
flood frauds so we need we need to
generate grid before a simulation like
this green indicate the grid a
difficulty of finding so gray orange
indicates two main difficulty of a
defining domain is flow must not reach
boundary because in this situation we
could not generate any more because
water reached the boundary of domain and
we cannot simulate
this situation because overflowing point
this is out of domain so we cannot
simulate this and you can find a rod
tube dry great in this area I mean
there's no there's a lot of grid without
water it's so interest to cut rate so
what we did is a domain is expanding
shrink domain a drawing the simulation
like this we use both simulation module
and mapping module
at first we input level failure
condition and mapping module generate
domain around
let me feel a point and then calculate
for water flows on the grid but soon
water reached the boundary of the Doug
grid a domain so mapping module generate
other domain like this again attention
great flood frauds soon reached the
boundary so mapping module adds a domain
like this if out of domain Debbie Farah
happened out of the domain we can
generate terrain like this it's a very
sophisticated system calculating
simulation is very much much faster than
conventional method and the we do don't
need care about the fine of a character
at the file creation domain because
calculation domain is automatically
defined by the this dynamic medium
another application of dynamic DDM is
setting of runoff model none of
modifying the land of domain land of
model is also the same difficulty we
need to define the calculation domain
before analyzing the plan of model a
like this if I calculate if I to defined
domain we can generate the network or
brand of model but judgment area must
not exist out of the domain and you can
see a lot of orange grid here this is
non catchment area this should not be
exist in the domain for faster
calculation so I use run of dynamic DDM
for defining the run of model
at first we input give up conditions and
then the dynamic medium spread the
calculation domain like this so to up a
stream
the calculation domains automatically
generated we do not care about the
calculation domain then I said I will
talk about applications of our product
case one application by local government
this is the croup this in this case
grantees
Otis T guma Japan they want to build
risk awareness among public because in
the industry there is a very steep slope
so if rad happens blood flows speed is
very quick so citizens should be
evacuated very quickly so the dieting
desired information is easy to
understand the contents that shows how
quickly water flood water spread so what
they did is provided three-dimensional
computer graphics movies on their
website I showed the website if you
access this site you can watch the
movies and they use a web it's at public
meeting about flood mitigation because
this content is very easy to understand
application to a rejection by inference
in insurance companies at this case
client is fennecs risk Research
Institute its Sebastiani of mr. Doval
general insurance they want assess
possible water depth available time and
damage job properties of their client
property so they are the buyer holiday
want to advise property owners on
countermeasures so the diode information
is quantitative what-if scenarios
because they want to provide
quantitative advice activities say
is she met several flood scenarios using
this product this pasta is I make I made
this post presentation at United Kingdom
last year it's a pasta of the
presentation and the last case is
application at technical seminar this
product is used in international center
for water hazard and risk management or
HM it's Japanese governmental
organization about to build risk
awareness from international
communication purpose is teach how to
map flood disaster flood hazard so HM
want software that is powerful and but
we learned in short time so I challenge
it is give a lecture with our product
participant on the lecture came from
over 20 countries from China Philippines
Vietnam Cambodia Indonesia etc so using
this product they make a lot map and
discuss about the appropriate
information okay I will mention our
conclusion briefly rather serious
disasters and what will be serious
disasters in the future because of
climate change we need to mitigate
disasters and to mitigate justice we
need informations generation and mapping
technology can contribute a lot to build
such information thank you so much for
your attention
it is associated the presentation so you
don't if anybody in the audience has a
question please don't hesitate to ask
you said levy fatal point manually is it
possible for your system to protect well
and when ready Farah okay
we okay at present we could not we
cannot do that because every Farah is
very difficult to predict but I will
conduct a research for that so I hope in
the future we can predict that
automatically any other question I have
a one question
so it's might be ad of the application
of this system um I wonder if maybe some
you know the government or a
construction company may be interested
in when they have a some plan to build
and a large asked to show a building or
wide load in some city which might have
a some risk of the flood
so could you can we use this system to
you know assess the you know possible
risk by constructing those kind of oil
you know price building or you know and
then we can compare the current and you
know the future after we construct start
building I think it can be done
simulation is useful for assessing
possible land use change or urban design
so I think it's emergency but these kind
of situations could be very useful to do
that
isn't a question from the audience okay
he keeps at us you know the presentation</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
