well let's let's get started how are the
rest of the group gathers let me start
off by telling you I want you to to wash
your minds of anything you currently
know about fusion I'm gonna I'm gonna
tell you what I think is important as we
go along and I think you will agree that
what you currently know is probably not
current now let me let me start a little
bit with a background my father was born
in horse and buggy days
at the end of the the end of the 1800s
he lived long enough to fly on a jet
plane and visit me and visit Hawaii
actually before I moved here so he
didn't visit me in Hawaii I carry one of
my earliest memories is riding in the
back of a horse this was not a this was
not a riding horse this is a plough
horse
my father was following along behind
that horse powering the field with the
horse he raised squash and corn and
beans and tomatoes that he sold his
truck crops to the market and that was
our livelihood while the orchard was
growing we grew up in Southern
California it's 70 100 miles south of
here the reason I bring in this
background information is that it gives
you a little bit of a idea that
I grew up in a very different world than
the one you live in an energy poor world
horses were our energy source I can
remember my mother cooking on a kerosene
stove we had our refrigerator was not a
refrigerator it was an icebox
now I'm not that ancient you understand
but we didn't get electricity on the
farm until the mid 30s the house was
originally plumbed with with nectar with
acetylene for four lights so we had gas
lights it was converted to electricity
my great-grandma great-grandparents
built the house in 1929 now why do I
bring this up because we've lived up
until now certainly I have in a hundred
years of the most abundant energy ever
available and unless you have fusion it
will be the period of time in which the
most energy per capita was ever
available the reason is I'll show you
later I'm a geologist by the way I know
a lot about energy I guess I should tell
you a little bit more about myself my
background started off in physics at
Caltech undergraduate and bachelors a
masters degree in geology however I
discovered geology and found that a
fascinating topic as an undergraduate I
took my PhD at Princeton in geology
subsequently I've taught at Caltech at
University of Texas Dallas and the
University of Hawaii I retired about a
decade ago and although I had previously
been the director of the point Institute
geophysics the oceanographic arm on the
University at that time I was the
director of Sea Grant the time I retired
and I went back to work after I retired
for a few for a year or so as the vice
chancellor for research a few years ago
I got involved in fusion juice has been
one of those topics that has been
fascinating me since the none since
undergraduate days when I used to race
over to from Caltech all the way over to
the Nevada Test Site to watch The Elms
go off they would announce that let 11
o'clock at night that a bomb was going
off the next morning if we would
literally race all the way to the test
site to see the bomb go off the next
next one eight five o'clock that's a
long-winded explanation of where I'm
going I used to drill oil wells when I
was like your age or in college at least
for shale oil company and I stayed with
the energy industry ever since I'm well
versed in the in energy resources I used
to work in geothermal energy as well as
in oil and now fusion so let me go
forward and begin to give you some idea
of where we're going and why when I grew
up there were two million people in the
earth there are now six and a half we're
headed for 9 billion by them by the
middle of the century those are the
numbers that you've been told and
they're likely to be true but I want you
to notice where all the red areas are in
this map the red areas are those areas
where people live as population density
and on the next chart I want to show you
where the energy is consumed this is a a
map courtesy of NASA and you can see
where all the energy is consumed and
it's not where the people live you will
see the Southeast Asia is red very red
but on this on the energy map it's very
dark same is true for Central Africa
same is true from
South America much of the earth does not
population does not enjoy the energy
availability that we have and if we
don't do something about our energy
future we will enjoy the same situation
as the rest of the earth dark and that's
why we are talking to you about fusion
you have to have a new energy source
during your lifetimes to replace what
you now use that that has to happen it
can be nuclear comedic or power plants
or it can be fusion those are the only
two choices you have the energy is the
fuel of national prosperity if you'll
study this a little bit along the bottom
we have the gross domestic product per
capita that's how many thousands of
dollars you bring in per year per person
now that's average for the country that
includes all the children and and the
retired folks the vertical axis is the
gigajoules per capita now a gigajoule
means nothing to you probably but again
six Giga joules is a barrel of oil so if
you wish divide that by 6 and that's
barrels of oil 60 barrels of oil is
which you consume each of you to
maintain your lifestyle 60 barrels of
oil you do not have in a decade's time
that's the message the bottom line
message and you can see that we and
Australia because we're both distributed
populations use the most of the of
energy other countries are more
compressed populations they have more
public transport and they
they use less energy per capita and
still enjoy a reasonable gross domestic
product per capita this is the projected
world energy demand and what I would
like you to really notice here I'll see
if I can get the mouse to work
I'll change hands here and I'd like you
to look at this part of the curve the
future the future projects a growth rate
and energy why is it projected growth
rate and energy when we know we have
limited energy supplies because that's
what the population of the globe expects
it expects to emulate the United States
it can't but it expects to try it also
means that we grow our population we're
going to we're going to increase by 50%
by the by the middle of the century but
what I want you to notice also is over
here where does all this energy come
from this energy comes from oil it comes
from natural gas
it comes from coal and a little bit from
nuclear power and renewables eighty-five
percent of our energy comes from
depletable supplies oil has peaked we
will never have production of oil as
high as we are as we had a few years ago
it's just impossible to sustain oil
fields cannot deliver that much oil gas
we've been drilling 4,000 wells a year
in this country and we haven't increased
the supply at all oh ho I made a mistake
I forgot to turn off the cell phone
come on turn off somebody got rudely
answered and we replied to anyhow coming
back to these depletable resources oil
has reached its maximum gas we've been
unable to increase in this country we
have increased that elsewhere in the
world because of the Pearl if a gas
fields in the Middle East but even those
have limits they have the same problems
we have you cannot continue to produce
gas at the rates that are well initially
comes in it declines that about 10
percent per month any gas well does coal
everybody says we have infinite supply
of coal no not even a 300 year supply
not a hundred years I don't even think
we have a ten year supply at the current
extraction rate I think we'll see peak
coal within the next two years a recent
article in National Geographic says that
peak coal will occur next year a that is
an article based upon a professor at
Caltech and another professor at
University of Texas at Austin
they have assessed the world sorry
you're both safe can you please mute I'm
not I'm not gonna roam like I said I was
going to do so anyhow the the resources
that we have are all depleting and
they're going to deplete more rapidly
that means we have to put something mate
frontline in that major I think is
fusion and the mind-boggling thought
that comes from that last slide is the
following fourteen terawatts between now
and the turn of the century that's
required that's 10,000 new nuclear power
plants
of average size typical size or it's
18,600 and some power plants coal-fired
power plants for which we have no coal
or will have no coal or 400 new 35
gigawatt Electric what we call heavy ion
fusion star power complexes which we'll
talk about in a moment every year for
the next 40 years you need to bring on
30 new fission plants or 556 new
coal-fired power plants coal and
gas-fired power plants or 12 fusion
facilities we clearly are starting from
a deficit we cannot build that fast
because we have been very dependent upon
fossil fuels all of which are going to
peak almost simultaneously this is my
message the existing sources
hydroelectric coal gas they all have
problems coal nuclear wind
I don't think wind will ever amount to a
hill of beans it's will remain small and
production is not reliable the wind
doesn't blow no power comes out solar is
likewise everybody's bought onto the
solar wagon but I don't think that's the
right answer you don't get power when
the Sun doesn't shine and that means for
a week at a time you get no power out of
almost any place in the world that means
you have to go back up that means the
cost is doubly high biomass well that
takes away from food supply biomasses
some of it is waste product from growing
food I think you have to go to the only
thing that's not on this list that it's
using power so my conclusion is that
technology is the answer but it's not
these technologies that we're showing
over here we need a large resource not a
collection of small ones
and we need a source of liquid fuels our
society depends upon liquid fuels you
cannot change society's infrastructure
overnight and you're going to have to
change overnight and fusion is the
source we have to use now I told you to
wash your minds of fusion because all
the fusion you know about won't work in
this timeframe you you've been told that
since your grade school kids fusions 30
years away 50 years ago if the years has
gone by is still 50 years away it just
hasn't happened why hasn't that happened
not because we haven't tried it hasn't
happened because we tried to make it
small Fusion is never small so I want to
talk to you about the big approach to
fusion and that's accelerator driven
heavy ion fusion fusion can be online if
you follow that approach and here's my
little joke about 50 years ago there in
print and that's because we put our
hopes in tokamaks tokamaks have problems
to scale up with the size of the
facility the problem just gets bigger as
the facility gets bigger it doesn't have
a converging solution there is a way to
do fusion today it was it was
demonstrated in the 1970s it was all
worked out it was approved by
international science bodies but was
never built and what is what is heavy
ion fusion heavy ion fusion is use of
use of an accelerator to drive a ion
beam of heavy ions xenon 2 and LED
probably maybe xenon the mercury that's
a currently known technology linear
accelerators are unknown technology I am
being steering is a known technology we
can get to ion beams to
to hit on cross-sectional environment or
human hair
that's what Large Hadron Collider is
demonstrated pellet fabrication we know
how to built build pellets and freeze
deuterium and tritium inside of inside a
capillary you're inside a sphere we know
how to do heat heat exchange that's
conventional we do it all the time
there's a better way to extract energy
from electricity make electricity from
fusion power plant but we're not
proposing to use that because it's never
been demonstrated all the technology
that we want to use has been
demonstrated it's not experimental it's
all been demonstrated in different
applications we want to see it those
that these demonstrated technology is
used for an application of fusion power
generation here is the scientific
feasibility was vetted by large
Committees of scientists back in the in
the late 70s and early 80's it was
reestablished and brief re-reviewed in
the 90s it was reviewed more recently
even it's always received a no
showstoppers go ahead do it but no one's
ever done it why it takes a lot of
capital and it makes a big amount of
energy a huge amount of energy you'll
see that that comes up we need
leadership and we need funding as a
corporation we're willing to provide
some of that leadership is Google
willing to provide some of the funding
good question I'd like to talk to some
of your leadership about that the layout
is is like this we have a we have an ion
source a multiple multiple sources that
are then funneled together into a single
accelerator because they're different
their ions a different mass you have to
accelerate them differentially to get
them all to come out on the end of the
accelerator at same magnetic stiffness
so they
go around a corner together otherwise
they all just scattered you go around
through a magnetic field you then put
them through some delay lines to make
sure that take out all the spaces
between the the pulses that you started
off with because you want this to be
compressed you want all of these bunches
of ions that started off as the thousand
thousand separate bunches over here to
arrive at the target over here at the in
the same microsecond the same sorry came
down a second and this can be done it
turns out this is what the Large Hadron
Collider does we know how to do this
this is not new it's just apply
conventional accelerator physics to a
different application so we show here a
series of reactor chambers and the steps
that have to get be used to get there
and you can think of a more more
chambers over here to the size up the
twenty chambers can be powered from one
one accelerator source this is a poster
that's over in the wall you can look at
it at your leisure you can't read it on
the screen I don't think yeah maybe you
can but the main point is that I want to
get from this is that we know this is
the and a source accelerator an ion
source this is the DC accelerator these
are the conventional Linux sections we
we come out the other end and we either
through these long tunnels down other
end to generators the only thing we
never built is the reaction chamber it's
been designed for times but it's never
been built so you had no source defeated
so it's been signed on paper and thought
about and this is this little diagram
down on the corner here is the flow of
energy from the from the chamber
the various heat exchangers to the
generators but more importantly there's
a fuel component in here and I want to
talk about fuel for a bit because that's
what reading hurt that's what really
hurts us in the future and this process
can help this this diagram visually
shows the amount of energy coming in and
it's being partitioned off into various
processes this is waste heat going up
these are captured heat energy going
down and the one I really want you to
focus on is liquid and gaseous fuel the
production of hydrogen using the sulfur
iodide process which is a
high-temperature disassociation of
sulfuric acid process well it's well
researched but never applied because we
don't have a high temp big high
temperature heat source it has to be a
thousand degrees centigrade that source
infusion provides that liquid fuels are
the key to our future energy supply
Fusion allows the efficient production
of hydrogen you almost half of the
energy content coming out of the fusion
reactor can be captured and converted to
hydrogen the combining of hydrogen with
co2 extracted from the atmosphere does a
very interesting thing it produces
methanol methanol was used as the
gasoline feedstock in New Zealand for
more than a decade they used their
source of methanol was natural gas and
using the same process we're proposing
to use right here they used this process
they got the they produced gasoline you
can go on and produce kerosene and
diesel via the necks on mobile and SAS
all patented processes they're used
everyday everywhere in the world this is
not pie in the sky this is functioning
chemistry that's going on today
the result is you have a carbon neutral
fuel system
you take the carbon out of the
atmosphere you make a fuel out of it and
you put it back in the atmosphere when
you burn it doesn't solve the part
doesn't take away from what's already
there it just temporarily uses it and
puts it back but it's a carbon-free
business in the sense that there is no
carbon involved anywhere there's no
additional carbon involved anywhere in
our process and you have a carbon free
energy and for electricity production of
hydrogen for fuel cells etc let me give
you some idea of the size and scale of
such a facility one heavy ion fusion
facility can produce 500,000 barrels of
oil per day that's the production of a
giant oil field think of it you can
build a giant oil field wherever you
want one anywhere in the world your
materials the Fiat come promotion water
deuterium that's where it is it's in the
oceans about a million your supply of it
at our current rate of consumption
there's no refining required because you
build it from you've built it up in the
process from hydrogen and carbon carbon
dioxide you made a hydrocarbon that you
put in your gas tank your car doesn't
know the difference between this
gasoline and the gasoline you're
currently burned the diesel truck
doesn't know the difference between the
diesel that's produced synthetically and
the diesel that you currently burn why
because it's the same refinery process
that produces it it's exactly the same
and the production of such a system does
not decline in five years time as most
loyal fuels do oil fields come on peak
produce and then decline and forever
decline at 12% per year
the problem we're having now is the oil
fields are beginning all oil fields all
big oil fields are being in decline
most of our fuel comes from a hundred
different big fields there are four
thousand fields to get fuel from but
almost all of it comes from those
hundreds and they're starting to decline
you can't recover from that decline and
I guess most importantly from my
perspective is what we're proposing as a
product liquid fuel made synthetically
from just from energy water and carbon
dioxide supports the currently existing
infrastructure you distribute it by
pipelines you distribute it by gas
stations it ships around the tankers or
tanker trucks it you don't have to
invent a new infrastructure in order to
use this stuff it's the same stuff
you're currently using and your current
cars and trucks and you can use it today
you don't have to replace all of your
rolling stock that makes a big
difference I mean I realize we're going
to replace the rolling stock all the
time we always do we're throwaway
society but you can keep using it as
long as you can maintain it the
economics arts are typical of all big
things there's an economics of scale hif
is not an exception there's no question
that the size does matter the bigger you
make the facility the more economical it
gets you want to have big facilities
because you get low-cost energy you we
put an awful lot of effort into making
one gigawatt fusion power plants for the
last 40 years we haven't succeeded you
probably never will succeed why
very simple why it takes a huge amount
of energy to get determined tritium to
combine and you want a 100 times
multiple or more when you finally get
them to combine you want a hundred times
as much energy out as you put in you
can't do that with small systems at most
they'll break even
most of the small systems will never
break even they're just taking energy
from one source and wasting it and
giving you part of it back and another
source the design that exists currently
and is being pursued by Germany and
Russia the GSI version of heavy ion
fusion produces energy at a higher cost
than coal energy producers will call the
one that we are proposing because it's
much larger and uses a different way of
accelerating down ion beam which means
that you can have much greater yield per
unit pulse is about 10 times the more
expensive but it proves us a hundred
times more energy that's turns out to be
very cost competitive its cost
competitive with any fuel coal natural
gas any other one you want but it does
take a lot of capital upfront but you
get all that capital back within three
or four years it's a very even at these
low prices of energy you get all your
capital back in a few years time I've
done these models over and over and over
again I cannot find a flaw in that logic
what I guess I'm want to leave you with
is a few thoughts the solving of the
energy challenge that we face as a
society requires the understanding of
technology and its implications and the
implications of those use of that use we
ignored the implication of the use of
coal and the result is
we have a co2 problem the ocean is
feeling that co2 problem I don't know if
climate is I can't convince myself the
climate it's actually warmed but I can
tell you a theists ocean has gotten more
acid because I measure it constantly on
another project but the consequences of
our energy usage are real and near as I
can tell the only consequence that I can
see for converting to fusion is that you
have a lot of waste heat to contend with
but it's a much more efficient operation
than any other form of generating energy
and therefore energy generated you have
less heat emitted you capture more of
the heat into the process that you want
to to sustain the requirements for us to
proceed our vision and leadership my
hope is that I've given you a little bit
of my vision and that you might be
willing to learn some more about it and
follow that vision a bit it's going to
take leadership from government from
individuals from corporations and from
philanthropic organizations to make this
happen
fill the top with organizations in the
way I I see them include the NGOs we
have to see it there is a better
alternative to the way we currently do
things in my view Fusion is the solution
for the fuels and transportation problem
that we face for the electricity
problems that we face for the water
problems that Los Angeles faces if you
have waste heat you might as well use
some of it to evaporate seawater and
produce fresh water and a brine that you
put back in the ocean and it provides us
energy low-cost energy to reestablish a
metal refining and fabrication industry
in this country we have exported that
interest
that industry because we did not have
low-cost labor and low-cost energy we
consumed our whole cost energy for
cities we need to re-establish that
ability to fabricate metals within our
borders the need is urgent from my
perspective because I see things from a
geological perspective I understand
the decline of oil fields I understand
the decline of coal mines and I can give
you specific examples and industry-wide
examples if you wish but those declines
are real they're gonna happen I can't
stop them you can't stop them that's the
property of a finite resource think of
this as a predator-prey relationship the
predator is man and the prey is the
earth once you consume it it's gone you
don't have it and you can't find more
and the time to act on all this is down
it takes 10 to 20 years lead time in
order to get one of these online but if
you'll think a little bit about all
those renewable resources you now depend
upon and use and you can put in 4
percent per year decline and they're all
guarantee you two of them will decline
much more rapidly than that you will
find you won't have 20 years you'll be
hard-pressed within 5 years time in my
view I don't like that phenomena that
because that's in my lifetime and I
don't want to be hard-pressed for energy
I like energy I like those 15 slaves to
follow me around everywhere that I might
give instructions by turning on and off
the lights which I mean that's that's
basically what power is so you it's 15
slaves or 17 slaves behind every one of
you doing your work for you
I leave you the thought-provoking
question has my concluding question what
do you think your standard of living
will be in a decade's time without
fusion I'll be happy to answer questions
and I'll let you read this last slide
that you will if you can read it at this
one--this screen yes you can
okay thank you very much for listening
I'd be very happy to answer questions
and have a discussion on any of the
topics are brought up thanks again
no the self occur sulfuric acid winds up
being basically a catalyst it's a you
start off with sulfuric acid and an
diadem and you reaction between those
gives you a hydrogen iodide and a soap
and sulfur dioxide and you recycle that
a back around through the process each
time you could go if you want to read
about it go to sulfur atom and you'll
find it on the web and it's a very
well-known reaction very well researched
it's never it's been demonstrated
there's an operating plant in Japan that
it's a glass plant the glass tubing it's
not a metal tubing like you want an
industrial plant but it is a very well
known process it does not consume it
does not consume the sulfuric acid or
the iodine it just uses them as a
vehicle to give you a a process that you
can separate because the hydrogen iodide
separates from the sulfuric acid it's a
very missable
and therefore you can you can
disassociate each one separately and
then recombine the products except for
the oxygen and the hydrogen which you
you capture and market there are other
ways of getting hydrogen using this
using other processes there similarly
efficient high-temperature electrolysis
not quite as efficient but close silver
iodide is the most efficient to all the
processes yes
so I noticed that if I remember right
you said it costs twenty billion dollars
to build one if so if we set aside like
the problems of fundraising and and
getting capital and things like that if
somebody showed up with twenty billion
dollars and said let's build it today
how long would that take it would be
limited by the permitting process you
could build it construction from a
construction point of view it take five
years from a permitting process that may
take ten but I think in five years time
you'll be so hungry for energy you'll
say forget the permit give me an
I'm sorry for being so crass yes could
you go into a little bit more detail
about that 20 billion capital estimate
and the different compatible investment
yeah
well the biggest capital the biggest
component of the capital investment is
the is the linear accelerator there is
there is there been a recent proposal to
build a an international linear collider
ILC you can read about it on the web
they estimated that for a 22 long 22
kilometers on your celebrator it's going
to cost something on the order of 10
billion dollars we have said that we
only need 1/3 that amount of
acceleration but we need a little bit of
fancy trickery here and there which is
going to add a little bit to the cost so
we have used 10 billion dollars as our
planning number for an accelerator the
chambers themselves cost about a billion
dollars each that's comparable to a
chamber for a nuclear power plant it has
a very complicated liquid liquid lithium
recirculation system inside the chamber
without lithium
liq without lithium being present
surrounding the the reaction point you
get problems with the neutrons we solve
the Neutron problem that all fusion
other fusion technique all of the fusion
techniques stumble upon by having our
explosion take place inside of a sphere
lithium that lithium is not is vaporized
but not consumed it is sickly vaporized
and that becomes part of our working
fluid and then we chill it and make
another sphere out of it and drop it in
and fire it this is an explosion process
it's like a 60 60 rpm engine if said
sarin Gold pain bang-bang-bang in vacuum
so you don't hear it but it goes bang
bang bang once a second
in each chamber and there are 10 of them
you'd mentioned that chamber earlier as
a potential problem oh I'm sorry I'm
over here oh this way oh sorry
ok the microphones over there I was
lucky over here in the bunker over there
so so you mentioned the chamber as a
thing that's been designed four times
but never built and this is the part
you've probably answered some of it with
the lithium and it explodes 60 times a
second kind of thing so what what kind
of problems are you likely to run into
building that since it's only been
designed four times and never actually
built is that they are compete there are
competing designs some some want some of
the Chamber's have been designed to
maintain optical continuity within the
chamber they've been designed for laser
fusion so you have to maintain optical
continuity for 192 beams very
complicated business in our case we we
need to be mentoring points actually
there are four beams on each side so
it's eight we have eight beams focusing
on the pellet but they come in almost
parallel from opposite sides the the
chamber itself is largely a vacuum
chamber but it has to be isolated from
the world because there's lithium
president lithium reacts violently with
water and oxygen and some metals so you
have to be very careful about what you
put in that chamber and what you use for
pumps but other than that it's all been
designed and says yes it's doable now
from an engineering point of view it's
doable
of course we've learned a lot about
processing and lithium in the last
decade and all these designs were done
two decades or more ago lithium has
become a very common substance because
of lithium batteries and as you know it
is a fire hazard but if you put it
inside of an inert atmosphere and inside
of inert materials it's just like any
other
substance that you have to have a
appropriate containment system for it
it'll be operating at about 1300 degrees
centigrade was there a question back
over in this corner I saw a hand come up
but that's how the the chamber seems
like a big puzzle so 10 Giga joules is
about a 2 kiloton whoo going off every
second no it's a pretty guess it's an
explosion that is the equivalent of a
barrel one point six barrels of oil per
second so it's like a big diesel engine
with that's like the charge at one point
six barrels of oil few ish yeah I think
what does a ton of dynamite is four mega
joules ok kilotonnes yeah it's a little
boy it's a it's it's a couple it's a
couple it's a ton or so of explosive at
a time right so that's that's a pretty
big explosive it's hard to man remember
there are no gas there are no gases
other than the lithium and lithium as it
expands I see some intersects with other
lithium and cools to where it goes back
to being a liquid not a vapor it's in
that suppose that stabilizes every
second part me
so the huttle restabilized every second
in order to the calculations say that
you can run you can actually the
calculations say that you can run it at
two cycles a second we're proposing to
start it at two seconds per cycle and
and graduate and keep up on one so is so
so what's the what's the skilling limit
to build back because that does seem
like a pretty tricky thing to get right
now I mean could you build like a you
know a smaller one to just fire a couple
you can you can build a smaller chamber
but in reaction in reality you have to
contain the explosion right you have to
have the accelerator you cannot build
you cannot build anything without the
accelerator it's
your sledgehammer your sledgehammer cost
ten billion dollars you might as well
put the extra billion dollars on it and
make a full-size team yeah that's yeah I
would I would not build ten chambers if
I were if I were doing this today as the
man over here asked if you gave me the
money I would not I would not build ten
chambers right out of the gate I would
build one and then I would modify it to
make sure I incorporated what I learned
from the first one but frankly this is
much like building a jet airplane you
don't build a jet airplane and test to
see if it's going to fly you fly it in
the computer you fly an accelerator and
a chamber in a computer to find out
whether it works that's how good your
computational skills are these days okay
so so could you use one of the existing
accelerators to essentially build a
chamber alongside as a test well you
can't no accelerator it has the the
Hydra source the multi-headed source
you'd have to build yet the reboot yet
to build a multi-headed source to go
with an existing accelerator and you'd
have to build all that telescoping part
that brings all the 16 ions that you're
using 16 different isotopes you have to
use cheetah each isotope separately
because otherwise you you you violate
their whole series of things like
masking limit so forth you you you
violate one of the parameters but like
the physics of accelerators but by going
to multiple isotopes
you have that enough degrees of freedom
that you can maintain beam quality all
the way to the end so you it's really a
specialized accelerator there is one
that works in four with four isotopes in
Brookhaven but has nowhere near the
length that we need to have it has only
demonstrated the principle of
telescoping and showing that it works
just fine but doesn't have the power
that we need we've we've we've explored
all accelerators in the world
there is no accelerator you can do it
this way you have to build one hi yeah
you had mentioned gathering the fuel
from the bottom of the ocean collaborate
about the fuel source itself I'm welcome
the fuel sources is deuterium it is it
is four tenths of one percent of the
ocean as just the heavy isotope of
hydrogen every glass of water you drink
has to carry minutes heavy water
we use that in h-bomb manufacturer or
a-bomb manufacturer back in World War
two so it's it's a known that areum is a
known issue the other component of the
fuel is tritium Trudy you get you start
up by getting your tritium from current
nuclear reactors but you also breed
tritium in the in the reaction chamber
because that lithium the way you get the
lithium to take care of the neutrons is
you convert part of the lithium six
unloosen seven to two tritium and helium
so you you have a you have a source of
tritium that you harvest on at your own
facility and it's the other half of your
fuel you use almost all you produce
maybe you use a little bit more if
you're not quite if you're not careful
with your branching ratio it's a your
imported piece of fuel is is deuterium
the rest of it you generate you have to
import lithium we will be a major user
lithium and you know that lithium is
currently scheduled to go and look into
electric car batteries so let's define
another supply or we're out to compete
pretty hard yes so once you have these
precursors you have to form a pellet and
for other forms of fusion the pellet has
to be particularly spherical and then
all production process is particularly
complicated is that persist in this well
that's that's the current
that's what that's that part you're
supposed to forget about the whole realm
we don't use it's too complicated to
build we use a lead pipe literally a
lead capillary tube chopped into lengths
and the capillary is filled with
deuterium creating frozen and and that
you heat you heat the lead casing around
the outside of the deuterium that
compresses it and then you impact it on
the end with an X with a with a another
weather in this case he'll Mercury H
came up but the symbol came up not that
the name okay we'll work with mercury
ions and that gives you the fast
ignition pulse that you have to get the
get the temperature up to a million
degrees so it's a it's a two-step
process the ignition is a two step
process first compress it secondly
ignite it you can't do that with lasers
because the compression process at
Blake's material off and you can't get
the second beam in because it gets
reflected back by all the materials
flying off and gets it your way so but
in particular you're planning on like
using 60 pellets per second and you have
to get them into the chamber and so
forth you're just dropping 50 of those
three not per second per minute per
minute excuse me yeah yes you're
dropping in per second you're dropping
one per second into the chamber and they
they take a fraction of a second to get
there because they they've fallen part
of the way under gravity outside the
chamber and the rest of the time inside
the chamber there's a valve that has to
open close it it's nothing more than as
I say think of it as a great big diesel
engine without Pistons the piston is
actually a is well if you actually get
direct conversion going the piston is a
magnetic piston that you actually use to
get electricity out and we don't propose
to depend upon that direct conversion
route because it's never been researched
adequately we propose to use
conventional heat extraction techniques
so how about a civil engineering
challenges are suppose you have a hunt a
hundred gigawatt facility and it's 70
percent efficient then you are basically
dissipating our 30 gigawatt overall or
continuously my my efficiency
calculation is that for the sulfur
iodine process it's about 50 percent of
the heat is converted to hydrogen so you
get 50% of 50% efficiency at that point
what's left over is still hot enough to
make steam we use that steam to generate
electricity to run the pumps and so
forth that are going to have to go on
and to be present in the refinery part
or the the building enough part we
overall think about 60 to 65 percent of
the energy can be captured a bit more if
you're gonna have a water maker at the
end of it that isn't no more of it eat
load than a current nuclear power plant
like Senator no free subtle no free puts
out of six a six gigawatt heat load well
though you are a hundred gigawatt
facility about I have but I'm but I'm
I'm extracting over 60 gigawatts so that
it has has marketable energy right so we
have its fact that then that energy goes
into a fuel or into electricity I ship
away from the site right so that leaves
about 30 gigawatts that needs to be
dissipated as heat waste I have 30 I
have up to 30 gigawatts that I have to
dump at the site I guess I've said it
incorrectly you currently San Onofre
currently puts out 6 12 12 gigawatts of
heat into the environment
so I'm putting out I'm putting out maybe
3 Center no freeze and some of that will
go into water which I hope the ship away
is hot water it's little more energy I
have to admit if you air exchange it you
do have a healing effect that's quite
serious and you
I've had some meteorologists take a look
at that and they look at it the
following way that if you distribute
that discharge heat over of a 10 a 10
square mile area as a series of points
you don't create a you don't puncher the
the troposphere you will produce some
rain downstream there's no question you
have you will produce rain downstream
unless you if you cool in the ocean
different story but if you cool in the
air then you have then you have a heat
little problem you have to worry about
but that's the same problem that the the
facility outside of Phoenix has the port
of the three nukes are they have a heat
dissipation problem that they have to
worry about and they just they
distribute over about a square mile
Atlanta Atlanta has a as a city of
Atlanta has a heat discharge problem as
a city the rainfall is increased on the
downwind side of Atlanta same is true
for st. Louis same is true for Dallas
you can measure the increase of all
cities because we dissipate heat in
cities
that's a measurable phenomenon nobody
worries about it but it's measurable I
don't want to minimize it it's real but
I think it can be cared for so as far as
reactors getting back to the reactor
design on you say the heat exchange
method for the reaction chamber is
conventional heat exchange the first the
first loop is is actually a liquid
helium and that has to exchange probably
two working fluid of either sodium
potassium metal or to a high pressure
helium I don't think we should put a
high pressure helium inside the chamber
for fear that if a small leak occurs you
destroy your vacuum and therefore stop
the operation you don't want to you want
to anticipate problems that your heat
exchange might cause we
you see it that there are two stages of
the heat exchange one internal to the to
the envelope that the lithium ISM is
contained within and the other one
external to that to that envelope and
that external heat exchange could be
very likely would be high temperature
our high pressure helium gas as has been
proposed for by GA for the advanced
nuclear reactors so the idea is that the
heat gets initially captured in the
lithium gas which then interacts with
the walls there's about 50 tons of
lithium circulating inside that inside
that chamber and it's exhilarating
storage and vacuum pump facilities you
it's it's it's a complicated Beast I
don't I don't want to minimize the
complications of that chamber but
they're they they've all been looked at
and worried about in three different
four different versions and I think that
that's something that the engineers will
solve without a problem I'm sure it's
been looked at very carefully I only ask
these questions because I'm curious well
I'd be happy to talk with you about the
details but if you want to stick around
for a minute or two afterwards here
IIIi would recommend a good point now my
brother Harold L say if in case you
didn't get easy get introduced to him my
I mean don't worry even got a nurse to
me I'm Charles Helsley anyhow let me
finish that one physics today June in
the letter section and physics the day
October letter section first letter
gives you an update on some of the older
thinking on this kind of fusion reactor
and if you want to look up more look up
a guy named shark off sha RKO V he's a
Russian Boris shark off he has a very
nice write-up about the the program
that's going on in Russia yes um I
wonder where would you build this
ideally like in the desert where land is
cheaper in the Antarctic where it's
colder if I had middle of Los Angeles if
I had my druthers the my answer my
druthers I would build it at Camp
Pendleton I supply fuel to the military
military needs to TG a source of fuel
they have a piece of land that's not
being used it's all underground and
tunnels you'll never see it and one of
my reactors would be the San Onofre Eric
site which is would replace a nuclear
reactor with with a fusion reactor the
other four sets of reactors would be
another points down the coast you would
see for Center all you would see driving
down the highway is for I want you to
visualize what it is you see it's for
Center no phrase several miles apart
each cluster several miles from the
other one and there's gonna be some
accelerate business around that where
the in terms of generating this hydrogen
but that's what you that's what you're
looking at and that's a very good sight
why because it has ocean water no my
second other sight there's a great place
for it just south of the canyon Diablo
site beautiful place to build another
four or five reactors and you would not
damage the landscape whatever I've
actually they can take in the canyon
Diablo and just planted it four times
down the coast that you would never know
that they were there in terms of the
ecology offshore and so forth if you
want to go to the desert environment yes
great place to be Nevada Test Site
except the only cooling water I'd have
to use air cooling I'd rather not use
air cooling at that location for the
simple reason I don't want to increase
the rainfall in Salt Lake City for fear
I flood the airport I mean there are
serious that's a that's a joke but it's
a serious it's a serious issue I
actually worked out it for away Hawaii
is actually the most energy consumptive
per capita place in the world
the Hawaii thinks of itself as being
totally green it's not we use more fuel
per capita than any any other population
in the world why could we fly all of our
industry in and out of the state in the
form of tourists and that jet fuel is a
very expensive item 1 million people we
have a we have a fuel bill of eight
billion dollars for 1 million people
that's Hawaii and I can and you turns
out you can put one of these there and
it will produce all the fuel you need an
export fuel to Los Angeles California
doesn't like doesn't like nukes and so
it's gonna be hard to build them here we
may wind up building the first one we
may wind up building the first one into
that in Idaho for the simple reason that
they they have permitted land that you
put experimental reactors on
Ennio not where I want it but this is
where I might have to put it there are
many other places I have a strong
interest right now put one in Florida
there's a strong interest to put one in
Spain a strong interest to put one in
Egypt high population centers with no
source of indigenous energy they can't
afford the energy bill they'd like to
have a something that provides them the
energy that maybe where it goes India is
very interested China less soul Bhagat
but I think because they're going to try
to do it themselves</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
