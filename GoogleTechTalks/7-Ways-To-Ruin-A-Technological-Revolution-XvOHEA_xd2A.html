council in a legal department for those
of you who haven't had the great good
fortune of working with the product
council we help you get your products
out the door legally and it is my
pleasure and honor to introduce today's
speaker James Boyle you know
occasionally I have Googlers come up to
me and say things like I don't usually
like lawyers but the Google lawyers are
cool is that self-serving Oh many of us
became cool because we were in some way
trained by Jamie so we Jamie is an
important influence in the approach to
intellectual property that you will see
at places like Google and approach that
emphasizes an understanding of the role
of fair use the importance of
dissemination and distribution and
access to information and the need for a
balance between that and property claims
over information jamie is the William
Neil Reynolds professor of law at Duke
Law School and he's the co-founder of
the center for the study of the public
domain at Duke Law School which is a
very innovative organization focusing on
the value of the public domain and its
role as a counterbalance to a proper
tized regime he's written very
intelligently on open source software
among other things he's written a novel
the Shakespeare Chronicles he's a
regular contributor to the Financial
Times and perhaps most interestingly to
me recently he's published a graphic
novel comic book a comic book bound by
love which is about fair use and
documentary filmmaking and the often
very amusing but troubling hurdles faced
by by documentary filmmakers trying to
clear rights so Jamie tells me he likes
short introductions without further ado
I will cut this one off and hand over
the mic thank you I have my own like
thank you
thanks very much can I find how many
people here are not lawyers fabulous
fabulous that means that the only people
in here who could contradict what I'm
about to say we're trained by me I'm
very happy to be here I'm going to give
a talk called seven ways to ruin a
technological revolution which started I
gave it an open source conference and
free software conference and it was then
for ways to ruin the technological
revolution but it turned out that good
extra ones just kept occurring to me so
it's it's getting longer it might maybe
at eight by the time I finish Justin i
don'ti this is necessary here but it has
been necessary at prior speaking
engagements this is ironic I'm not
really saying it would be a good idea to
ruin the technological revolution so I
just wanted to make that clear right at
the beginning get out it's like hmm so
the let me give you the real story of
this and I'll come back to this at the
end for the last 20 years or so most
concentrated Lee for the last 15 I've
been looking at the way that law deals
with advanced technologies particularly
in IP but also in other areas and trying
to figure out why it seems to make so
many mistakes and what kinds of mistakes
it makes and whether they're dangerous
or not so what follows is an alarmist
talk and at the end I'm going to try and
Levin that alarmism by saying that how
close is this to reality so I am
exaggerating here for comic effect but
not that much and that's the heart of
the talk so first I want to point out
that ruining a technological revolution
is hard because technological
revolutions are complicated and they
have lots of virtuous self-reinforcing
cycles so you can't just find one thing
and screw it up and think you'll
automatically ruin it so you know it's
not it's not a simple process also you
know I was limited in my choice of tool
I know the law best so the law is what I
turned to and the law has been good at
ruining various kinds of things over the
years as well as enabling it so it's not
add tool my son that when he was five I
got one of those lovely bright notes
from his kindergarten teacher they kind
of look even if they don't have little
hearts over the eyes you kind of think
that they will have little hearts over
the eyes I said David is a very
enthusiastic student we have been
assembling and disassembling simple
machines his favorite tool is the hammer
my favorite tool is the law but that's
what I'm going to talk about here so um
let me note i am not a law basher per se
I actually think law and particularly
the kind of law I'm going to talk about
intellectual property law is extremely
valuable I think the basic ideas behind
the system we have are actually pretty
sensible the structure of it was set up
by some people who were deeply sketched
skeptical of intellectual property but
thought that it was necessary people
like Jefferson Madison Macaulay who so
it is a limited in temporary monopoly
which would encourage innovation but
needed to be tightly controlled because
there were all kinds of abuses that
would lead to so in my view the basic
fundamental structure of the of the
system is sand and I also think contrary
to what a lot of people believe it's a
system that is in principle perfectly
capable of evolving to include new kinds
of innovation so it actually can and
does support things like the general
public license free software distributed
creativity and so forth so when I say
that it's screwing things up it's not
because law will inevitably screw things
up in fact I think the system is a
pretty good one okay so how to ruin the
technological revolution well the first
thing to do and this is a canonical
principle is that it's important to make
all of one's policies entirely without
evidence of any kind and this may you
know people smile but but in fact if you
studied intellectual property law you
would you would smile in a different way
because if you go to a hearing about
let's say proposed new right let's say a
really big proposed new right like
creating a intellectual property right
over compilations of fact that require
energy to gather just for example right
something that is not now covered by
American intellectual property law so
you might think well how would I decide
whether that was a good
thing I'd probably weigh like
pro-competitive and anti-competitive
effects I'd look to see whether that
would encourage new forms of investment
spurred your kinds of Technology whether
on the other hand it would lock people
out whether there would be monopoly
problems access right is this the kind
of stuff you would look for what
actually happens on the contrary is
people say it's not fair he took my data
in fact I was talking to the very nice
receptionist down there about the
various crazy calls you get at the
reception desk from people who are very
upset about things that they think
Google has done to them and the stories
that are told in congressional hearings
about proposed new intellectual property
rights are not that different in kind
from the crazy calls when it's a
copyright for example what they do is
they bring in they bring in a few law
professors and librarians when the ones
actually in the hearing room so there's
this very disciplined it's really
depressing you give your testimony and
kind of an impassioned voice to a
completely empty podium and then they
bring in a country and western singer
say who let's say we're too considering
term extension and he's been told by the
lawyers before he comes in the important
thing is that the property right needs
to last for the life of your children
and their children right that's the
that's the pitch he asks what he has to
give notice it's not exactly an
empirical argument but it's still an
argument of some kind and the guy comes
in and says my songs or lack my children
and if other people had them it would be
like people killing my children but he
starts to cry and the paddle applauds so
there we have policymaking and you're
thinking okay so he's exaggerating but
I'm actually not so the world
intellectual property organization is
the body which of the specialized agency
of the UN in effect which coordinates
and harmonizes intellectual property
laws worldwide how many empiricists and
economists would you think are employed
by the world intellectual property
organization huge task right I mean 00
absolutely not right because they never
conceived it of their role as looking at
evidence right this isn't about evidence
so the idea that you probably came in
here which is IP is a kind of thing to
adjust inputs and outputs in an
information economy that member enters
into the framework this is a
about right and fairness and justice and
the empirical claims are not there now I
know what you're thinking you're
thinking okay this is pretty bad and
this is kind of like making drug policy
by having people say my friend really
wants to take that pill and I took the
pill and I feel better so you should
approve it right I mean that is in fact
pretty much the level of our argument
but you're thinking but so far you
haven't proven anything because if we
didn't look at evidence we would have a
random scatter shot of error right we
would overprotect sometimes under
protect sometimes just do totally stupid
things sometimes but it would be a
random distribution there would be no
skew so we might be annoying it might be
a drag but it wouldn't actually screw
things up permanently or revoke ibly so
that leads to the second requirement not
look at evidence but also we have to
adopt a worldview that makes it sure
that we only make errors in one
direction now in my view it could be in
either direction so we could have a view
that says we don't need any rights at
all so that somebody spends hundreds of
millions of dollars developing a drug
and we're not going to protect it at all
and the day after it's released somebody
can copy it for pennies that under
protecting would destroy much innovation
too but the direction we've chosen to go
in is over protection and that's what
I'm going to focus on how do we do this
tookie-tookie ways of doing this the
first is obviously the way that IP works
intellectual property works is you've
got people producing things creatively
machines software novels what have you
and we focus on what they generate code
the novel itself the picture and then we
slap protection on it we argue about how
much protection let's expand it or not
but the thing about novels are software
or gene sequences is unlike houses we
don't normally say I'm going to build a
house I have to come and knock down your
house to build my house we don't
normally build chairs by smashing up old
chairs and taking them and getting parts
of them and plugging them together but
it's a characteristic of intellectual
property that your inputs are generally
somebody else's outputs right you got
that gene sequence from somewhere
someone originally isolated that line of
code or something like it etc etc we're
all standing on the
shoulders of giants so we what we do in
IP policy which is kind of a shame is we
only focus on the protection of outputs
never on the need for inputs and this
goes to actually Daphne's point about
fair use a key part of Google's argument
in the in the Google print project the
library project is that actually the
goal of the IP system is not just a
reward authors but in to encourage
innovation creativity and the
distribution of learning and there are
multiple ways of doing that one of which
is by rewarding authors but another one
of which is making sure that people
actually have access to the stuff and
can find it so that what Google was
doing Google argued that in this case I
totally agree with them was perfectly
consistent with the goals of IP right
that this was actually part of it that
it wasn't don't just focus on the output
side in other words was google's
argument and that was actually the right
argument in my view and that argument
might win in a court assuming you don't
make a deal with the publishers might
win although probably not at the
district court level is my view so you
might say well you know there actually
have been some part of the last the
history the last twenty or thirty years
where we've actually not gone in the
direction of always extending
intellectual property so resistance to
software patents in Europe for example
or resistance to the database directive
this attempt to prevent properties a
shin of facts in Europe but nevertheless
those are pretty isolated instances name
me a dimension of IP length breadth
severity of sanctions number of things
that it covers domains that it is
engaged with types of technology that
happen insidiousness into your personal
personal life you name me a dimension
and I will tell you how I p is expanded
in that dimension had a great
conversation with a person from one of
the collection societies where I was
saying to him but you know there's
always been kind of a private space in
which people can enjoy music right like
in the shower because that's just a
problem of monitoring
you know they're singing I mean that
you're not to performance you know he
was wrong on that too but okay third
thing how else can we make sure we only
make errors in one direction what I call
the 2020 downside vision which is when
you focus on technology only focus on
Carson all benefits so fairly obvious to
all of you because you work here but if
you imagine somebody in the world before
the web and you said okay so you have a
potential market now 500,000 people in a
rate of the illicit copying of five
percent and I can give you a potential
market of a billion people and give you
a rate of illicit copying twenty percent
which would you rather have right the
larger market is actually going to be
considerably better for you and the way
that we look at that is not to look at
the costs and benefits that is to say
okay my search and retrieval is easier
distribution is costless advertising is
better I can target it's all of the
virtues I can do viral marketing but
simply to focus on a listen copying so
the words piracy and listen copying are
basically a drumbeat in IP discussions
and again let me be clear it's not
obvious that some changes in IP might
not require strengthening of Rights but
the point is if you only focus on their
costs and not the benefits they will
always focus on that again as the the
issue that I'm that I'm focusing on here
a couple of other neat ones here which
you'll actually see and some arguments
some indeed that Google has or will
confront has in the case of Google print
will in the case of YouTube very
interesting confusion between
intellectual property and stuff like
shoes or sandwiches obviously there's
some differences you know if I have my
shoes you really can't have them at
least not for long if you've eaten the
sandwich I actually don't want to try
and eat part of it if you have a song or
a book I actually can share it it's a
non rival good but also differences in
the kinds of protections that we give we
don't generally say this is your house
but only for your life Plus 70 years you
know we don't actually have limitations
on on on intellectual property another
key thing and this again I'm this is the
wrong audience to make this claim to
because I think you're worthy
you already understand it if you we are
extremely bad as a society possibly as a
species in understanding the benefits of
openness we're getting a little bit
better because the world wide web is a
sort of living proof in front of us of
the benefits of openness on lack of
control but my claim is except for the
people in this room if you got even very
smart people 20 years ago and we're
sitting in a room with business people
government bureaucrats people from the
content industries and deciding whether
how to design this new thing this new
global world wide web and you had some
sort of excitable Tim berners-lee like
fellow who says no it's all going to be
open its going to run a cope and
protocols no one's going to control the
protocols you're not going to have
requirements to to get on there there's
no need to you know be accepted by
anyone end-to-end etc etc that the
response would have been you're insane I
mean we will be nonsense up there people
will be lying there'll be people saying
you know coming up with crazy theories
they'll be viruses they'll be spam
they'll be porn Jack Jack Jack right
there'll be illicit copying of mammoth
proportions and come on we need to have
some control here we need things that
can only do a few functions will
reinvent the terminal rather than the
general purpose Turing machine we need
networks that need accreditation will
reinvent minitel rather than the World
Wide Web we will effectively I think in
most cases even with sympathy and you
know goodwill assumed openness is very
very scary a particularly scary by the
way for lawyers because there is almost
no law exam on which you get more points
by saying my client should have less
control right my client should have
fewer rights or should waive them right
that's a rarely an a answer although
it's often present company excepted
although it's often the right answer in
a particular circumstance so there's
this there's this fear of let I mean for
obvious reasons rate our assumptions are
until recently almost all of us when we
thought about interactions with property
objects there were these kinds of
property objects and those do have
characteristics which make control at
least in some way the case is extremely
desirable and dealing with the world in
which that isn't the kind of property is
is hard intuitively to get your mind
around it sort of like someone who's
been brought up in freefall you know
you're not going to have the right
you're not going to lunge for the ball
in the right place let me move on
speeding up a little bit here so um so
we've decided we're not going to have
any empirical evidence we're going to
have a one-sided view which
automatically will push us in the
direction of more rights both by only
focusing on outputs and by third having
this very negative vision of Technology
only its costs and benefits we're going
to misunderstand openness and be
frightened of it fourth very important
to ignore or trivialize types of
creativity that don't fit the model of
strong hierarchical creation protected
by property rights within a firm in
which the stuff being created is
proprietary and is owned and controlled
by the firm so great quote here from a
lady called Louis Boland who was the
internationals director of the US Patent
and Trademark Office we're saying when
should wipe oh look at all these
different kinds of innovation that don't
fit the model that model I've just
described ranging from free and open
source software through things like
Wikipedia to ideas for open source
biology and so forth should we be
looking at this as we're trying to
understand how to make creation happen
and her answer was and I really love
this open source software runs counter
to the mission of waipo which is to
promote intellectual property rights to
have a meeting whose primary objective
is to waive or remove protections goes
against the mission of the organization
now just to think about this remote
right by this logic christmas is
anti-capitalist right I any exercise of
Rights other than by demand either
shooting you for attempting to get what
I've got or demanding payment
immediately
is against the idea of property rights
giving is definitely out renting is
definitely out right any idea of
reciprocal deals are definitely out and
as for dating well I'd simply don't want
to go there so um by the way you should
know that under one of the contemporary
definitions for what kinds as commercial
use which is one of the factors in fair
use it's a it's a commercial use if you
get for free something you otherwise
would have had to pay for and again just
think about Christmas and dating okay so
moving on um so again this this is the
thing about this is it's worse than the
idea which I don't believe at all the
policy is simply controlled by a narrow
cartel of content companies because the
point that I'm making here is if we
think this way even the content
companies will frequently make mistakes
and that these mistakes are perfectly
honest mistakes right this is a genuine
world view a way of understanding the
world in which control is the only ever
valid exercise of a right and technology
is only a threat if that's the way you
see the world in all honesty with a
polygraph on your wrist you will say
yeah we need greater control we need to
stop this kind of stuff okay so moving
now to practice what should we do
practically very important I think of
this I hope is dear to the hearts of
this audience is we should ditch the
platforms and protocols and practices
that brought us the information age for
a couple of reasons first of all these
are inconvenient counter examples to
everything I've just been saying saying
openness never works saying no one will
ever create anything and put it online
without extremely strong property right
side the power to exclude people right
it's just it's just annoying to have
this thing sitting there sort of denying
everything that I've just said in terms
of the point of view so what should we
do and these are genuine proposals some
of which you've seen some of which you
haven't on the level of the computer
it's really quite a bad thing that the
computer is a general purpose
gene is the thing about general purpose
machines is they do whatever you tell
them to do right well that means that
people can tell them to do bad things
also it means they can tell them to do
things that no one thought of yet which
is called innovation again thinking in
terms of the logic of control it would
be good a good idea to move to trusted
systems that actually don't allow you to
do certain things or make it hard for
you to do certain things or make it hard
for you to be on the net when you're
doing certain things and ideally we want
to turn those trusted systems or the
architecture of this trusted systems
over to a convicted monopolist well
because I mean they have more experience
with that kind of stuff I think in
particular you know I'm sure they'll
respond quickly and with alacrity to for
example problems that lets say open
source software would have with the fact
that any time a program is being
modified it's going to come up as being
not a valid or verified action and
therefore something is problematic and
I'm sure that will be taken care of any
time now so so that's the computer on
the level of the the net itself very
important that we not have this net
neutrality thing you know I it's to
quote the wonderful line from the guy
from one of the cable companies the
point is google is eating our lunch and
we ought to be eating their lunch now
that's not an empirical argument I don't
know what is what's the basis for this
argument here we will create wonderful
super fast networks but to do this we
need control control control I'm sure
you've all heard the arguments and so
the analogy goes it's like when you make
a phone call to call the two called papa
john's pizza they say well it'll take
you four minutes to connect to papa
john's but you can be put through to
dominos right away that's the vision of
the internet that is being put forward
here and notice what that depends on it
depends even if you assume supposing you
you don't care who gets the money right
just so long as the services get there
it assumes that the people who run the
networks have the incredible ability to
pick the next winners in terms of who's
going to be most innovative which I mean
let's face it there's a lot of
credibility here I mean think of think
of AOL think of minitel
one of these people are good at guessing
the future but it makes one wonder
whether or not we really want to ditch
the end to end a principal quite so soon
so um sixth and seventh very important
to make policy and international venues
which are hard to get hard or expensive
to get too hard or expensive to stay at
so that's one reason just stops the
non-governmental organizations the you
know the policy groups the inconvenient
watchdogs from being there but it's also
good to do it internationally for the
following brilliant political science
reason those of you who remember your
poly SCI so if imagine a process of
harmonization of rights in which we go
around the world same go to harmonize
rights harmonizing makes sense right
everyone the same rights wherever you
deal with supposing I've got a life Plus
70 years copyright term and your country
has a life plus 25 years copyright term
which one do you think will harmonize to
we only ever harmonize up right because
otherwise we'd be taking away our right
of mine of course you could say wait
you're actually taking away the right of
the public in her country who used to
have the right ticket but we don't think
of that as a right right that's the
public domain it's just what's left over
after we've filled our bag with he big
slices of monopoly rent right you know
it's a sort of so there's no way in
which we'd say well let's harmonize
let's harmonize exceptions right because
then we would have the same benign
process in almost every single
international IP treaty the rights are
mandatory the exceptions are optional so
you harmonize up and then you make it
optional to have any exceptions at all
and this is actually the the future of
of IP policy making this is what I call
the insane barbershop quartet theory of
harmonizing where you could harmonize
but only upwards right it's like a so
now to my dear friends in the the free
software community the the final thing
is to the extent that our critics it is
extremely important that they fail to
engage with the political process at all
and if they do engage with it they
should only do through so through
extremely obscene email which contains a
lot of acronyms because politicians just
eat that stuff up you know if contacted
by an earnest staffer from a
congressperson eager to find out what
his or her policy should be on IP it's
absolutely fundamental that you should
reprove them for their choice of word
processing software right I'm not
reading anything it's said to be in this
format is just again that will establish
your bona fides as someone with whom
they wish to work and honestly when I
look at my dear friends and allies it is
as if we have gone out and sought to
bring self marginalization to the level
of an Olympic sport I mean anyway and
the thing here is that I mean it's tough
to do that because all the good
arguments are on our side right but with
perseverance so um you know any we could
say well nothing could be done apathy is
also a very good and very productive
nothing can be done where it's all the
pockets of the big companies important
to not note here that in many cases
where big companies in the few cases
where big companies I'm actually lost in
their attempts to expand IP like when
the Hollywood sued Sony for the Betamax
which was a thing they used to attach to
televisions when Hollywood sued Sony for
that saying that the the Sony Betamax is
to a movie as the Boston Strangler is to
a woman alone Jack the lab was ejaculate
he's less inflammatory quote his other
quote was to compare it to the atom bomb
and add recently more recently to
terrorism so they lost the suit too in
the supreme court to say that it was
contributory infringement to have a
Batum actually probably know the case
and as you probably also know the result
of that is that the cost of VCRs dropped
a fairly precipitously as did it cost
tapes and far from destroying the movie
industry had saved it which for about
the next 15 years would glean more than
fifty percent of its revenue from
rentals of tapes the point here is they
make the same mistakes when they are
quote acting in their own self-interest
they follow exactly the script that I
have just described and they get it
wrong right I mean that's one of the
interesting things okay so coming to the
end to what extent of my exaggerating
and what can be done about is there a
real threat and what could be done about
it I am exaggerating to some extent not
about the one-sidedness of the debate
the total lack of empirical evidence the
fixation on control the move to
international elements all those things
are true nor the insane barbershop
quartet all that stuff is true i'm
exaggerating because first of all there
are large areas where the law is not yet
being applied in it all its full rigor
or it would be very hard to do so so the
world of the mash-up and remix which you
dealt with love and which you've done
with sent each other endless youtube
clips some of these are fair use many of
them according to to our to your lawyers
and to me at least some of them are fair
use but many of them are not but they
exist in a kind of demi-monde the kind
of unpleased world you know think the
the y mar think y mar journey germany
and a sort of a smoky bar full of full
of opium and and transvestites singing
singing old french songs it's not that
it's exactly legal it's that you know
this is a place where we let this stuff
go on and it's tolerated and there are
whole areas of Technology and of the law
which exist in the demi-monde I'm
regularly stopped at the the touchline
of the Tsar my daughter's soccer games
by eager duke university medical
researchers who say hey so you know
we're doing this and i cloned that gene
sequence to run a test that's legal
under patent fair use right and I'm
caught in this kind of ethical dilemma
right do I tell the person that there's
no such thing as a research exemption in
path
in the United States and possibly delay
the cure for whatever thing he's working
on or do I you know do I lie through my
teeth you know it's absolutely great
fair use yes you know it just hope he
doesn't remember my name generally what
it's all look at a great plays tackle so
there's said there's the world of the
unregulated demi-monde question what
happens as this stuff becomes more
pervasive both culturally and
technologically so will there be more
monitoring more monetizing what happens
when the innovative companies who got in
by pushing the limits and breaking the
law suddenly start cutting deals with
the content manufacturers and no longer
have it in their interest to be as
iconoclastic as they once were right
well what will happen I don't write what
will happen right we don't know right
will that will there be always another
iconic class coming along behind we hope
of course if business method patents are
going along and you can patent the idea
of looking for something i don't mean
looking for something on the internet I
just mean looking for something or my
own favorite recent patent which was for
a gene sequence in synthetic synthetic
biology it patent the or and and and if
then and if not statements but but any
other kind of logic or algebra you want
to do is cool just you know now that was
admittedly only using genetic basis
those kinds of patterns clearly if taken
out at the beginning of the software
revolution would have crippled it what
are they going to do to the synthetic
biology revolution alright so again yura
see you're in I know doesn't seem that
way but a mature technology not very
mature and I'm not it's not a diss but
but but a little bit mature and it was a
technology which was developed in in
this kind of liminal demi-monde and the
next ones are not as writing an article
called the second enclosure movement
about the expansion of IP at the
beginning it has a poem from the 17th
century or 6 eighteenth century excuse
me which about enclosing the common
ground you know the enclosure of the
common land kicking the commoners off
given all the lord of the manor great
poem the law locks up the man or woman
who steals the goose from off
common but let's the greater villain
loose that steals the common from under
the goose okay nice little rhyming legal
theory my researcher system was trying
to find the provenance sent out an email
to the 25 sites on the net that claimed
one provenance or other for this got
back 17 emails that said we're very
sorry we will take it down please don't
sue us no we were asking why you thought
it came from the 18th century the 19th
century from wherever you thought it was
you know we're not writing it's like get
back aight further letters which my
favorite was once again we apologize the
reporter responsible has been
disciplined is no longer with the
organization we exist in a culture
rapidly moving towards a bipolar
disorder an intellectual property in
which it is presumed either that we are
in a world where there is no law at all
and anything is permitted or the default
that everything is forbidden and
permission must always be asked a bunch
of teachers I just went to talk to in
North Carolina and these were the
technophiles the people who taught the
rest that teachers how to use technology
one of them said okay I know fair use is
only ok behind a password-protected
firewall and I know that you're not
allowed to link to somebody else's site
without permission but what I want to
know is is it ever fair use to take more
than three cells from a spreadsheet
because I know that the fair use statute
says only three cells that
so they looked at my vases what's the
matter and I said I haven't heard
anything like this since I was 11 and
people were telling me about ways that
people could get pregnant and I never
believed the story about the belly
buttons anyway I was just pretending
that I did I mean where does this stuff
come from it's just the three cells I'm
still figuring that with it ok so
there's exaggeration here and there's
also powerful forces on the other side
the content industry in the United
States about is you know in the hundreds
of millions the hardware industry in the
billions and billions and billions and
billions or trillions excuse me once the
hundreds of billions the others in the
trillions economically this is not stuff
that makes a lot of sense there are lots
of counterweights this is now something
that is no longer on the business pages
there are now people who used to be that
when I said I taught I pee people would
run from me to find a proctologist or an
accountant to talk to now they're
actually kind of interested in it there
are sort of civil society groups
involved in it there are obviously
industries with vested interests on the
other side so I don't think that the
story is anywhere near as dire as I have
described nevertheless it is scary to me
that the technologies that would enable
the Google equivalent in the next
technology cycle are being developed
under the conditions that I have
described because you would have to be
an insane optimist to think that none of
that is going to get screwed up by the
processes I've described and I am far
from being an optimist a Scotsman thank
you very much
questions sir most likely my former
player HP is investing in
of which month pop shops are not one of
them in rights of their out after Yahoo
microsoft whatever we need to be fine
right so how far do you think they'll go
with the inside because the patent
office also has a very long delay so how
do you think all the stuff is going to
play out because if it's all for big
corporations how much is that going to
affect open sourcing yeah to be it's a
really big question I mean so three
scenarios ranging from from dreadful
through to you know optimistic dreadful
there's this wonderful thing called a
business method patents which is even
worse than some things you're describing
which is so if you imagine pads you
think a pattern is like like over a
thing like a corkscrew like a method of
removing a court for a business method
patent is I want to patent the idea of
getting wine out of a bottle right it's
not the method right it's not the method
flipping burgers it's fast food right
that's the business method patent the
thing about business method patents is
business method patents are truly toxic
to the next generation innovators
because they undermined all the things
that said no you don't need masses a
capital you just need one great idea
right but you need a one great idea and
a lawyer to figure out whether it's been
patented that in the loan is enormously
expensive right so so and then you have
along with that the not as bad part
which is that you just have a privatized
public domain so the way that this works
in technology particularly in IT is you
probably know is everybody gives out
patents the hell out of stuff that they
don't think are particularly useful or
valuable innovations in order that they
won't be sued then they get in a
cross-license with each other so this is
like a privatized public domain and so
they can't bother to value the patterns
because who knows so they basically do
it by weight how many of you got right
and so IBM's got more than anybody but
other people have got a bunch so you
just come in and that's it and maybe
there's a transfer payment that maybe
there isn't but nobody else gets to play
in that space that's clearly not
positive now if all of those patterns
were great that would be fine because
patents have a great function
encouraging innovation but they're not
great patent quality is diminishing in
my view the so that was the not quite as
bad but still bad privatize public
domain restricts but doesn't eliminate
competition
the good vision is that actually
everybody seems to be figuring this out
there's some interesting empirical work
on it which suggests that the patent
system has gone from being about an
eight to twelve percent incentive to
innovation to now being a six to nine
percent tax on it it's based on patent
renewal rates actually kind of cool cool
drug war is very speculative varies
enormously across technology areas not
true for drugs more true in certain
areas and there are enough people
complaining and they're people like IBM
and I would perhaps google that the
Patent and Trademark Office is really
having to listen so I actually would I
think the patent system at its root is a
great system only twenty years which
door copyright lawyer is like is nothing
only 20 years like we deal in hundreds
of years of protection and you have to
disclose it's a great system all we have
to do is make sure that we are I mean
right now what we've got is the the only
way property rights work is if they're
clear and hard like there's my picket
fence and you can build up to the edge
of that but no further and I can build
up to the edge of that no further what
we've got is a set of completely
impressionist picket fences marked by
landmines in which the only way to
detect the land mines is to hire an
impressionist landmine detector I
trained them right right and this is
this is just an insane way to do
technological development so I actually
think that will get fixed right that's
true sir I point out that the sort of oh
we're holding our pets
defensively theory sometimes falls apart
in practice there's this nasty
phenomenon that I observe quite being
deposed which is a company performing a
great company goes down the tubes they
start taking their defensive patents and
suing other companies in this
suing son
you know basically having invented it
perfect I thought you didn't know it
could actually
watch out right oh I know what I should
have done and Daphne can even handle
microphone if you want to do it I'm
supposed to repeat the questions in case
the remote audience is listening so the
move in the business cycle where people
move from using the pants defensively to
offensively yet actually I would suggest
that there's a really great consulting
like Anderson you know Mackenzie style
consulting measure to say to look at the
level of investment in prosecuting your
patents and to basically that that's a
inverse protect predictor of how good
you think your businesses quite
seriously it works quite well if you run
it back over failed computer technology
firms if you look at the stuff there was
a moment when I'm try remember what it
was digital or something neck or someone
was like getting in much more on patent
litigation every year than they were
actually getting with their products
okay you know sell the stock now because
right I mean why are they doing that I
think for the reason you describe but
let me stress I actually do believe in
some level of patent protection I just
think it has to be big innovations that
are truly non-obvious and we have to
make it with clear lines and with that
the whole point is to exclude people
charge them higher and Sue am if
necessary so it's not that I'm against
it I'm just against the kind of vaporous
kind sir how do you get some more
education about
like that because obviously there's tons
of misunderstanding but how do you
understand yeah good question i think
it's sector by sector so sorry yes how
do how can people educate themselves
with this sort of sort of going to law
school I think it's sector by sector I'm
actually very much focused on this i
lost whatever shreds of academic
reputation i had left by making this
comic book about fair use but the reason
I did that is because i would get
questions from documentarians which were
just as heart-rending is the ones I gave
you from the teachers in this case it
wasn't the belly buttons it was I know I
have to airbrush out all the logos on
people's hats that's like okay but is it
ever okay to film a truck I was like I'd
like to help you out there as opposed to
our car there's like nothing up writing
on the side oh the no writing rule I
remember so well where they introduced
that in the third Acadian Sumerian
middle period yes so yeah the the comic
book was an attempt to do that we're
doing a whole bunch of other things in
that regard and I actually think I mean
I obviously one of the big problems
could I just widened momentarily about
technologists one of the big problems
about technologists people who are like
you know geeks in the honorific sense is
that when they come upon complex
illogical schemes that don't fit their
preconceptions their general responses
that's stupid you know you like well
yeah it is but it's also the look no
that's ridiculous that's just stupid I
was like yeah but can we get me on the
stupid thing which we're totally we're
there okay but but could we like you
know is like now this ridiculous and
it's like I refuse to I refuse to engage
with this I deny this reality you know
it's like you know I refute it to us you
know it's like then
yes it's stupid but it's there you know
I mean come on you guys you know get
your baggage off Airlines right i mean
lots of things that are stupid you can't
just deny them you know I like you so I
think it's sector by sector and I
actually think they're one of the things
that's most interesting to me the plus
side of everything that I've described
is that law really didn't intellect
probably oh really didn't apply to
people in the old days because no one
could trigger the rights unless they had
a printing press or a factory right it
was a it was a system for doing
intra-industry competition if I had a
printing press I could trigger it but if
I was a person I just walked right over
on the top of it the landline didn't go
off because it was set to the level of a
tank now everyone is a tank right so
what happens is people get pissed off
and they can't believe the system is as
complicated and irrational and they
educate themselves so this is why people
like me get posted on Boing Boing for
writing things that you know 25 years
ago is like would it be of interest to
you know my family who would not have
read it but would have pretended that
they did you know so it's like so I
think that's the plus side if we're if
we're stupid enough for long enough we
will educate lots of people whether they
like it or not because they will be the
subject of the law how educate them yeah
so sector-by-sector things like you got
to guarantee people's no use you know
writing long lure of your articles and
treatises you've got to do things like
comic books we ran a film series you've
got to have public education you've got
to counter the nonsense that's taught in
primary schools and k12 about it you've
got to go to the universities and when
they say as our my university did it's
forbidden ever to copy a copyrighted
thing it's like even your own you know
it's like okay just nonsense it's so
it's you basically fight it battle by
battle issue by issue but my point is in
each area there's an interested audience
just so I
the bad one is that a few months ago
Mike McQueary former
this horrible off that Baltimore Sun
basically saying that should net neutral
wall pass you want to protect
you know AT&amp;amp;T you just completely out
and
get internet access without
even now I grow
I'll add the you know should this law
has personally favor miss Burke various
internet go if you will personally pay
for Google's it was alright that was the
thing at the beginning I was saying you
ought to explain you're being ironic
these ahmeds get the major popping up
all over the place is kind of difficult
as the on base
to do that is the
which still
I would encourage that's actually this
is a minor pet peeve of mine I'm against
writing letters to the editor of
newspapers I think you should write
op-eds first you get paid which is which
is nice and second I think more people
read them and more people pay attention
to them and I actually think that all of
the kind of intelligent focus slightly
obsessive communities not that there
would be any of those here but but but
who are interested in these issues have
the kind of ability to come up with a
line like Justin's you know i'll pay his
internet access if he pays Google's and
just expose these blatant miss truths
untruths misunderstandings so I think
that's one thing needs to be done I do
think that what's remarkable is not
what's remarkable though is that when
Ted Stevens said that the Internet is a
series of tubes I actually really wish
it were a series of tubes have you ever
been you ever go to an old French
department store where they have the
pneumatic of connectors and they would
put the money in it go I mean it would
be so much cooler to get your email that
way right as I get it hey so so I also
people really read laughing at him but
when he said that it was on the jon
stewart show and that was a very
interesting moment right because they
were just laughing use this and it was a
series of tubes they were laughing at
it's like you're out of touch you're an
idiot and you're the person thus mainly
concerned with regulating the internet
and I think that that is something that
has jumped into the popular culture
which 10 years ago I don't think that
that would have been you know that
wouldn't have been a story it wouldn't
have got up there so I actually do think
this is my optimistic non Scottish park
I think things are getting better there
product liability
4software
a sphere
if you publish them softer if you're
publishing it for free download of
painting and maybe modify the limb self
blows up or let somebody reduces
pretty good way
right
use right you know
great it was a huge issue i mean i think
the product liability one is going to be
a long time coming simply because there
are too many vested interests who have
very strong reasons not to want to allow
either a court decision that goes that
way or statutory change in tort law that
goes that way they're all kinds of
arcane things like whether software is
actually a good or a service which turns
out to be relevant and how to apply this
and whether warranties but the larger
issue is obviously there's a larger
issue which is if you're going to have
free open-source software development
number one or if you're going to have
companies giving stuff away on some kind
of basis we have to think about what
what the rules are going to be and the
rules in my view should be even-handed
they should neither favor proprietary
closed code models nor favor free
open-source decentralized models the
government shouldn't pick the winner but
now other people a lot of my friends
think no they should be totally skewed
in favor of free and open source
software but I'm demonstrating my
balance here to say that they should
actually be level because both of these
are valid methods of producing things in
competing I actually think any
conceivable software universe is going
to have both within it and I think what
we shouldn't be doing is because of the
arbitrary lines that the law chooses to
draw on the liability grid or the IP
grid saying you have to compete with a
lead weight around your leg and he gets
a 10-foot star so that's the issue that
i see here that's the larger issue of
principle I think the liability one is
this is just the new the liability
excuse has become the new excuse for
everything in life you don't want to do
I have not yet heard someone say I can't
date you for liability reasons but I'm
sure it's coming this is going to be
like I'm washing my hair you know it's
like I'm sorry we're just not compatible
hey there
so the critical question
so the picture from google standpoint
internationally on an electric power
actually leaves me feeling happier about
our position in the u.s. I do with other
countries so for example in the moment
we're actively engaged in sore copyright
reform legislation in
the UK Canada Australia and New Zealand
yeah we're fields are going forward
studies are being done and actually all
these
no lots of of fair use that we can
and instead stuck with specific
enumerated helium sentence and to the
point where in a bunch of these
countries i think the
normal legality of our core web searches
may be questioned by the analysis would
be are you copying represent this web
page for your commercial enterprise is
there any exception that covers what
you're doing right I don't think any
judge in these countries going to shut
down we're doing bigoted use some kind
of lame my license barriers that like
that but anyway but it leaves us feeling
kind of
much less secure these other countries
so the two preparation is one Talon
country right and to what's going on in
all these other countries he just sort
of culturally why I'll give you an
example what were reacting to the
Attorney General's in Australia said and
what we're pushing for in terms of fair
use is an American value that doesn't
fit with Australia's unique traditions
and and he says he thinks we're trying
to big legal what is he legal in our
country in their country so anyway do
you have any insight on what's going on
in those big eight Mel Gibson the
copyright portfolio and I think that's
pretty much what you could expect the so
the question is about the way in which
IP law works around the world IP law is
nationally based so there's no sort of
universal international IP law it's
country by country and while the systems
are similar in ways there are
differences and the differences are
particularly marked in exceptions and
limitations things like fair use
defenses you might want to think
privileges freedoms South annar is
pointing out the the if you go and look
at another country you don't find the
wonderfully broad vague amorphous fair
use factors that you have in the u.s.
you have laundry lists of permitted
exceptions which a lot of people might
like is they look like they're more
definite although they turn out to be
vague on the edges too that's just more
of them and so for a lot of people
coming from the United States the idea
is wow they really don't have the fair
use tradition that we do and maybe this
means that a lot of things we take for
granted as fair use would not be fair
use there including things like Google
search so are you right to think this
partly but only partly the first thing
to remember is the level of this
actually I guess you're right to worry
about it most people are is right to
worry about it it's true that fair use
is more narrowly defined in other
countries but it's also true that the US
has the highest levels of statutory
damages in the world so if you actually
did it as a risk/reward calculation yes
it's true that there's a better argument
about fair use in the US but the damages
you're playing with on the backend are
way way way way higher and this is
something people never factored in it's
really important now luckily or
unluckily for you you're the one entity
who's engaged in large-scale enough
copying that it would add up anyway to a
standing sub so in your case this is not
consolation but but in other people's
case it would it would be great second
as you point out although these
countries say they're doing this kind of
particularly the lawyers there and the
parliamentary bodies say they're doing
this the judges actually show a very
different pattern and what the judges
show is a pattern of doing stuff that in
many cases is much more like what fair
uses in the US including saying things
like well even if this wasn't covered by
this it would just be covered by free
speech there's no way we could actually
stop you from doing this because it
would be protected as a fundamental
right no First Amendment right obviously
but uh so I think there's my vision was
yours until I did some comparative study
all this was focusing on the UK which is
maybe closer to the US and I actually
ended up thinking it was not quite as
horrific as I had thought but yeah there
is definitely a culture of education
going on there your greatest weapon here
is time the more me google has saved so
many people in lawsuits not by being
involved at all but because every law
student who come out of my class if they
learn one thing it is to say or by rote
if that were illegal google would be
illegal okay the- the- subjunctive
google sentence right and it turns out
no it's a great sense it's a just of it
and and it turns out that that almost
any expansive interpretation of IP would
make Google and illegal right hold of
you know the caching you know absolutely
spiders all you know whatever you had
the alternative services your book
search me it's great is that everybody
looks on you and for whatever reason the
onion has some very interesting musings
on this google is seen not only as kind
of you know inherently good but also
it's just like it's just there it's just
there in the world and often the one
thing you have to counter the seven
thing to mental tendencies i was talking
about is but then there's google
and people like to say no that couldn't
be illegal right I know that could
because it's google now if you get a
judge who pronounces as Google then I
would suggest that you settle the google
the google is good this international
thing the US intellectual property is
based primarily on benefit to the public
and my understanding is that most
countries it's based on i'm the king and
what I say goes so how is that affecting
how this plays have this merging and
harmonization plays out international
court wherever benefit to the public or
utilitarian encouragement to authors
would lead to higher rights that's what
we take and wherever I'm the king or
it's the duardo tour or the divine
rights of the Creator would produce
higher rights that's what we take so we
get the best of both worlds so I
actually was debating the I was I was in
I was invited definitely how I should
stop at three-thirty or when do I stop
this is why should I stop when okay so
people don't don't feel if you leave I
won't cry I was going to talk to the
French Senate about the internet they
were they were against it and there's
this great moment where I the president
has said it was introduced to my son the
self self saying David the one with a
hammer and he said I'll are you liking
valleys and my son said did you know sir
that the average pedestrian steps in dog
poop once every 88 steps on the Parisian
street sqlite years so sir david was
shuffled off quickly and i gave my
speech about about right it was vaguely
similar to what I've said to you and the
avrocar got up and said you know that
the French lawyers this is the sacred
whether it's nothing about calm else
what you're talking is industrial
property we are talking here about
something that is sacred it has nothing
there are two points it has nothing to
do with money and the author must get
paid
so I think that there is a culture gap
between the two systems or the two ways
of looking at particularly between do
auditor and the American sort of
encouragement of innovation one I think
the idea of you know the Divine Right of
Kings is kind of gonna basically you
just have to learn to have different
ways of arguing the justification
or what happened
this basic idea that
I new business practice and simply not
telling
and shoot anyone who seeks my factory
and find out about it and the time of
this was fortified we have recently
engagements industrial espionage nielsen
feeding technology your
wanted to make sure that you know that's
one thing I'm a not so the deal was you
tell everyone
and we'll stop them from doing it for
some period of time which is kept
it seems that there seems to be an
inclusive test
which never go
wondering why the test would be if it's
not something a complete secret
why is it something that any person the
same technology immediately find out
we've never want to send in a news 5 why
is it something that willing to give you
right great with the second but it's a
very good question and yes the one of
the main reasons for appearances the
idea with patents is we're better off
with patterns because otherwise one
slice of innovators will use trade
secrecy which will be worse because I
can conceal my innovation forever and
continue to charge monopoly prices and
it may even die out with me so we're
only now figuring out how the
Stradivarius and going arias violins
were made because that was run under a
guild trade secrecy system so we're only
now recovering it patents was the
socially desirable out 20 years of
exclusivity but disclosure and your
point obviously is as you said that
implies a test the test actually is in
US law you're only supposed to get
patents for things that are useful
original and wonderful phrase
non-obvious I offer this to you as the
phrase of the day other people's
relationships are almost always
non-obvious right if you find this you
know their marriage is not obvious
non-obvious is supposed to put a limit
on it the limit is vicita the parson
having ordinary skill in the art would
be able to do it or figure it out so in
theory all of that should be working for
various complex reasons perhaps having
to do with aging or undergraduate
education the Court of Appeals for the
Federal Circuit decided to ignore that
limitation in certain areas of
technology that they either didn't
understand or misunderstood they picked
genetic engineering and computer
software tough you know they could have
picked glass etching but they picked
genetic engineering and computer
software in computer software they did
something which is really interesting in
computer software their theory is that
it's done by people who
who aren't very smart and so either that
sometimes they say they're very smart
it's not really clear but so when you're
looking at what's the level of the
person of having ordinary skill you
basically pick like the person who tries
to recover the network when it crashes
and I lose my documents and say that's
the person having ordinary skill that's
a very low level of skill so what's
obvious to him or her might not be very
high right so they get to choose that
right that was when my in chemistry in
biology what they did was a little more
complicated they decided that genetics
was really just chemistry with
long-chain molecules okay they had
studied chemistry in the 60s none of
this stuff was there then sounds pretty
complicated to me and so there they
decided pretty much a priori that a
whole bunch of things that are now done
routinely by high school students were
completely not obvious as per se we're
completely not obvious per se rules
which allowed people to patent all kinds
of stuff that was just absolutely basic
two different methods to reach the same
result in both cases the floor you
described which is there in patent law
got pushed way down but a malformation
of the law the Supreme Court doesn't
like the Court of Appeals for the
Federal Circuit one of the ways in which
I agree with the Supreme Court because
the Court of Appeals for the Federal
Circuit has an uncanny ability to piss
them off by saying things like they
would probably defer to us because we
are the specialists Supreme Court does a
lot of things well viz Bosch figur but
what it doesn't do well is take people
telling them that they're going to defer
to other people so they're now up in
arms and you should expect several
ritual canings of the Court of Appeals
for the Federal Circuit over the next
three years they nearly did one in a
great case called metabolites which was
basically people saying that you could
patent the idea of having a thesis
testing it in the world figuring out
whether the results confirmed or denied
it I forget the rest um
they chose to dodge that one though it
was quite clearly the most insanely
broad patent claim ever but there's some
new ones coming up where they're going
to where they're going to smack the the
court feels the Federal Circuit
unfortunately my fear is they're going
to pick arcane picky little things
whereas what they should be doing is
smacking them on stuff like this I
should take yep
how do you act
protection in
there are some metrics that say that
before you know
for innovation now they're actually a
government where where are these metrics
I'd like to get it right so the one in
particular is a guy called Jim sorry
repeat the question so the utterly
crucial question which I didn't answer
my talk thank you for bringing it up
how'd it to the extent i'm talking about
evidence in balance how do we actually
figure out what the balance is where the
point at which you're no longer helping
innovation but actually hurting what
kinds of metrics are there then you
mentioned this research the guy who
family had a search engine the guy who i
was referring to a guy called James
Besson ve SS en who has some interesting
papers on this one as yet unpublished
there couple of others many of them have
to do with trying valuations that people
put on their patents in terms of like
how they renew them they also have to do
with empirical studies so they're all
imperfect like a participant empirical
studies how much do you rely on this
what are your motivations for doing it
do you think it's mainly defensive do
you think is that so it's a combination
of all of those things that I'm going on
here habit the larger question which is
absolutely appropriate how do you
measure it it would be for people of
goodwill this would be an enormously
difficult question but luckily for me
the boundary of IP has been pushed so
far that the extensions re-proposed are
so ludicrous that I can actually come up
with completely convincing empirical
cases that they are harming although if
we were doing rational IP policy it
would be much closer to the line and the
metrics are describing be much harder to
figure out so here's one when you're
extending copyright terms don't extend
them for dead people it is unlikely you
will spur innovation by doing so not
impossible but very very unlikely right
so that would be I think a strong
empirical argument another one would be
despite harmonization there's often a
time lag in people creating new rights
so if your people with roughly
equivalent economies an economy a
creates a new right an economy be
doesn't and you can observe the
industries in both areas and you know
control the best you can do the multiple
regression for the other things that
might differ it so case in point
European Union creates a database right
the US has no database right people
facts are free you compete on business
models on top of facts you add value to
them you can occasionally wrap
copyrighted shelves around the hbu condo
and the facts themselves there's an
initial surge of people entering the
European market which you would expect
big new monopoly right huge monopoly
right covers anything covers your little
black book of you know dates you had
when you were younger I mean it covers
everything covers telephone directories
covers anything you want what happens is
that both the rate of growth the
absolute size pretty much any measure
you want the US out dramatically
outperforms Europe after introduction of
the right so it's things like this now
let me be the first to admit there are
other ones where it's tougher because
you can't rewind to figure out what
would have happened without it and there
you have to rely on inferences and all
I'm hoping for is a world in which we at
least start looking to the evidence
where we get to the point of
befuddlement about some of this stuff
rather than assuming that we've got it
by always expanding quick response
clarification it's still it's
sort of balance between let's say
genetics where sometimes the drug can be
concussed millions in billions to
develop and then can be reproduced
ragan on the other side you have
software patents
the barrier of the ball is much
I just don't see how the same system
give a s for your ideal
not as lending
I was that taken
corporations or any
ownership
not quite not inventor Craig the
great questions also to repeat the
questions the first one was does the
point about incentives battling
incentives and negative effects does
that mean if effectively that we should
go to a industry specific forms of IP so
IP for drugs IP for genetics and so
forth because the rewards risk ratios
are very different and the product
cycles are very different and then I'll
come to the second one sec so as to that
a lot of people argue for that and in
fact interestingly some including some
people have benefited from it so Jeff
Bezos for example said that he would be
willing to have business method patents
but only for two years right because
that's all I need I don't need Liam I
did if you do that the problem you're
going to have is the boundary line
drawing which is always a problem and
there's that would be in which would be
insanely difficult now I have to say the
more I look at this I used to be totally
against this now I'm only marginally
against it I was totally against it
because I thought the boundary line
drawing would be problematic and because
I thought that the law would never catch
up with the technology fast enough to
come up with the new container before
something else had happened and so that
I in the perfect world where we could
design instantaneously and come to but I
thought that wouldn't happen seeing
what's going on has led me to say maybe
we could do it on the back end which is
adjust the kind keep the formal
structure of the law the same but then
adjust the kind of thing that this
gentleman was asking me about like
what's the level of skill in the art
required to get the patent right so that
the fundamental system is the same but
maybe you need more innovation on this
end right or maybe higher damages
judgments so I think we we maybe don't
need to have the completely different
system to get some of the benefits
you're describing and I would be in
favor of that as the second question
retrospective term extension it's etc
what about corporate ownership to the
extent that your goal is encouraging
greater innovation it's fairly clear
that they would have created for what
term they got because they did right
there are a couple of arguments that
this will help people out that one is
maybe it's the prospect of further term
extensions that kind of got Walt Disney
up in the morning
you know it's like one day this is
copyright is going to last nearly
forever I don't I don't buy that one
another one is maybe it encourages media
migration so you take all your old stuff
and put it on the new format du jour
there we have very good evidence and the
evidence is that it works much better if
it's in the public domain much much
better in fact another reason why Google
book at all so great 90 something
percent of all Western culture produced
in the last hundred years is a under
copyright and B has no identifiable
copyright owner which means that
copyright is locking it up while
providing absolutely no benefit right
and that's dreadful there's no
conceivable reason for that and that's
unfortunately what you get I would
rather have direct payments from my tax
revenues to the Disney Corporation for
all the films they want to keep in
copyright forever and just let the other
ninety-nine percent of culture pass into
the public domain after 25 years right
it's much more efficient system just
give them corporate welfare is what
they're getting but their corporate
welfare is at the cost of destroying
access to all of 20th century culture in
any fixed form and we should probably
stop there I'm gonna we keep expressing
good one-liners thank you so much
you
