on writing for translation or world
ready authoring our speakers Bjorn I'll
strat he has a dual degrees in
translation and interpretation and
taught at the Monterey Institute and has
consulted for 15 years two companies uh
doing internationalization of their
websites of their software and
documentation so please also remember
that this talk is being recorded and
saved your google specific questions
till the very end after we stopped
filming thank you and here's burn good
many dominant an sweat mixes you had the
recombinase to conan BAM google Tech
Talk let's get on the steamer women
through bizet some cryptic tribes okay
yeah so how did that feel and be seein
ya it edelweiss yeah so that's what it's
like for sometimes for translators or
even speakers for of a foreign language
to consume things that weren't written
or designed to be consumed in that
language and even though translators are
of course highly trained individuals
that have degrees and or you know
bilingual as much as you can possibly be
bilingual sometimes it's very difficult
for them to understand the source copy
because of certain speed bumps that I
call them speed bumps translation speed
bumps that may exist in your collateral
or in your documentation online help in
your user interface and today's talk
even though Google of course is already
very world ready because you translate
already into dozens of languages and you
have 50 or 60 interface languages you
can select for the Google search the
main Google search interface there are
still some things that could be finessed
a little bit and so today's talk is not
so much about oh my god this is horrible
and here's you need to completely change
what you do but this is really like a
coaching session to help you improve
slightly on the on the great work your
idea or doing
so what is world ready authoring it's
really about increasing the portability
of your output cultural and linguistic
Portability and because in modern
high-tech businesses English is just
another language it does really pay huge
dividends to design and author and think
about translation before you even write
the original and so this is why I the
second bullet point or a sub bullet
point it says translation starts before
you write the original which seems
counterintuitive but it really becomes
clear when you think about translation
and localization as an is not a feature
it's not something you can tack on at
the end it's like an architecture and if
it's not architected into the whole
document and electronic collateral
creation process it's going to be very
expensive later to fix it just like in a
house if you don't put the pipes in at
the beginning and or you have to tack on
an elevator later it is usually a lot
more expensive than if you had planned
for those things in the beginning so the
US English typically in a multi in a
national multilingual global company
like Google has to strike a balance
between the hippest possible
ethnocentric culturally SuperDuper for
American audiences version and a more
linguistically portable version which is
taking into account the 20 or 30 or 40
other languages that are still
ultimately going to be consumers of that
interface so it touches really
everything the layout the composition to
style the font choices and so on and
I'll go into a much more detail in my
presentation what are some of the
elements of World Radio authoring well
some of the benefits of world ready
authoring well if you have 40 languages
you fix it once in English you don't
have to fix it 40 times it's very simple
multiplication math that if you were
mediated once you don't have to then fix
it over and over and over again in the
translated copy the translation quality
goes up and the source text becomes
easier to understand also for US
consumers oddly enough writing for trans
asian good writing for translation is
actually typically good writing in just
period and so how many of you have read
Strunk and white yeah old-school Strunk
and white you know page for the clarity
and conciseness that also benefits
translation is actually one of the
hallmarks of good English writing as
well and one very important very bottom
line centric aspect of writing world
ready copy and world-rated you is is
that it typically takes about 20 minutes
to fix one of those or remediate one of
those problems and the 20 minutes of
crew by I have to you know place a call
to the translator to the engineer then I
have to translate engineering ease into
English and then I have to communicate
with the translator what that was to put
that button label meant and then get it
translated and fixed and updated and God
forbid it was a UI element so now after
we take screenshots and very quickly one
simple mistake can add up to 20 30
minutes of fixed time so even if you
have just two per page on 100 page
document in 40 languages it's actually
quite a good change of money to go
through that and make it a world ready
copy that you can save by doing that if
you do it once at the beginning of the
process do you all know what a locale is
by the way because I mentioned that it's
one of those translation technical terms
what's a locale
because for example and looting spades
nonsense correct so the answer was that
it's a particular code that tells you
what language and geographical location
this is designed for so for instance
Spanish Spanish vs Mexican Spanish
there's also this great construct that
all translators that are really you know
train translates love which is north
american spanish it's just a great the
construct doesn't really exist but for
convenience is used to cover the
spanish-speaking population in North
America and if you lived in Los Angeles
is another language now it's called
Spanglish and it's it's truly an
emerging language that probably a
hundred years is going to be like Dutch
and it's going to be another language
where church is for instance now
translated into j &amp;amp; bakery is the back
area and so things interesting you know
new language emerging there in Los
Angeles so I mentioned there's a quite a
few components to world ready authoring
and one of the really important ones
that it's going to get really expensive
and hard to fix is layout so for
instance translated text is almost
always longer than the original text and
the text while can be between forty and
three hundred percent this is an actual
German word I looked it up it's on
Wikipedia you can check this and it says
in flashy etiquette Iran 0ba homes of
God move autonomous Gazette's hmm it
starts with beef you have in flesh
etiquette along is labeling you go back
home is monitoring of God are the tasks
what ragams is transfer &amp;amp; Gazette this
law and so German is one of those great
compounding noun languages that you can
make arbitrarily long nouns and while
this is of course an extreme example
German words typically are longer than
their English originals and as our
Spanish words so because there are
there's going to be more words and
they're going to be longer one of the
things that are really hard to deal with
is a tightly constrained source space
could be a button it could be a tab
writer it could be a columnar layout and
so if you what's it pop-up windows right
or the google boxed the info box that is
constrained by law and the powers that
be marketing they can only be under 20
pixels tall well if you cram it full jug
full of goodies in English it's likely
not going to fit in the translation so
another example is map atlant Cathy
Ashton or laptop in some Spanish flavors
that's computadora portátil so if you
had a great little map it button on your
google maps and then you do it in German
good luck and of course this this means
anybody wants to take a stab at this
means this long German word so it's the
law governing the Supervisory tasks
regarding labeling of beef that's pretty
much it it's a a subchapter of a very
apparently very meticulous German
government agency that deals with
nothing but supervising how beef gets
labeled and if there's a law about it of
course so as an example I i went to the
google the public Google site to look
for some examples of what this is
actually already in effect today and you
can see that this column in a layout
here setting preferences fits nicely in
the bulleted form but then as soon as
you translate into german fest chillin
misleading phone and gentlemen it does
wrap and the german words are longer as
well so here it's okay it doesn't look
pretty but it's okay where it's not okay
is if it starts to have a constrained
space and gets truncated which happens
sometimes in user interfaces that are
not entirely HTML of web-centric for
instance on a regular windows dialog box
if you chop off a piece of award you
could change the meaning and so then
this becomes a real problem by the way a
lot of the examples are German not
because the German translation team is
doing a poor job is because it's my
native language so I felt most
comfortable selecting examples from that
interface
so here's some recommendations this is
always easiest to say don't do this but
obviously you can't prove a negative so
here's some of the things that you
should do if possible which is to avoid
an arrow or columnar layout it aids the
I reading online that's why the columns
are used in web on the web especially
because it's a lot easier to read a
narrow column on a screen than it is a
wide text it scrolls across there's also
the main reason why large format
newspapers use a columnar layout is the
guides the eye makes reading faster
however in translation it becomes more
difficult so you should assume that for
a column width that you would go
probably typically sixty percent wider
than you would have in English to
accommodate other languages and you can
quickly try this out by simply going to
a German newspaper website cutting and
pasting a chunk of text into your layout
and see how many words wrap in
translation it will hyphenate the
translators will be able to hyphenate
but if you just ever see if I fence it's
also not very pretty so a quick and
dirty trick is to just cut and paste
text from a German website or from the
German Google site and see what that
does to the word wrapping if it wraps in
a middle of a word it's typically going
to be hyphen ultimately and not not
super great layout so white space is
another very important thing especially
if one to one page correspondence is
important which sometimes it is because
you're going to produce a manual that is
four or five languages they all have to
be in the same page layout the same page
breaks the graphics don't get messed up
so if you don't leave enough white space
this will never happen and it's going to
be very expensive lay outing that has to
happen to make that fit and especially
size sensitive collateral quick start
guides package inserts spines of books
spines of boxes spines over Google
appliance and I know that you put text
on these sometimes right so very very
important that you consider that this is
going to be if it gets localized or
translated
you do have enough room for the without
an excessive amount of wrapping and
buttons and UI elements of course the
worst offenders because buttons have a
really hard time growing
in typographical conventions one thing
that English native speakers like to use
a lot is capitalization for effect
safesearch personalized search etc right
safe search is not only capitalized it's
spelled together in what is known among
coders as the Hungarian or sometimes
known the Pascal notation and so if you
see variable names sometimes you see
somebody write int and then you know
some uppercase letter and so on that
means typically it's a variable of the
type integer so for convenience people
like to glue those words together
capitalized the important words and that
has a special effect because it creates
the effect of a trademark or a branded
name of course in Asian languages and
with some native speakers here there's
no capitalization because it's their
idea graphic languages right so they
just use the character symbols so that
is lost entirely also if there is no
spaces between words then putting two
words together doesn't make a whole lot
of a difference also small font sizes
may make characters really a lot more
difficult to read than they are in
English for example you see the first
example the first bullet point here you
have the irregular a then you have an
umlaut a with the two dots on it and
then you have an idea graphic character
which I have no idea what it means does
anybody can anybody translate what that
character means help I must have cut and
pasted that from the website so at the
same font size note how it is a lot
easier to read the regular the English
letter there umlauts are a little bit
harder to make out and then the Asian
character is almost illegible because
it's smudge it's a dense videographic
character so I have to go up in the font
size to make the Japanese or Chinese
legible and one second and I can keep a
smaller font size so now imagine if you
had densely packed small text in English
it's going to get forty percent longer
after translation and have to pump up
the font size but one click to make it
legible so now a real text trial problem
right because i'm going to have suddenly
two pages worth of stuff and i have one
page to fit it on unless i want to use
you know farmers farm
illogical package insert font point six
with the reading glass for free yes is
there a specific minimum that I need to
repeat the question for the audio so the
question was is there a specific minimum
size font and the answer is now because
it depends on the language but I would
experiment with as a layering person who
creates the original I would experiment
with different languages to see if the
legibility is maintained at that font
size and if not leave more white space
because then ultimately one of the
devices that the foreign language DDP
person may have does the publishing
person may have is to increase the font
size to make it legible so it's just
something to keep in mind as part of the
world ready authoring approach yes is
bold used for emphasis in character
based languages it is used and it is a
sometimes quotation marks also used and
underlining are used on the web
underlining carries a special meaning as
in I'm a link so that's a problem right
but bolding is usually a safer thing to
do because it will carry well in two
languages that are not using the
capitalization org where you cannot use
capitalization because it's meaningful
like German italics are sometimes
pointless in Asian languages typically
italics are used for different cultural
contexts such as comics and so emphasis
which is in English italic seeing
indicate emphasis may indicate a total
cultural shift or inappropriate cultural
shift in some Asian locales so it's a
it's a tricky device to use so here are
some examples from the google website
what is personalized search it's
capitalized here for effect because it's
a particular feature of google and in
german let this effect is entirely gone
because now person or zip the sukkah is
it regular adjectives it's not
capitalized and if i write that in its
german translation i would never know
that personalized search is a feature
that you want to draw our attention to
because that capitalization is really
what that does it draws attention to
this word
that's a so the question was what how
would you deal with that in other
languages and the there are multiple
ways to deal with it for instance
bolding a different font type which is
also tricky an Asian languages as you
can imagine and if it's a trademarked
term you may capitalize both words to
indicate that this is a noun phrase that
belongs together and it's a trademarked
term if it's not trademarked then you
can't use that symbol of course and it's
it's a tricky issue it's usually
marketing decision what is done with
that how important is it because also if
you person if you capitalize the p here
it would draw attention to itself may be
unnecessarily so because it would be it
why on its face value would be a
typographical mistake if it's not a
trademarked term capitalizing the p here
is wrong as it isn't it's a hard hard
and fast error correct so some
recommendations again scaling font sizes
to work well with accented characters is
one important important consideration if
you can't if you don't want to do that
or can't in English just leave enough
white space or use some of the other
tools in your arsenal to deal with the
very very likely text while that will
occur quotation marks in bolding were
feasible was gold bolding carries well
but again keep in mind you have small
asian text and you bold it it becomes
illegible you had need to scale it up a
little bit and if you want to do
yourself a favor avoid creative fonts I
did one project in a past life when I
was working for Bloods translation
services and we localized to the Timon
and Pumbaa cd-rom games Timon and Pumbaa
was the jungle King you know many months
ago and they used a great and clever
font called the Timon and Pumbaa jungle
font which was all grubs and leaves and
sticks and things like that of course it
didn't contain a single home love so
there we sat in front are for four weeks
and made umlaut dotted oz and you know
strikethrough xin n years and things
like that out of grubs and trees to to
get that localized properly
coconuts yeah well you know there are so
many foreign characters if you ever want
to see what's really in each font go to
your Start button undone run type char
map and then scroll down and you'll be
surprised how many different characters
say oh that you need to recreate from
coconuts and trees and grubs to get
something localized yeah and the reason
why Unicode fonts are so large is
because they contain every single one of
those characters Arabic etc etc every
possible accented characters strike
throughs you know every possible
mutilation to a character that you can
imagine is in there now a very very very
important topic near and dear to my own
heart glosser ization and this is one of
the core ways you can influence
translation speed as a technical author
a document by and large cannot be
translated until it comes with a
glossary okay very important you cannot
just look it up that if you ever say
that catch yourself and say no I learned
that you can't just look it up in the
dictionary or online you can't even
Google just google it why well because
without context words have no meaning
very little meaning or many many
possible different meanings which is
even worse for translator and for
example the word set just a small sample
of all the different ways you could
translate the word set into spanish it
could be no juego if it's golf clubs but
that e I've it's kitchen utensil
cubierto colleague Theon servicio
escuche dental ora set of teeth so you
can imagine that this is just a subset
but you said it's like looking up Smith
in the phonebook pages and pages and
pages of translations time depending
again on the context right what time is
it we speed this is how much time does
it take we learned our this how many
times did something occur we all
finished up
so imagine your poor translator at 6pm
on Friday and somebody's dumping at a
translation task on your desk of string
tables every of doing what string tables
are string tables are basically all the
words that belong to a piece of software
and sometimes they pull all of those out
into one separate file and so not here
you are sitting and trying to translate
the word time or set well it's
impossible example glossary Tsar also
great for translating the same word
consistently over time and I found this
particularly delightful example so we
have the start site they which is
translated as home this is both alive
right now and your website by the way
Google he'll face ooh kill fair or
Google he'll fare let's help sukant lag
is gone Laden a vital azucar is for
finite asuka and philly via phone to
google may awake so Google that's
actually wrong were
more ways to Google hmm is it is it
supposed to be a verb in English no it's
this could be a noun yeah only vague if
you enough warm is this is the standard
German all all roads lead to Rome so it
is it is a noun so but as you can see
even if you have the best translators on
the world which I'm sure you do over
time there are so many different ways
you could translate the same word in
different ways that a hard glossary
becomes a real control on creativity and
welcome control because this is
confusing ultimately because I click
this is literally clicking back and
forth between two pages and getting two
different nav bars yeah these are this
is one link one one click away these two
yes well how we really move us for free
by the violet worth seven I'll get it to
that Gloucester ization recommendations
yes so here's some recommendations how
to make a good glossary include all any
and all companies and industry and
product specific terms even if you think
they are absolutely obvious because one
thing that is not obvious is that as
soon as you work in any place not just
google any place for more than a week
you will start to where that place is
verbal uniform and in verbal uniforms
work like this they are used as a social
marker if you speak a lot of technical
terminology that only your peers
understand it raises your social
standing you may have noticed this and
talking to some people especially if you
know a lot of acronyms these are like
metals on the verbal uniform and it's
great it as a it basically accelerates
communication it has its place doctors
talk in technical jargon amongst each
other because it's more efficient to
communicate this way they can say this
particular nerve latin word instead of
saying Mulder nerve do you know that
runs from here all the way down to here
and comes out yankel because that's not
very efficient however as soon as you
leave your social group then it becomes
manipulative or ineffective
and so my favorite sentence when I have
asked a technical person to explain
something to me is to say in a language
a twelve-year-old could understand and
in 25 words or less what is a compiler
and that makes great glossary entries if
you set it up like this mentally so
since we have a little bit of time in a
language of 12 y'all could understand
and in 25 words or less what is a
compiler anybody want to venture
definition yes
it translates the language a human can
understand or some humans into a
language that computers can understand
that's great it's a great definition
that's a very good definition and that
makes sense right it's like a
translation device and my grandma asked
me this question a few years ago and she
loved baking so I said it's like an oven
and you take the ingredients for a
program and you bake them and what comes
out is still the same ingredients but it
has different functions now so compile
is like an oven which made perfect sense
to my grandma so depending on your
target audience coming up with a good
glossary definition is hard but it's a
huge time saver because those transcends
will not call you and will not waste
hours and hours and hours doing
terminology research when it could be
translating yes yes so include all a's
eyes and a s acronyms abbreviations and
initialisms very very very important try
looking up DB in an acronym dictionary
again like Smith and the phone book lots
and lots of different meanings decibel
database and so on and so dun and
Bradstreet there are many many possible
meanings for DB even in the same context
and at the very least a glossary has to
have four columns a source term a target
term you can leave that blank because
nobody is expecting you to actually find
the translation for that term but when
you submit a glossary for translation it
should contain the source term which
part of speech is it very important
remember the set example or the time
example is that a noun verb adjective
pronoun on phrase none of the above in a
comment field and that the comment field
is where you can spend four hours
writing comments for a glossary and save
yourself / language 20 hours x 40
languages real big bang for the buck
this should be making making a glossary
a robust glossary should be part of your
translation process which i'm sure it
already is but it's a responsibility of
the source authoring team to really
contribute to that process the
translation team will create a glossary
but you
really make it a lot better and more
useful by contributing to that process
it was one question in the back there a
good question so the question was is
this specifically for the translation
team or for the target audience both
because the target audience benefits
tremendously from a good glossary
correct so that again it that the
question was just a target audience
influence what goes into the glossary
yes it does so the most expansive
possible version of the glossary will be
for the translation team and for a
novice audience let's say somebody just
bought Google mini and wants to spa get
into the network and they may need to
look up what the you know feeds protocol
is and is that its own word and what
does that mean even even though they
just bought the search appliance and
they are moderately technical just not
in your way you had a question okay
now to your earlier point of course
translation is not just replacing words
as you well know because otherwise
machines could do it and they still kind
of suck at it but we've been away from
perfect machine translation for 10 years
now since the 1950s so that's you know
we're making progress we're still ten
years away and there's a lot of cultural
content as well that influences imperf
uses language for instance if you simply
say the word Super Bowl you most people
in this room would know what that is
right and what what are all the things
that pertain to it what are some of the
words that go with Super Bowl football
championship snacks BBQ party but point
spread very good booze you know etc
right so the Super Bowl is a cultural
institution and a sports game but if you
say i want i went to a superbowl party
that means a lot that you don't have to
explain because you all share in the
same culture of course if you're in a
culture that for some bizarre reason
doesn't have to game a football not in
that form they played with a smaller
ball and it's round and you know the
soccer thing that's going on right now
then adding something that's culturally
relevant is gonna really caused a huge
translation problem the World Series is
the same thing do you remember the
subway series this was a few years ago
where two teams from New York played
each other in the World Series but you
could go between the two stadiums using
the subway so not so much world in a
technical sense of the word
constructions like great move not you're
not using those I'm just saying don't
potluck party what does that entail
that's everything from suburban living
too particularly informal way that
Americans interact with each other so
potluck party is simple straightforward
word if you have to explain to somebody
has never been to the United States you
could spend easily a few pages
explaining what that is hang ten etc etc
so even straight forward words like
school can mean many different things
school in Austria for instance is a lot
more about academics there's no school
sports does this caste system of jocks
and cheerleaders doesn't really exist
like that clothing is less relevant
after school activities are practically
non-existent while in the United States
the high school is the focal
with social life for most for most
people growing up and also take into
account that when you translate
something you also have to take into
account legal and technical requirements
for other business cultures for instance
here's an example of what is why is it
that you can get the number of steps in
the Statue of Liberty in under a second
put waste too much time and so on and so
forth so of course when I translate that
I would have to take something that is
relevant to my target audience that is
maybe different from the example the
Statue of Liberty because that's a
uniquely American example not the end of
the world and that this is you know a
professional translator will know what
to do because they're trained in doing
this very specific task just saying that
this is another one of those tiny speed
bumps it's going to slow down the
translation process a little bit and
here's an example of these are this
illegal disclaimer that has to do with
intellectual property and it's a good
translation it's accurate what I don't
know without being a lawyer a German
Austrian lawyer is does this mean
anything legally in that target audience
I don't know maybe this is reasons for a
lawsuit because I now violated a statue
of free information sharing from 1869
you know I don't so again translation is
a lot more than replacing words even if
you're the perfect legal translator in
this way in this particular place you
would need to cultural eyes it as well
here are some of the worst offenders of
transition speed bumps I called modifier
strings for instance I'll give twenty
dollars to the person who can tell me
tell me unambiguously what the first
bullet point meets got it right here
twenty dollars anybody what does that
mean yes volunteer programs that work
faster programmers that work faster or
could it be faster programs is it
developing faster or the program's
faster What's in accelerated
applications well if programs run faster
the be good thing right I'll have to
keep those sorry relational database
index schema that's one of yours
enterprise performance management
software solutions great but my favorite
is from an actual government report and
the government is the worst offender
when it comes to acronyms initialisms
and technical jargon followed closely by
engineers the Commission was impressed
by that this is an actual not made-up
example but a test project command
module reaction control system engine
oxidizer vapor inhalation damage recover
results translate the best dictionary in
the world plus google will not do you
any good in this this is not
translatable as it is sometimes it's
unclear the modifier strings are shorter
but they are loosely correlated in the
texts such as you must send the art
typography and color specifications to
us so are the specifications modifying
the art typography and color or just the
color we've driven to integrate system
development and sales and support
personnel on a global level again non
translatable as it is so what do you do
with these yes and we'll get there in a
second another another problem with
getting things out of context is that
sometimes words are spelled the same but
they don't mean different things because
they are either
mama graphs meaning there's pronounced
differently but spelt the same or they
mean different things for instance set
we already saw an example with the set
searching the database is an example of
something that out of context is very
difficult to understand what that means
is it a message to status message I'm
searching the database right now or is
it a chapter that tells me how to search
the database searching the database
here's how you do it in for us seats
four easy steps record or record have
different meanings depending on how it's
pronounced but of course on paper or in
electronic format you don't know what
that is telegraphic English empty
database does that mean I'm supposed to
empty the database the database is empty
and invisible plurals in Spanish I would
need to know how many servers are in
Iraq because otherwise I can't translate
it as I would in well German I could
just make one of those great compound
nouns and let the user figure it out
program update how many programs are
getting updated database update in your
case how many databases are actually
getting updated because the translation
would be different depending on if it's
a singular database or plural yes right
so I'll actually get to that on the next
slide it's basically you've left out a
key word either the database is empty or
how to empty the database and so now I
cannot translate this out of context
because I won't know what the intent was
right here's a great example from your
website Google Search Appliance feeds
protocol developers guide specifying
sculpting radius values food for thought
so how do you solve these guys and this
is again a great benefit to your English
users as well for example accelerated
development of applications to our first
example the twenty-dollar example or if
it's not not what if that's not what's
meant then obviously you can just
reshuffle it Google Search Appliance
developers guide for the feeds protocol
is that right is that what is meant to
be said there in the previous in the
previous noun phrase it's that's right
so look we incurred almost no txts well
just a little bit but it's a lot clearer
in English as well translation comments
is another huge time-saver especially if
you do have to export stuff into string
tables or into some disembodied forum
adding a little comment marker like
button label here and it means save
makes this word instantaneously
translatable what's wrong with nothing
it resolves by doing this you resolve
the puzzle of searching database that
the puzzle is searching database which
could mean how to search the database or
I am searching the database right now
and by either using one of those two
forms it becomes immediately clear what
this sentence means searching database
not so much and this is also it's
basically this technique expanding an
elliptical English for going from empty
database to database is empty while you
have sacrificed four characters two
spaces and is you've added a lot of
meaning and glasser izing invisible
plural is very very important server
rack contains one or more servers okay
no problem program update updates three
programs that maintain the database for
instance
last but not least graphical elements
are innocuous and I showed this to the
sideshow to Jenna before I presented it
here and she said what's wrong with the
mailboxes and absolutely nothing is
wrong with the mailboxes except those
are bread boxes in France because
mailboxes don't look anything like that
in Europe right and great gmail is not
using mailboxes anywhere it's all the
envelope symbol which is universal which
is a good great use of iconographic
design that is culturally portable this
means a okay anybody in Brazil here
means something slightly different in
Brazil like really bad in a World Cup
yeah great job striker for the other
team what's wrong with the yin and yang
symbol what does it mean in this country
here yoga studio something like that
meditation you know but it's actually a
pretty significant religious symbol to
Buddhist people so using that
frivolously might not be the most
culturally portable thing to do the
mailbox is where he talked about this
means stop in American English it means
hi in Iraqi Arabic this means come here
in Thailand this means victory this
means something like this in England and
the Red Cross and Red Crescent they have
a problem now because now the Israelis
have wanted to have a red star of david
for a long time but the nobody could
have reached that so they actually going
to change this symbol now to a red
diamond which is going to be the
universal symbol for a red cross and red
crescent and then you can put your own
cross or crescent inside / light /
country but they had to come up with a
culturally portable symbol so people
wouldn't be offended if you write
somebody's name in in Korea in red that
means that they're either dead or you
wish them dead so that might not be the
best thing to do and green and
arabic-speaking countries across a
religious color and I've checked this I
went to Al Jazeera and hope the Homeland
Security Department is not on
trail now but I went to several
arabic-speaking websites to see and they
also use green in their user interface
and I since I don't speak Arabic I
couldn't find out if that was always
with the religious context it's just
something to keep in mind that it might
be religiously connoted have somebody
check it make sure it's okay so for
instance here's some examples from the
google interface of course Google is
famous for its seasonally appropriate
Google logos and there's no reason
whatsoever to stop those I'm not
suggesting that it's just a great
example of a culturally specific akronoh
graphic design and I know that the
Google Austria has different symbols
depending on their holidays in Germany
and so on yes is there anything alright
are there any safe colors no no there
aren't any safe colors black gray and
white butt white means death to you know
why play ladies and so and so darn
tyranny safe colors and this is an
example from this was a think Sketchup
were roads or Google Maps i forgot where
the road symbol looks like an American
Highway sign of course there wouldn't be
much to a use of a foreign culture and
very very importantly concatenation have
you ever seen things like that or
written them worse unable to do
something with something unable to move
the directory generate the report delete
the file very efficient in English
because you just plug in words of course
it doesn't work at all in foreign
languages because the gender of the
report might be masculine so now the
other words have to change to fit that
so anytime you see concatenated sentence
like that assume as a default position
they will not be translatable and it
will cause huge rework and pain and
suffering in a translation department
and in the engineering department
because you will have to rewrite your
code and that's expensive concatenation
is for instance I will have a table of
words like move generate delete update
and I have another table where it's
called record file report directory and
then I'll stick them into this template
as needed and I'll say
make the sentence template unable to foo
something bar I'm able to move the
directory delete the file update the
record and and because i have so many
different possible permutations with
eight words that can make eight
factorial permutations it's a great time
saver in english and it's an absolute
translation killer because it does not
translate period your report right you
have to may have to change the location
other words may have to change because
now it's a different article because
suddenly the noun is masculine not
feminine and so on and so forth another
great time saver is your reports are
being printed or your port is being
printed if you see this all the time if
count less than one you know don't put
an s there of course in german not much
so here are some recommendations for co
catenation avoid it definitely avoid it
do not contaminate words into strings
and evil companies use concatenation
which Google is not right there are ways
around it for instance you could make it
slightly less slick in English by saying
number of reports printed x that is
translatable no problem because I've
taken pieces from within a sentence that
are meaningful and have isolated them
into one meaningful unit and a variable
so that is translatable if you ever want
to really get somebody some translators
blood boiling ask them if they if you
should concatenate you'll get the good
response so here in conclusion some
interesting translation facts it often
takes as long to translate something as
it did to write the original and to you
as technical writers this may not be
very shocking but to some managers it's
flabbergasting why don't you just sit
there and like a parrot you know just
type it in a foreign language no as a
technical writer did you just sit there
and write it in English what you don't
type fast I mean it takes you a whole
day to do a single page slow typists all
of you know because technical writing is
different from just typing it right in
translation is different from just
typing it in a foreign language
translation resources typically
translate about 2,500 words at most a
day you can do more if it's really
at the end of a large translation
project and you have already totally
assimilated the glossary and you're
totally in a flaw but by and large count
on being but 2,000 2,500 words optimized
source text reduces the number of
occurrences tremendously of these
translation speed bumps that take up to
20 minutes to fix and nobody in the
world what including yourself will ever
read the text as carefully as a
translator because they have to
understand every single sentence no user
no boss no reviewer no editor will ever
read your text as careful as a
translator so they can be your allies
and by making their life better and
easier they will be able to be more
productive which obviously helps Google
as a company translation is a complex
and creative process and it's it's well
beyond just looking up words which we
export a little bit of that today and
the number of qualified transcendence is
actually quite tiny how many translators
do you think there are in the United
States professional you know certified
translators five thousand more five
thousand would be a lot less than oral
surgeons there are actually a lot less
than oral surgeons yeah it's the
American translators association i think
has about 13,000 members it's not a
whole lot and there are other
translators that are not members but
it's a really small number typically
translation is a training that's between
two and four years plus experience and
people were constantly to keep the
languages fresh it's a highly etat
translation at the monitor institute you
can tell you there's a reason why there
is a two-year graduate program to become
a translator there's a lot to learn in
addition to having two languages okay
and that's pretty much it any questions
normal questions yes so the question was
do you do you avoid idioms and metaphors
some and I would avoid idioms and
metaphors if they have no apparent
translation such as something that is so
uniquely cultural like super bowl or
potluck or World Series that it's going
to be it's going to take a translators
footnote this big to explain if it's a
standing phrase like early bird catches
the worm there is a great trimmer and
Spanish and Japanese translation for
that it's going to say something
entirely different but the meaning is
going to be it's going to be possible to
carry the meaning across so no you don't
have to make your source text so bland
as to avoid all references to something
cultural you may want to Gloucester eyes
it and you may want to draw the
translators attention to it what you
meant to say with this metaphor what is
it that you really want to communicate
by saying Super Bowl or the bottom of
the ninth and the bases are loaded which
if you not from a country to place
baseball does mean much right so it's
not it's not and I'm not advocating
making the textblender but just keep it
in mind that this is going to be
something that's going to bubble up in a
transition process it needs to be
handled and managed but it's okay
