useful like generally understood to be
useful have been very hard to bring into
the world of web pages and Mark has been
working very hard to make those two
communities come together the result of
that is a piece of work called rdfa
which currently is processed by our own
web search for Rich Snippets I'd like
Marcus here to talk about how he sees
this work of all weighing and impacting
impacting the web to take us beyond
where we are today with respect to
vector Otto so take it away bark thank
you very much ramen hi everybody
obviously great news to hear that well
everybody puts it however they like to
put it so all the microformats people
have said hey Google's processing
microformats and all of my friends are
saying hey Google's processing rdfa but
either way it's good news on both sides
lots of exciting things that can be done
so my name is mark because ramen says I
have a small software company called
backplane based in London and we do
interesting things with xforms and the
Semantic Web and particularly rdfa of
late some of the things I'll show but
mainly what I'd like to talk about is
how I see some of the innovations that
maybe now possible as we put as we embed
more and more information into web pages
so obviously publishing on the web has
has never been easier and by that I
simply mean that anybody who wants to
create a web page or a website it's very
straightforward they can create a blog
they can you know send an SMS message to
Twitter from their phone and they can
get a web page that corresponds to that
so it's very easy the evolution over the
over the years to get to the point where
we're at now it's very straightforward
for people to publish to the web and
essentially the kind of foundation point
that I'll keep coming back to as I
go through is that that's the
infrastructure that people who are
interested in the Semantic Web and rdf
really need to be leveraging and that's
why rdfa is exciting this because it
leverages the the kind of HTML ecosystem
but anyway so data is more difficult to
publish and by that I mean if you want
to publish information like an item for
sale or something like that you
generally have to go to a centralized
service and actually type in information
into a specific format into a specific
form and that centralized system has to
kind of manage that information for you
so that ease of publishing a web page
like a blog page isn't really there with
the publishing of data but it's
interesting that when you when you look
around you do see that people are
actually trying to to do exactly that so
in preparing these slides I kind of just
rolled around looking for different
blogs and looking at different ways that
people are using their blogs and came
across here for example a blog very
simple very straightforward somebody's
set it up and they put the address of
their company and their contact details
you can see I don't know how clear it is
actually but the text in red there is is
the address of the company that set this
blog up and then every single post
within the blog is an item for sale each
entry each blog entry is an item for
sale and it's got basically an image of
the item for sale it's got information
about the price and so you can see that
people are using a blog because it's
easy to publish but the thing that
they're publishing is actually doesn't
really lend itself very
straightforwardly to it to a kind of
blog structure so that's kind of one
issue another issue is that in order to
put your information into a community to
become part of a community you tend to
have to do the same as that kind of ebay
scenario you have to go to some central
place in order to get your information
into somewhere so a good example would
be something like Yelp the review site
where you know anybody who wants to do a
review of a restaurant or a film or
whatever would actually have to put the
information into Yelp itself in order in
order to get their information aligned
with other people who are talking about
the same things and this obviously
raises questions about well who actually
owns the data and in particular again
looking around at how people are using
blogs came across a number of sites
where people were blogging simply
reviews everything that they do is
review so this site here is just film
reviews every blog entry each individual
blog entry is a review of a film that
this person's seen old films sometimes
you know videos or new films this
particular site has every single blog
entry is a book review this particular
site it happens to narrow it down to
book reviews about books for older
children so you see that the each entry
there is a is a book review and so you
can see for people like that I mean
particularly that last example can't
really see it very clearly in that in
that slide but the person who does the
book reviews site comes up about 15th in
the Google search for for this
particular book so obviously for them to
actually put their data into some
central site if there was a Yelp
equivalent of book reviews for them it
would be quite a big deal actually to
hand over that information because
obviously they're quite it's quite a
popular site you know they've done well
to get that high in the rankings and to
be you know because that's a general
search I just searched there for the
name of the book chander secrets so
obviously they're competing there with
Amazon and all the rest of it and so to
come on the first page doing pretty well
so the question there of joining a
community of getting your information
into a community of how you align your
information with other people you can
see people are using the blog format to
get their kind of reviews and things out
into the outside world rather than going
and joining the kind of yelp style
central size now of course the next step
would be that that you're kind of rich
snippets or
these kinds of techniques the Yahoo
search monkey this kind of thing would
actually not just enhance as the example
here the Yelp style or not Yelp style
the actual Yelp site but would also
enhance results from people like these
small reviewers film reviewers hobbyists
maybe or maybe they're they're selling
they're trying to sell books as well now
obviously the format is correct so the
processing that you're as long as they
have the correct format and so this is
part of the the theme that I'm pursuing
here is that because rdfa allows them to
add this information then they
essentially are able to get the same
benefit that we're seeing here with Yelp
getting that kind of rich formatting the
rich snippet formatting which we know
users like from what we've been told so
they would then benefit from from that
as well so even the small individuals
would benefit from that that's kind of
another area so we've got the people who
are selling products online each blog
entry being a product we've got people
doing reviews why should they put their
reviews into some central system they
want to keep them on their blog another
area of interest so I'm introducing lots
of areas and problems and then I'm going
to try and bring bring them together
another area that I find interesting is
publication for specialists imagine if
Marie Curie was around today doing
research and chemistry and physics as
she did or inventing many things she
would probably have a blog there are
many chemistry blogs out there where
people actually talk about the specific
research that they're doing and so again
once again you can see the blog format
being used in actually highly
specialized areas where the terminology
will be very precise it will be
something that doesn't really well me
something that most of the rest of us
are very familiar with unless we're
unless we're chemists so using this blog
format using the the architecture of the
web to convey very specialist
information so we're seeing in all these
examples blogs as
more than more than just simple posts of
text you know people sort of saying what
they had for breakfast or how they feel
and we can really see that people are
starting to push the limits of what what
this kind of format is you know people
are using it to have items that are for
sale as I've said people are using them
to review things specialist information
and then web pages that want to be data
is an example there which I'll come on
to in a moment so I'm not really
actually saying that blogging is the
future or anything I'm not trying to say
anything profound about blogging itself
what I'm trying to do is use blogging to
kind of illustrate but publishing a
fairly basic HTML page can actually take
on much more than simply being a basic
HTML page and my argument is that I dfa
and this idea of embedding metadata
within the page itself is what allows us
to now rather than these people who are
pushing at the limits of HTML it's what
allows us to now take it on and take
them further so it's essentially saying
that with rdfa publishing data now
becomes as easy as publishing HTML so
essentially saying that the ecosystem
the many different systems that are
available to publish HTML can be
leveraged to now publish data and it's
not quite the same thing as kind of like
an ebay I mean hopefully this will come
out and we may be seeing the questions
and discussion but that's not quite the
same thing as a data-driven site what
we're saying here is that anybody even a
static HTML page can publish data so
about to look then at how rdfa is
helping address those scenarios that
I've described and others but those are
some of the scenarios that I that I
picked up on and by the way if there's
anything anybody wants to kind of
interject or ask any questions or make
any comments then feel free to do so
at any time so the first kind of
category that i would like to look at
how rdfa is is helping is data
distribution I've just realized that I
haven't even inquired because of because
of the way Google and what you're doing
with Rich Snippets I'm kind of assuming
that people know what rdfa is but that
was probably uh everybody okay with that
I mean when I you don't okay so well two
things about it we're number one I'm
using it as a bit of a shorthand because
I'm saying really embedded metadata I'm
saying that any way of actually putting
information into the HTML page rather
than the kind of traditional Semantic
Web approach which would have been to
have a separate channel by a separate
channel I mean you might have had an rdf
XML document or even in RSS feed
actually you could regard as a kind of
semantic channel of information but a
channel of information that's kind of
distinct from the web page whereas what
we've done with our DFA and what the
people behind microformats were doing
basically the same goal was to actually
make the HTML page the carrier of the
metadata and sometimes it's carrying
metadata about other things and
sometimes it's carrying metadata about
itself so really when I when I say I dfa
through this i'm generally mean those
kind of solutions that allow you to
embed metadata the reason I'm favoring
rdfa is because it's it's very
specifically its goal was to align
itself with RDF so it's actually much
more precise than microformats but the
idea is essentially the same that you
put you embed information there as to
what it is that's its purpose as to what
it is it's a w3c standard now it's
something we've been working on for four
or so years which no no I guess that's
quick for the w3c we've been working on
it for quite a long time and it recently
became a standard and it's very much
about defining the syntax of how you
embed information it's not really about
saying what the vocabularies should
should be whereas microformats is much
more about the vocabularies and a good
example of
what the flexibility that that brings is
that when Google did its Rich Snippets
it just came out with its own vocabulary
got a lot of stick from it for it from
the Semantic Web community or some there
but the point is that you were able to
just come out with your own vocabulary
because rdfa is about the syntax and the
structure rather than the actual terms
so it's very much in the spirit of the
web in the sense that it allows people
to define their own vocabularies or
reuse existing vocabularies and put them
into their documents however they see
fit so rdfa is a standard and its goal
is embedding metadata in pages said okay
so this is a an example of a piece of
work that I've been involved in in
London and the central office of
information in the UK is a government
department and they're responsible for I
don't know if it's correct to say all of
the websites but they're certainly
responsible for a lot of the websites
and the communication messages that go
out in the UK and one of their jobs one
of the tasks that they were given last
year was to come up with a way of
centralizing all of the job vacancies
that were available across all the
different websites all of different
government websites or government
related websites so for example the army
would have their own job vacancies pages
the National Health Service would have
their own job vacancy pages here's an
example on the Civil Service website if
you want to be a civil servant here's a
job available standard kind of thing you
would expect you know where is the job
what's the salary range that kind of
thing here's a job on the NHS the
National Health Service again standard
stuff location salary range that kind of
thing so that was one of their tasks to
centralize the job vacancy information
so that so that the public could find it
basically across all of the sectors and
just in passing the kind of examples
that they that they gave to me where
they were saying if you wanted to be an
electrician or a plumber in Britain you
wouldn't necessarily think to go and
look at the NHS website or you wouldn't
necessarily think to go and look at the
army website for example and some of the
biggest the largest number of
electricians in Britain
because of all the buildings and the
hospitals and everything actually work
for the NHS so what they were trying to
do is make the availability of these
jobs known to people across the board
and people obviously can't go to
individual sites so that was one task
another task that they had to address
was what are called consultations which
I don't know if they go by the same name
over here but it's essentially where a
government department asks the public
for their input on a particular issue so
here's an example on the Ministry of
Justice website to do with voting
prisoners rights to vote and what they
do is they put these things up on the
web and they basically ask for feedback
from people they tell people how to
provide the feedback they provide forms
they provide email addresses mail
addresses and then I have a date by
which you need to get your feedback in
and again these are sprinkled throughout
the different websites across government
in in Britain so their task was to
centralize both of these things not on
the same website but to centralize both
of these things and make it easier for
the public to find these things because
obviously if you're a democracy and
you're asking for consultation you want
people to be able to find the site so
that they can give you their feedback of
course the problem is that each of those
sites use the different technology so
some sites there are some departments
that have a small number of job
vacancies and they just use static HTML
pages to put their vacancies up because
they hardly they hardly have that many
vacancies there are other departments
that use asp.net there are other
departments News Java PHP whatever so
everybody's got a different way and a
different workflow and a different
technology different architecture for
how they produce their websites and how
they actually get the job vacancies out
there now the traditional way of doing
it in the IT world would have been to
say right we're coming in with a brand
new system everybody must enter their
job vacancies into this centralized
system and then we will then publish
those vacancies up to the web in this
centralized website and as you can
probably imagine you know two years
would go by it wouldn't happen millions
of pounds would be wasted and the
project
wouldn't work because you know getting
people to change practices change
systems all at the same time it's just
kind of a non-starter so the solution
that they went for and this is how we
got involved the solution they went for
was an RDF a solution and this is the
main the theme this is now coming back
to the theme that I'm that I'm mentioned
before about leveraging the existing
HTML ecosystem the infrastructure of
HTML and the web HTTP and HTML really
i'm saying when I say HTML I mean kind
of the the architecture of the web by
leveraging that they were able to get
the job done very quickly and much more
smoothly and essentially what they did
is each of those departments was asked
to put rdfa into their web pages to mark
up the vacancies so those vacancies that
you saw in the civil service in the NHS
and across government they then
contained rdfa which very explicitly and
very directly told you what the salary
range was what the location was you know
what the job title was what the closing
date for responses for the consultations
or for the jobs was and all those kinds
of things so we created vocabularies and
all the things that they were necessary
to do that and once you had each
department that all each department had
to do was published the rdf a that was
it they didn't have to change any of
their workflow they didn't have to
change the way they entered the
vacancies or change the way that they
checked them or tagged them or whatever
that everything stayed the same as long
as right at the very end of the process
their scripts their asp.net whatever it
was output both HTML plus the rdf a and
then what we were able to do is then
create a kind of federated or
hierarchical whatever well distributed
kind of approach in the way that we then
consumed them so if you look at for
example on the very right hand side that
swim lane on the right represents
essentially the the individual servers
so that would be like the NHS or the
army
or the civil service or the Ministry of
Justice their individual servers then in
the middle the swim Lane with that one
box in the middle that's pointing to all
of those servers is essentially this
centralized website that they were asked
to set up that server that that that was
the kind of task that they were given to
sort of centralize the vacancies and
that that's represented by the the
middle swim lane and that servers just
periodically pulling in the vacancies
and the consultations from the various
government department websites but then
what it opens up so that's their job
done so each departments done their job
they've published rdfa the COI have now
done their job they've created and made
available to the public the vacancies
and the consultations but of course
because that site also publishes rdfa
the whole thing then goes you know
Turtles all the way up I guess because
now those green boxes represent third
party websites that come along and say
okay we also want to use this
information so somebody can come along
and say well we're going to have a
website that's purely for nurses and
we're going to have all the vacancies
that are available for nurses that we
will have effectively its kind of screen
scraping really but with very very
precise screen scraping because of the
the way it's tagged up so we're now
going to pull in the nurses vacancies
and we're going to put them in our
server and they could have got those
either directly from the NHS website or
they could have got them from the
centralized website and because idfa is
being built into each of these sets of
pages in each of these publication
processes then you you're able to get
this kind of very flexible hierarchical
well not hierarchical distributed i
think is probably a better better way so
that there is no Center to this I mean
I've laid it out of represented it sort
of right to left there but at any level
you could go and pull in rdfa from
another server so the key thing is
leveraging the HTML publishing
architecture that already exists and
o-tar her difference
when he did a talk at some semtech the
other day about the rich snippets and he
said that some of the your partner's
your launch partners like Yelp were able
to implement their rdfa and micro format
support in about a day and that's pretty
much the same kind of experience here we
did have like weeks of wrangling but
when they actually came to actually
doing the technology publishing because
you've already got the HTML and HTTP
infrastructure publishing information in
this way it's very very straightforward
ok so that's kind of the first area kind
of distributed data another area in
which rdfa from that group of different
scenarios that I had at the beginning
can help is this idea of owning your own
reviews is very much along the lines of
that model once you've got your reviews
on your blog in this case but
essentially i'm using blog was a
shorthand for any HTML publishing system
that's easy to use essentially once
you've got that then you've got the
ability to for it to be pulled in in
that federated kind of distributed
manner into some other server and
whether that's very generic into into
Google server or yahoo server in the
sense that with your crawling everything
or whether that's more specific it's
kind of a Yelp for books that comes
along and says right I'm now going to
pull in meat just reviews and I'm going
to centralize them all in one place and
I don't need to necessarily show you
this but if you haven't the this is the
kind of the text of the review that
somebody's written they've just this is
how it looks at the moment you know
stars equals five stars the title of the
book the author the you know if you just
got a few lines there the beginning of
the review and then this is how it looks
when it's marked up obviously there's a
number of ways you could mark it up I've
shown it here with the the Google
vocabulary and this is you know the
small number of changes that would need
to be made to actually turn this Jen
will review this general kind of flow of
text into into something that's you know
machine readable that could be starts to
become part of that infrastructure that
I showed so you get the possibility then
if somebody having in this case that
remember this example was the one where
somebody ranks quite highly in Google
search for a book you get the
possibility then of them retaining their
their site which they obviously going to
do anyway because they've done now
they've done that so far they retain
their site but they still now get the
possibility the potential of joining
some community of joining some other
kind of Yelp like ecosystem because now
you've got the possibility of their
information being in two places at the
same time or more now there's another
thing you may have come across the link
data idea I'm sure some people have but
there may be some who haven't something
that's getting a lot of attention at the
moment what with the British Prime
Minister appointing Tim berners-lee as
his personal advisor on linked data the
the idea i mean there's lots of
different things that people mean by and
i think often it's just generally meant
that you've got kind of databases that
that have some kind of identifies that
allow you to join with other databases
but i like to think of it more in
relation to the to the current web in
the sense that as you're browsing the
web if you have a bit more information
available to you about the information
that you're viewing whilst you're
browsing then you've got the possibility
then of doing other things with that and
pulling in other data at the same time
and we can start to enrich the user
interface for example so i'll give an
illustration of that now so if we kind
of think back to the example of somebody
who's writing the book review or
somebody who's written the restaurant
review or whatever we said that one is
one advantage of them surfacing their
information was that they would get the
kind of rich snippet
scenario from from your search engine so
that's kind of one benefit of the of the
market that I showed a moment ago of
kind of adding that information to your
to your blog post or whatever but i'd
like to show another advantage which is
the possibility to enrich the the actual
user interface when people actually come
to your blog and actually see your post
the ability to to well enhance the
experience so this is a kind of sequence
that i'm going to go through we're
essentially I've created a dummy blog
and what I'm going to do is put
information into the blog individual
posts but what I'm also going to do is
create what are called lenses which are
kind of mechanisms that will influence
the display of information based on the
type on the type of that information so
what I'm showing here this next sequence
of steps is merely kind of getting
everything ready in a blogger space but
obviously it could be done with with
with any configuration of web publishing
mechanisms it's not the ID I want to
keep emphasizing I'm not really saying
that blogs are somehow something special
it's just that they've got to the point
now where they're so simple to use than
anybody could publish HTML is kind of a
really interesting mechanism for getting
this information out so anyway so the
first step here I'm simply modifying the
template and if you can see but
so that's kind of step 1 add the name
space it means now I don't have to add
it every time in any post that I make as
I because if I'm a prolific reviewer I'm
going to be writing lots of reviews of
books and things then it just cuts down
a little bit on on what I'm going to
need to add so what I've now got is a
blog post but this blog post is rdfa
that describes how to display some
information in the blog and basically
the top chunk is a kind of selection
mechanism and the selection mechanism
just simply says go through the this
page and find anything of type review or
rather anything of type Google
vocabulary review so it's very specific
it's looking for review items that's the
first kind of cluster of four lines that
you can see as a gray hey is there and
then underneath it says this is what
we're going to do with it and in this
particular case it's just going to
display a message that says I found a
review and it's going to say how many
marks out of five it found then the next
step that we do is we add a few
instructions to the blog layout and
again you know this will all be stuff
that you're familiar with obviously
because you wrote it these blocks there
are just saying things like when when
you load this web page when this blog is
written out to the web in the same way
that you're able to add gadgets and all
this kind of thing in the in the in the
normal use of bloggers what i've done
here is i've just added some extra
little bits of rdfa so i'm putting in
little pieces of rdfa into little
snippets I shouldn't use the word
snippets cuz that's going to be
confusing into little blocks in the page
and that those bits of rdfa will get
picked up and be seen as instructions to
load these lenses these these these
things that will kind of influence the
display so done kind of three things
we've added the namespace we've added a
lens a way of displaying it which is
rdfa we've added the instruction to the
template to load the lens and all that
shows is just what they look like again
it's difficult
see but it's just a couple of lines of
HTML with rdfa attributes the final step
is that I create a blog post that
contains two things it contains your
review format which is the orange the
orange properties there and then it
contains an identifier which refers to
the ISBN book number and so what I'm
trying to show here is how the user
interface can be enriched by using
linked data another category then is
related to the the well the Marie Curie
example that I gave earlier and this is
the idea of vertical search this is
another scenario and this is something
that I think this is kind of the example
I've been in the years i've been
pursuing rdfa this is actually the
example that I often come back to
because this for me is I find quite
exciting so don't if you can see that
but if you were to search there for
something like benzene compound the
results you're going to get back if
you're a chemist are pretty useless you
know they're going to be sort of
Wikipedia articles they're going to be
stuck there's stuff there on health and
safety I mean they're great for Joe
public you know for me who knows nothing
about chemistry but for a chemist or you
know somebody who's a specialist in a
particular area they're going to be
pretty pretty meaningless now there are
actually sites where you can do a search
there are specialists sites that sort of
say okay we're going to aggregate all of
the journal articles we're going to
aggregate the blog posts I guess you
would sort of want to see this in your
model you'd probably want to see this is
a custom search scenario but of course
the problem with that is you have to
actually give it all of the you are eyes
of all the places that you want to
actually bring data in from although
before I go on to that the I should show
that the unfortunately even though so
the interesting thing here if you do a
search for benzene on that site you
don't get any articles and yet I found I
found articles about it by following
links on the science so so obviously
well
no need to tell you guys that search is
a difficult business but they don't even
get it right there they're trying to
monitor all of the bits of information
but they actually you can't even use it
in the way that you would like to use it
obviously is a valiant effort and they
have lots of sites that they're linked
to on there but even though I know there
are tours on there which I can found if
I navigate around and look through to
the links doing that search that I just
did doesn't actually retrieve anything
so so it's quite and it just shows that
the problem is you know quite a tricky
one so this is an example of the same
technique I showed earlier where
essentially this is just a screenshot
though what's going on here is is the
kind of combination of a number of
different themes that I'm talking about
here where we've enriched the user
basically what we've done is just in the
simple demo is added rdfa that
identifies chemical compounds to the web
page so that's quite important obviously
from the point of view of search because
it means that you can now actually say
this article is about this specific
compound this blog post so in a in a
vertical search scenario you could
surface that even though there'll be far
fewer links to that article than there
would be say to the Wikipedia article
about benzene for a specialist for
somebody who's working in the area it
makes it much easier to find these kinds
of blog posts so that's number one added
a couple of bits of markup which our
show in a second to indicate chemical
compounds and the names of them and the
identifies of them and then this then
goes through the same process that I
showed earlier with the with the books
on the blog it fires a few messages that
say oh I found some chemical compounds
it says what do I know about what to do
with chemical compounds and in this
example this it knows that it can add a
tooltip so that rather horrible looking
yellow block in the middle just below
the rather horrible looking icon is
actually a tooltip that's been added
automatically by this processing so
again you can see the difference here
between something like the go to Amazon
and grab a bit of code that you can
embed in your page I mean who's going to
do
that for every time they refer to a
chemical compound whereas if you can
just put an identifier in like this and
that's it and then you get the benefit
of this richer user interface you can
see there that the diagram representing
the compound in the in the tooltip when
I mouse over that's something that's
much more meaningful to the chemist and
then of course we get the benefit that I
was just talking about before about
targeted search the ability to do
targeted search so kind of lots of
different things i'm throwing out here
and but essentially the the theme i mean
you know that there are there are more
problems that it solves than the ones
listed here so obviously the substance
of what i'm talking about is not here as
a list of all the problems solved by
rdfa it's much more this new way of
looking at some what is cipro I guess
it's it's sent if we look at HTML pages
and the HTML and the HTTP HTML
infrastructure in a slightly different
way and look at it as a bringer of data
then we get all of these other benefits
we get the possibility of having more
targeted search both specialist search
vertical search we get the possibilities
of organizations being able to publish
data more easily which was the center
office of information scenario with the
vacancies and the consultations and
obviously that's a big deal at the
moment over here as well in the US about
making data available to the public and
to IT making it easier for individuals
to publish data you know the the book
review restaurant review scenario the
items for sale scenario and then the
customization of the user interface all
of these things are available once you
start embedding richer data into the
into the web page
and I didn't want to talk for an hour
and then sort of you know rush off so
I've actually kind of kept it to that
because um I'll be interested to hear if
there's any questions yep sorry I missed
the first part of your talk but I'm
wondering is there stuff that you wish
google would push on for rdfa you know
beyond what we're already doing beyond a
little that we're already doing well I
think there's um I would love to see the
two sides really 11 is this sort of I
have this mental model of kind of this
line where you've got servers kind of
over here doing all their clever stuff
and then the UI and all the things that
I'd like to do over on the right
metaphorical but anyway on the left hand
side the kind of server side obviously
you can make search more targeted but I
would imagine that's the kind of thing
that you're going to be looking at doing
or already doing anyway but that kind of
being able to know when a specialist is
searching for a chemical compound rather
than Joe public searching for the same
chemical compound that that obviously
would be fantastic to be able to have
that that level because I think I do
think that you know in the spirit of the
web kind of as originally conceived and
obviously Google are very into this
whole idea of it being a kind of
research a place where research is done
and information shared it would be
fantastic to connect these people up and
when you watch them struggling you know
I sort of chemistry's the one I've been
following over the last couple of years
because there are a couple of people who
are trying to use our DFA in chemistry
they have been for a few years so I keep
looking and thinking God it would be
great if you could help these people you
know communicate and swap papers and
swap research and this kind of thing so
that that side of it I think would be a
really rich area to pursue I would
assume manitech you know financially as
well I would assume being able to create
these vertical you know targeted
advertising all the rest of it is a
benefit and then the other side I think
would be really good would be if you
could play back the rdfa in the search
results so that I could then customize
my user experience in the way that I've
that was showing there but people could
choose their own customizations I have
this you know kind of idea that it would
be possible at some point kind of
imagine the way things like the browsers
like Firefox have their custom style
sheets you know at the moment you can
switch in a different style sheet but
imagine if you could take that to a much
richer level and sort of when I see the
results for the restaurant I have a
different interaction with it than how
you might but rather than having to go
to a completely different server to get
that different experience we could all
be leveraging the same server Google
Yahoo whatever but actually having a
more custom experience based on our own
settings or you know and the IDF AI feel
allows that because it sort of brings it
brings the data right to the surface
rather than hiding it on the server
which is the way obviously we're 20
works at the moment you hide all that
stuff on the server and then you just
punch out a bit of script that does
something clever in the client but
there's nothing else you can do other
than that clever thing
thank you for coming one of the one of
the things that you mentioned when Rich
Snippets came out was that we took some
flak for the way that we defined a
format so i wondered if you have any
suggestions for for google about how to
be involved in the community in a way
that still is pragmatic but also
something that that's going to make
people really excited difficult one to
answer mean well because firstly it's a
community that you may never be able to
please you know so you know which is not
to say that Google should be any more
arrogant than it already is because I'm
sure you don't need any help with that
you know but but it's going to be
difficult to please because there's a
lot of I don't want to go down this kind
of idea that there's academia because I
think that's an unfair criticism that a
lot of people make about the Semantic
Web you know there's these academics
over there and then pragmatists over
here but obviously there are a lot of
people who are very very concerned with
the the the infrastructure and getting
it right and they're going to be vocal
you know when they think people don't
get it right so some of us were partying
and thinking wow this is amazing what
Google's done and other people were
saying you know about time too and
they've got it wrong you know so that's
the kind of first thing it's going to be
difficult to please everyone but also I
don't know where I see what we did with
the COI work is it was really impressive
how far sighted the people at COI were
because the first thing we did the first
thing they asked me to do is create a
vocabulary and I said what can I create
the vocabulary in public and in fact i
set up a google code project with all in
svn got an issue tracking system got a
public list blah blah blah I say can I
do it in public and just get people to
to input ideas and things and hopefully
reuse the vocabulary and try and create
a community and the reason I mention
that is because i'm not sure you're not
going to find a community you're going
to find communities of interest so I've
got you know the people involved in that
are people involved in kind of
government vocabularies and ontology
zand that kind of thing but there's
nobody there who's you know talking
about price vocabularies or product
description vocabularies so I think it's
some
there isn't you know you say get
involved with the community I guess you
could but you'd have to find the right
one and sometimes I don't think you know
sometimes I think it's fair enough to
just sort of say we'll look I mean the
figures you were showing the other day
at semtech and Peter mica from yahoo was
showing about you know getting this in
perspective about the level of adoption
of this kind of stuff is so low than
actually coming up with a brand new
vocabulary that works you know you could
say well why not you know because
there's so much more to do why don't we
just get on with it so you know
obviously what people don't want to see
though is that somehow Google's got one
thing on Yahoo's got another because
they think they're going to kind of
Microsoft blackbirds style you know own
the space kind of thing you know and
obviously people don't want to sense
that but if they sense that it's it's
based on a legitimate thing so for
example you made the point the other day
one of you about you you went with that
particular style of vocabulary so that
there weren't loads of namespaces at the
top of the document I think that's quite
a legitimate observation I think you
know people have to we're talking at
lunch about this which I think that's
something that we have to address in
other vocabularies going forwards is you
know making it as easy as possible for
people to use so I think if people sense
that it's based on you know a healthy
kind of attempt to solve problems I
think you'll be okay but but which they
don't join the communities but I think
you have to find the right ones and you
know what do you plan to do with this
vocab read or go or what you know I
differ I mean what's its kind of how is
it going to become a community I think
the answer is that the data vocabulary
org the main purpose is to document what
we will ingest basically so the process
for defining some new vocabulary would
be separate from that mm-hmm and it
might be you know code google com would
be a nice idea except then this has even
more of the Google is
this stamp on it so we'd actually like
to find some other way to set up a
community to define a new vocabulary and
then once we've agreed on it we can sort
of assert that we're going to accept
this by putting it on data vocabulary so
databook hablar is really like it's the
end point I guess of the process of
defining the vocabulary in our viewing
so so would that would there be any
point of which you so you asked me
earlier what would I like to see do you
just reminded me of another thing which
is just processing any any rdfa because
you're phrasing it as if you're going to
you know peer you accept another format
yeah so that I mean so for our main use
right which is to show things in search
results mmm the main hurdle is we have
to understand what the I mean it's not
in a way it's not semantics unless both
parties understand it right so if you
mark up your page in legitimate rdfa
with your own property names let's say
we have no way of understanding what
that means people try to use same as and
other mapping schemes but your
assumption there your assumption there
is that you're one of those two parties
yeah you see whereas my my model is the
you know the vendor is parte 1 and the
searcher is party to and you're just a
conduit so yes I understand it I mean
obviously you know there's a level of
which you want to understand it to
enhance the results but there's a whole
other level at which oh yeah we can
certainly take off in a yeah so I mean
one thing we could do is we could pass
through about tags in some way so that
on the search results we you know put
them in the mark-up so that if you had
plugins that detected those and looked
for linked data you know you could see
it on the search results so we could do
things like that that where were just a
pass-through so would i would custom so
custom search wouldn't currently get
things that you don't recognize so the
pass-through isn't there at the moment
or so yeah this maybe you guys should
come over here on our candles so that
there's a distinction to be made here
between like an actual custom search
engine
if you're familiar with the custom
search engine product we define like a
search forest site or a collection of
sites and regular web search so for
custom search engine yes we do intend to
pass it through raw because they're you
typically have you know some custom
search creator who knows about the
domain that they're talking about knows
is serving a specific vertical you know
and wants to give their users specific
user experience and so they'll write
their style sheets to style things based
on the semantics of that stuff for their
users and so in that case you're
absolutely right we don't have to
understand it we just have to store it
and pass it through for them on regular
web search on the other hand we have to
say okay you know we're responsible for
serving the best stuff to the whole
community of web users out there to get
them to their results as fast as
possible you know and what's the UI for
all of these long tail domains and we
also have to worry about spam a lot more
ya know but that'll be perfect I mean
that scenario you described of the
custom search pass through would be
absolutely ideal well in fact this
exists are for those custom search
engine customers who get results in XML
we already pass through the rdf AR
microformat data that you put in we just
have a common sort of key value
dictionary format in which it comes back
in your ex and all results and we're
working to extend that to the other
formats in which we serve custom search
so yeah ya know we're excited about that
case also mm-hmm that's great
I've got any more questions for you at
the moment but not only anybody else
anybody like to anything on rdfa you
know you want to so maybe I should say
something on that the one of the
scenarios that we're talking about is
actually being able to allow people to
use values unpressed and I think that
that would go some way to addressing
your issue about coming up with a names
one namespace that you can use rather
than sort of foaf and dublin core and
all these different ones that could have
been there
yeah but i think the the the in inverted
commas semantic web community has gone a
long way to solving a lot of those
problems but what they've done is
they've got a lot of the technology to
solve those problems but what we're now
which is gray we're now moving into a
space where we're saying okay how can
authors add this stuff that's why I was
trying to show the example where I said
okay here's a google blog i add a little
i had a gadget effectively which just
contains a bit of code i added the SI
out of that and there I've got this rich
you I so I was trying to show how we can
start to move to this next phase where
under the hood there's all sorts of
clever our same as stuff going on and in
that world in the one I'm describing
where we're now talking about developers
JavaScript programmers HTML authors
adding this stuff I think we are into
the space where we do need to think
about how many namespaces are being you
know put into the head of a document and
that kind of thing it's that
mm-hmm
I
well in fact that's slightly the other
way around but I would say you're on the
on the right track and so this COI
project that I described that we did for
the government department the google
code project we set it up we had wiki
pages for the vocabularies and the idea
is that the site is actually nothing to
do with government as such the site is
called Argo hub googlecode com Argo
being a rgot hyphen hub and the idea is
that it collects together as ramen says
vocabularies and different ways of doing
things like a kind of recommended best
practice sort of saying use this dublin
core term use that for term this kind of
thing now that was the first pass we
used wiki pages on google code to do all
of them but the second passes they were
actually creating now much more precise
documents which are HTML documents with
rdfa in which define our ontology 'he's
to express much more precisely exactly
what it is that we want so you can see
the kind of whole thing eating your own
dog food I guess but the whole thing
starts to become much more precise and
people can then use tools to generate
documents from this information but then
you've also got the documentation and
the the actual specification are kind of
in sync all the time because they want
on the same document so okay well thank
you very much for coming so sunny
outside so maybe we should go back out
there thanks a lot
