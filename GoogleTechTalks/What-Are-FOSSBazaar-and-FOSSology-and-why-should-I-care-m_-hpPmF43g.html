pleased to present today
mr. Phil Rob with the hewlett-packard
company and Phil is actually the general
manager of phos bizarre work and I had
the pleasure of meeting him at in Linux
coffee you this year and he was nice
enough to offer to come in and give us a
tech talk on what is fala g and
phosphors are and why do we care take it
away Phil thanks Leslie so this talk by
and large is going to be about
governance and managing open source
inside of a corporate environment or an
institutional environment and by and
large particularly for developers that's
not typically the most entertaining or
interesting discussion that one might
care to have but still one that is kind
of important so I'm going to talk about
it anyway so I'll first start off
talking about me who I am what I do talk
a little bit about HP and what we do
with free and open source software or
false user innovation networks touch
upon those a little bit as well as
fauces adoption curve and where we see
it and I'm going to a little bit about
why open source software is different
than third party commercial software
that is currently mostly installed
inside of institutions and enterprises
today then I'll talk about what faas
Bazaar is and what fasala G is and what
we're trying to do with those so first
Who am I so software engineers since
about nineteen eighty-two mostly doing
UNIX internals and a networking stack
work term full-time manager in 1999 and
much to my chagrin haven't coded that
much since then so now I try to find
other ways to contribute to such efforts
started working with open source
software when i joined HP in 2001 and
one of my first tasks there was to work
on their open source review board in
their open source review policy and this
was back when HP was just getting a good
handle on the amount of open source that
we were using in the value that it could
bring to the company
so we wanted to be able to manage it
understand it manage it within our
environment currently I manage the open
source program office which includes
that open source review board as well as
coordinate hp's involvement with the
open source technical conferences and
lead our general governance tools and
the consulting work and then as Leslie
mentioned and also the general manager
of phosphors are so a little background
on HP and open source because i think as
i look at HP and i look at other
companies we may be using open source in
more ways than any of the company that i
can think of because we have such a
broad variety of products we certainly
use it internally with things like
jaburn on our email our openldap
infrastructure our entire directory
services infrastructure is based on
openldap we also incorporate it into
most of our software products we ship
full distributions of open source
software and we embed open source into
all of our when too many of our hardware
products including digital printers
cameras our storage devices and so forth
and then we're also active participants
in the community so in a way it's kind
of like Google as well in that I think
Google started and was young enough as a
company that you were able to create the
company around open source and be able
to utilize it as best as possible
whereas most organizations have a legacy
infrastructure they have a legacy set of
processes that they're used to working
with around commercial software so
Google unlike most organizations had the
benefit of creating your own policy and
processes around how to use software
including open source software at your
at your creation so I'm going to talk
now a little bit about user innovation
networks because that's that's the
essence of what faas Bazaar is and it
kind of encompasses also open source
software so
there's a guy by name of Eric von hippel
teaches out of teaches out of MIT Sloan
School and he's written a book called
democratizing innovation and in that in
that book he really tries to evaluate
and understand how innovation is
changing and who's doing the innovating
is changing from large corporate
entities with large research budgets to
individuals who have the ability to
contribute now and that happens because
the definition of a user innovation
network is some group of people with a
common objective or a common problem the
soul all right and they have some method
of communicating so that they don't have
to be in the same room they don't have
to be in the same time zone they have
some method of working together across
those that space and time they have a
set of tools that allow them to
collaborate and work together on
projects and overtime cultures evolve in
policies within that organization that
self-forming organization occur so that
they can actually become very effective
in their efforts so the end result is
you know many individuals contribute
small amounts of intellectual property
and the end result is often far larger
than the sum of its parts and if that
sounds familiar i mean that's that's
very much what open source does right
large disparity group of people common
problem common set of tools that they
want to understand comments are the
tools that they want to build or some
problem they want to solve with software
they get together within that
organization and they build something so
so free and open source software is
actually one of the best first examples
of a true innovation network a user
innovation network if you recognize the
picture on the right that's that's from
Lars that's a photo mosaic and I thought
I did a really good job of depicting you
know all of the individuals come
together and the end result is extremely
powerful distribution called Debian
but you know developers and system admin
administrators again started off
particularly with Linux back in the
early days they had a problem they
wanted to solve that a tool they created
it they threw it out there on the net
they said here you might find this
useful I did and what ends up happening
is it comes back and somebody's added a
feature to it hey this was cool it
didn't quite solve my problem but I I
added this I added this piece of
functionality because that's what I
needed so take that back and then ends
up building upon its building upon
itself right as more and more folks get
into that community the web has provided
that frictionless information or
frictionless communication method and
tools such as Google search so that
these folks can find each other bugzilla
IRC email of course subversion these are
all tools that that these developers use
to be able to collaborate and you know
depending on the project that you're
talking about there are different
cultures that grow out of those
organizations as well debian has a
pretty unique culture right and they're
very good at defining what their culture
is defining what their policy is what
they believe in writing it down and
making sure that it's enforced then one
of the best examples of a self forming
organism right that has been able to do
that so Wow free and open source
software is one of the first best
examples of the user innovation network
there are actually many more they're
more in their infancy than Linux or most
open source projects are but some
examples are the early sale boarding
community this is one of the first
examples in in erich von hippel book
where he talks about how people were
trying to you know trying different ways
of lacing their feet to the board and
the different size of the sales and you
know getting pretty much impaled and
slammed into the water when things
didn't go right in those early in those
early prototypes they kept working they
kept building and some of those early
adopters some of those very beginning
users ended up going into business they
star
and making boards they started they
continue to innovate they continued to
work with their group of of hardcore
early adopting users and they ended up
building this building a business out of
being able to bring sale boarding to the
masses Chris Anderson is the guy who
kind of talks about the long tail where
I would also put phosphors are which is
why i'm interested in Chris Anderson
right not a whole lot of people care
about open source governance but the web
is one is a nice medium to actually
allow you know many many many different
types of groups with very specific
interests come together and solve
problems together Chris Anderson in his
latest endeavor he's got a website their
do-it-yourself drones because he and his
son are really interested in unmanned
craft and it's an entirely open source
project it's hardware based right it's
you know designs from everything from
the Control board's to the engines to
what the crafts wingspans need to be and
so forth but it's all about it's all
about just trying to try to try to build
drones you know unmanned flight vehicles
on your own today's educational
communities are the same way right we
see more and more groups who are
collaborating with best practices on how
do I teach my kid x right you can go to
different websites you can learn you can
learn you know what's the best way to
teach division if they're having this
kind of problem what's the best way to
get my kid to remember history or
whatever right and it's the same type of
thing now it's not just being left up to
the teachers because the users or the
parents in this case have the ability to
collaborate and they have a means and a
mechanism to be able to do that faas
Bazaar is also a user innovation network
and it's kind of different in that it's
focused on open-source software but it's
not focused on development it's not
focused on code or code creation it's
actually focused on what are the best
ways to actually
image open source inside of an
organization and here's here's why I
think that matters so I think we can
look at open source software and its
adoption in many many organizations and
it's it's it's very much in its early
adopter phase so if you look at you know
the the original categories of
innovation there's an early adopter
phase right there's an innovator phase
an early adopter phase early majority
and late majority right and Clayton
Christensen's book talked about how
right in here or rather right in here
between early adopters and early
majority there's this chasm right
because early adopters are certainly
there are developers and the sis admins
who want to work with open source but
there are also companies who are okay
taking the pain of understanding and
working with some new technology they
take the time they take the effort to
understand it so that they can use it as
a technical differential advantage to
themselves when they're when they're
working in competing in the marketplace
right the early majority is they carry
the extra burden to the developers that
the early majority has to have something
that is easily consumable by them all
right it either has to fit the existing
processes that exist inside of that
organization or it has to be around long
enough that it's fully understood by
that early majority right and if you
look at managers inside of typical
typical organizations around the world
be it enterprises institutions or
governments that's the barrier that
they're facing right now with open
source right many of them actually are
just coming to the realization that
they've got a bunch of open source in
their organization and they didn't know
it was there right we'll get to that in
a minute but when they do realize it's
there they have a whole bunch of
questions that are on I answered because
open source is new enough that it did it
it isn't easily explained to them and
we'll talk
about those in a minute so regardless
open source continues to march on open
source continues to permeate
organizations 2007-2008 2010 open source
will be an eighty percent of the
infrastructure and twenty percent of the
business software investments so those
are numbers from gartner and you can
watch in the good thing about the
analyst firms is that you know once
there is some kind of a trend that can
build their estimates get relatively
accurate and they don't they haven't
change these numbers for a while now the
only small variations so it's pretty
well understood there is a trajectory of
open-source penetration into
organizations and it continues to grow
so why is open-source different than any
other software and what are these things
that matter around governance for open
source there's one thing that commercial
software you have to go through when
you're working with it in development
and that's procurement so you know these
are the people that you typically don't
like to talk to because they have all
these questions and they have all these
requirements and all you want is this
piece of software right be a user be it
a user be it a developer you know
there's only one thing you want but you
got to go talk to him right to get it
and they ask all these questions you
know their job is to make sure the
number of suppliers to the company is as
small as possible right make sure that
you get the absolute best price you
possibly can for that software make sure
that that company is viable and is going
to be around in ten years make sure that
you understand what the SLO with the
service level agreement is and what the
support contract looks like right these
are the things that procurement cares
about and they track for the company
whenever any kind of software asset is
brought in or any other asset as far as
that goes all right so with open-source
it's a one thing that's missing because
the open source can be so easily
acquired you don't have to have anybody
cut a check you don't have to have
anybody
you know pay an outside vendor so you
don't have to go through procurement you
can just pull this off for down off the
web so then what does that mean as far
as challenges with bringing open to our
software well here are the questions
that you need to answer right and i give
this same talk fundamentally to both
managers and to developers and when i
talk to the managers i say these are the
questions you should be asking and when
i talk to developers i say these are the
questions that you should already have
answers to when you go to your
management you want to use this software
excuse me so how is it acquired right
how are you actually pulling it down how
is it coming into the organization how
is it chosen so how mature is it how did
you select that particular package are
there other organizations inside of your
company who need similar technology and
are you working with them so you're
making sure that you're not pulling
different versions or different packages
from different places when you don't
have to how is it used and where meaning
depending on the license is it
intermingled with proprietary code is it
not is it used for external consumption
out on the webz it strictly used
internally those the questions how is it
supported right and there are multiple
levels of support their self support
which is absolutely perfectly okay there
are places where you can go to get
support like red hat for four major
component tree and full linux
distributions and then there's these
integrator support provider's folks like
open logic or source labs or a spike
source where they'll take some set of
open source components integrate them
into a stack and then support them for
you self support works just fine but you
got to make sure that you've got
somebody in your organization who will
be around and who will be available to
actually support a production
environment in that case so how is it
updated and how is it secured again
typically when I talk to developers they
bring the open they bring the code in
and there isn't any plan to actually
track the vulnerabilities keep things up
to date and for software particularly
that's expose
to the outside that's a real problem how
is the project tracked who's going to
track the project make sure that it's
still following the same technology path
that the company wants to follow make
sure that it's still viable make sure
that there aren't any rifts occurring
that there's still a vibrant community
around it because you have to plan if
some project is being obsoleted from
some other project you have to know at
what point would you move would you stay
would you continue to invest more
resources in that project to keep it
alive those are the decisions that those
responsible for the management of that
software have to be able to answer then
a big one for many companies is how is
it licensed one of the problems with
open-source software is it because there
are so many different open-source
projects licenses are there are many
more licenses than there are with
commercial software a benefit of being
able to go to one vendor and purchase
software is you may really hate the
license that they give you but there's
only one so you only have one to track
and then how mature is the software
again how long has it been around how
good is the documentation how many
contributions does the project get on a
weekly or a monthly basis how often do
they Rev how often do bugs occur so
governance is really been talking about
all of those issues and again from a
developer standpoint usually you know
developers don't care that much about
any of those particular aspects or it's
not their responsibility so but
open-source governance then is really
not about helping the developer to
understand what's necessary to work with
the community to be able to interact
with open source developers and be able
to you know pull information from them
get get fixes and patches and
enhancements back into the project
that's not what we're talking about here
in governance here we're talking about
the rest of the organization
that's responsible for open-source
software that aren't developers because
these are the folks who really don't
understand what open source is about so
these are the engineering managers the
CTOs office CIOs office the procurement
folks and legal we at HP we went out and
we started talking to our customers and
our good early adopters around open
source and we started asking these
questions because these are all things
that HP inside of our governance program
kind of work with and we started asking
them so what do you do in these areas
because we were looking for best
practices right and we were really
shocked to find that this was two years
ago we were really shocked to find that
most of them didn't do anything they
didn't understand the issues and they
didn't really one they hadn't really
thought about what policies and
processes they need to put in place so
that's when we started thinking well it
might be a good idea if we could create
some place where early adopters folks
who are comfortable with using
open-source could continue to further
its understanding to those who haven't
worked with it enough or haven't managed
it enough and then also just to get an
industry consensus what is the best
practice right so that's what fast
Bazaar is about in a nutshell and it
covers these four areas right as i
discussed in the previous slide planning
and strategy so what is your open source
strategy one and why do you want to use
open source the maturity assessment of
the open-source software that you want
to bring in what is your policy and that
comes from you know understanding
licenses and legal compliance
understanding your IP risk understanding
the maturity of the software as it comes
in understanding how you track the
projects knowing exactly what open
source you have in your organization
again we continue to find when we work
with customers that they know they have
some open source out there there but
they're not really sure where how much
and when we help them figure that out
it's always an order of magnitude more
than what they were expecting so how do
you evaluate it how do you certified
again the integration and legal
compliance aspects of the open-source
software as well as management over time
how is it going to be updated who's
going to do that who's going to support
it and how are you going to continue to
understand what's in place so fasta czar
is really built again around talking
about all those issues and they're not
they're not very well understood at all
right now right I mean you've got you've
got cases where code Providence is a
good example right there are companies
like black duck who work on
understanding and helping you understand
where the software in your product came
from if it came from an open-source
origination right so understanding that
whereas software came from so that you
don't incorrectly mix open source
particularly GPL software with
proprietary software is one of the
things they work on it's a really hard
problem to solve and it's a problem that
by and large most folks don't worry
about for commercial software right you
never really care or wonder about where
software came from in any of your
commercial products and a lot of that is
because you get indemnified right so
another thing that doesn't come with
open source software is indemnification
the open source community is not going
to indemnify any user if some some piece
of that software is found to infringe on
a patent and the patent troll is now
trying to sue right so this is a gap
with with open source software versus
commercial software and there are ways
to mitigate that gap and you can go
extremely conservative and you can go
out and buy insurance that is IP
litigation insurance and it's extremely
expensive but if you're really really
risk-averse that might be a direction
you want to go right or you can
understand what the community would do
and how organizations such as grok law
the open invention network and so forth
would help you in defending any kind of
patent action that would occur on on
various pieces of open-source software
so it's all a matter of Education and
once each issue is understood then each
individual consumer of the open-source
software can figure out on what level of
spectrum or where in that spectrum they
fall as far as risk aversion so key
topics inside of phosphors are and what
we focus on is again all targeted
towards managers and folks responsible
for software assets and organizations
that by and large aren't developers so
we care about in the topics that we
cover getting started in open-source
governance governance maturity IP issues
intellectual property issues license
compliance lifecycle management how to
track in your open-source inventory
setting up a policy in a process for
managing open source inside of an
organization tracking those security and
vulnerabilities software acquisition and
supportability so here's a list of some
of the key resources that are currently
on Foss bazaar it's it's a fledgling
effort we started this and launched it
on january twenty fourth this year and
it's really like i said it's its
premises that it needs to be a user
innovation network and one that's
focused on intellectual property and
materials around how to best manage
open-source right so we continue to look
for more folks to help to help
participate again we think that early
adopters such as Google such as HP the
other members of the foundation that we
have and there are many other tech
companies that we know are early
adopters of open-source software they
figured out a lot of these problems
right and so the intent here is to try
to cross the chasm that i described
between early adopter and early majority
by having those early adopters have a
man a method right to actually push the
dialogue push the understanding of how
to manage open-source software to that
early
majority because we don't find that
adoption of open sources ever being held
up by the development staff that's not
the case right it's always the case the
development staff knows there's a widget
out there that they can use does exactly
what they want they want to be able to
put it into their code and not have to
reinvent the wheel but there's all of
this uncertainty when they actually try
to get approval into their organization
so by educating their organization on
what's right what's wrong what's
manageable what's not then that whole
flow that whole adoption process of
open-source can then be increased so
that's the point it's kind of different
it's not like that it's not an open
source project it's targeted at a
different audience but the expectation
is that it will ultimately help the open
source community because it will free
those barriers those inhibitors which
are mostly based around just in under an
area of you know unquantified risk
because the management involved in
having to say yes to any piece of
open-source coming into the organization
isn't they don't have their not
well-informed so this is this is built
to inform them so we ask for your
participation if you got a question
around open-source governance that that
you've always wondered put it out there
let's let's let's have a discussion
about it if you see a topic missing out
on the site then then tell us and add it
and if you find something incorrect
pointed out to show that we can fix it
it's all about a collaborative effort to
build best practices so with that then
I'm going to go on to our next project
which is called Fox ology so HP open
sourced the tools that we built to help
us manage our open source software and
we open source those about December
eighteenth of last year the way HP is
organized and the fact that we shipped
so many products with open source
software one of our first and most
important issues was license compliance
we wanted to make sure that we were
abiding by all of the open-source
licenses in the software we were
shipping excuse me
so we've actually gone through three
generations of the license detector and
it it's it's now rather sophisticated
i'm going to show a i'm going to show a
demo here in just a few minutes but we
realized when we were talking to
customers and to others as well as folks
in the academic community that there's
the cool thing about open source
software well one of the cool things
about open source software is that it is
it is so transparent and so easy to see
right you can track the project you can
track the folks working on it you have
the code so you can try to measure its
its complexity you can identify the
dependencies acrossed everything you can
look and scan for licenses you can look
and scan to see how often different
snippets of code were used throughout it
there's lots of studies that you can do
on the open source software and we found
that we thought that building a tool
that would actually allow anybody to
write their own little agent to study
some aspect of open-source software and
then put it in a database that anybody
else could use would be an interesting
would be an interesting idea so that's
that's that's that's a large goal of
what fala g is another thought was that
in many of organizations that we talk to
you know what they really wanted was
they wanted a procurement office for
open source they went someplace in the
organization like I believe is part of
the open source programs office here at
Google where that organization is
responsible for identifying and tracking
what open source comes into the
organization and keeping tabs on it
right so that it doesn't have to be done
by all the individual developers so this
tool fossil adji is geared towards that
librarian or that procurement office
role as well and with that I'll go ahead
and enroll the role the demo
welcome to a quick look at the new
fossil adji user interface this video is
to show you what we've been working on
and what you can expect to see in the
next release the screen shots were taken
on March seventeenth 2008 running code
from the development directory this
directory has been available in our
surgeon repository for a couple of
months now we're going to move the new
UI code from this directory to the main
UI directory as soon as we do a little
more testing an official release version
0.7 point zero will follow that in the
not-too-distant future please keep in
mind that I'm only showing a snapshot of
current development expect some changes
before the release we didn't redo the
interface just because it felt wrong mr.
Spock the ship feels wrong feels mr.
Scott I know it doesn't make sense
instrumentation reads correct but the
feel is wrong although that sometimes
get enough reason for change and it
isn't just a cosmetic makeover or some
people like to say it isn't just new
lipstick on a pig the entire user
interface was rewritten from scratch to
make it more flexible and with the
plug-in architecture so that new
features could be added easily we still
need to put up documentation on how to
program new plugins but for now if
you're interested in writing your own
plugins just look at the code in the
development user interface directory
there are plenty of examples to follow
okay are you ready to see it show me
this unit
I wish to learn we have a new look
notice the menu bar on the top and a
login link on the right for now we only
have rudimentary authorization we felt
that these authorization levels were
what we needed to get started on a
public repository let's look at the
Browse function notice that the folder
navigation doesn't appear until this is
selected in the old user interface the
folder navigation was always there but
that wasted a lot of space since it
wasn't always meaningful to some of the
functions now let's browse through one
of the rail for source tests over here
on the right in the yellow bar we have
what we like to call a mini menu this is
a context specific menu for the current
window which is browse in this window
you'll also notice view and meta actions
these are specific to the listed files I
guess this isn't the best example since
there's only one file the ISO but we'll
see more later view will view the file
and don't worry it'll be paged and in a
readable format so you don't have to
worry about a gigabyte binary file being
sent to your display meta shows the
metadata we have about the file right
now this is pretty simple since we only
display metadata that was stored in the
file itself several file types like I so
sour p.m. stebbs images have metadata in
the file the volume ID CD format block
size the stuff you'd expect notice that
the path in the yellow banner says that
we're looking at a file called artifact
meta pathology creates files called
artifact up metta when it finds a
container like a G zipper I so that can
contain metadata in its own file header
this data wouldn't be discovered in the
files the archive contains so we created
a file now let's browse through the ISO
notice how the path is being built in
the yellow banner every time we find a
container we start a new line this makes
the path and it's the files origin much
easier to see I've clicked down and tell
them in the HX play 106 directory let's
do an analysis I proposed to run an
analysis through the ship's computers
comparing the present condition of the
enterprise with her ideal condition mr.
Spock we don't have tidy for that yes
wrong analysis let's find all the
licenses in all the files in this
directory and the directories underneath
this one notice that the word licenses
are hyperlinked clicking on these will
show on the left what licenses are
contained in these directories pretty
cool huh the file names and directories
on the right are also hyperlinked they
allow you to continue browsing in the
license browser now I've gone into the
player directory and see all the
licenses in this part of the file tree
again clicking on licenses shows what
licenses are in this directory but what
about the opposite can I click on a
license and see what directory that
licenses in yes indeed okay that's cool
look what does the show link do it shows
you the files with this license in this
case there are four instances of the
pine license and they happen to be in
four files let's look at the new search
capability it's a simple search on file
names and far from what we want search
to ultimately be but it's a start okay
let's find files whose names start with
ssh since this drain just gives pop into
the light clause of the Select sequel
statement I'm entering SSH followed by a
wild-card the percent character
scrolling down we see the results hey
what is this why are these results
invented this is showing identical files
the script sshd to is found under rpms
and s rpms that's not a big surprise for
a script if you want to see the script
just click on
but I'm not going to do that now I'd
like to show you a licensed report since
every name in the path in the yellow bar
is clickable I'm going to click on the
log watch tar.gz so I can browse its
contents notice that I'm in the file
browser I want to see licenses in the
star so I'll click on licenses in the
context specific micro menu you've seen
this before but it's fun to see what
licenses are where and what files and
directories contain what licenses you
may find this functionality more than
just fun if you're vetting specific code
for licenses enough of that I'm going to
click on show so that you can see the
files that contain these GPL references
I see four different files remember if
these were the same file but under
different names or different paths I
would see these grouped like we saw
before let's click on climb AV and look
at its licenses ok there's the file and
the license highlighted in yellow with
all the words and symbols that are
patterned metra found in the reference
license to see the reference license
just click ref like I'm doing now the
reference license is also highlighted
with the words we found in the clan navy
file notice that in clan Navy the pound
symbols weren't in the reference license
and the reference license highlighting
shows that the last paragraph was not
included in clam maybe you may have
noticed that this doesn't look like it
should be called a ninety-four percent
match since the whole last paragraph of
the lice the reference license was not
included in clam maybe one of our astute
contributors also notice this and we've
since fixed our percent calculation
thanks goes to Daniel German at the
University of Victoria for catching that
ok let's wrap this up by showing some
more things and browse I'm going to
click on s rpms to jump to that
directory in this isoh let's pick a
random rpm like imagemagick and click
meta here's another one of those
artifact metafiles and RPM has metadata
and here it is let's look at some of the
other top level menu items this is going
to be fast since these don't need to be
fleshed out a bit
remember show jobs in the old you I now
we have something similar but have added
a new feature called by upload let's say
you uploaded something to the repository
and want to know what the job status is
specifically for that upload this is
something that we do quite a bit
actually I'll click on this Debbie and I
so and we can see that this job
completed without errors clicking on
details and the micro menu shows us much
more information about jobs related to
this I so we uploaded how about the
admin menu this menu is all about
information you might want to know about
running fossil adji we only have two
items in there now but you can expect
quite a few more to come here's the
dashboard to show you this ting dat
abase statistics so there it is a quick
run through of the new user interface we
hope you like it as always we welcome
participation and pathology
co-development bug reports documentation
suggestions we appreciate it all so long
plus ologist see you next time alright
so that was a brief tour of what fasala
g does so just in summary you know what
both Foss bazaar in farsala g you're
trying to do is help build an
understanding around policy process and
tools in managing open source software
inside of enterprises institutions and
governments faas bizarre focuses on
understanding what are the topics to
build a good policy what are the right
ways to instantiate that process that
enforces the policy and fasala g is the
start of a set of tools that will help
enforce or help be help organizations
implement that policy with that I'll
take questions
yes cat in terms of people signing up
and getting involved in the community so
with regard to foss bazaar we've got
about 200 registered users now since we
started we still get about a thousand
hits a day on the site you know there's
all kinds of stuff going on in the news
all the time around open source software
the latest i think is probably the
settlement of the verizon case with the
busybox folks and the sflc you know
prior to that there was the whole
interoperability discussion going on
around Microsoft and what it is they
were doing with regard to open source
software and how that related to their
interoperability statements so there's
always something going on there's always
some kind of current events that are
going on and then we also have again
discussion topics around again what is
the right way to do code Providence
right you can take it to a couple of
different extremes and somewhere in the
middle is probably the right answer and
we continue to drive to get discussion
on those topics so that that best answer
can be found any other questions all
right well with that I thank you for
your attention
you
