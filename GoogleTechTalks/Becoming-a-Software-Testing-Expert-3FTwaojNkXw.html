and one of my jobs is actually to bring
in speakers and it's one of the best
parts of my job
James Bach's work has actually affected
the industry and has affected my work as
a tester for about a decade because I
don't know if James remembers but we
first met at quality week back in 1995
and the first thing we did was argue for
two hours and it was it was a magical
moment for me and it showed me kind of
what it really meant to be a tester and
to be a tester doesn't mean you actually
have to agree with everybody so one of
the things James is currently advocating
for testers because there is so little
that's actually available that's
currently state of the art is how
testers should actually go about making
themselves experts in their field and so
with that James Thank You Harry this is
a very bold and arrogant titled talk
becoming a test software testing expert
because after all who could possibly
give this talk except someone who seems
to consider himself a software testing
expert well I do consider myself a
software testing expert and partly for
reasons that you probably don't know
about yet because you may or may not but
probably not you probably don't go to
all the testing conferences and and talk
and argue with people who write testing
textbooks so you don't know the secrets
of how do you get to be a software
testing expert how do you get to be
considered a software testing expert I'm
going to spill them all for you here I'm
going to tell you how it really goes
down how it works first thing you need
to know is there's absolutely no
authority in the world that says whoo
it's software testing expert is shoot
okay don't worry about that
there's no authority you know when I
published my book lessons learned in
software testing nobody checked to see
if I was a or any of the co-authors
whether we knew what we were doing they
just published it so now I'm a
published author in software testing and
it was remarkably easy and it makes
sense now to me as I look at most
software testing textbooks on the market
and I see that they are in my opinion
completely worthless or almost
completely worthless I go oh now I
understand why anybody can write one of
these things and then they can go to a
conference and say I'm a testing expert
so look I'm a special kind of testing
expert I'm the kind of the kind that
invites you to be skeptical about my
status as a software testing expert be
skeptical now if you google me you'll
find lots of hits associated with my
name in software testing okay but that
doesn't necessarily mean a lot there's a
bunch of other people also get a lot of
hits but but at least Google seems to
think that the Google a magical super
mind system the all-knowing global super
mind it attaches me to software testing
on a regular basis so that's kind of
cool and maybe increasingly as we go
into the future Google will be the
arbiter of these things that's my
prediction everyone will just get
googled that's like you know you're up
for Supreme Court justice well let's
Google you first here let's that'll be
more important than the the ABA
designation of your qualifications I
want to invite you to take a challenge
an expert tester challenge I'm going to
put up a few problems here I'm not going
to give you the answers to these
problems I'm happy to talk with you
offline about the answers these problems
but I want you to know the kinds of
problems that I am expected by my
clients to answer for them lickety-split
I'll top my head okay I've got to sound
smart while doing it I've gotta sound
educated I've got to be aware of what my
my competitors are thinking in these
arenas okay take any of these claims
let's say it's important that testing be
repeatable analyze that now what happens
what happened
is in your mind what happens in your
heart when someone says Annalise it's
important the testing be repeatable do
you have anxiety do you do you wonder
will what kind of analysis I mean it's
so vague what I haven't happens to me is
excitement I have so much to say about
this I can talk about what they say at
the conference I can talk about what
they see in the books I've got lots and
lots of stuff to say about it and I can
write a whole report on any one of these
just analyzing it from different points
of view various kinds of analysis okay I
suggest to you that if you want to be if
you want to have a public reputation or
reputation in any community as a
fabulous tester among other things
knowing how to talk about statements
like these how to look at the pros and
cons how to question the meaning of each
word in the statement and relate that
back to testing methodology and not only
your testing methodology but the testing
methodologies of the world throughout
history that ability to do that and to
smile while you're doing it it's a big
part of what it means to be a testing
expert now
I'm going to share with you what I think
of are the non-obvious secrets of
becoming a testing expert okay not the
obvious ones I mean obviously you should
do testing have experience as a tester
you know that helps read some testing
books once in a while you know it helps
even if they're worthless because they
are worth something even the worthless
testing textbooks have one value and
that is you can say you know what that
author says about testing and that is if
you're a testing expert as opposed to
someone who just does testing really
well you've got to be able to comment on
what the other thinkers are saying about
testing so I mean they're the obvious
things that if you just sit for two
minutes and think what is it how do you
be a testing expert well obviously you
get a degree in software testing and
then you you get your masters and
software testing in your PhD and
software testing which by the way none
those things exist and you read a lot of
research papers and then you have to
write articles and you have to speak at
conferences and you have to do lots of
testing over a period of many years okay
those are all the kind of the obvious
things I'm not going to dwell on those
very much except I want to point out
that some of that is wrong actually it
may take less experience than you think
to become a testing expert it may take
less reading than you think and it may
take different reading than you think
but you do have to struggle with stuff
like this how about this here's a simple
problem you're using a calculator you
press these keys what is the expected
result can you answer this I'm not going
to tell you what the answer is
in fact if you're looking at this in the
Google space of Google video stop the
video try to answer this before you see
my next couple of slides
quick quick stop it no too late how
about this two events overlap what are
the test cases I need to test the risks
that if these two potentially
overlapping events do or do not overlap
that that will be some kind of terrible
thing that happens how do I analyze the
combinatoric of that how do i frame the
problem what do you do when somebody
throws a problem like this at you if
you're a testing expert okay these are
the kinds of things I've got to be able
to do and look smart doing it how about
this these are real common quick what is
boundary testing and how is it done it's
one of the most basic test techniques
boundary testing and yet I was at a
conference recently where we tried to do
a task analysis on boundary testing to
rethink boundary testing and what we
found when we applied task analysis
methodology from education theory to
boundary testing is we found out it's a
lot too boundary testing that none of us
present had ever quite put into words
and I realized that I had an entire day
of material for teaching boundary
testing that I didn't even know I had
until I really thought about this and
analyzed the task of boundary testing
consciously on purpose in most testing
textbooks you see boundary testing
horribly trivialized and oversimplified
I promise you it's a rich and
interesting idea to do boundary testing
I'll just give you one hint how do you
know what a boundary is how do you test
boundaries that are invisible boundary
testing if it were going to be
super-fantastic at it you have to be
able to test invisible boundaries that
no one identifies that nobody knows
about that emerge from the interactions
of complex systems gee how do you do
that fascinating problem and what you
what do you find in textbooks here's
what you find the textbooks step one ask
the developer what the boundaries are
the step two that they don't tell you
about is step two believe whatever
you're told it's implied and what I do
because I'm a professional tester in my
own idiom is that my system just go down
here I know it's back up again all right
you never know what's going to go wrong
I'm a tester I'm ready for anything I'm
like Inspector Clouseau in those Pink
Panther movies I instruct all my
colleagues to attack me randomly
speaking of that I encourage any of you
to ask a question or make a comment at
any time I'll repeat it into the
microphone here or if you're close
enough then you will give you the
microphone okay and you can challenge
anything that I'm saying that's how I
become an excellent tester in my own way
of thinking about it is I associate
myself with the most challenging minds I
make rash statements and then I sit next
to Simon field and he says well you have
to think about it in a number of ways
and I get smarter
Simon fields here today in the audience
he works at Google now I worked with him
at Borland international in 1992 1993
1994 I recognize now that a lot of what
I do as a tester came from arguing with
this guy day in and day out about
epistemology
I don't think I knew what epistemology
was until I met Simon field and so
that's how I honed my mind it's one of
the things that I'm going to recommend
to you two is you find people to
criticize you so I'm going to invite you
to do that now
traditional boundary testing says you
find out what the boundaries are you
hear a rumor about the boundary you
believe it and then you try one before
the boundary one after the boundary what
I do is I asked what the boundaries are
and then I don't believe a single word
I'm told because those programmers have
no idea where the boundaries are a
little about myself I started as a
programmer after I quit high school I
became an arcade game programmer for
spinnaker software based on that
experience I was hired to be a Test
Manager at Apple Computer not having had
any experience as a tester or a manager
I was at Apple Computer for four years
of a few months after I joined there I
became the test methodologist for my
group at Apple Computer that shows how
screwed up our industry is and then I
went to Borland and and got lots of
wonderful experience there with bright
people doing agile development wasn't
called agile development back then but
that's what we were doing small a agile
and now I travel the world training the
minds of testers that's what I like to
do I challenge testers with problems and
I try to get their neurons to respond
and by doing that their neurons get all
muscular that's the idea but I started
as a programmer and that's one of the
reasons why I know that programmers have
no clue what the boundaries are you ask
a programmer what a boundary is and you
get well this is what I think the
boundary might be go away I'm busy and
so as a tester what I have to do is take
these little clues about what the
boundaries might be systematically not
believe them but systematically use them
to try to do boundary testing while
looking for the invisible boundaries
that no one ever anticipated you might
think this is impossible to do and if
this were any place other than Google I
might let you go along and say well
maybe it's impossible for you to do but
the kind of thinking that they encourage
here at Google is exactly the kind of
thinking that I'm trying to promote for
the entire industry the kind of people
who can test for the invisible to test
for what's not there and there are ways
of doing that and I can show them to you
can you explain your test methodology
Khojaly in five minutes or less
I can I can because I practiced doing
this and this is again is something a
testing expert needs to do you know my
first question is where's the whiteboard
show me the whiteboard I'll give you my
test methodology right there you don't
have a whiteboard you got a napkin or
something can I write on this table with
this crayon here I can draw it in the
air if you must if I must but no
diagrams help absolutely I can explain
my test methodology I can explain it in
a way that engages you in a conversation
about it this is what a testing expert
needs to do now I believe for any
testing problem for any claim like the
first set of claims I showed you that a
non expert is more likely to look for
book answers to look for Pat answers to
say yes this is right that is wrong or
if they don't know they'll say I don't
know and they'll stop they'll freeze I
don't know like c-3po you know with
smoke coming out what I'm looking for in
a budding text expert is this kind of
behavior questioning the basis of the
question being aware that what I've just
been told is a projection from a hyper
dimensional space on to a lesser
dimensional space and information has
been lost when it's been turned into an
English sentence and I must find a way
to replace that information to bring
that information out every test problem
in the world is a murky problem remember
that problem with overlapping events one
question that occurs to me when I
address a problem like that is can an
event and/or begin simultaneously with
another event in some context the answer
is yes another context the answer is no
it's digital spaces and screed events
you can never have exact simultaneity
but in other cases yes you can have
exact simultaneity and that changes how
I develop test cases for this among many
many other things so I'm looking for
what are the possible answers what are
what's one way to solve it if you don't
know tell me how you go find out tell me
what kind of analysis that you do that's
what we're called upon to do as experts
because the expert the testing expert
that's the last line of defense there's
no one pass that if you're considered an
expert in your community you're
considered to be the person who can
figure it out here are my credentials
this is my eighth grade diploma
this is my high school transcript
physics by the way is my favorite
subject
I got a 49 in physics never got a 49 in
any other subject before why did I get a
49 because I felt that the physics labs
were an insult not only to my
intelligence but to the meanest
intelligence of the of every person in
that school and I wasn't going to be
part of a system to trivialize physics a
subject I hold so dear so is I stated
that to the physics guy and he gave me a
49 I took a couple math classes in ninth
grade I'd never got a grade for that
because I didn't take the final exam
because I had to go to the University of
Vermont to take a calculus course that
was starting on the same day as the
final exam and my teacher was very upset
that I didn't take his final exams he
surprised me the next year and forced me
to take these exams that I had no idea
that I was supposed to study for so I
eventually did get a grade the next year
this is my this is my credentials I have
I have no certifications other than of
course a level one paraglider
certification a Patti open water diver
certification a driver's license in the
state of Virginia anyway my state of
California certification is laughs as
has my motorcycle license and I've got
my student private private licensed
pilot license but it's it's it's lapsed
I have to go and get that again these
are the only certifications I know of
other than the time that I was detained
by Canadian customs while they scanned
my compute
Peter and certified that I was a free of
hate literature and child pornography
which they granted me that certification
but I have a feeling that that expires
every visit but I do have this March 16
2006 page 371 of the transcript pad comm
versus net motion Wireless a Delaware
Court the Honorable sue Robinson
presiding declared that I was an expert
in software testing and not only that
but they threw in networking and
computer programming too so that's what
I'm holding on to declared to be an
expert in a court of law and what did
the court have to know in order to
declare me an expert my my resume was
more or less read into the record and
they just said whatever and it's
interesting that the other side didn't
object I think that was some sort of
agreement where they weren't gonna
object to me if we didn't object to the
professor from Rice University that they
brought up to try to attack my work but
my side prevailed the jury went with
good old uh Bach here so screw you rice
all right this isn't going out on the
air is it here's what I'm talking about
when I talk about a testing expert
someone is very good at testing someone
who is considered to be an expert in
testing that's the second definition
that's a community designation of expert
the first one is an internal thing are
you actually really good at this stop
becoming a testing expert means becoming
someone who is recognized to be an
excellent tester becoming someone who
really feels like an excellent tester
and who has the self-criticism have that
mean something for all I know you're all
expert testers I don't know maybe you
are the difference I think is I have a
public reputation I want to share with
you how to get your own public
reputation as a tester so that you could
turn that into money because by the way
public reputation equals big
Ochs reputation equals money so I became
a big issue in this court case they
brought out how much money I was making
to do that that thing it was like oh my
god they pay a tester that much it's all
because of reputation so it's kind of
cool to work on this stuff if you really
like testing and you want to be in this
career now here's one idea of perfect
testing okay the infinite process of
comparing the invisible to the ambiguous
so as to avoid the unthinkable happening
to the anonymous is that sound like a
challenge to you it is a major major
challenge I didn't just make these words
up it is an infinite process if you want
to do it perfectly to trust the entire
space and it's easy to make a little
inductive argument which demonstrates
the infinity of testing all you have to
do is imagine any test at all just take
any test and now add at a time delay of
let's say one millisecond at some point
in the test that now is a different test
and you go no it's not a different test
there's no way you can tell me there's
not a different test what you're saying
is your hope it's not a different test
you hope that that one millisecond time
delay doesn't make a difference but just
know what you can prove it doesn't make
a difference
and the history of software is full of
examples where little milliseconds did
make a difference so it's a different
test it's just not one that's different
in a way you happen to care about now I
can make an infinity of those can't I an
infinity of combinations of time delays
at different places inserted into tests
we can easily see that there are many
many many many tests and what we're
trying to do is we're trying to decide
what kinds of tests we can safely ignore
and that is a fascinating problem in
modeling in mathematics in heuristics in
the rhetorics
of software testing we're comparing the
invisible to the ambiguous the invisible
is software software is invisible I use
Google I have no idea which Google
server gave me the
answer that I get and if I try that same
query again am I going to be trying on
the same server probably not I don't
know how it works but I imagine there's
some sort of load balancing algorithm
it's invisible I don't know what's going
on what I see when I'm running software
is I'm seeing an illusion of software
I'm seeing some little little slice of
this vast hyperdimensional thing
projected onto my screen in two
dimensions in in three or four
dimensions depending on whether I'm
doing sound and whether there's changes
over time it's invisible and part of
what I do as a tester is I get little
strobe flashes of what this software
could be little strobe flashes and I try
to draw inferences from that it's
ambiguous I'm comparing this to
something ambiguous because different
people want different things from
software so I can never be quite sure is
this good or is it not good or you could
go look at the requirements but the
requirements themselves are just a some
kind of political date on some kind of
no-man's land where a group of people
come together and decided to stop
arguing at a certain moment and say well
I guess this is good enough each of them
having a different interpretation of it
and here comes the tester the innocent
little tester like a little bunny rabbit
into the into the no-man's land and then
the software does something and they go
oh look it does this and that it doesn't
really match with that could that be an
F and then get blown up by all these
angry people saying no that's wrong or
yes that's right we are in the center of
the maelstrom of all these disagreements
that our clients have as to what the
software really should do but we have to
make it clear what the software actually
does do we're avoiding the unthinkable I
discovered this when I worked at Apple
and no one wanted to talk about risk I
even had one when leader say to me risk
James we don't want to talk about risk
for entrepreneurs we take risks okay but
don't you want to know what risks you're
taking shouldn't we talk about that no I
find that frightening myself but it's
really hard to get people to talk about
what if something goes terribly wrong if
you go to a typical user and say what
are the 10 things that will make you
faint with with a terror if they were to
happen on your computer right now and
they don't want to talk about out of
there
losing all their email records for the
last 10 years or anything like that
that's negative negative to speak the
name of the evil is to invoke it so I
have to test for that stuff with people
don't want to talk about it they don't
want me to tell them about my day as I
tried to save them from the evil and I'm
trying to prevent this evil from
happening to the anonymous because I
don't know who's going to use this
software in the future I don't know
who's out there I have to make guesses
about who's out there this is a
challenge and to me it's a delicious
challenge I love this kind of thing I
love unsolvable philosophical problems
but one of the things I do is I work
from a different definition I look at
that first definition of testing and I
say that's an interesting challenge now
here's how I actually think about
testing doing it from day to day
testing is questioning a product in
order to evaluate it and this focus is
on the cognitive process of software
testing testing is a process done by
human minds highly-skilled human minds
if it's done very well and we need to
know how to question things it's an
open-ended investigational process some
people talk about testing as if it was a
process much like doing inventory in a
grocery store there's three cans of peas
up there let's check and see how many
cans of peas there was supposed to be
why they were supposed to be three tests
passed
that's clerical work that's unskilled
labor and if we think that way about
testing let's not be surprised when our
jobs disappear to whatever the cheapest
conceivable geography there is on the
planet you know today it might be India
or Pakistan or China tomorrow it's going
to be the Yanomami tribesmen of the
trol amazon are going to get all the
testing work you know there's it now a
they've discovered a little community of
people somewhere I think it was in South
America who don't even have numbers yet
they don't actually count those are the
people to get all the testing business
if we keep letting people think the
testing is unskilled simple just check
this against that kind of thing it is
not that fantastic testing where you
find the bugs the uh-oh bugs the
non-obvious bugs the dangerous bugs the
ones that are going to be on CNN if you
don't find them and not cnn.com but the
actual the satellite feed those are the
ones we even got to catch and they're
not easy to catch these things because
everyone else all the non expert testers
are going to look at it they're going to
pronounce it lest now put yourself in
that situation you come in through the
swinging doors like in the saloon and
you look around and you want to have
better perception better perception
about where the bugs might be you want
the smell danger where other people just
smell lilacs okay you want to smell the
danger that's under the lilac smell that
smells like a fragrance and an
artificial fragrance there's something
going on here I'm developing myself into
that kind of person that's the focus of
my whole career I want to help you do
that too this is what we're about now
what's special about testing aside from
that is that no one's going to teach you
how to do it probably probably no one's
going to teach you how to do it there's
a few people like me going around trying
to teach testing skills but they're not
very many and your company generally
doesn't send you to this sort of thing
so you're kind of on your own and it's
very easy to do testing and think you
know what you're doing and you really
don't unless you apply vigorous self
criticism to what you do and you get
involved in it with a community of
people vigorously criticizing itself but
learning testing on your own doesn't
cost so much so at least there's some
kind of hope I've heard that a lot of
you are in the computer science you have
computer science degrees hmm well
testing eight part of computer science
computer science likes to thank the
testing as part of computer science but
if you look at a computer science
journal you look at articles about
testing in there it's it's like somebody
treating cacti as the whole of
vegetative life on the planet by looking
at a desert and seeing a little cactus
sticking up what you generally see in
computer science journals that talk
about testing is ways of optimizing sets
of test inputs using various algorithms
assuming that these laboratory
conditions prevail for all possible
situations further research is needed
and it helps a little bit but it doesn't
even scratch the surface it doesn't even
begin to deal with the actual testing
problem the actual testing problem is a
jungle cross with a marsh crossed with
some kind of weird
Cthulhu HP Lovecraft environment where
you could get swallowed up in any moment
it's like hoff okay it's crazy I go into
a testing problem and I have no idea
what the boundaries of that testing
problem are I have to discover what they
are I've got to set a perimeter
I've got identify my assumptions none of
this has anything to do with computer
science it has very little to do with
algorithms now I think knowing about
computer science can help you be a
fantastic tester and I encourage you to
know about computer science but don't
confuse testing with computer science
testing is actually a social science
deserves to be thought of as a social
science now I'm from a certain community
I identify the community I'm from so
that you don't think I'm speaking for
everybody
lots of people think I'm full of it ok
you should know that make up your own
mind but I'm part of what's called the
context-driven software testing
community we adhere to these principles
among them there can be no such thing as
a best practice best practice is a
marketing term invented by marketing
people or by consultants trying to
impress and overwhelm and intimidate
people who don't know what's going on
but you actually have is no best
practices what you actually have our
practices that are more or less
effective or more or less interesting
depending on the context and what we
need to do is testers we need to read
the context we need to understand the
problem before we talk about solutions
for the problem just like a doctor needs
to maybe examine a patient before
deciding that the patient needs
chemotherapy
so the context driven community we're a
ragtag band we're a bunch of rebels
we're trying to think about testing in
terms of dynamics problems and solution
patterns heuristics we're trying to see
it as a social science and we use the
ideas of social science to further our
education and I want to share with you
some of that but first let me say
something a little generic about experts
I think experts have these things and
experts do those things we have
situational awareness that's a term I
learned while learning to fly an
airplane situational awareness means I
may be focused on this but I know what's
going on around me I give people testing
problems that are designed to help them
fail if they don't have situational
awareness they don't ask questions like
hey what kind of equipment do I have to
solve this problem with they don't ask
that question they never find out
there's a roomful equipment right next
to them they could use to help solve the
problem instead they just assume that oh
I can only solve it with my bare hands
and my naked eye that's all I have to
solve this testing problem for little me
and I try to evaluate when I'm
interviewing testers when I'm training
testers their situational awareness by
looking at the kinds of questions they
ask me to probe the situation around
them what kind of project situation are
we in how much time do we have who's
involved with who's on the test team
what kind of deliverable doesn't have to
be
who's our customer what information do I
have on my desk right now about this
problem what information is available
via the various electronic mechanisms
situational awareness is where you know
how to ask those questions
and most testers I trained have pretty
bad situational awareness work on that
confidence in confusion a lot of us are
frightened of confusion if we're
confused we don't want anyone to know
about it
but you know my older brother my older
brother Robert not my younger brother
the other tester guy who got his Google
video before me okay
the one who stole my thunder with his
talk on exploratory testing hey my older
brothers the airline pilot he knows that
if he's confused about what's on the
airplane dials what do you call those if
you can't think of the name for the
avionics he knows that's important
information you cannot fly an airliner
and be confused about the state that the
airliner is in you know that's important
you don't try to hide it oh no one
notices that I forgot what this lever
does right so an expert has confusion
confidence if I'm confused I'm confident
that that means something important I
can work with that
that's a tool someone who's not an
expert is more likely to think of
confusion as a as a little terrible
demon that they must try to repress you
need a colleague network you need
trained reflexes you need an awareness
of your limitations
there are certain kinds of testing I'm
really good at and other kinds of
testing I haven't developed the skills
to do yet and I don't mind because my
clients don't ask me to do that kind of
testing but as soon as they do I need to
find one of the people my colleague
network who's good that kind of testing
call them up get them to quickly
transfer that skill to me with through
some sort of a neural download and then
I can do that work for my client I need
diverse experiences I need relevant
knowledge I need mental models for
problem-solving what educational
researchers call schemata
problem-solving schemata and I need
schema activation heuristics huh I'm
throwing around the terminology from
education theory doesn't it make me
sound like I know what I'm doing yeah of
course if you're good testers you know
to question that maybe I'm just throwing
around these terms and I don't really
know what they mean and maybe I'll
crumble as soon as you question me about
exactly what is this stuff
okay I'm just giving you fair warning
about that trying to tutor you and how
to deal with someone presenting himself
as an expert who might not be an expert
now I'm not an expert in education
theory but I have a friend who just got
a PhD in education theory and that's
part of what gives me the confidence to
talk about some of this stuff is I've
worked with her to to learn about some
of this stuff developing these mental
models for problem solving that's tough
it takes a while I have a model that I
use I guess I'm going to show it to you
in a few minutes if I had a whiteboard
here I would draw it you know what I'm
going to use virtual whiteboard
technique okay here's what I'm going to
do all right I'm going to write it up
here on this white board here that is
hanging invisibly between us okay this
is a mnemonic that I use for analyzing
any testing situation okay it's part of
my mental model for problem-solving and
testing and it's a mnemonic that helps
me remember this heuristic model okay
I'm just going to read you off the
letters that belong to the mnemonic CID
te STD SFTP OTC ru SSP ICS TMP else at
the SF SC you are a 36 letters that
spell testing to me pick a letter you
see it up there pick a letter
C okay which C the third one okay let's
see
CID tu tu okay that stood for
compatibility good it reminds me to
think of compatibility testing as part
of what I have to do the compatibility
of this system with other systems like
it with platforms and by the way there's
a P there and the SFTP o P stands for
platforms it reminds me to analyze
platform dependencies the first C I
thought you were talking about the first
C at first that stands for customer it
reminds me to enumerate the customers
who am i working with here every one of
these letters expands into a
word or phrase which reminds me of a
dimension of analysis even under
pressure considerable pressure I can
analyze a situation I practice with this
stuff now when I was a younger testing
expert I thought here's what I need to
do I need to come up with this stuff and
then I need to tell you all about it so
you can use the same thing I do but now
that I've done a little more research
into education theory I've realized
something and that is that's not very
effective the more effective approach
would be if you came up with your own
model of software testing it'll be much
easier to remember it it'll be very easy
to change it whenever you feel like it's
let you down in some way just like I do
with mine I certainly can share with you
my model and I do it's right up on my
website but I want to give you
permission right now not to use it
I want to give you permission to cheat
to take it and change it any way you
want to reword it to make up your own
and ignore mine the process of becoming
an expert is not necessarily if the
process of learning to copy every other
expert that's out there but you ought to
be aware of what's out there so that you
can make some choices about it
okay and experts have this experts do
this sort of thing self criticism self
training coherent explanations you've
got to be able to justify your
methodology that's why I have these
models in my mind that I can speak about
like that because if someone says why
should I believe your test methodology
is any good I go let's talk about it let
me lay it out for you here and it starts
looking like that white board over there
like any number of white boards here at
Google just full stop which part of it
would you like to talk about and if I
can expand on that on demand people go
wow this guy knows what he's doing I
have not yet found someone who has the
patience to sit through an entire
description of my test methodology they
all give up they'll tap out they go okay
you know testing you know Jessie please
stop talking to me about this I'm so
bored okay and I find that rhetorically
useful
Steve McQueen towering inferno this is
where I get my mental image of an expert
performing okay this is I found this on
Google last night uh this is what he
says when he comes on his first scene
he's trying to size up the fire
situation entire inferno in the 70 he
says exhaust system sprinklers why
aren't the sprinklers working and then
he turns to the architect Jim give us a
quick refresher on your standpipe system
seek and learn on the fly are these
elevated for program for emergencies
what floor are your plans are okay he's
trying to figure out where he should set
up his forward post he figures it out he
says what he's worried about
he gives the preliminary analysis that
he wants a list of tenants the guy
doesn't understand why he wants he
starts explaining this is why I need it
because of these toxic gases should I go
on and the guy goes now no one
tenantless coming up I loved this I was
it was years it was 1999 before I
realized that in 1978 or something I got
a picture of what it means to be an
expert and I wanted to emulate that
Steve McQueen the fire chief and
towering inferno is the expert I want to
be not in the realm of fires whether
they're almost sizing up a testing
situation and I want to share that
because it's a lot of fun to feel like
you could come in and people are all
confused around you
and you could say okay people I know
what questions to ask I know what to do
calm down I'm an expert I love that idea
okay no expertise is situated socially
psychologically and technically here's
my personal vision of testing expertise
I say to people I can test anything yes
under any conditions in any timeframe
can you do that I can that's my personal
vision and then I go into a little bit
into the fine print okay I can test
anything relative to my standing in the
local community because different
communities define expertise differently
government community is very different
from a video gaming community when it
comes to testing for instance and it
depends how hard I want it and it
depends on my technological insight the
more I know
the technology the better I will be able
to test it all other things being equal
there are some downsides to knowing
technology but pretty much knowing
technology makes you better as a tester
and there's a little bit more I have to
say relative to these things I can test
anything such that and the top one is or
the second one is the one I think is
most important I do as at least as well
as any other expert would do in the same
situation okay if we all if we bond with
another test expert and we're competing
and and that guy knows just as much
about the technology as I do and wants
it just as much as I do and then I'm
saying that achievable vision of test
expertise is I can test it about as well
as he can and these other things I'll
deliver results
I'll collaborate effectively with other
people I'll advise my clients about how
they can help me do better work I will
faithfully and ethically serve I have a
code of ethics I use the I Triple E code
of ethics I also like the ACM code of
ethics and that guides me sometimes and
what I'm doing it helps me justify not
doing certain things that I believe are
unethical and because I'm independent
it's easy for me I just fire my clients
if they want me to do something I think
is not right here's my personal testing
syllabus now the rubbers meet in the
road you want to know what it takes to
be a testing expert this is my vision of
what you have to know to be a great
fabulous testing expert and notice how
different this looks than what you
expected I think you need to know about
general Systems Theory general systems
analysis I think you need to know about
epistemology applied epistemology which
includes things like experiment design
the logic of experiments the ability to
analyze text the people put together
where they describe what they want and
the ability to break that down and to
get hidden meanings out of it
information theory is important too that
should be up there I just realized it's
missing
cognitive science how do people actually
think thank you how do people actually
think not how should they think that's
epistemology but how do they actually
think what kinds of biases afoot people
did you know that there's a phenomenon
called inattentional blindness
inattentional blindness is about how you
are unable to see certain things when
your attention is occupied over here
you're unable to see things that are
happening right there even if they're
pretty outrageous even if something
walks across your field of view and
you're not focusing on it and your
attention is take it up with some
cognitive activity you will not remember
seeing that guy in a gorilla suit going
by
it's called inattentional blindness part
of becoming a testing expert I think is
becoming aware of things like
inattentional blindness because when
you're looking at screens and you're
trying to say is the test passing or
failing you know I was trying to break
into somebody's system the other day the
first time I was ever paid to do
penetration testing was wonderful I love
penetration testing I hope I'm paid to
do it again but I broke into the system
a half hour before I realized had broken
into it I was doing a search and I was
getting I was getting hits that I wasn't
supposed to get and I would just thought
it was the same thing I just said oh
nothing's happening nothing interesting
and I didn't notice that the number of
hits had changed from 67 to 119 because
I wasn't looking closely enough and
focusing on that aspect to see that
though not only had that number changed
but all the results had changed and I
just didn't notice I got oh yeah it came
back with results just like it did last
time and after half I realized oh my god
I can see all the secret stuff cool I
broke in using I used a URL editing to
to break into that particular system in
that particular way and I just thought
that was fascinating that I thought I
was looking at the screen but I really
wasn't I was really looking at certain
aspects of the screen and my brain had
gone numb it had gone to sleep in a
certain way it's inattentional blindness
or something like it but I studied this
kind of thing because it gives me
humility about what I can and cannot see
about what I should expect of myself as
a tester that's what cognitive science
gives me it also gives me ideas about
how to use heuristics which are fallible
methods of solving problems as the basis
of a test methodology my test
methodology
entirely heuristic I do not use
algorithms in my testing except as
heuristics in other words there's no
sure way to test anything you're on your
own there you've got to use heuristics
you got to know how to use heuristics
just the way you have to know how to be
with a dog a dangerous dog you've got a
you got to keep it on a leash you don't
let it run around killing people
cornering people and you don't want to
let your heuristics go crazy to a lot of
process improvement falls apart because
tester or because process people take a
perfectly good heuristic like a little
friendly dog and they let it off its
leash and now everyone has to follow
this rule as if it's a hard and fast
rule instead of a heuristic now it's
attacking people now we work for the
heuristic it's a terrible problem in
process improvement
well anyway cognitive science is part of
how to learning how to deal with
heuristics properly mathematics those
are the areas of mathematics I find
useful to study testing folklore that's
an important part of testing too but I'm
aware that all that stuff in the testing
textbooks most of it is just folklore
unproven stories it's hearsay about how
to test but it helps me with terminology
I also need to learn rhetoric I also
need to know about technology of course
I need to know about software process
dynamics software engineering economics
personally this is the stuff I learn
about notice that on my reading list
there's no testing textbooks these are
books that change the way I think about
testing and not one of them is a testing
textbook you memorize that yet good now
how much do you have to learn about
these things you have to overcome
intimidation that's one thing that's I
want to leave you with here is very
important overcome intimidation for
every one of the subjects I just put up
there was a time when I was intimidated
by it and I've overcome that I know
enough now that someone who knows a lot
about it can't back me into a corner
yeah sure you might know more about it
than I do but I know something about it
too enough not to be bamboozled and
faked out now I want to get to the point
where I overcoming coherence that means
I can tell a coherent story about that
subject matter
and how it relates to testing and many
of those subjects I feel I've reached
that point not all of them maybe half of
them and then I want to overcome
competence overcoming competence means
overcoming the complacency that comes
with being able to do a good enough job
and then starting to take some risks
experimenting innovating in those areas
I feel that intesting as a whole I've
overcome my own competence I pushed past
it and now I'm experimenting and I'm not
afraid to screw up because I know I'm
smart I know I'm good at this stuff so I
can screw up and it doesn't reflect
badly on me as an expert but for any one
of the Constituent subjects I may not
have reached this point I would say for
most of those constituent subjects I'm
here or here but overall when you take
them together and talk about applying
them to testing I feel like I'm at level
3 so that's how I think about it this is
how I develop my expertise there's three
big things that I do study and model
experiment and perform observe and
record they reinforce each other study
model is that's where I'm just thinking
like a philosopher ah what's going on
here what's going on here this is where
something's happening and I'm taking
data down about it during my projects
I'm writing I'm usually one writing more
notes than anyone else about when was
that decision made why did we do this
technique instead of that technique and
then I try experiments and I try out the
skills and I work with other testers
okay this is the test model or alluded
to earlier I have this in my head bang
I've got lots of other models but this
is my main one what about certification
I recommend that you avoid weak
certifications and every certification I
know of so far is just a weak
certification any tests or
certifications you may hear about at
this point in time every one of them is
a scam for consultants to make money off
of your fear that's what it's about your
fear that you won't be able to get a job
as a tester so you got to get the CSTE
or the ice m or the is tqb
and that one of them has a shred of
foundation to it other than a group of
people got together and saw a business
opportunity I've been asked to be a part
of some of these and I've turned them
down I've been asked a bit to be a part
of some of these and I've said yes in 95
I was part of the C sqe process and
that's why I know whereof I speak i
repudiate the certified software quality
engineer certification and I was on the
committee that created it so I know
something about how it happened
I think these weak certifications
cheapen the craft I urge you to ignore
them here's what I think you should do
is my advice to new experts and I think
among all of them building and
protecting your reputation as a tester
is the single most important thing you
can do I can't emphasize it enough
reputation equals money I've made
hundreds of thousands of dollars that I
couldn't have made if Google didn't show
so many hits for my name in a favorable
light
with regard to testing if I didn't have
people like CEM caner certifying me
saying he's a good guy you should go get
his class and so that's really made an
impression on me when I trace where my
my business comes from that reputation
has a lot to do with it and the big
difference between being an experienced
tester and being an expert tester is
your reputation who knows you Michael
hunter from Microsoft he's got a lot of
hits he writes a blog that's the thing
he hasn't written any any books he just
writes a blog but it's a widely read
blog on software testing Jonathan Cole
has a wonderful reputation he also
doesn't have a book yet he doesn't even
have a class but he writes a blog and
he's a good writer he writes this a blog
called collaborative software testing
that's how I got to know him okay so
these days blogging is a big part of
getting your reputation as a tester all
right anyone have any questions nobody
interrupted me I guess I was talking too
fast but I don't have any questions
anyone challenge anything I'm talking
about here I've got a couple minutes
left don't I
does anyone here round yes
which would be the best book to read
about domain testing okay I would say
that there's no really good book on
domain testing but there's a fantastic
paper by chem caner on domain testing
and there also is a seminal paper on
domain testing by Balcer and Ostrom okay
so read the ball sir and Austrian paper
which by the way I can get for you and
also read campaigners paper analyzing
the state of the practice of of domain
testing where he talks about five
different meanings
for the term domain testing and then
talks about his preferred meaning for
that and why he thinks that is a better
way to think about domain testing as I
think those are the two best things if
you really interested in a book then I
would say Paul Jorgensen's book software
testing a craftsmen's approach has a
pretty lucid discussion of domain
testing in it as well and that's that's
what I think
oh you're asking for my email
oh my email is James that satisfies comm
which is on my first slide here and you
know this is my business this is the way
I market so I'm happy to do get emails
and actually what I do is I never charge
for email consulting
I'm just flaky about it but it's free so
lump it okay so I don't charge and I'm
here's what I love to do I love when
people give me testing problems it's
like you you know you think that doctors
would love to get medical problems
people just throw out of medical
problems and ask for free medical advice
but you keep hearing doctors go who I
don't like that
I love getting testing problems bring me
your huddled masses of testing problems
I'm writing a book on testing problems
right now and I'm trying to collect as
many as I can so you want help solving a
testing problem lay it on me
I'll give it a higher priority than they
otherwise would but I'm always happy to
get any emails from anybody you know I
answer them as I as I have the
availability to do that okay anyone else
have any questions
see if managed to intimidate you all
you're afraid of question my expertise
it worked again yes my slides you can
get them from me
I can I can put these up on my my
website but I need you to email me to
remind me to do that
if you send me an email I will say oh
yes
and then I will quickly upload them to
my website and give you a link all right
they'll be on some leak they'll probably
be on a BST e dot PDF off my website
will probably be what Allah what I'll
name it and then and hey it's also on
Google video so there's always that
all right amount of time Harry what's
the deal all right thanks for coming and
listen to me harangue you I enjoyed
myself</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
