to go up a few miles so but I certainly
wanted to you know where the GTECH
speakers because uh as Esteban kind of
pointed out yesterday and rightly so
that I'm very proud to be wearing that
but also probably shouldn't show my what
I'm wearing but this is a Firefox
t-shirt and I'm equally proud to be
wearing that so I think they fit
together and they certainly we're
together I want to thank you for voting
for this talk it's crowdsourcing at its
best right it's been a great learning
experience preparing for this talk I
haven't been at Mozilla that long and
just to discover where Mozilla is what
type of company and it is its history
and and and where the user tester
community actually fits into the
development process oh about the talk
today I'd like to give a little
background and scale of Mozilla
crowdsourcing just where that fits in in
terms of our testing the history of
Mozilla community testing I think it's a
really interesting to goes hand in hand
with the history of missoula itself and
just how do we succeed with community
testing well you've already got some uh
you know background on me on a think
Jeff for the shoutout about agitar that
was certainly a lot of fun I think 1x
agitation has issues that he's still
working out so but I've certainly gotten
over but but I've been then the testing
biz for most of my career certainly at
various test management positions at
these companies some have different
names now but i find myself now as the
QA director at mozilla been there about
nine months I started there January this
year I manage a team of 30 global test
engineers and
truly a global team number of my folks
are spread all over Europe I have a few
in Canada on each coast a couple
contractors working for us in India and
the rest in Mountain View California is
where Mozilla is and this is kind of a
new challenge for me for having such a
remote team it'll normally necessarily
plug software but I live on skype now so
but it's been so far just a great great
experience so i wanted to give you a
little background on mozilla foundation
because it gets act a lot about is it a
non-profit is it profit well i indicated
i work at mozilla corporation as a
corporation is a for-profit company we
do generate revenue but both mozilla
messaging and mozilla corporation are
wholly owned subsidiaries of the Mozilla
Foundation and the mozilla foundation is
a non-profit as you see there that
missoula messaging handles the
thunderbird email climate in terms of
development and of course mozilla
corporation is concentrated on the
desktop firefox you see the codename
fennec but that is desktop on mobile
platforms in addition that we also
manage mozilla labs and mozilla labs is
essentially an incubator of research
projects and technologies one of the
probably the premier one that that we've
been working on so far that's going to
be in firefox 4 is called firefox sync
and it allows sinking in the cloud user
bookmarks and tabs and user preferences
so that each instance the firefox it
automatically synchronizing that data
mozilla really is a global open source
project it sit Rep
jen's a community of thousands of
creators and it's both a public benefit
company as well as a mission or into the
company and as you see here this is our
mission it is to remote openness
innovation and opportunity on the web
and that's really a full stop that's
really what we do and that's what you
know the CEO on down you know it really
drives that message and more
specifically want people to engage and
participate in innovate on the to make
the web essentially better for everyone
we use a like a community-based approach
to engage folks of really any any any
experience level to advance the
technology of zila open source projects
such as Firefox you know for example
just recently there was his dedicated 12
year old his name is Alex many Miller
who actually discovered a critical
buffer overflow in the browser and got
awarded a bug bounty of like three
thousand dollars so it's just like
anybody can join and and and participate
so another aspect I'm still getting my
used to you know the scale of Mozilla
there's just tons of information that
flows fast and furious that you know on
a daily basis hourly basis and and
really about the huge numbers of users
of Firefox it's it is kind of daunting
exhilarating you know to know that
you're actually working on a product
that one in twelve people on the planet
actually use so when you first start at
Mozilla you get this kind of chuckled
grinned and said hey you're going to get
hooked up to the Mozilla fire hose and I
have to say it's very aptly named there
is so many sources of information that
change you know just
like I said on a like at an hourly basis
and it's up to each person to really
judge for themselves what they monitor
on a daily basis or hourly basis and
it's a struggle people that have been
there for years still you know are
constantly challenged by you know this
amount of information that changes
Mozilla scale you see that we have about
400 million users depending on how you
count these days but every day like 10
to 15,000 people and our what we called
nightly testers download the latest
trunk version and do nightly testing our
beta testers they scale up in millions
and we're targeting like two two and a
half million people or beta testers to
work on Firefox 4 and you know from a QA
perspective this is pretty mind-boggling
in terms of the numbers and you really
you know it just gives me pause every
time that there's a big patch that's
landing if a change adversely affected
just say one half of one percent of our
users you're still talking about 2
million unhappy customers that I don't
want to see so a little I wouldn't give
a little story kind of a recent Firefox
prior to meeting there is actually this
heard a while was about two months after
I started and we were working on this
major feature for Firefox 4 called out a
process plugins and essentially is
crepes protection so that any plugin
that gets fired up in the browser runs
in its own process and if it dies it
doesn't take down the whole browser and
that the big decision was is that we
were going to take this big patch and
poured it to the existing three dot six
version of Firefox and I certainly had
paused on this we were doing some
testing on
but I really came you know this is kind
of my mindset before going into this
meeting to really discuss whether it's
ship or not shipped to our beta
customers and as you know that in being
in QA or testing or something like that
you know your audience or your users it
doesn't matter there's what you're
trying to do is no bucks right or at
least you know testing you find the bugs
and get them fixed you know before your
audience does that or you can have that
and I don't want two million of these
people with torches coming after my head
so but on the other hand the product
manager his name is Michael sinner it's
been there about five years and he had
is certainly a different perspective he
was very eager to get this new feature
you know to the beta audience as soon as
possible like within days but I was
being aggressive and I said no no we got
some more testing to do and so just a
little discussion kind of developed in
this meeting in fact we went at it each
other for it was like about an hour i
think we've managed to empty a room with
about 30 people with just in fact it was
a teleconference so I'm you know just
shouting out at these speakers in the
ceiling and not exactly our most
professional moment but we finally were
able to concede each other's point and
that we were both right and wrong it was
a big change from my perspective you
know to understand where our tester
community really you know comes into
play kind of a big point is is that our
in-house QA team I think they do a
fantastic job of finding the functional
bugs and you could call it low hanging
fruit but you know ones that are on
let's say the popular platforms but
there's certainly a diminishing return
of what they can do what they can find
because we just don't have the resources
for a huge compatibility lab you know
with a lot of different
hardware and stuff like that but this is
essentially where our tester community
absolutely comes into play in terms of
the being able to you know like help us
do the surface testing of the
competitive compatibility matrix that
were confronted with so essentially i
went from protector to respecter of the
tester community certainly as a partner
of the QA team helping us really test
new features new patches always
providing feedback on the suitability
usability whether it's buggy or not and
effectively giving us an overall health
assessment of the you know the current
firefox release or that current build so
that was that meeting mike and i work
really do well together these days in
fact our biggest focus right now is
getting firefox for shipped as soon as
possible hopefully very soon so i wanted
to turn it a little bit of attention to
crowdsourcing crowdsourcing has been
around for quite some time it's
certainly you know kind of a no-brainer
involves a crowd working on a kind of a
common goal or task certainly not a new
concept by any means crowdsourcing as we
know it today is filled by Internet
technologies all quite aware of today's
capability in terms of social networks
and newsgroups and stuff like that where
virtual groups form almost instantly
without regard to look location and and
crowdsourcing today has certainly it is
grown into an industry by itself I mean
it's and these are a few examples of
companies or projects that either
utilize some aspect of crowdsourcing or
it's their whole business model some a
company not you know very familiar with
this crowd is you test we share kind of
a common bond with with you test because
they are their secret sauce is
is test community management and so
we're kind of in toxin in exchanging
ideas about how we can better do
community management so it's something
that that we do on another aspect about
crowdsourcing um kind of mozilla labs
has this concept series which are open
calls to the community to participate in
a project to discover in prototype
technologies and whatnot it was somewhat
fortunate timing is is that we actually
have mozilla labs that a particular
project called crowdsource crowdsourcing
and it was goals are you know
effectively to identify the best
practices of what is crowdsourcing and
identify the gaps you know that exist in
let's say what Mozilla does and then
finally trying to create two prototypes
or programs that Mozilla could actually
adopt and better utilize their use of
crowdsourcing some of the key findings
is is that not too surprising there's in
crowdsourcing projects that there is
there's heavy users and casual users
kind of sometimes referred to as the 99
1 rule and if you think of like
Wikipedia you know kind of use as the
kind of epitome of crowdsourcing project
like ninety percent of the people that
are the audience there are the lurkers
they consume the data whereas like nine
percent of the users in that community
ever like the editors they fixed you
know the entries within Wikipedia and
then there's those super users that one
percent that are like the creators and
so that's something those users or
something that you really want to take
care of another point is as as crowd
motivation and that is typically
separated in two basic forms is kind of
intrinsic
motivation and extrinsic and intrinsic
motivation you can think of the kind of
an enjoyment base you know like gaming
communities you know people enjoy games
in and you know are just a or to join
you know within the group and discuss
that or it's kind of a kind of an
obligation community-based approach they
feel I oneness with the you know the
group that they're in extrends
motivation very you know you can you
think of just money money for a
particular job or particular task but
it's also the ability to recognize
achievements and this is actually a big
deal in crowdsourcing these days is that
is the recognition of status is like
badging systems are big in in
crowdsourcing models these days and how
we can universally show or like things
like social credibility or street cred
kind of the last point here is
crowdsourcing relies on people I mean it
you shouldn't view this as human
automation you need to a for success you
need to give the ability of people of
the ability of shine communicate and
collaborate and it's got to be fun
people got to enjoy you know coming back
again again to the project and in
participate so when we talk about
crowdsourcing often community and crowd
get interchanged and I don't think this
is correct I believe that they're
absolutely suited for different tasks
and different problems so you can always
think that as this being somewhat of a
spectrum where crowd based approach is
is better for like single tasks or
parallels test typically I it's a
competitive situation where let's say
little or no competition or form of
collaboration exists people are just out
there to do the tat community-based
approach is I think better for longer to
live project
typically this is where the rise of
expertise is needed you know to complete
the goals and tasks of the project and
sometimes is referred to as expert
sourcing but when we talk about
crowdsourcing and crowd-sourced testing
at Mozilla I think we're really
referring to kind of a unique hybrid
approach we use various forms of like
intrinsic extrinsic motivation to engage
the tester community to work on any
particular release any particular patch
and we also get down to actively
engaging the community sometimes on a
one to one on one basis to help us
perform testing tasks sometimes manual
like exploratory testing regression
testing and bug verification we will
also take advantage of the large number
of tests or community and gather as much
data as we possibly can either through
passive means or through very low
barrier feedback mechanisms and lastly
we really rely on their passion their
huge enthusiasm to make firefox a better
product and all that combined is what I
refer to as crowd-sourced testing
Mozilla style so now we kind of want to
talk a little bit about the history of
the tipton community the history of the
mozilla tester community goes hand in
hand with the history of Mozilla which
is the history Mozilla you know spans
about 12 years I mean it and you could
do a series of talks on you know what
transpired you know during the history
of Mozilla but as these three points
below here or what I would consider
major milestones that affected the
Mozilla tetra community during the
history of the project the first
milestone was essentially the start it
was the release of the source code of
the Netscape Browser as an open source
project and it was ministered by Mozilla
org
and it wasn't intended to be strictly a
source code only release but the fact
that it was a source code only release
it really meant that it was kind of a
members-only Club and the entry to that
Club mostly meant you were you know a
developer hacker something that was
intimately involved in developing the
software but there certainly was lots of
passionate people that wanted to help
wanted to be involved and this person
ASA is corrected for being the first
Mozilla community tester he really
galvanized the early going of the tester
community which was what it was really
quite rough most of the time it was
actually chasing down builds it was
trying to find somebody that could build
on this particular app platform and and
do some testing for that so this is kind
of the rise of the nightly build it was
kind of against the rules you know to do
builds but it became in this at
necessity community members like I said
you know started building the product
with the latest changes and also ACA and
his team really started what our daily
tests daily manual tests to validate the
build and and communicate that out to
the community and so it had some level
of stability that people could rely on
so this was actually a great success
that the community grew into like the
thousands asa was well respected in
right now he's an evangelist it still
you know at Mozilla to grow this
community of testers but it certainly
wasn't without his problems as the
members grew so did the volume of the
feedback you know given to the
development team there was a it was like
too much of a good thing
the feedback started to get quite noisy
it started to not always be accurate you
know duplicate bug started showing up
and this is somewhat a problem with
larger community crowds and the only way
that this was really solved it was
solved in a couple of ways was
effectively was better test her training
of the community so that they could
write well documented bugs they actually
do you know to kind of stem that tide
they had introduced what is called the
unconformity isla and for bugs so that
you know if anybody produced it if they
didn't have the right privileges they
couldn't get submitted to developers and
it took people with the right privileges
that would verify the bugs turn them
into new and send it off to the
developer the other thing was to
introduce what were called test dates
and these are really essentially
training for testers to as well as doing
some some good work and in that focus on
a particular feature and how to write
bugs and to you know just kind of
galvanized a bunch of testers around a
particular task also there was to do bug
triage which was a very big part of what
you know that the tester community had
to deal with these these practices
actually live on today we do this on a
kind of a regular basis you know and in
terms of test days the last I mean the
second change was just it was a huge
change for Mozilla and the tester
community I kind of call it the modern
age of Mozilla this is when mozilla
foundation was formed they almost be
essentially became a start-up and no
longer under the wing of AOL so it kind
of went from Strictly open source
project to two more product focus and it
was kind of the the rise of the Firefox
code base for the tester community this
was a complete reset
no longer did it have the support of the
parent company of AOL and so there was
huge reliance on the testing community
going forward to really monitor you know
the the health and the quality of the
browser as it went forward so the last
point here is and it took awhile is kind
of in 2007 and this was the the rise of
continuous integration and unit tests it
became quite a necessity just because of
the complexity of the browser was
becoming so huge and problems we're
starting to really show up without it
there was automated testing to a certain
extent but it was never coordinated but
a particular developer his name's Robert
say or some people might on but he's
kind of credit of pushing this through
our development somewhat kicking and
screaming but as you well know that this
is a very tough thing to do in a project
and but what happens that we have today
is just mean is it's a the largest
continuous integration system that's
built on Bill bartender bartender box
technologies for every commit 11 full
builds in fact I think it's even more
that because if you take into the the
mobile builds are produced for every
code change there's about 300,000 unit
and performance tests that are get
executed / build and which is you know
kind of yields like 3.3 million
automated tests you know executed for
every committed code change and so this
the result of continuous integration
least on a nightly basis is a version of
the browser which refer to as minefield
minefield somewhat appropriately lame
but it kind of doesn't describe it give
it justice right it's a lot of people
use this as their personal browser it's
that level of stability and
allows our tester community to really
focus on new features new capabilities
and not worry about the stability now I
can't say that it always is completely
stable but it really is a fairly solid
product you know for every code change
that gets developed I kind of want to
change a little bit about community
feedback a lot of the community feedback
and test or feedback is is exist in
bugzilla in fact I think Mozilla has at
least the largest are one of the largest
bugzilla instances in existence
everything runs on bugzilla I mean if
you want a new chair you write a bug if
you want to talk to legal you write a
bug but certainly anything that has to
do with software is every issue feature
change and what not is tracked in
bugzilla and some of these bugs have
well over you know hundreds and hundreds
of comments during its lifetime and
sometimes that lifetime you know can
happen over a weekend I've seen you know
you can actually see comments just go
flying by so a lot of communication
happens on bugzilla another way that it
in terms of feedback an unfortunate fact
of life is that browsers do you crash
Firefox has been known to crash somebody
asked at a recent conference that you
know you know should I report crash data
do you guys even look at it does it go
into a you know some black hole or
something like that indeed we we do in
fact every crash over the last five
years is on our public database and
that's one thing that Mozilla does is
all the data that we collect and analyze
and whatnot is something that anybody
can look at and view so one of the
things that in of the crash data it's
test by this back-end system called
Socorro which is based on brake pad
presents a pretty extensive web app with
lots of graphing capability ability to
drill down to signatures to a fine
assigned bug reports it also gives some
ability for developers to really
identify correlations like different
versions of plugins for instance or
different add-ons or something like that
because a lot of times these crashes are
never reproducible at least you can't
you know get two steps to reproduce and
go off of it so we have to get some
correlation we have to get a lot of data
to to really figure this out and one of
the more important aspects of the crash
system is that it's a early warning
system to us when we you know based on a
particular patch or a particular lease
is we may find one or two crashes in our
testing in terms of the QA you know
internal testing and it doesn't you know
we certainly write a bug but it doesn't
register as you know something that is
going to be a significant problem it's
only until you start picking up the
volume and so we look at this and
monitor this data on an hour to the
daily basis to see if there's any rise
in crashes that are developing and and
if they do you know the alarm bells go
off and we certainly take a look at it
and try to to diagnose it as soon as we
can we also use crash data you know for
let's say release criteria as you see
that our Firefox releases over the last
five years up until three dot five there
were exhibited the same pattern but if
you see in terms of three dot five these
are the bugs that are reported that are
associated with crashes we released too
early it we weren't paying attention to
this graph enough and Mozilla got pretty
about this 3d f5 was was represented as
a pretty low quality and perceived as a
low quality release as something that
we're really paying attention attention
to now in terms of the release of
Firefox for firefox for now has a
feedback mechanism the second point to
this in the beta version of the product
you can conceive ace if you're happy
with what's going on or a sad face and
give some sort of like Twitter like
comment as well if it's a site that's
busted you can put that in and the
mechanism in the back the back end
collector is a kind of a Hadoop I think
HBase of implementation allows for word
and phrase based clustering so that
we've been like of a site or a
particular web app you know starts
coming online you know we can take a
look at that or if it's a particular
theme like tab browsing we see you know
if these are the problems that crop up
it's kind of noisy it's in fact it's
like Twitter I mean we also monitor
Twitter but it really gives us sometimes
a pretty good feel in QA where the
sensitive feature exists so that we do
more testing around that in fact a round
mountain view we have LCD screens of
both the feedback data as well as the
Twitter mentions on Firefox and that's
an interesting thing to look at I mean
in terms of the different comments it's
a pretty raw stuff one of my criteria is
is that I know you can't see it is is
that there's intersperse green and red
there on the Firefox input is one of my
criteria is I want to see that green for
at least a good day and you know it's
kind of a release criteria
how do we engage the the milton
ulladulla tester community well manual
testing it's still a very big part of
what we do it's one of the main
activities and where we directly
interact with our tester community what
you see here is a web app called litmus
is a test case management tool that
we've actually did we've lived with for
like the last five years it served its
purpose it's a little creaky it was
written by an intern over the summer
which you know is kind of a stand you
know that the test of time but this is
something that we're completely
revamping right now and rebuilding to I
think better support kind of the
crowdsourcing model as well as being
able to be a lot more distribute in what
we do so this is what we're doing this
is where we write all our manual testing
I had mentioned test and bug days we're
ramping that process up quite a bit to
you know to make that a much more
enjoyable in a thing for a test release
it as well as educational test date or
like on the day of the event we
advertised in many different forms and
we use IRC quite a bit in terms of our
communication mechanism is everybody
know what IRC is used it but not heard
of IRC because it's kind of old
technology but it's basically allows
it's a chat technology that where you
can join several different channels of
rooms or something like that and this is
where we interact mostly with our tester
community and a test day you know is
usually devoted or focused on key
features that have recently landed we
perform exploratory testing regression
testing and test case development and
like I said we've been making it much
more of a contest we did this recently
and I think improved our participation
bug days as I mentioned a little bit
before are focused on on things like
verifying unconfirmed bugs or verifying
bugs that have been fixed so these are
one of the main test activities that we
do to engage our tester community one of
the things that we're working on right
now is what I refer to as community
focus automated testing Moz mill is a
JavaScript framework that allows GUI
testing of cutco based application and
certainly we're using that for testing
firefox and thunderbird it's somewhat
more suited for community for a number
of reasons one is it doesn't require an
instrumented build and it works with any
version of firefox that you can download
from the ftp site the other aspect of it
is is that it it's very well suited to
be bundled as an extension or an add-on
and that's exactly what we're trying to
do is effectively bundle all of our
tests and the environment and be able to
destroy that to our tester community
around the world we were building a
back-end database which is based on
couch it's db2 gather all that data and
see you know what you know are the
results across the different let's say
platforms that the community runs on so
kind of just an overview of how we
succeed like an indicated continuous
integration is absolutely the foundation
of our current success in community
testing and and also part of that you
know getting that setup is utilizing
that community feedback their ability to
tell us to you know what you know is a
problem for the types of testing that
they do and also engaging with them on a
direct basis it is manual testing but I
think in the future we're also looking
at how they can participate in automated
so that's how I think we can be a really
succeed currently one of the things I
wanted to talk about is community
stewardship I don't think we do a great
job on that we do kind of a I don't know
a I don't know if it's a bad thing or
think but as these leaders in both
development and the tester community
rise up and become well known to us for
the work that they do what do we do we
hire them and so they they essentially
become you know employees and I don't
think that's a great thing in the long
run for the health of the community so
we need to figure out how we can replace
you know these community leaders and and
largely that's through you know
education reaching out to prospective
users or you know members that would
like to join our project one of the
things that we're doing currently within
Mozilla this is Mozilla drumbeats is a
product started this year to really
reach out to our user community to teach
essentially just users about what is
open web and how they can participate in
various web projects there's web made
videos is one of the more famous one the
fact next starred in a couple of weeks
November 3rd to the 5th is drum beats
first festival for learning about the
open web and this is going to take place
in Barcelona sprain what's an interest
to us in QA because we're developing a
curriculum about Mozilla testing that is
going to participate and be incorporated
within drum beats what is called a
peer-to-peer university and the
peer-to-peer university is the series of
online classes that are available to
anybody that teach web development
skills but we want to be able to teach
you know it's perfect for perspective
tester communities about what it is to
do testing
so teaching our community about you know
things that we do is something that is
going to be very central to our plans
for next year so lastly is that we have
a website this website is referred to as
cumo our quality of mozilla org and it's
certainly our main conduit in
communication to our tester community
this is where we effectively reach out
educate there's documentation on there
we just completely rear it rewrote this
site in WordPress and it was also going
to be incorporating buddypress to
support membership login better over
support support of the tester community
and I certainly wanted to ramp or tell
my team you know how can we get our
message out and one of the things I
wanted to kind of play a little bit as
we I told let's create a video let's
create a video about what we do and
stuff like that so I wanted to play a
bit with you it's a little long but i
won't play the whole thing that see if
we can get this going there are some
things you should know about Mozilla
we're an open source project where end
user focus and anyone can participate
how do my mom is Costin woke putting
blush honda manometers i haven't been
able I secure services Rapunzel helping
with firefox there's a bit suppose it
isn't long
I work in mobile QA our primary goal is
to make sure that your favorite free
mobile browser is of the highest quality
konnichiwa Firefox or society so I think
you can get the idea that this is you
know it's a global team that we're out
there trying to reach anybody out there
in on a global basis so I think lastly
what I'd like to talk about is
effectively I call out to you and in the
Tet you know the test professionals this
has been a just a wonderful experience
for me to really get to know some of you
personally you know some of the projects
that are happening I guess I want to
know as a reminder that Firefox is an
open source project and it's available
to anybody and it's got and I think it's
a prime proving ground for any new
innovation and our testing technology so
I think it's a great opportunity for you
know collaboration that we can do you
know experiments together so just to say
that our doors always open to
collaboration so if you have any ideas
that you want to bounce off it and and
see what it can be done or certainly be
able to do that the next chapter for me
is you know how we can improve our
processes in art you know how we can
better make our tester community shine
and so I guess I invite you all to help
us collaborate together and see where we
can use let's say Firefox as a
springboard for new testing tools and
technology so thank you very much
everybody I appreciate it
I guess I'm ready for any questions
hi Matt hi a great thought thank you so
you mentioned that manual testing is a
large part of what your community
testers are focused around right now
given the size of your community can you
tell us a little bit about how you
manage that how do you communicate your
testers that this is something that I
want more feedback on and you know when
the testers come back with bugs that
they report in either litmus or bugzilla
how is it that you continue that
feedback loop with them to maybe ask
them for you ask them for more questions
or clarifications etc is that a big
problem it is it's it's a challenge we
do it in a couple ways like and nightly
testers we have a newsgroup that in a
newsletter that we we don't do it on a
daily basis but we certainly if there's
a new feature a new patch that has just
landed we certainly inform them that it
is now landed here is like our existing
test plan and see what they can do and
just you know and testing it so in that
kind of focus the other is kind of what
I mentioned there is is about the test
days and and that's how we kind of the
kind of can keep that communication get
a line open with our community testers
that you know if they're sometimes
they're they're assigned to a particular
feature and and sometimes they're even
assigned a particular feature so largely
that communication is through bugzilla
but it's it's really you know it's it's
it's a lot of like email or IRC you know
communicating they come to cycle we have
a particular Q a channel where we see
you know these the testers come up
largely we don't know who they are they
be they have all these IRC nicknames and
kind of a fine as funny story is is that
we recently did the summer a summit up
in Whistler Canada and it was great it
was 300 of the employees as well as 300
of the community members but it was just
it was interesting
like oh you're you're that person so
this is you know just kind of the whole
combination of trying to communicate
with them I don't that answer your
question him Ramesh arranged so a few
things I'm sure like you know most of us
here use Firefox it's a great browser at
the same time I think most of us use
Firefox as more of a debugging tool we
use Firebug extensively and break you
know that's one of the great IP I think
we have in terms of like you know the
testing commuity is Firefox trying to
add any anything more to it so that one
it benefits the whole testing community
in terms of like you know doing a better
debugging as well as like no also helps
in terms of debugging the code of
Firefox itself absolutely i mean Firebug
is probably one of our premier developer
tools and something that we support
absolutely both in terms of development
as well as testing so there's there's
quite a whole program around you know
just that particular out on so and we're
very dedicated because we know that you
know Firefox is kind of like the default
browser for doing web development and if
you we did a study recently of what our
beta audience or beta tester audience
it's ninety-five percent male under the
age of 35 so i think and i would say
that ninety-three percent of that are
probably developers you know so that
kind of skews it but i mean it but it
also i think brings into a portent thing
is is that firefox i think is absolutely
here to stay as a development browser
and you know part of what i was talking
about this is where i think we can
innovate you know together in terms of
tools and whatnot hi how do you triage
and prioritize the defects and who are
the people involved and how are they
selected the trio's in terms of the bugs
largely a it's the development although
our QA team members do participate not
in every
project but it's effectively community
selected and in in terms of the that
kind of triage but as far as like the
the management of bugs and stuff like
that it's it it falls on our
responsibility you know to make sure
that the bugs are verified and closed
you know as we go on but to be honest at
the bug database is huge and so the
prioritization becomes a big task you
know do we would do it well i don't know
i mean it's something that we pay
attention to but it is it just a huge
problem and this is where we really rely
on our community you know to help us out
and to give us feedback and how that's
done okay you know I want you to correct
me if I'm wrong is it going through the
bug reports and understanding them a
bigger project than the than the Mozilla
itself because because I ok try to go
through you know many of the bug reports
I see different people have a different
you know what's a bug reporting style
although you have guidelines you know
given to them you know but I see if I
were to be in that position I would find
it extremely difficult in order to go
through okay each one of them understand
so you know if you could actually help
us understand how is it that you're
managing that that would be fantastic
how do we manage making sure that
there's proper documentation essentially
is that it you know we have examples
both you know what is a good report and
if we do see you know something that is
out you know that it is not meeting that
kind of standard we pointed out we
pointed out to the community members
saying and that you know Oh to of
overtly but telling them that you know
this is that the required information
and sometimes developers are less than a
diplomatic and say you know or off and
until you can provide you the right
information so you know that there's
there are standards and what we try to
do but it's largely I think self policed
and and how the right information
it's you know within bug reports it
means do you have any explicit means for
taking the bug reports and analyzing
trends and using that as feedback for
the developers to do something like
process improvement we do have some you
know like that and we didn't in terms of
charts you know that kind of the bug you
know that the fine fixed rate you know
the as well as being able to do that and
that's something that's actively being
developed right now in terms of the
tools and we haven't done a good job I
think in the past but I recognize that
and you know there's such a wealth of
information out there that is just a
shame that we're not using it more
effectively and and targeted but that's
sort of like that you know that is on
our plans in terms of development of
tools any anybody that would have again
good ideas in that that respect uh I'm
all yours Matt I'm interested in stuff
you didn't quite talk about on Mozilla
for where you're doing the send a smile
send a frown min you mentioned that
you're doing some kind of affinity
grouping on the feedback using i do /
something look like that and can you
talk a little bit about how you're
trying to process the feedback that
you're getting and what's your thoughts
on doing that yeah it's it it's kind of
an experiment you know certainly for
this this is the first time that we've
tried that and it has been in a quite
successful we're getting like about
5,000 tweet or inputs a day and largely
I think it's we're like I said and doing
clustering based you know in terms of
phrases we see that and if for instance
like tab browsing that is one of the key
areas that people are having problems
with we also take a look at you know
what people are saying about the you
know just a usability experience and
feeding back
that into our UI team so it's it's kind
of this constant monitoring you know
with the tools that we have in place in
the back end but it's it I i would say
that QA uses it the most at this point
or at least in terms of actionable data
because that's we are we're basing our
test plans around that as well as
prioritizing our test plans but i think
that you know over time we're going to
get a little bit more experience you
know what we can do you know with this
particular data that answer your
question or is that sorta well it's like
I said it's a it is an experiment and
we're going to get better at utilizing
that so okay anyway I really appreciate
thank you very much everybody</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
