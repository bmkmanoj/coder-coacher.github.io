artificial general intelligence and
welcome to google it's really great to
see all of you here i'm your host moshe
looks I work in Google research where I
lead a small team that is tackling some
really hard and interesting problems in
beige in inductive inference why is
google hosting a conference on
artificial general intelligence
basically this is my fault I'm
responsible um so so what does it take
to get authorization for hosting an
event like this to be held on the campus
of a multinational corporation with
nearly 30,000 employees there are PR
angles security angles cost-benefit
analyses it's it's gotta have been
pretty bureaucratic right you know forms
filled out in triplicate that sort of
thing so what actually happened was that
I circulated internally a report on last
year's HGI conference and suggested that
Google hosts this one ah my manager
Peter Norvig approved and Alan Eustace
senior vice president wrote back and he
said this is verbatim I'd be happy to
host the AGI 11 event next year and that
was it so thank you Peter and Alan
so why is Google interested in
artificial general intelligence our
mission is to organize the world's
information and make it universally
accessible and useful so it's pretty
clear that if progress can be made
towards AGI this is hugely relevant to
Google's core mission so Larry Page our
CEO describes the perfect search engine
as something that understands exactly
what you mean and gives you back exactly
what you want this is an AI complete
problem it requires understanding human
goals and psychology as well as all of
the text images and video on the
internet at the human level or beyond
another Larry quote that I love is that
sometimes doing bigger things is easier
than doing smaller things I think this
applies directly to AGI and it is
certainly why I'm here on the margin
more resources should be devoted to
trying to take large steps forward in AI
to address the big questions of how
human-level capabilities of perception
planning judgment under uncertainty and
analogical reasoning can be reproduced
in software and of course far more
resources than the present should be
devoted to formal theories of
intelligence that address issues of
stability under self modification and
attempt to understand what humans
actually value and I am delighted that
Google and the AGI conference series are
helping this work forward so we invite
you to sit back relax and enjoy the show
now over to Peter Norvig who wrote the
book on AI
okay thank you Moshe and welcome
everybody to Google and to the
conference and I'm glad we didn't have
to do anything in triplicate and and
thank you moshe for all the work you did
and making this possible thank you also
to Alison and Ben bear who and all the
others who helped out and while we're
throwing out quotes when an i do one
from Sergei who said and I don't have it
verbatim but but it was something like
we want to build computers that are like
hell in 2001 but hopefully they won't
kill anybody so we're trying to achieve
some level of understanding and in
discussions earlier today people were
reminding me of a talk I gave at the
singularity summit in 2007 where I think
my talk and rod Brooks were
characterized as the wet blankets of the
conference and I didn't really think of
it that way I thought of it more as a
challenge to say what do you have to do
to succeed in this business and so why
don't I repeat that and try to go over
some of the points may there and and
maybe my views have changed a little bit
over the time but these are the
challenges that I see for the field as a
whole so the first one is calibration
and you know I know the point of a
singularity is that it's unpredictable
but we have so many predictions and
there we go in opposite directions
there's going to be utopia is going to
be the end of everything and the time
frames you know so Kurt's whales got it
down to a single decade in the middle of
this century John McCarthy says
somewhere between three and three
hundred years I think he said that more
than three years ago so maybe maybe we
can update it a little bit but why is
there a factor of 30 difference in the
in the variance between these estimates
and if we're going to if anyone's going
to take any of these seriously we need
to calibrate them better another one
Kevin Kelly talks about the problem of
intelligence ISM which is like
racism but it's elevating intelligence
over all other things and and maybe
that's natural for us to do where we're
homo sapien so we put it right up front
there right in our name of saying we
think being wise is important to us and
intelligence is certainly a great thing
to have and it does have this factor of
being self multiplying in a way that
many other facilities or properties
don't have but it's not the only
property in the world and I think you
know if we were talking cheetahs we'd be
talking about building super fast
machines and when we were when are we
going to have the speed explosion and if
we were elephants we'd be talking about
making super strong machines but instead
we fancy ourselves being intelligent we
think that's going to be the answer to
everything and I think it's not always
the answer to everything and you look at
other properties and how they've
advanced over time and how a big change
sometimes results in a small result and
so let's look at the history of
explosions over the course of a hundred
years we went from just inventing TNT to
having devices that are now capable of
producing 20 billion pounds of TNT
equivalent so that's 34 Moore's Law
doublings in a century so one every
three years or so and certainly there
are political effects of having the
h-bomb but the military effects have
been zero so far they've never been used
in warfare and so we have this great
advanced in one area but does it have an
actual effect and so the question is is
intelligence necessarily going to have
this incredible effect that we expect it
to have so that's a challenge to answer
that the next challenge is in
integration that we're looking at so
many different domains we want to do
language understanding we want to do
vision we want to do interacting with
the world is it possible to address them
all at once
we want to be general we want something
that does it all but as a strategy what
are we going to work on as a field as a
whole and individual groups how much do
you want to specialise versus how much
do you want to generalize and that's
true for the sort of topic areas in
terms of these types of integration and
then I think it's also true in terms of
looking at the interactions of if you
have an advance in one area is it going
to help in another area and and what are
the areas well the things I think need
progress on is one is is in learning and
I think a lot of people agree we need to
do a better job they are and we need to
do learning at large scale and nut but
another one that that may seem to
contradict is having deeper semantics
and so when we think about doing better
at learning well you know a lot of the
focus now is you learn a model from a
vector in Real's to the end to another
real number and we're getting really
good at doing that but then
contradictory to that is this idea what
we'd also like to have an understanding
of deep semantics and have a
representation that's richer than a
vector of real numbers we'd like to get
a meaning in not just word counts then
we'd also like to have hierarchical
models and we have people envision that
are trying to build up from pixels to
edges to objects to relations between
objects and and so on and that's
difficult as well we also it seems that
temporal aspects are important so you
can look at an individual image but it's
probably more realistic to look at it at
a video and then this idea of continual
learning of you know right now most of
us run our programs for a little bit see
something that's wrong stop our program
fix it and then get it running again but
what we're all trying to get is
something that continually learns
without us interrupting it so we've got
this learning deep semantics a
hierarchical temporal and the continual
we want to make progress on all of those
how do we do that
and so I'm you know each of those
individually is a tough problem but
figuring out how to do them all at once
actually makes a GI as challenging as it
is so that's all I have to say and now
will hand it over to Ben who's going to
tell us about the workshop</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
