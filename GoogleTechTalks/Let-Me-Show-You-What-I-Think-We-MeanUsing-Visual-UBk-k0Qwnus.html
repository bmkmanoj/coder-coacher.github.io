me to come it's really exciting to be
here it's such a great place I don't are
the people on the other side all set to
okay good did you see the slides her
name is as you know Oh had to know okay
okay there's no way for us yes see ya
good to check with all your participant
say so you know it's really it's really
funny I have a hard time sitting down
because then I can't see the people are
sitting on the floor so if it doesn't
bother you I'd rather you sort of stand
beside you can see your whole life okay
okay good so I wanted to give a little
bit of background as to sort of why this
is what i'm doing i started teaching at
carnegie mellon I was a consultant for
25 years before i started teaching at
carnegie mellon four years ago and in my
first year I invited a couple of people
to come and speak and one of them was
Hugh dubberly and Hugh deborra-lee for
those of you who don't know him he
worked at Apple in at Netscape and has
his own consulting firm now but the one
of the interesting things is that he
talked about how developing models in
his practice in his work and his
experience at Netscape an apple and
every place else was a really nice way
of moving towards getting common ground
among team members and participants then
Rick Robinson also came and spoke for me
and he is a social scientist and he also
talked about the role that
models or these kinds of shared
representations played in their work and
so one of the things that I experienced
in 25 years of practice is some some
challenges around getting people to
really agree about what we think we mean
together as a team so i decided that i
was going to start looking at this and
and specifically in relation to
interaction design service design
projects so i think most of you sort of
know my view and that you have to do
really important immersive people
research like some of the really
wonderful stuff we saw already and then
you you come to models and then that
helps you figure out what or how to
design so most of what I'm going to talk
about today really focuses on that piece
the models piece um let's see oh I see
what happened don't know okay well what
I'm out of sync with my my presenter
view in the other view sorry about that
I'm sorry well I'm just gonna go for it
this way I think um big maybe it's not
moving forward that's the problem there
we go ok so when when I'm doing this
with my students usually we're looking
at data that's generated really quickly
I'm sure that's never the problem for
you guys you have lots of time and lots
of money to spend doing a lot of
research there's always this this
challenge to deal with a lot of
different contexts and it's always the
challenge to integrate the perspectives
from a lot of different kinds of people
so you don't always you know at least in
in my world the ideal for me is that you
have all of the different kinds of
people actually participating in the
immersive research it's not
just the design folks is not just the
anthropologist it's not the technical
people are there as well so that's
really what I'm talking about here when
I'm talking about people research then
the parts to this talk are really this
little bit of background talking about
what what are those things that you're
looking at and and that you want to
represent in your models the ways of
representing the information and then
also the the roles of models in in the
design work boy this is I don't know
what happened here sorry okay so this is
I'm going to talk you through a little
model here from from my friend Hugh and
here's here's me and here she oh and
here's the project okay so the next
thing that sort of happens here is that
you have my model of what the project is
and your model of what the project is
right so here we are the next thing that
happens is i have my model of your model
of the project right and then really
what we're looking at here is my model
of what of the correspondence between
your model of the subject and my
momentum of subject and i think most of
you have probably experienced where you
spend a lot of time working with people
you can spend a whole day working
together collaborating you think that
you are all on the same page that there
is this perfect correspondence between
what i think and what you think and and
we go off and do our work and we come
back a week later and we find that well
actually what you thought I thought
wasn't exactly what we thought it was
and so the problem is if you don't work
we
be hard to establish a shared
representation together then I think you
have this kind of issue of this lack of
correspondence between my view of the
project and your view with the project
okay to being it again this is the
strangest thing okay so done Norman has
this really nice description of this and
things that make us smart the power of
the unaided mind is highly overrated
without these external things it's
really hard for us to to leverage our
thinking beyond the words so it's really
important for us to work on on producing
things outside of us so when I talk
about models you know if this goes out
to the rest of Google and engineers here
this they're going to go models that's
not what a model is I'm really talking
about diagrams here or frameworks that
represent some aspect of the experience
and I'm really specifically here talking
about producing these things as a way of
facilitating communication in in a
design team they help integrate the the
findings from your people research and
they essentially they really do help
make you smart so models are also a
bridge so again this is a really nice
model from Hugh dubberly which is kind
of based off of some stuff from Rick
Robinson Stafford beer Christopher
Alexander but I've also modified it to
but what we have is this really nice
little two by two where you look at this
is the concrete this is actually looking
at stuff in the world okay and then you
move up from that and you produce a
model of what you've seen in the world
so you document your findings and you
produce some sort of representation of
what it is that you've seen and then you
can work on top of that model to produce
a new representation which is a model of
what you think it might be and then when
you move back down again so what you're
starting to do here is shift over into
prototyping and what you move down here
and you get concrete again is that you
produce a pro two
type of what you think it might be so
what you're doing is you're sort of
going around and around here and as you
get more information more feedback from
your prototype you can go back out into
the world and get validation on that so
again nice description in norman and
things that make us smart the things
that you really want to do for your
models just capture the important
features of the represented world so
that first square really make sure that
you understand exactly what's going on
there so what I mean is if you are when
we're looking at services for example at
Carnegie Mellon you're looking at a
journey of a patient for example when
they come into into cancer treatment for
a day so what are you going to do what
is their day like when they come in so
you're going to work really hard to
capture that what they what they try and
do is to you want to develop models in a
way that helps really helps your design
team all of those different disciplines
come to the same place get to
regularities and structures so that you
can make decisions for your design
challenge and then again help you go
back out and get more and more focused
data so the first part that I'm going to
go through here is really the what's
that you're depicting so what I'm saying
is how do you determine sort of when you
go out in the world to do your immersive
research thinking about the kinds of
things that you want to be looking at
now the this is not an exhaustive list
so I want to make sure that that's
really really clear but these are just
some examples of the kinds of things
processes attitudes approaches
relationships and user types and some of
these will be more familiar so what do
we mean by a process like I said the an
example here is going in a cancer
patient for the day
is going in for a treatment what's that
process like what are the kinds of
things that are going on there why do
you want a model processes well i think
you know it's pretty clear that when you
document exactly what's going on from
the service line in your in your
cafeteria to any other sort of process
it's really becomes clear where the
breakdowns are you know you can see
almost always there are post-its where
breakdowns happen or notes or other
kinds of signers so you see where what's
going on there you see what's part of
the process and what's not and that's a
really important piece actually sort of
defining what is is a part of the
process and what's not especially in
design challenges because oftentimes
when you go in and you're looking at a
new thing you said you tend to get so
wide that everything is everything and
it becomes really hard to move forward
you can have discussions around where
interventions can be made could we put a
new set of ropes there in the line at
the cafeteria if we put that
intervention and then what happens and
you can also what's really nice about it
is you can compare the the process of
going through the line of the cafeteria
to the process of a cancer patient going
through treatment for a day how are
those things that like how are they
different what can you learn from each
one of those things that might actually
change your perspective on what's going
on so actually producing a
representation is a really this
representation is really important so
this is an example of a this was an
online service that was supposed to link
consumers with service providers and so
you see that consumers were getting
people like plumbers and cleaning people
or repair people to come into their
house and it started off with what what
you would find this service online you
would register you figure out which
service you want you'd look at the
different service providers you'd select
one and you'd son
request and on the service provider size
of the people who were delivering the
service had this going on where they
were there they would put in their
schedule and then a pending request was
there it would match up between could
the person who was requesting the
service could the actual service
provider that they had selected be there
at that time and be available and then
the acceptance happened and all of this
other stuff happened well the
interesting thing about producing this
representation when we were working on
this project was that they had no
visualization of this so they thought
they could batch process this so they
could do this overnight well of course
there's no service if you have to wait
overnight then you get a notification
but actually no we can't make it and so
it's really important to to visualize it
modeling attitudes these are complex
mental states and I think oftentimes we
we don't think about attitudes enough
what we want to do is map experiences to
the attitude a person has is a
particular moment so that it feels like
it's been designed for them personally I
think again a lot of what we saw earlier
today is that we we make assumptions
about what the attitudes are coming from
our perspective and not understanding
and consciously reflecting on those
attitudes is is a danger so you have to
understand what the attitudes people
have coming to a particular experience
are you know are they are they using
this because they have to you know is it
you know I'm renewing my driver's
license online you know it so it's I
have an attitude about what that should
be like I have an expectation about what
that's like based on the fact that I
used to stand in line with all of these
people what are the kinds of things that
I can account for in that situation and
and either help move people past that
expectation or decide that that's nuts
something that we have to deal with
anymore and then this is an example of
an attitudes math so what in in this
situation we were looking at trying to
change the identity and the internal the
internet for this organization and we
understood what the different qualities
that the organization was reflecting so
what what did the organization think
that they were good at or think were
their values and what were actually
reported as what the values were so the
ones that were inside are things that
everybody felt we're actually values
demonstrated and then also on the
outside where all the ones that were
challenged so we had to in designing the
new identity and the new internet
account for those different values and
make sure that we that we were either
going to choose we were either going to
deal with them or choose not to deal
with them approaches how people approach
at ask how they go about a difficult
problem i think that the difference in
my mind between a process which i talked
about earlier and an approach is that if
you ask people about approaches they can
usually verbalize that so a process is
something you often go through and you
can't you don't even think about it
you're just kind of going through it but
an approach is the way that we do this
so I have never had this problem before
okay so it reveals how they're looking
at it the it's really important that if
you're designing something in a new way
that's going to deviate with the way
that people currently think about it I
currently think about their approach it
you have to account for that in the
design so you want to think about that
and the other thing that I think is
really interesting is oftentimes if you
get people to verbalize about their
approach you'll find that different
people have unique strategies for
dealing with something and that if you
pull that out then you can apply that to
everyone so it's often you'll get these
kind of quirks or these workarounds that
people do and they're actually really
much more powerful than the original way
that it was conceived of so here's an
example of crossing organizational silos
so you're going to do initiatives you're
going to do research you're going to
identify experiences and then in the end
you're going to draft plans to align the
initiatives and crisscross across the
silos so someone in an organization can
verbalize this is the way that we're
going to deal with the fact that we
don't we don't find a way to talk to
each other across silos relationships
it's another thing that you want to be
looking at connections between
representative examples or components
that's typical the I think that what's
important about looking at relationships
is it gives you a handle on the
granularity or the dependencies that you
might have between things and it gives
you insight into how the audience
perceives the elements and once you
cluster them you often get a sense of
where opportunities exist you know that
the best examples i have of these are
actually from the new york times these
are the maps that were produced after
the different conventions at the last
presidential election and looking at the
words that the speakers used in both
conventions gives you a really
interesting sense about about what the
conversation was what was important in
each of those events so it's a nice way
of thinking about
if you're looking at you're observing
people using a particular application
and you do think aloud protocols with
them you get them to verbalize what's
going on and you can do some sort of
word frequency on that and then see what
those different you know maybe there's a
clustering of different kinds of people
different categories of things I also
like that they looked at it this way
according to each one of the different
speakers and then the number of times
the words were spoken the interesting
thing too i think is whenever I I teach
people outside I've card emailing and
working in workshops and things this is
the method that people find they can do
right away because it's it's you know
it's a word count in its frequency some
of the other methods are more
challenging but it's a nice one to start
with and then this one I'm sure you're
all familiar with I really think that
this is just another model our title
users or personas and this is a quote
from Alan Cooper and Ryman and about
phase two after we formalized the
patterns we can systematically construct
patterns of interactions that match the
behaviors models the goals and the other
thing that I think is really important
is that it helps you unfold the
experience whether people are at a
specific life stage you know I'm a I'm a
young person or I'm an old person with
the cardigan the different experience
levels so that you can in your in your
work account for people and design your
applications so that they are absolutely
fabulous for first time use but at the
same time they can be designed so that
they can account for experts so thinking
about that the different motivations and
you need our type of users for scenarios
in your process and this is just an
example of
a persona done by some of my students
okay so now the ways of representing so
here's the kind of the challenge here is
that it would be really nice if I could
say well in this kind of situation use
this way of representing it because
that's always the way for this kind of
information but it's really really hard
to say this way of representing the
information is always going to give you
the best results you really need to play
around with it and the people at IBM
Research who've done many eyes the way
that they describe it here is that it's
finding the right way to view your data
is as much artist science so I think
what's nice about what's going on with
many eyes and also with swivel is that
it's introducing a new form of visual
literacy for folks new ways of looking
at data and here they have different
categories of ways of representing or
visualizing the data and they give some
suggestions about what what they're good
for so that's good Ben Frey who's our
current Nuremberg chair at Carnegie
Mellon who's really fabulous in his
dissertation and computational
information design listed all of these
different ways so I'm not going to my
list is as far shorter I'm just going to
walk through some of these they're more
and more variations and they aren't
always pure as you'll see but here's a
representation of a spider and it's
organized by placing the central theme
or unifying idea in the center in this
case the outwardly radiating
sub ideas pedals surround this sort of
common functionality so this was a a an
online experience for selling art and
fine craft there were five different
roles that were to be supported or five
different kinds of users and the
underlying functionality was the same so
each one of these darker gold ones have
the same underlying functionality but
the way that it was represented to the
user felt different because it was
different for each role but the ones in
the center were common services and the
thing that was interesting about this is
I said it was a site that was selling
art and fine crafts and this model was
produced and constructed collaboratively
and all the team members and actually
the the CEO of the organization as well
and what was interesting about this is
that that person felt that the CEO felt
that this was actually about the the
model reflected what they did in a sort
of artistic way so that she felt really
good about the models and it had
something to do with its role but she
also picked it up and carried it so that
whenever there was a scope creep she
would always refer back to the model and
say so where does that fit in the model
are we adding new things and are you
know is this really so it became a way
of having this kind of common framework
a common language that everybody you
know she was not a technical person at
all she was a business person and it was
a way for her to be able to understand
and also say what's important here's
another spider and I throw this in
because I'm really i think it's great
because it's a spider of spiders this is
done by Nigel Holmes the idea in the
center isn't it identified it's really a
bad attention this is another spider
diagram that was constructed for work
that we did at Carnegie Mellon on the US
Postal Service for their TMM
another way of representing is a process
flow linear I showed that earlier it
helps us look at things over time
behavior over time oops this is one from
my friend Hugh looking at the flow of
information across a mobile device they
actually like produce these very long
and complicated maps of what's going on
this is a representation from against
some student work where we were looking
at any place anywhere anytime level of
interactivity and this particular team
decided that they wanted to focus on
connecting families connecting family
members in a really low sort of cost not
financial cost but low cost lightweight
sort of way so they looked at the
overtime among people and then sort of
how the mapping of the individual versus
shared activities were you can do them
in a circular way as well so here's that
process flow circular I've got through
these kind of quickly I think I'm
running out of time this is the bad part
here you just get the idea event
actually popularized by John VIN um my
favorite one useful usable delightful
this is a nice variation on that that
you did for the gain journal on what do
people desire what will sustain a
business in what can we build
subsequently we have changed this or I
persuaded him that he should change it
so that actually all arrows point to the
center so instead of it happening in a
cycle where you start with people or you
start with business where you start with
technology we're actually doing all
three simultaneously together
two by twos everybody knows those just
one on looking at different research
methods defining a sweet spot for a
product again that sort of
family-centered thing system or network
this is a actually I think a really
useful mnemonic when thinking about
especially sell kinds of communications
that what again I think some of the
stuff we saw earlier was looking at the
relationship between me and me and the
other person but oftentimes what you
were showing was me and us and then this
compete complete collaboration with all
the way out to them and when you're
thinking about designing for I think
those kinds of mobile applications it's
an important framework to keep in mind
and that this is one of my favorite maps
another really nice map from the New
York Times again based on the election
this was as anybody here remember news
maps no this was really great it was a
web one point of application that took a
reading of the news and produced these
landscapes so the relationships between
the the articles are represented and
each one of these dots is a particular
news story and they were all placed it
was really wonderful and then of course
um Martin Wattenberg SMAP at the markets
um so now I'm gonna really quickly I how
much time okay okay all right um so
anyway what the models do in the process
I think is really represented here where
we're thinking about what we have to our
project and we create a territory map
that's our very first kind of model we
do our research
we produce a model of what is we produce
a model of what might be we prototype
and then come back so here's an example
gosh these are like so washed out
mapping of the territory of work this
was an online language application and
actually deciding where self-paced
language learning was where it fell
within all of these different things so
what happens when you do a territory map
again it's this very first thing you do
as a team and we usually do it in the
first week and a half and say what is it
that we're working on and by nature of
what's not there these are all the
things we're not working on so and it
becomes this mnemonic for the group
going forward here's again the one that
the group that was looking at family and
connections so they said that they
wanted to address values they wanted to
look at activities and they wanted to
reinforce loving relationships so then
all of the things that are inside here
are all the things that they need to be
researching and of course it's not
exhaustive because you've only spent you
know the first week and a half on it but
it gives a framing for moving forward
that you can all share this is an
example of documenting research findings
what this team was looking at was the
patient and therapist relationship and
then how back-end systems actually
influenced how that face-to-face
conversation actually would go because
they were really trying to understand if
we redesign the back-end system how's it
going to impact that time that a patient
has with the therapist this one I think
is a really important one because it's
this particular team looked at what
students were doing in creating when
they created a Lego artifact and so the
actual process where what can you make
actually doing it producing the artifact
and then splitting it up is here and
then as you move further out in this you
can actually see product concepts so
this is actually the design implications
or the product concepts that you can
overlay
so it's moving up to that what could be
they understood what was and then moved
out into what could be and then also in
explaining final solutions the online
learning environment was actually
creating a collaborative book of
knowledge and so this was showing how
individual schools would send content up
into the system it would be voted on by
the masses and then it would either get
taken up into the service the online
French service or not so this is being
really interesting to see this works
alright so here's another example of
looking at what to do with all the
images so this team of what we did is we
use a method that I call directed
storytelling where we generated the data
in an hour and a half and it was using
the people in the room and understanding
what they did with their images on their
cell phones and this is a cluster of all
of those things then they came up with
the groupings from the cluster analysis
started doing sketches and then
ultimately produced this this
representation of what was going on with
people in their images that there is
this there are these for overall stages
within that there are the sub stages one
is really highly charged with emotion
individual experiences are different
they discover this kind of this is the
capturing moment and then here's image
purgatory and a lot of those images that
don't go anywhere but some of them
actually sort of move on to other places
so some of them go into email and and
whatever but you get the sense of of
what's going on here
a little time for okay just one more
slide there we go okay so if you if you
think about this it's it's we're never
going to produce the right model but the
important thing is that we do have some
shared representation that we can all
get into so that's it
this is really hard like as you doing
this is really great talk and thank you
and I've been trying to like sort out
ideas I'm is struggling with in my brain
for the last couple weeks in like Ben
come to me I feel like dumb about DNA
was communicated but it was greatly had
all these examples that is still like so
much hard work and trying to figure out
how to organize a set of concepts
especially yeah I don't know yeah it is
it is and it's not easy but I think the
important thing is that you know what I
like to say is that the papers in the
middle of the table and that we're
actually all drawing on the paper and if
you can get the people if you can put
something out there then everybody can
start of work on top of then I think
that you sort of have half the battle or
they can say gosh that's not the way I
saw it at all and then you start to
really get a sense of how are you seeing
it versus how I'm seeing it but if you
don't put it out there if you don't sort
of go beyond the words and put it out
there then you don't have that
opportunity to get that shared view and
I can tell you that it makes a huge
difference in how productive teams can
be a specific question but slides as
well as the possible goes sighs no help
canon XL I don't need to pick on this
slide what I'm curious about is how that
stands and functions as an object in the
design next to mutations outside so
while you while you're on hand for
design 12 is the fly right it's applied
and was the power 1 and looking at that
as a computer scientist and say oh it's
a tree diagram thank you it's a
hierarchy right really you've got
different receivers of those designs and
in particular is I recall you said
something like that
a fine arts supplier or something like
that and so they particularly resonated
with that of one of the classically hard
problems about doing designs you have
difference instances you have to make
them all happy or just some degree of
happiness I'm up in this like mhm so how
do you make that choice when you're
choosing a model or representation
diagram space like this you just feel
good about it or do you have a more
methodical way well actually um I don't
know why it's like not allowing me to
control this line it's very funny but we
went through a lot of different ways of
representing that so I think that's
really the important thing you know we
showed the team the same content you
know all of those these are the
different roles here are the different
applications that we're providing
underneath here's how we're you know
economizing with the implications so
that they feel different for different
people and here's all our core
functionality but we showed that in a
whole variety of different ways and what
we settled on was the one that had the
most residents for the most people of
the team but I will also tell you that
like the one with a therapist and
looking at the back end systems you show
that to people and they go ooh you know
like that's way too complicated so I
think that when you're designing your
models while you're also looking at is
who is ultimately going to be seeing
this in the case of the art and fine
craft place we really wanted buy-in from
the organization so they had to own the
representation they had to feel that
this was their site that was being built
this was their business that was being
built so it was crucial for them to
participate and feel good about it but
there's some models you would never show
and in my world the consulting world the
client because they would be frightened
then this is it you know you you have
three bottles there that's all we're
getting for this amount of money how can
that be so see the other
that we discarded depressed tell you
what let's do the switch over okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
