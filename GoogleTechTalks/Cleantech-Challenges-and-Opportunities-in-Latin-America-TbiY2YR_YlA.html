Mario guajardo I'm a software engineer
here in the networking group at Google
I'm honored to introduce our speaker
today this is part of a speaker series
we are trying to start called
perspectivas where we invite Hispanics
and Latinos that have worked in sciences
and engineering and in the IT industry
and so that they can provide like
mentoring at scale and share a little
bit of their personal story but most
importantly to share what they currently
work on and exciting technologies they
are invested we have a great speaker
today he is the president and CEO of
green momentum which is a start up here
in Silicon Valley that those market
intelligence for the creation and
dissemination of the green industry
throughout Mexico Latin America he's
also founder of an NGO called green
impulse to point o that has a similar
objective which is to promote the
industry and the creation of high-end
green jobs in Latin America and he's
also the chairman of the clean tech
challenge for Latin America which is a
program that he probably will explain
more about that is also aligned to
strengthening and stimulating the
upcoming opportunities and today to talk
about our clean tech and the challenges
and opportunities in Latin America let
us welcome luis aguilar tours
Thank You Miriam and think you're ready
for for being here and I'm honored by
the invitation Mario asked me to before
I start talk a little bit about why I'm
here and why I'm talking to you and why
you should pay attention or not to what
I have to say today just the the very
quick version is I am I'm Mexican i was
born in mexico i studied i had my first
degree in computer engineering in Mexico
and then after that I went to study in
England I did a masters and a PhD in
electronic engineering in in the
university of london i worked in europe
for a few years mostly in the telecom
industry and that's the way i came to
the US i ended up coming here working
for AT&amp;amp;T in the telecom industry too and
it was then when i started just talking
to startup companies technology firms
here in Silicon Valley and and when I
started thinking well I probably should
go to Silicon Valley because these were
where everything happens so I took the
first opportunity I had which was to
work with an Israeli company to my
surprise I Israeli company hire me in
Silicon Valley but then they send me to
Tel Aviv and then they send me to
Singapore and so my dream of coming and
working in Silicon Valley was really
just to come and set up a house here
because then I was all the time in
Israel and Saudi station but then I
started getting involved more in in
market development business development
areas and and then I got more interested
in the type of business and the type of
activities that you could have in
emerging markets specifically the
Southeast Asia Eastern Europe and
eventually Latin America at some point I
started thinking actually and it sailed
through here my wife started telling me
that I should do something important
with my life and you know as anybody
who's been married knows we just do what
the wife says and so I did that and I
moved to to clean tech for me clean tech
was a way of doing my part what i want
to do was to promote clean technology
promote ways of helping the environment
but also a part that was really
important for me and eventually became
one of the most important parts of the
company was to to promote sustainability
and here I'm talking about sustainable
development in the sense that I want to
promote a balance in technology
development the economy and society I
want to make sure that if we are for
real migrating to a green economy from
an oil economy to green economy that we
are gonna do it right and we're going to
benefit also communities and and then
being from Mexico that the company
started focusing on on those communities
that we knew that is Latin America so
eventually we with other partners here
in Silicon Valley we found it Green
momentum and green momentum is a market
intelligence team focus on promoting and
accelerating the development of clean
technology in Latin America so this is
the very long answer to a very quick
question than Mario had and so I'm going
to take it from here and i'm going to
start the presentation please feel free
to ask any questions at any point i
think it's better if we have a
conversation rather than you just
looking at me and looking at the slides
right so i should have shown this a
slight when i was talking because you
know it's part of what i was going to
say but also mario mentioned something
and i want to mention it very quickly
here we also found it something that is
called green impulse in pulls over the
dos puntos arrow to point o basically in
pulls over they what it does it promotes
green jobs it promotes the creation of
high quality green jobs for Latin
America so this goes hand in hand with
the objectives of green momentum Britain
momentum is a for-profit part of the
organization impulse over there is a
non-profit part of the organization and
together we we work on different
projects so the idea of me coming here
today was to talk about opportunities in
the clean tech industry mostly in Latin
America but to do this we need to first
agree on what we're talking about here
first we need to agree on what we mean
by clean tech clean tech which refers to
clean technologies is a term that has
been going
specifically a group called the Clinton
group the Clinton group has been using
this time for a while and it's a term
that investors vc's use to refer to an
industry that has knowledge based
products and services that are focused
on improving performance productivity
and mostly helping the environment by
eliminating a co2 emissions there is
another group consultancy firm called
clinic that has a slightly different
interpretation of what the word is but
at the end of they were all talking
about the same thing we're talking about
products and services that can be used
to eliminate co2 emissions or harness
renewal materials and energy sources the
whole idea is to cut emissions and
reduce waste when we talk about clean
tech and this happens all the time
whenever we are in a conference people
get confused with sustainability
sustainable development cleantech how it
all relate so I think it is also
important to talk about what
sustainability means sustainability
comes from Latin sawston era which means
to endure to persist basically when we
talk about sustainability we talk about
the ability of an ecosystem to survive
given the specific conditions throughout
time then there is a term of sustainable
development sustainable development was
properly defined by the brundtland
commission of the United Nations in 1997
which talks about the development that
meets the needs of the present without
compromising the ability of future
generations basically we're talking
about intergeneration now equity here
equity quality sorry just get confused
with the words and then when we talk
about sustainability and sustainable
development it's what I was trying to
explain at the beginning we're trying to
find a balance between the development
of Technology economic growth and
society we want to make sure that
everything is fair in every sense and if
we manage to get that balance that
equilibrium we find a point in which we
we can grow and we can ensure the future
of the next generate the next
generations so when we talk about
sustainability occurred
to the united nations environment
program in the world wide fund we talk
about improving the quality of human
life while living within the carrying
capacity the current capacity of
biological species in an environment is
the is the population size of the
species that the environment can sustain
indefinitely so when we talk about
carrying capacity we're talking about
how much can our planet support right
how much can we leave and it's very easy
to see these in terms of food in terms
of water environmental conditions and
living space so when we talk about this
always the topic of population increase
comes to mind so when we are talking
about sustainable development
sustainability we are talking about
carrying capacity and then we have to
talk about population increase I I know
that Al Gore was here recently and he
was talking about probably what he's
been talking about lately which is
climate change and also what climate
change has to do with population growth
and what it has to do with the future of
our planet when we talk about the
population increase we we can we we
always focus on developing countries we
always focus on the bird rate that has
increased in in countries like Mexico
and Latin America China and India most
of the increase has indeed come from
from this part of the world has
apparently the current when I don't know
the numbers by heart it has raised from
5.6 billion to 7.5 well it will raise to
seven point nine billion by 2050 so this
this presents a very important risk for
all of us for the entire planet if we
continue to grow the way we're doing the
population continues to increase
particularly in developing countries
like Latin America Southeast Asia
Eastern Europe we are going to find
ourselves in an ecological deficit and
when we find ourselves in an ecological
deficit that is the carrying capacity
cannot support the current growth of the
population and
the needs of the population then we need
to start finding on sustainable ways of
compensating and when we do these we
start looking at world trade which is
probably the most common way of trying
to meet these on sustainable extra
resources but also we start relying on
things like fossil fuels which normally
we talk about it as coming from the past
because when we say coming from the
future we're also talking about
exploiting resources that are not the
are gonna disappears if we continue
exploiting them the way we are so and in
this in this sense we need to understand
what they the carrying capacity of the
world is today what it has to do with
the population growth and what it has to
do with what we have to do from now on
so when I was when I started talking
about this i was i was talking about
clean tech and the relationship it has
with sustainability with carrying
capacity and with population growth the
the relation ship is directly related to
consumption and directly related to the
way we are going to consume the
environmental resources in our planet
this has led according to many experts
and scientists has led to what is called
climate change and everybody's familiar
at least with the term but basically
what it means is that the current
conditions of the environment given the
amount of co2 equivalent gases that are
in the atmosphere have caused an
increase in temperature in our planet
according to scientists if the
temperature were to rise more than two
centigrade within the next several years
will have a catastrophic scenario for
the world so here is where things get
really interesting right so far for the
in the past 50 years temperature has
increased point six degrees and we're
expecting that within the next 40 years
temperature could increase two degrees
to centigrade which means we're gonna
die if that happens so what we need to
do is we need to prevent that from her
we need to make sure that we do what we
can to reduce the emissions of
greenhouse gases that are the ones that
will cause this increase in temperature
so the way we do this is by promoting
the the carbonization of the environment
and the world and the way we do this is
by exploiting renewable energy sources
and by doing that in order to do that we
need to develop what are called clean
technologies so this was a very long way
of going around but this is the
relationship this is why clean tech is
important it's not just a business
opportunity it has to do with our own
survival and survival of the planet so
now that we're talking about this still
everybody has heard about the Kyoto
Protocol the kyoto protocol that was
initially conceived in 99 to the earth
summit but really signing cure in 1997
was not ratified by the United States
and China and other countries but a
total of 189 countries up until two
thousand November 2005 signed to the
Kyoto Protocol the Kyoto Protocol
basically what it says is we are going
to commit all together to reduce
emissions by five point two percent the
entire world is going to get together
and try to reduce emissions by that
amount but that doesn't mean that
everybody's gonna reduce emissions in
the same amount it just means that the
ones that pollute more are going to have
to reduce emissions more than the ones
that pollute less and only 37
industrialized nations are committed to
do this the rest of the world is doing
it in a voluntary basis so the product
your protocol is bound to expire it's
going to expire in in 2012 so what we're
trying to do right now is get together
the whole world is trying to get
together and come up with a replacement
with a replacement for the Kyoto
Protocol and this is expected what's
expected to happen in Copenhagen at the
end of the year actually starting Monday
next week right now things are not
looking great things are actually
looking terrible
we find ourselves in a situation where
developing countries are facing off
developed countries and trying to agree
on very specific things such as who is
responsible for what's happened and and
this is a very interesting argument
because right now China is saying that
they are responsible for the most
emissions in the world however they are
still a developing country their economy
is still growing and nobody limited the
growth of the US when the economy was
growing by limiting emissions so right
now the debate is whether countries like
China need to be subject to a binding
agreement with the rest of the world and
also at the same time we have the
developing countries we have the poorest
countries in the world who are demanding
financial aid and countries like the US
are supposed to give them money and this
is calculating about 100 billion dollars
a year so right now Europe the US and
all developed nations are trying to
agree with developing nations as to how
much money they have to give them for
this and when we talk about this one of
the points that people are in
disagreement right now is how much do we
have to reduce in terms of emissions we
are talking about preventing an increase
in temperature in the next 40 years so
we need to do this by reducing co2
emissions so how much do we have to
reduce and right now the US for example
is suggesting that using 2005 as a
baseline they are gonna reduce in
seventeen percent the emissions by 2020
and countries like China are suggesting
a reduction of forty to forty-five
percent by 2050 also but none of these
has been signed in any document nobody
has agreed yet on this but one of the
things that that normally happens is
when I tell you that we're gonna reduce
50 million tons of co2 it means little
to most people because most people have
no idea what that means so very quickly
what is it when we say 1 million tons of
co2 equivalent we're talking about more
than hundred and seventy thousand
passenger vehicles were
in about twenty-four percent of the
annual emissions released by
coal-burning power plants so so in for
you to have an idea we have country are
actually the numbers are coming in a
little bit so when we talk about
emissions we can tell based on the
industrialization of each country which
are the largest polluters in the world
and by looking at this map you can tell
that the US and China are one and two
and then comes India and Russia very
close if we look at the numbers
specifically I don't know if you can if
you consider numbers from there but we
can see that China the US and Europe as
a block are are the largest polluters in
the world except for China and the US
Europe and some of the top 10 polluters
in the world ratified the Kyoto Protocol
what that means is that as a group they
decided in 1997 that they were going to
reduce their emissions that they were
going to try to reduce emissions and
then different mechanisms were
implemented and they're called
collectively the Clean Development
mechanisms which are were created for
those countries that pollute the most
those are our top 10 here except as I
say fortune and the China and the US
these mechanisms were created so they
could if not lower their missions pay
for somebody else to lower their
emissions and in that way balance of
somehow the amount of emissions that
they have in 2001 which is when enough
quorum was gathered to ratify the Kyoto
Protocol start a very interesting thing
in the world people start investing in
technology in order to clean the world
they people start investing in what we
call clean technologies and this and
this was a question that I got in a
conference very recently which is what
is it the
a direct relation that we can find in in
this policy at the UN level at the
federal government level with the
development of clean technology of the
development of a whole industry and here
normally I answer with a very clear
example and we are in California and
this is the best example that you can
have California the governor arnold
schwarzenegger basically passed in 2006
they assembly will 32a be 30 tube
basically means to put it simple that
Californian is to pollute less that
every industry in California needs to
reduce their emissions that utility
companies need to provide energy from
renewable sources up to twenty percent
and recently this year with the
executive order 12 the governor
increased these two thirty percent
basically asking all utility companies
to produce energy from renewable energy
sources and this wasn't an option this
was low and because of this law
companies started scrambling trying to
meet these requirements and what happens
were in California while in Silicon
Valley were in the place where all
intrapreneurs are thinking all the time
what to do next so they found an
opportunity policy influenced investment
investment brought new innovation and
technology and a new industry was
created based on AV 30 to a whole new
industry in Silicon Valley was created
and since last year when the little
financial crisis started the only place
that had a negative unemployment in
cleantech was Silicon Valley basically
when we're talking about California we
can translate this into a whole country
right California is arguably the fifth
economy of the world so basically what
happened in California could happen at
the country level in the US and China
and many other places and this happened
when
as I was saying after 2001 when
countries started trying to find ways of
Clinton environment of developing
renewal energy things started to move in
in the investment community so if we
look at how much money was invested in
clean technology according to the united
nations environment program and new
energy finance about 155 billion dollars
were invested in 2008 these include
assets financing did include direct
investment from venture capital firms
and this includes financing for new
energy sources in developing and
developed countries the the amount of
investment was divided a basically for
key technologies and then all the rest
to put it somehow so is this too small
can you read or should I read it for you
I guess it's it's okay well last year
Solar got the bigger the biggest piece
of the pie with 5.5 billion dollars most
of the investment went to Europe and the
US and about thirty percent of that
investment in solar came to specifically
Silicon Valley biofuel and wind also got
investment from VC firms and then
efficiency and infrastructure for
electric vehicles and battery 2009 I
presented a very interesting change
because up until this point
biotechnology was number one industry in
terms of investment on the in the third
quarter of 2009 it was clean tech for
the very first time that took the first
the top spot biotech was second to clean
tech in terms of investment this granted
will happen because of the stimulus
package Obama there were a lot of money
to to promote in the smart grid and to
mode renewal energy sources so that's
why a lot of the investment came this
way but this has created some momentum
and it is expected to continue maybe
biotech and cleantech are going to
continue playing but for the for the top
spot but basically clean tech has gained
enough momentum to stay and continue
increasing in terms of investment in
terms of asset financing we can see that
win took the first spot win technology
and wind farms in the US and in Europe
started growing in in Europe we have the
largest number of wind farms and here in
the US we have and actually this is a
very interesting thing because I think
Germany is the number one country in
terms of installed capacity for wind
farms but the u.s. is the number one in
terms of production so the efficiency of
the wind farms in the u.s. is much
greater in other places also offshore
wind farms which were only available in
europe now they are being developed here
in the US they are talking about a
product in the the Great Lakes are
talking about a project in Maine and
other countries like Australia and also
in the southern hemisphere other
countries are developing offshore wind
farms so in terms of where the money
went and this is a information here is
it's very interesting to put somehow at
the world environment day in June the
undersecretary for the United Nations
also the director of the UN Environment
Program a container was presenting this
report what they were saying that 155
billion dollars were invested in clean
technologies worldwide and he said that
approximately twenty-five percent of
that went to developing countries this
was not necessarily right if you look at
the at the report developing countries
took about fifteen percent of the
investment at the end but from the
amount of money that went to developing
countries have feet went to China and
the other half when almost entirely too
Latin America so the the translation of
the numbers are appear in this report is
is very interested in the way it's
worded it's kind of confusing if you
ever look at this report but at the end
of the day what was discussed the world
environment day was that a lot of the
money is coming finally to emerging
countries it is people believe that the
development the developed nations are
reaching a point of saturation in some
sectors such as solar and beginning to
reach saturation in in other areas such
as wind and developing countries are
benefiting from this so we were talking
about carbon emissions by region and by
country and if we look at this also from
electricity consumption we can see that
there is a direct correlation the the
top 15 countries would be the same we're
talking about countries with the highest
population also are the countries that
require the most energy and required to
produce the most energy this is also
related to population density if we look
at american market with if we look at
developing countries such as china we
look at latin america we can see that
these are the poster child for
population density the largest cities in
the world are in developing countries
and this is directly related to energy
consumption energy production and co2
emissions so if we look at the world in
terms of population we we can start
trying to identify where the
opportunities will come at the end of
the day if we manage to relate
population growth population density
energy consumption co2 emissions we are
also trying to find opportunities to
invest in clean technologies so we can
see from here that china india the US
brazil and mexico are some of the top
countries in terms of population but a
very interesting way of looking at this
is what's going to happen in the future
in nineteen I think it is 1946 only one
point six percent of the world's
population was living in urban areas now
it is forty-seven percent so in the last
50 years most of the world has moved
into the big cities and this has
happened mostly in developing countries
right now if we this is a log
logarithmic graph so it's not entirely
evident but you can tell that Africa and
Latin America are increasing in terms of
population and they are projected to
increase at a higher rate than most
regions in the world so if we put one
and one together we can start looking at
this as an opportunity we can start
looking at this as an opportunity for an
industry that is being developed to
clean the environment to mitigate the
effects that co2 emissions are having an
environment so going specifically to
Latin America Latin America has 569
million people in 20 countries we are
not counting ten' dependencies or
whatever they're called different
departments the largest cities in Latin
America are really in the top countries
they are in Mexico they are in Brazil
they're in Argentina Chile Venezuela
Colombia and Peru these are the
countries that constantly are investing
right now in clean technologies they are
the countries that are trying to promote
the use of renewal energy and a way of
mitigating co2 emissions so this is
probably difficult to see but we're
talking about co2 emissions per capita
and if you could see the numbers on the
screen you would see that Mexico Brazil
and Argentina have the highest number of
co2 emissions per capita which the
reason is next to the population is
because it's confidential that those
three countries also have the highest
population density so let's start
talking about Mexico Mexico has this is
debatable more than 110 million people
living there they say about twenty
percent of them live in the capital city
it has a gdp of 1.5 trillion dollars
this is a very interesting figure
because I don't know if you have
followed the news but China said that
they're gonna invest in clean
technologies between now and 2020 one
trillion dollars basically two-thirds of
Mexico's GDP is going to go to clean
technology it might need that were to
happen in Latin America were to invest
that amount of money in developing clean
technologies the Mexico is responsible
for one point six percent of the world's
emissions but right now that now that
we're going to Copenhagen president
calderón from Mexico he is very active
in promoting the negotiation between
developing countries and developed
countries he's promoting something
called the green fund this green fund is
a phone that is to be created to help
developing countries to finance the
fight against climate change in order to
do this and to show that Mexico is for
real he has pledged and he was widely
criticized in the country for doing this
without asking first that they're going
to reduce emissions by fifty percent
that is they're going to bring it down
from 425 from 1990 levels to 212 million
tons of co2 this is as you can see
equivalent to removing 37 million
passenger vehicles from the streets in
Mexico a country that has 50 million
cars wants to reduce between now and
2050 emissions which are equivalent to
removing sixty percent of the cars are
the street right now this is an
impossible situation if we were to do it
just by removing vehicles or shutting
down factories so basically the
president is promoting a a number of
projects a number of different programs
to promote the development of clean
technologies and right now so far Mexico
is a country that is bringing the
largest number of projects to Copenhagen
next week they're going to start
negotiating and one of the main points
of the negotiation is the green fund
that Mexico is proposing Mexico is also
committing to to use approximately point
five point five six percent of the gdp
to fight climate change and this does
not include direct investment and
public-private partnerships to develop
clean technology projects so it is
estimated that between now and 2020
Mexico's gonna invest close to one point
five percent of the gdp in climate
change and when we there is a study that
shows that if we were not to do anything
right now it's the cost of not doing
anything right now could be much higher
by 2020 and much more even in 2050 so
right now if a country uses one point
five percent of the gdp is going to be
less than half of what we would need to
use in 2020 to fight climate change so
that's the reason Mexico is proposing to
use that amount Mexico has also John he
was they were the first Latin American
country to join the arena which is the
renewal energy agency and this was done
basically because Mexico is also
committing to develop clean technologies
to commit to develop renewable energy
sources and and here these are very
interesting thing because Mexico is a
country that leaves from oil basically
Pemex is the largest company in Mexico
the second one is the monopoly the fair
electricity commission and these to rely
on fossil fuels to bring money to Mexico
and even then the country's promoting
the use of renewable energy they are
getting help they're getting help from
the World Bank they're getting help from
USTDA US aid and there is a lot of
investment going to Mexico to develop
clean technologies so right now the
government and I apologize this this is
ladies is in Spanish but basically what
the government is saying right now is
right now we have three point three
percent of the energy being produced
from convention and renewal energy and
they are expecting that in the next five
years they're going to bring it to seven
point six percent
they are going to develop new wind
energy projects biomass projects for
energy generation and they're going to
start promoting the use of solar power
at the residential level at this point
so when we're talking about
opportunities in Mexico in the clean
tech industry we can always talk about
the very large wind farms Mexico has one
of the best regions in terms of wind
conditions for wind farms it is in
Oaxaca in a place called a is mother to
want a peck and it is where most of the
wind farm projects are being developed
in Mexico also in Baja California there
is another place called Omarosa and most
of the European companies are coming to
that part to develop wind farms but this
has created a big industry and industry
for wind turbines for blades for
transporting these and installing them
and it's creating new jobs also talking
about what the government is doing the
government is promoting the use of solar
power Walmart is one of the first
retailers who is installing solar panels
of the roof of folder stores walmart has
about 110 stores in Mexico and they're
saying that at least seventy-five
percent of them are going to have solar
panels so basically this is creating a
huge opportunity for distributors of
solar solar panels for people who are
installing and when I was talking about
this at the beginning I said that there
is a nonprofit organization that is in
charge of promoting the creation of high
quality green jobs in Mexico we are
trying to retrain the workforce in
Mexico from building televisions at the
border with the u.s. to start building
solar panels to learn how to install
solar panels so this is a business
opportunity for companies that are in
this area but also is an opportunity for
a workforce or an for Mexico to promote
economic growth another aspect that is
it's growing in Mexico is the use of
hybrid vehicles and right now the Mexico
City the largest city in Mexico is
promoting the use of electric vehicles
and this is a very interesting
development once again because we're
talking about a country that lives on
oil we're talking about a country that
wants to live on all for as long as
possible however they have the
vision to promote the use of electric
vehicles this is its long way before it
happens but it's the first step in the
right direction so right now there are
many Chinese companies trying to enter
Mexico there are many opportunities in
terms of electric vehicles and not only
electric vehicles but batteries and
infrastructure for electric vehicles so
this is just a number of projects of
wind projects that are being developed
in Mexico it's a total of twenty-seven I
believe and most of them are being
developed by independent producers in I
think the translation would be like self
supply type of agreement because in
Mexico and we're talking about
challenges and opportunities one of the
challenges in Mexico is to get over
ourselves to be honest and basically
deal with the electricity monopoly which
is the affair electricity commission so
right now it's illegal to sell
electricity in Mexico view are not the
safe a but there are ways of generating
and selling the electricity if you
define for example a safe supply project
which is what companies like say makes
the largest main company in Mexico and
the third largest in the world they
created they build a wind farm and they
are feeling a energy to other plants
from this wind farm in Oaxacan so in
terms of solar power Mexico is in in one
of the best areas in terms of solar
radiation specifically the desert in the
north it's a perfect place for solar
farms solar farms are still difficult
large-scale solar projects in Mexico are
not there yet because of lack of a
regulation at this point but residential
solar is a new market that is opening so
right now solar is limited just to
residential and industrial installations
but it is expected to change and
companies like son
a son you I know how you pronounce it in
English it's has open a 50 megawatt
plant in Mexico and they are committed
with the Mexican government to not only
produce solar panels for the US but also
to Mexico and Latin America star in 2011
so right now Mexico is part of the top
15 countries in terms of solar
development mostly thermal solar is not
so much photovoltaic right now we're
talking about concentrator and water
heater industry but this is a very large
industry and the government finally is
given incentives you have a new
construction you can install solar
heaters and then you get incentives in
terms of taxes and it's basically
creating a brand new opportunity so we
continue talking about countries and I'm
going to try to go faster here because I
know we're running out of time we need
to talk about Brazil Brazil is the
largest economy in in Latin America it
has a population 192 million and one
point nine trillion in terms of GDP
Brazil recently pledged reduction of
forty percent by 2020 yousa used in 1990
as as the baseline and as you can see
this equivalent of removing 14 million
passenger vehicles so right now the only
two countries that have pledged in Latin
America are Mexican Brazil but they are
basically committed to reduce emissions
and in an important way and setting the
example for the rest of Latin America
Brazil is a country also that lives on
oil this is a country that has Petrobras
one of the largest oil companies in the
world and they just recently found
themselves in a nice predicament because
they found a lot of oil this is a
country that has been promoting biofuel
for the for the past 15 20 years and
suddenly they find incredible amounts of
oil so what's going to happen right now
the president Lula da Silva is basically
saying that they're going to continue
promoting the biofuel industry they're
going to continue promoting investment
biofuel Brazil is a number
to produce a number one exporter of
biofuel in the world and they are doing
the same thing right now with via diesel
they are trying to promote biodiesel in
the country and by doing that they are
also promoting new opportunities for the
sugar mills and they're promoting
opportunities for them to enter into
cogeneration contracts for producing
electricity based in the bagasse of of
the sugar cane so right now in terms of
Brazil and an ethanol production Brazil
is as I said the number two in the world
number one exporter but they're very
interesting data here is the amount of
renewal energy that is coming from the
ethanol industry from cogeneration
plants and this is growing II and as you
saw before about fifty percent of the
cars are using ethanol in Brazil
ninety-seven percent of the cars in
Brazil are equipped to handle ethanol
and also in in terms of cogeneration
about half of the generation of
electricity in some areas in Brazil is
coming from the sugar mills so this is
presenting great opportunities and great
opportunities for car manufacturers also
the distribution of biofuel the
distribution of ethanol and distribution
of biodiesel has become a great industry
in Brazil but this is not the only
industry growing in Brazil that that has
opportunities also in terms of wind
generation Brazil is the number one in
Latin America in terms of wind power
generation followed by Mexico and Chile
right now according to the Latin
American Wind Energy Association Brazil
has potential for close to what
according to them close to 10 gigawatts
by 2020 so this is a very large amount
enough to enough to generate one-third
of Brazil's energy needs so if we
continue talking about opportunities I
mean we see that Mexico has opportunity
in terms of biofuel wind solar power
Brazil is mostly biofuel but also wind
and in Chile Chile is a very interesting
country a country that is not in the top
20 polluters in the world but it's a
country that's trying to do something
right now they stumble upon a gold mine
they're basically stumble a point upon
the grey gold mine which is lithium
right now electric vehicles and laptops
and ipods and everybody is using lithium
ion batteries lithium can be found in
the u.s. in China Australia Chile and
Bolivia but chile and bolivia have the
largest resource of lithium and the very
interesting thing is that nobody and I
mean nobody is exploiting it right now
they basically don't have the money to
exploit it right now you have Korean
companies Chinese companies trying to
enter into bolivia and chile and try to
exploit lithium so this has created a
new industry battery makers are moving
to this region of the world and they are
entering into contracts with the
government to develop this new industry
so lithium is it's a gold mine that
basically became recently a priority for
both the chilean and the Bolivian
government but also chilis doing a lot
Chile has a project right now we in the
Atacama Desert the Atacama Desert is is
have you heard of the sub-sahara solar
project they're doing the same thing in
the Atacama Desert they're trying to
develop the largest solar farm in Latin
America and they're trying they're going
to use the energy produced by disorder
from to bring water to the major cities
so they are trying to fix two problems
at the same time and it is very
interesting for except rate that is
going to cost a lot of money and right
now Chili's getting help from the
inter-american Development Bank from US
aid in order to develop this project and
most recently this week the wind farm
cannella to began operations in Chile
which also was a milestone for them the
second
wind farm and this chili is one of the
largest copper producers in the world
and each one of the mining companies is
developing or building wind power plants
for their own needs and this has created
also big industry right now in terms of
in terms of industry the wind industry
in Chile is the one that is growing as a
fast at the fastest rate in the whole of
Latin America okay so as I was I think I
skip this one right now as I was saying
in terms of what believe is trying to do
with the lithium they estimate that they
need about eight hundred million dollars
to exploit the resource and this is a
very interesting thing because they
basically don't have the money and right
now they don't have anybody to give them
the money so they're hoping to get help
from the US specifically which is a
funny thing when you think about the
type of government they have to exploit
the resource so the other countries are
our Argentina Colombia and Peru and
Argentina is just a star in art
Argentine is just waking up and trying
to get into the clean tech industry to
they in when Osiris right now they have
some incentive programs which are really
small which are not really enough to
start a brand new industry but it is
expected to change after Copenhagen it
is expected that Argentina will pledge
emissions reductions and for the same
reason they will start developing a
brand new industry same thing we can say
about Peru and Colombia both of them are
developing in the case of Columbia a new
ethanol industry the government is
providing incentives to the sugar mills
in order to start producing ethanol and
start generating electricity with a
bogus with the leftovers of the sugar
cane and at the same time Peru is doing
the same thing with biomass Peru is
going to the forest scaring
forest residues to start producing
energy at the same time and they are
also trying to develop the first wind
farm in the country so right now these
are the countries that are investing the
most and they are trying to create a
brand new industry if we look at Latin
America as a whole we can see that there
are specific opportunities in biofuel
solar wind biomass and electric vehicles
in each one of the countries Mexico and
Brazil are probably the most promising
in terms of in terms of these sectors
and they grow in these sectors but also
Chile Bolivia Peru and Colombia present
important opportunities so right now it
is expected that Latin America as a
whole in terms of cleantech could be a
five percent of the total global market
which is estimated around 1.7 trillion
by 2018 and 20 trillion by 2030 so right
now the opportunities are really go hand
in hand with what countries have to do
to meet an emissions reduction target so
right now Latin America presents an
important opportunity for investors many
private funds are opening multilateral
funds are also starting to work with the
government's there to promote a brand
new industry in in cleantech I think
with this I finish the presentation I
don't know if you have any questions or
would you like to talk about anything in
particular
hey I have a question about transmission
so you mentioned the large-scale solar
project in the Atacama among others that
are really remote locations and I'm
wondering how they're addressing the
issues of transmission I couldn't hear
the left I'm wondering how they're
addressing issues of transmission
getting that part of where needs to be
from the middle of nowhere yes uh in in
every case we're talking about Latin
America there is an infrastructure
problem when we're talking about
transmission lines normally European
companies in Mexico for exam for example
they have developed that part of the
transmission line that needs to be built
in order to connect the wind farms or
solar farms and the same thing is
happening in the Atacama Desert they
have to be a brand new transmission
lines and interconnection sites
everywhere and a big bulk of the cost of
the entire project goes to the
construction of the infrastructure
around the solar farm precisely what is
being done about those big dumpsters
that are outside the big cities where a
lot of the poorest population make a
living by getting recycled items yeah
that is a business opportunity that I
didn't mention that I probably should
have there are a lot of biogas projects
when we're talking about land feels like
the ones outside Mexico City for example
there are a couple of German companies
that have come to Mexico they're trying
to make deals with a with the most
important city governments in Mexico to
create a biogas plant so they are trying
to address that problem at the same time
they address the problem of this
generation and it is the same thing for
when Osiris as far as I know Bogota
Mexico City and Santiago I noticed that
nuclear was a very small slice and some
of the displays you had is there any
consideration being given to expanding
nuclear and particularly next generation
nuclear plants that are less polluting
and less risky in Latin America or in
general either one do you want to order
well in the quick one is in Latin
America there is no
consideration and there is a nuclear
energy is not the most popular
affordable way of producing energy in
Latin America there are nuclear plants
but I don't think there's going to be
new developments in that sense and in
terms of worldwide there's these eternal
debate among people who work in clean
technology whether no clear is something
that we can consider clean in any way
most people and I include myself there
do not consider it because of the waste
that it produces so I know that there
are developments I don't know enough to
talk about them and I know that here in
the US part of the climate legislation
wants to talk about the development of
the nuclear industry in the US but
that's as far as I know anybody else
well thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
