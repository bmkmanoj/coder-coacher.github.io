the shape of things to come alright so
pleasure to be here today and talk to
you a little bit about directions that I
think my rapid manufacturing and
additive manufacturing is heading we
heard a lot about what is being done
today all these fantastic opportunities
that are opening but often the questions
that we tend to think about is how can
we reproduce conventional manufacturing
how can we reproduce conventional parts
using this technology at what point does
it break even with conventional
manufacturing but really that's not the
right frame of mind the frame of mind
that you should think about is how can
we do new things what kind of new
opportunities are opened by this
technology and this is really what I'd
like to talk about today and I'll show
you a couple of examples of what I think
our new direction so I'm at Cornell
University and we work at what we call
the creative machines lab lab that makes
machines that create and machines that
are creative and we'll talk a little bit
about how that plays out so here are the
conclusions just as in case we don't get
there in time but the the key idea is
that we were beginning to go in in a
really at the beginning of a story and
what you've seen up until now is the
first episode of what i think are three
episodes we have unprecedented control
over the shape and form of objects right
now we complexity is free you can make
complex shapes at a press of the button
that changes engineering in a way that
few inventions ever have but that's only
the first episode the second episode
which we're beginning to see now is that
we can combine materials and control the
internal composition of structures in
unprecedented ways we can mix and match
materials inside and graded in complex
ways not unlike biology that has opened
a new paradigm of engineering that we've
just were just beginning to explore
sense
that I'm thinking about how can you
control the manufacturing process to
make the material your uniform think
about how can you control the
manufacturing process to take advantage
of the control the precise control and
the non-uniform it get every single
location so you can optimize materials
in ways that you can do any using any
manufacturing method the final process
the final episode which will unfold in
the future is going beyond just just
structures and material and passive
materials to actually working with
active materials being able to print
electronic circuits being able to print
transistors conductive semiconductor
materials printing all these things
combined to really go from passive parts
to active integrated systems so that you
can eventually literally download your
ipod and have it working all right so
this is what we're going and I want you
it happens to me all the time I'm
thinking where was I back in when
Microsoft had ten employees what was i
doing right when Google had 10 employees
what was I doing when Facebook had 10
employees what was I doing don't think
about 20 years from now what were you
doing when this technology took off it's
taking off now and it's going to change
every field and no field is gonna be
untouched think about how it can affect
your field so with that in mind a little
bit of about my own story I got into
this whole area from the air from
direction of Robotics we were working on
evolutionary robotics start to evolve
robots to breed robots using
evolutionary techniques genetic
algorithms and so forth and we try to
breed robots that can crawl across the
table using parts that combine and
recombine in random ways and are
selected for their ability to move we
did that in a gaming simulator back in
the late 90s we had to write our own
gaming simulator we have to do all the
dynamics and we got these interesting
machines that came out of this process
but I had to you know I was trying to
get a faculty position out of my PhD and
I was thinking what can I do to give
this an edge go beyond just making this
in the virtual world into the physical
world and that's when I was exposed to
this fantastic technology of 3d printing
and we took a 3d printer back at the
time in 99 and we printed those robots
completely and have them crawl around
the floor so the the printers allowed us
to go from the virtual world into the
physical world and demonstrate how this
they said this is basically this process
of automation can be used physically
that was enough to get me a faculty
position and it appears in the front
page of New York Times you can't do that
anymore with robotics but at that time
back in two thousand that was below the
fold though didn't get quite to the top
but the question is you know how can we
take that step forward so I was already
beginning to I realized I'm not going to
get tenure by making plastic robots okay
I'm going to make something let's live
the more serious so when you look at
this this is a close-up of one these
printed robot everything about it is
evolved and printed but it's only the
structure that's printed only the
plastic part only the white part the
wires the batteries everything else we
have to manually put in according to the
evolved blueprints so our goal became
how can we make a new kind of printer
that will allow well that will print the
entire robot we really want the robot to
walk out of the printer batteries
included all right how can we do that if
we can do that we can really change
engineering and combine that with design
automation and all bets are off so this
is really what we want and since then
we'll be doing a lot of printing of
robots in fact I I dare say that there's
probably no robotics lab on the planet
that doesn't use 3d printers because
there's no better way to make things
this is a recently a flapping hovering
three gram a flapping ornithopter it
flaps its wings and hovers like a
mosquito it's eighty percent printed we
did that in the lab there's no way we
can do this with any conventional
manufacturing methods this really
changes everything so what kind of
technologies and we've seen we've heard
quite a few of them what kind of
technologies will allow us to print
combined integrated systems it's
definitely going to be the kind of
technologies that bring the material
deposited like a
Tina stream or inkjet that allow us to
work with multiple materials at the same
time and so we set out to print to make
a printer that can work with multiple
materials active materials in order to
make some of these things and cut a long
story short we started off by printing
things simple things like strain gauges
with this with the wiring embedded
printing batteries this example of a
printed battery that the chemistry of a
battery is easy to come across what's
difficult is to making printing all the
materials in a way that allow them to be
mutually compatible so for example
battery has five materials easy to print
except one of them one of the structures
of batteries is a separation layer which
is typically made out of paper now
ironically we can print everything but
we can't print the paper so we have to
find a new way to print a separation
layer without without paper and so that
was a challenge we found out that we can
pray the battery it's about fifty
percent of the capacity of a commercial
battery but it can be printed in any
shape and that means you can do
engineering differently you can embed
batteries inside the structure and
interesting ways what about motors we
have to give up on this idea of
electromagnetic motors and maybe think
about activation a different way this is
a electronica polymer made of five
layers you print them you're connected
to voltage it and it flexes so this
changes how we're going to think about
robotics and this is just an example of
how this technology changes things we're
still on our way to try to print a robot
that will walk out of the printer the
student that did this convince me to let
them try to make a robot that will swim
out of the printer it's a little bit
easier and we're still trying to do that
so whenever I talk about this people say
okay they get excited the beginning and
then they say okay what's the what's the
killer app what's the big thing that's
going to change okay you have all these
small things so that's a really
difficult question to ask with that with
such a generic technology is it printing
parts that we like we've seen a lot
maybe that's the killer app may be
springing toys a lot of people are
actually printing these kind of
figurines and pictures of their friends
somebody told me is the easiest way to
make
reigns now is is this way maybe it's
going to be fashion you'll be amazed to
see how many people are doing fashion
people who don't care about
manufacturing engineering or anything I
care about fashion suddenly I've drawn
to this this is titanium this is of
course no other way you can make
something like this people design it
make it and sell it there's bikinis that
are now print I didn't want to put the
slides here to show that but there are
lots of them that they sell for four
hundred dollars apiece they're a bit too
coarse for my my taste but but but
there's a lot of these options printing
cuneiforms we did that we scanned
uniforms we print them they have the
shape the field the color the weight the
texture of a real cuneiform they're
almost indistinguishable fantastic for
historians for archaeologists oh look at
these things maybe that's the killer app
I don't think so somebody talked about
custom procedures prosthetic devices
definitely a big area we've talked a lot
about already about medical devices and
I took out a lot of slides because those
excellent presentation but definitely in
this area training if you want to Train
surgeons on pathologies and you can't
find the cadaver with the right
pathology you want to train your
surgeons to train on models hearing aids
we've heard about that surgical planning
we heard a lot about that we almost do
this routinely now at Cornell with that
with with the with them with a med
school and especially we do this
sometimes we print these models before
they go into surgery and they train on
these models before they actually do the
before they go into surgery especially
in vet school we routinely get these
emergency calls the dog has been run
over here's the file we print it and
they can cut down the surgery by half I
think the regulation of that school is a
lot less thankfully than it is in with
humans and so they can experiment like
this a lot we heard a lot about implants
but one thing I wanted to add is
printing with directly with live cells
this is a bio printing there's a kind of
grow
this is some things we've recently done
printing with cells directly with in
this case either cells which we harvest
from from the meniscus of a knee
cartilage in the in the knee we take
those cells we culture them we put them
in a hydrogel and we extrude them in the
shape from a cat scan and this thing you
incubate that it's a meniscus ready to
be implanted and it's basically a
original part it's not a part from
plastic that's going to wear out or from
titanium it's an original part your own
cells and it's ready to be implanted
this is the easiest meniscus cartilage
is the amorphous tissue so it's
challenging more challenging to do that
with bone the bone is next liver and so
forth so this is printing the soft
tissue and there's really no reason to
print this outside and implant it one of
the interesting things and we've done a
little bit with this is to print it
inside in situ so not printing outside
we're printing in inside so these are
examples of ways you can really take
this this technology and change the way
things are done it's not about
replicating the way traditional implants
are made but better but actually
creating new procedures maybe the killer
app is going to be models making
teaching models and so forth we have a
lot of these teaching models from 1880
at Cornell we have them all online but
unlike any other Museum you don't just
look at these models you can also
download and make yourself a copy of
these mechanical instruments and people
are downloading them to teach mechanical
engineering and other places so that's a
new kind of museum that you can't work
with but still doesn't sound like the
killer app and so turns out that in the
computer industry back in the 70s the
big companies IBM and honey Mel will
also struggling with the question what
is the killer app of computing and there
are a lot of similarities that people
notice between 3d printing and computers
right they're expensive slow and big
back in the 70s and today they're all
small fast and cheap so what what is
change we're following the same trends
and you know
we think about what we try to think
about what happened back in the mid-70s
that the whole thing took off and so
what's the killer app the Honeywell in
IBM try to figure out what's the killer
app of computing and they came out with
this machine makes you cringe when you
see what they wrote their they thought
it's going to be the computer it's going
to the computer is going to be in the of
the kitchen but that's what it's going
to be so this was a big flop but but it
turned out the actual killer app came
from the market itself and when what
happened when the morning the prices
went down when the first computer kits
came out people started building their
own computer kits of the Altair 8800
came rather than 75 and people started
making lots of them there were lots of
them out so people came up with their
new ideas and the salt world software
there was reason to write software
because their computers there were
reason to make computers because they
were software the whole thing took off
in the killer app was gaming gaming was
the killer app all the hackers built
that up and IBM and Honeywell could not
anticipate that that's the thing so
what's the gaming app going to be for 3d
printers this is the Altair 8800 cost
about four hundred dollars then about
two thousand dollars today so we don't
know what it is but we know one thing
for sure we got to make these printers
cheap in hackable and let them loose and
see what people do with them so we made
the fab at home this is 5 at home model
1 we since then this is the model to
this model 3 it's completely open source
hardware and software people build these
all over the world there are others that
came along different varieties you hear
about them the news now all the time
branches said there's more of these
being built in Seoul than all the other
commercial ones they come as kids they
assemble them like a Kia you put any
material you want in them from cheese to
silicone and print and people are making
all kinds of things with these printers
all over the world and doing all kinds
of experiments if you want to try this
technology with the old materials with
your own ideas you don't have to settle
for the commercial expensive
machines will you avoid the warranty if
you'd make any change you can go with
these hackable systems and do whatever
you want here's the reprap which spun
off MakerBot use you might have heard of
if you haven't you're going to hear
about it just acquired for 10 million
dollars these things are going while
that just came back from Maker Faire
this weekend in New York City these
things were littering the sidewalks okay
these replicators so we can print from
anything from cheese to titanium alright
so there's no material you can't print
with you can print in combinations of
materials and really the sky's the limit
full materials ceramics and so forth and
people are making everything from Lego
to ipod covers two robots to bicycle
gears and anything you want so what's
the killer app so we let this thing
loose and a couple of interesting things
happen now it's all over the places just
want to show you two examples of things
that I at least did not anticipate the
people will do with these things the
first one is cooking okay people like
printing with chocolate peanut butter
frosting cake and the cake pan cha brie
and pesto you name it so putting all
these materials and this is opening up
to be this new area called digital
cooking where you have this cat softer
you say what you want how you cookie the
graded crispiness of it and all that and
you hit the print button and it makes it
for your printing people are making all
kinds of things this is the French
Culinary School printing scallops and
celery and frying them with one of my
students and this is fried dough
printing in some crazy shape and just a
month ago cab drivers taught me in New
York scene II asked me are you the guy
that's printing fried dough and you know
I hate that to be my legacy but
but if that's if that's what it takes to
bring people to manufacturing will do
that so we harness America's love for
fried dough to bring them into
engineering I think that's going to be
the key all right here's a cookie looks
like a regular cookie you cut it into
this text inside okay new way to send
passwords there's lots of different ways
lots of new applications and I think
it's interesting the second connected
area which we haven't mentioned is
education so it turns out that kids who
couldn't care less about science
technology engineering when you talk
about printing cookies they're suddenly
interested when you talk about printing
play-doh they're interested and we have
this fab at school project which print
puts these printers in elementary
schools and we're looking at how to
change a curriculum to allow kids to
engage in manufacturing on the spot I I
showed this printer to my son second
year second grade and kids was suddenly
we printed shuttles out of play-doh and
suddenly they were calculated one kid
was calculating how many shadows he can
print with one block of play-doh another
one was calculating how much profit you
can make doesn't matter what the
inclination is it all comes to play we
did a summer camp last summer I wasn't I
didn't want to do a summer camp I was
roped into it I say okay I'm going to do
this thing what can I do that's easy and
we had 40 kids and said we're going to
teach them 3d printing and we showed
them in one week these are reluctant
kids who were sent by their parents and
they don't really want to spend a week
at Cornell in the middle of summer but
they were there so we said okay dream up
your crazy project we're going to show
you how to make it and print it on a
spot and sell it online all right and
they lit up and you had kids suddenly
making an ipod holder for a bicycle and
selling it online in one week suddenly
kids were asking questions like what if
somebody steals my design and and prints
the copy and I've never heard a teenager
as IP questions from that direction
right so suddenly suddenly there you got
them engaged in these things this is a
pencil holder quick interesting pencil
holder the one of these kids designed
and made and is selling online in bronze
and there's lots of these if you look at
Shapeways which was mentioned there are
a hundred and fifty thousand different
objects people are selling online from
two dollars to 200 made out of all kinds
of materials it's a new cut it's an
industrial revolution of the scale that
you haven't can't even imagine so how do
we design for these things so this is
everything we showed you here is about
manufacturer how did we actually design
things and I like Brent's calling it
factory two point oh I love that name
and I stole it I'm going to talk about
katu point no we need a new kind of
computer-aided design that allow people
to to design things so it reminds me of
Tierra grey hot conundrum and they're
not in a way that you might expect so
Star Trek Star Trek has the replicator
that can make anything right and what do
they usually make with it t right so you
have this machine that can make anything
and all you make with it is t it
actually sometimes to make a cheesecake
but it's usually pretty limited in and
in what they do so so we have this
problem which you're calling the lab
that you know a great hot problem and
you bring a student to this machine that
can make anything and you tell them to
design and they usually will design a
block with a couple of holes it it's
difficult for people to take advantage
of this huge huge open design space it's
like a blank page so we need computers
to help us design and explore new things
so traditional CAD doesn't cut it it's
too conservative and what it allows you
to do so where can we go from here so I
want to show you a quick couple of
examples at one so if you want to design
a complicated shape like this it's going
to take you forever to describe it in
CAD forever to even think about it you
have to be a super duper expert to make
something like that in cad so how do you
do it so there's a couple of new
directions in capsules and it's a
reincarnation of all things one is
programming so doing design by
programming not by working with geometry
so you can design something like this
using
a procedural language a lot easier than
you can do by pointing and clicking so
there's a lot of work in that in fact
the new file format that allows you to
print things be replacing stl is a kind
of programming language so allows you to
put in formulas that allow you to make
complicated things like that very
concisely using a program can describe a
new material that is a kind of
microstructure and then use that
material to fill in things and so forth
so maybe it's going to be sketching so
for a while we worked on this software
that will take a sketch interpret it as
a 3d object and print it turns out that
fewer people know how to sketch them to
use CAD so that's that's that's not
going to go anywhere so abandon that
maybe we can do functional design so I
maybe I want to be able to say I have
three bars connect them in some make a
bracket that connects them in the
optimal way and it has to carry this
load and don't bother me with any more
questions just call me when it's done
right so this is how I work with my
students on the software to work the
same way so maybe we can do that so I'd
like to start with some constraints and
have it evolve or generate the design
for me so this is an example this is
running in real time of this kind of
design optimization where you say I'm
this isn't I'm harnessing structure it's
connected here it's hanging off here and
give me the optimal shape and here it's
optimizing and it's given me a pretty
good design here's now I can say okay
actually I want a bar passing through
the center give me a design that leaves
the space empty and it's giving me a
design so these are new kind of a
algorithm this is in 3d this is not in
three in real time but you can have
these kinds of functional design tools
that find solutions for you based on
high lever descriptions we call them
matter compilers right so it's a little
bit like compilers you say what you want
you hit enter and it generates a design
for you another thing has to do with
material so we talked a lot about
materials how can we predict the
material properties and we talked we
said earlier that we can mix and match
material we can have two materials if
fifty fifty percent turns out that how
you what the dot pattern of these two
materials affects performance if you
have two materials hard and soft you
make them fifty percent in a random
pattern or in a checkerboard pile and
you get very different results there's
almost no theory to predict that
material scientists are struggling with
predicting properties of laminated
composite materials that alone
checkerboard 3d random stuff so we don't
know how to do that and probably the way
to do that is going to be through
modeling this is an example in a
completely bizarre material you can
print materials that are oxidized emple
you pull on them longitudinally and they
expand laterally a very bizarre material
doesn't exist in nature you can make it
still with fifty fifty percent so the
pattern matters and we have no clue how
to predict these things and a new
theories needed so we're working on a
more data-driven you make lots of these
different things you pull them and you
model them and this is actually a
product of a kick natural Academy
project that was funded funded this a
couple of years ago to make this a
project we automatically generate models
from data and you can download Eureka
with the Q pasting your data hit enter
and you get these interesting and
elliptical models from it automatically
another thing that a couple of my
students are thinking of and you see
this more and more are fab apps these
are applications that embody a lot of
information about a design of a
particular thing and yet give you some
freedom so let's say you want to
download and print a new toothbrush you
want to make your own toothbrush the app
this is an app that would be delic
dedicated to making toothbrushes it has
all the know how about toothbrushes it
asks you a lot of questions scan your
mouth scan your hand whatever it needs
to do and it generates the perfect
toothbrush for you and it costs you 99
cents you downloaded you print one
toothbrush alright so this is a kind of
new business model that has to do with
CAD that's dedicated for narrow markets
for another one thing only does one
thing very very well and it's a way for
for manufacturers to get into the
business last thing i want to show you
in the cat is this sit back and relax
kind of cad
process this is a website that we've
just created called web endless forms
calm and what it does there you want to
design something let's see want to
design a I know a lamp okay but you
don't know any CAD you don't know how to
do that it shows you random things and
you say I like this I like this i don't
like that and i don't like that based on
your input it creates a new set of
objects and so forth and just by saying
what you like and you don't like you
create lots of things in about one month
we've had almost two million things
generated here there's a 3d print button
and you can print them people have
created these faces and spines and
mushrooms and exclamation marks I don't
know what all kinds of things on the fly
with not with zero cat training all
right and people just by this
interaction working in groups and so
forth so I think they're really
fascinating ways to do that and we want
to integrate this with I scanning now so
you can literally sit back and relax
just look and based on where you're
looking the machine can design new
things so we want to take all these
different modalities of cad that go way
beyond the traditional point and click
drag kind of cad and put them into a
system where you can say what you want
give some specs and we'll design both
the shape and the internal structure and
all the multiple materials all at the
same time to give you the desires
there's no way you can explore that
manually all right last thing i want to
say is that we are also in the verge of
transitioning from analog to digital in
manufacturing the idea here is that
you've seen a lot of technology moved
from analog to digital from continuous
to discrete we're doing the same thing
here we're beginning to move from
thinking of materials as continuous
materials materials that are made of
lots and lots of small pixels that are
either there or not so you can imagine
the position process that puts material
instead of a continuous process in a
discrete process and you know we see
that right now this is a continuous
circle but it's really made of also
pixels so let's start thinking about
objects is made of pixels in 3d and
depending on what kind of pixels you
have you'll be able to make lots of
interesting things and that will allow
us to go from just
with raw materials to printing with
capacitors and transistors and printing
with CPUs and printing with fpgas and
sensors and actuators and so forth so
the idea is to make a printer that
basically rapidly assembles gazillion
sand grain sized components into 3d
together with all this raw material and
we've been working on different ways to
do that to pick up a lots of things
using adhesion in this case we have a
printhead we wet some of it and dry some
of it with light and then it selectively
picks up objects and we can use it to
make three-dimensional objects of
various shapes and sizes out of raw
components and here's an example of a
rook that's made out of 10,000
components when you see this and you
tell your grandchildren that you
remember seeing that first object that
was made out of ten thousand pixels
whereas in the future everything will be
made out of Giga voxels this is what it
looks like so you can nobody will
believe you that that it was that low
resolution at some point but eventually
we want to take these micro components
as a powder and assemble them into these
large structures that are composed of
lots and lots of micro component
somebody asked about micro components
these are hunted these are 500 microns
on the side and they assemble into a 3d
structure so the next big phase I think
of this thing that's coming after this
revolution is moving from analog to
digital we saw it in computation we saw
at the communication and now it's
happening in manufacturing and that the
next big thing so you've seen this slide
already but we've we've talked about
these three episodes we talked about
complexity is free any shape goes we're
beginning to explore compositions of
material it's very very difficult to
anticipate what that's going to do and
now we're going to integrate functional
behavior electronics photonics all these
different energy all these different
things what what is it going to do it's
a new design space a new kind of
materials if there's one
thing I want you to go home with is to
think about how is it going to affect
your field okay and you have experts
here we can give you all the input but
there is no feel that this is not going
to affect so don't go home and thinking
oh this is cool but I'm going to do my
own thing no you're gonna have to think
how is going to thank you feel because
it is and the question is are you going
to be there or not and I think that you
know human evolution has distinguished
itself with the design with new tools
and and I think that this is the
ultimate tool and it's going to change
everything forever thank you add ketchup
okay we have a time for a few questions
probably about three so any questions if
gaining a proverbial research I'm
particularly interested in the
simplicity of input that you could
achieve in for such machines you touched
on this tangentially when you talked
about kids and then you talked about
languages which I'm afraid not everybody
might be willing to learn and then I
talked about choosing out of multiple
random designs I think if the
technologies to be adopted it has to be
super simple for everyone at home so
what do you envision to be the
simplicity of input here how do you
allow everybody at home whatever his
special tour expertise professionally to
make use of those machines also it's
it's an excellent question it's it
that's the million-dollar question okay
how do we get people to use it but it's
happening people are using it it's it's
a combination of having these machines
accessible and it's there's there's
material inputs and things like that but
in terms of design I think it's going to
be a mixture of things some people will
need a dedicated software for the
particular thing the people who make
food and print cookies I have asked me
multiple times is there a food cat okay
for making cookies and it's not
something is going to work with Phil
it's and holes it's going to work with
feelings and coatings and things like
that so
I think we're going to see a
proliferation of design tools for
different areas there's not going to be
a 1-1 answer for everything and how we
do that is going to is the next big
question yeah siciliana Ryan and
Colorado State University first off
thank you for a very interesting
presentation as you start simplifying
this CAD to or factory to my concern is
about quality control because this is a
manufacturer so can you say something
about it right so there's a this huge
societal implication and the question
about quality control is a very
important one there's a there's not just
that there's there's intellectual
property which was mentioned there's
quality assurance this liability if you
design a steering wheel somebody puts it
on a brakes who's liable there's a how
do you make sure everything is the same
these are all issues that that nobody
has the answer to and I think there's a
lot of opportunity to test that i think
the importance of automated engineering
tools that can verify these things in
advance that can predict properties can
can have feedback while printing to
ensure that the things being created
match the design all these things are
going to be paramount so so so I think
these are these are big open questions
in a way I think we have a better handle
on the technology's technological issues
and we have on all these societal issues
and and for better and for worse it
happens with the democratization of
everything you lose control and usually
it's for the better yeah my name is da
Hye Jung Hwan i'm from texas A&amp;amp;M
university is a very interesting talk so
the first question is on you reviewed a
very interesting road map for your am
process so what's what's the timeline
you are thinking about the episode 2 and
episode 3 to happen like the composite
material and the future functionality
and then the second question is as
amateur scientists as amateur engine
I want to see what's a research need you
will for your you know am process
what other needs like I'm ceramic
pressure and maybe some mythologist over
here what's a neat research area you are
alright so timeline and the next and the
research agenda so timeline I think I
think it's also learning from the
computer industry and I think it's a
similar but it's just going to be a bit
faster so i would say in in i'd say in
10 years everybody will know with 3d
printing ask anybody and I'd say you
literally will have a hard time
explaining to your grandchildren how you
lived without a printer in your house
right literally so so I'd say in 40
years everybody will have these things
in their home and and so that's that's
that's your timeline so in terms of the
current material science challenges I
think they're all over and there's you
know you just pick whatever whatever you
like you can go from kind of very
specific questions like how do you make
titanium you know crystals grow better
and so forth to two questions are more
about automation these are things that I
like about forget about modeling anymore
improving any particular process how can
I automatically make a system that can
watch what's going on and automatically
improve it because a lot because there
are so many materials and so many
combinations that it is hopeless in my
mind to try to model or understand any
any specific material because they are
just so many this is a there's a there's
a explosion of complexity and the only
way around it is to have data driven
processes that actually learn from what
is printed and create models of
thematically that's that's the post
we're pursuing but I think material
science will need to go in that
direction that the of machine learning
in AI to battle this complexity okay
thank you alright thank you thank you
bunches
I'd like to ask the ice creatures to
come up we're going to go in and start
the panel first of all thank you very
much the speakers to L standing pretty
good so we thought we could just start
out with we pretty much have a good
background all the speakers and you can
see the diverse areas such as aerospace
to medical to the future and outstanding
docs but we wanted to kind of go into
maybe some of the issues we touched on a
little bit of them kind of like societal
issues an electro property but one to
open up the floor to you to continue on
questions that you didn't get a chance
to ask and open up that dialogue again
great talk guys I have a question for
each of you and in one line if you will
whereas what is the great engineering
challenge in 3d printing going forward
for somebody to start a career for like
my kids or anybody could each of you
take a minute to say what do you think
is the great engineering challenge in
the next level for 3d printing thank you
so I've got the probably the most a
short term answer out of this group here
for that and I really again there's a
question about material science we have
what we're seeing with the end the four
dimensional energy input gradients that
we have in these additive processes are
really not the same type of energy
inputs we're used to in traditional
traditional manufacturing and that we
have that has guided the the chemists
and whatnot to formulate polymers in
particular or even metal alloys wanna so
I think there's still quite a bit of
just in the weeds work that certainly
you could fill a whole career with to
really tailor materials towards additive
manufacturing the big polymer companies
you know vonyc and and are coming down
when are just starting to look at that
but that's that's a again that's
probably the most short-term short-term
response you'll get from this group but
but there's a lot of work to be done
there so you just heard me talk about
this but I think depends if you are I in
academia or in the industry in the if
you can afford to do long term I think
the one of the things that are most
missing right now our design tools we
have fantastic with the we have iPods
with no music ok we have machines that
can play and make things though but they
have nothing we're still thinking about
it the old way so we need new design
tools that can allow us to explore this
vast new possibility it's a bit longer
term but I think that's where where the
most impact could be had I would second
that in medicine I think one of the
biggest one of the biggest challenges is
figuring out how to use these
technologies to do things that are that
are not only kind of duplicates of you
know so say another way of making a
metal implant instead of casting or
machining is by additively creating it
maybe you can make some interesting
structures but how to design that to fit
to fit a unique individual with their
unique you know their unique functional
needs and I think that's really where
you know you start getting really
complex really fast and I think that's
where a lot of the systems today just
fall apart so I think there's a big need
there to take advantage of the additive
technologies and what they can bring
because today we're doing a lot of
things that you could do and some things
you couldn't but a lot of things you
could do some other way and it just have
to be better with additive but I think
in the future there will be many many
more things that you can do with
additive that you cannot do any other
way and and those things really relate
to very complex shapes and different
types of porous structures and
interactions of different materials
within 11 part developed for one person
I think I think the beauty of these
technologies at some level is just about
anything you're interested in at the
intersection of digital to physical
realization there's there's open
questions out there and so if it's
designed if its computation if its
materials there's there's still so much
left to explore and I think even on the
business side there's massive
entrepreneurship opportunities all over
the place and one of the things I peas
been mentioned a bunch almost all of the
initial patents for almost every one of
the types of machines that exists are
either just expired or are expiring in
the next couple of years and so there's
the huge opportunities for for companies
who could not play in the past because
of as Brett was talking about people
having all the legal battles those are
going to go away at least to a large
degree and already have started that's
how that's how this whole huge explosion
of these little extrusion machines fab
at home and others have taken off the
last couple years because the patent the
original patents for these extrusion
basics machines are gone and it and and
so now it opens up the marketplace that
nobody's worried about getting sued on
it so they didn't care about the patents
anyway some hackers I here anyways
exactly hi John Oxenberg from MIT since
my children are going to bring this into
our home very soon I'd like to ask about
toxicity in terms of powder and fumes
and perhaps most importantly Cheez Whiz
yeah so this whole like I said the all
these these impacts the safety and
reliability are open open questions
nobody knows and you know you would hope
that Cheez Whiz is already safe to some
extent but but there's
I know if you're talking specifically
about food printing but that's
definitely something that that needs to
be looked at this way that way but when
things are open source and what we're
beginning to see here is movement
towards open source hardware which is
that you download and make stuff and
just like there's this you know security
issues with open source software that
people were worried about well turns out
that security and open source software
is as good as close software so my gut
feeling is that open source hardware if
to draw the analogy is going to be as
safe for the same reason if anything
just because lots of people do it and
debug it a lot faster so but but you
know though who knows Nick feemster from
Georgia Tech just had a question for the
panel about reusability so I could think
of printing certain things or certain
certain objects that I'd only want for a
short period of time for example I can
trip I forget something and then I want
to instead of throwing it away maybe I
want to make something new you know the
next time is have people are people
looking into sort of reusability of the
raw materials and answer ways to make
that easier and what's going on with
that so you have the the thermally
process materials a lot easier to handle
that with the nylons thermoplastics
things like that bday amorphous or some
that crystalline so there's kind of a
clear path forward with that obviously
the processing temperatures get to be
kind of tricky especially with the poly
or else what you you don't want that in
your oven at home but um so that you
know a lot of the load sent baby I see
some things like that you can you know I
mean heating and cool and reuse those
Joseph well that's kind of a big push
with in Boeing's to move away from the
thermoset composites it mirrors this in
the additive manufacturing and move into
the thermoplastic composites because
again that recyclability and processes
when I Cheez Whiz though I'm not sure
but i think the reusability is actually
a major issue particularly in Europe
that that drives a lot of the research
to being done in these in these areas
and so on the metals are easily
recyclable the polymers yeah you got
changes in molecular weight and I
the things that occur through multiple
cycling and you have a hard time with
most of the currently available polymers
getting them to be reusable at anywhere
near their original properties but it's
the nice thing is that with these
technologies is you're generating with
most of them very little waste you're
only putting that material where you
want it so the first place you're using
less and all the remaining material can
be just dumped back in and reused again
and again and again at you know with
certain exceptions but yeah there's the
other side of it though which I want to
imagine anybody has a printer like that
in their office immediately sees a lot
of waste being generated at least in my
lab people you know we used to have this
thing in engineering think twice cut
once with a printer you you print many
times then you then you start thinking
so this is that's exactly what's
happening people you make the holes of
kind of the right side you print it if
it doesn't work you make a hole a bit
bigger you print it again it's still too
small and so forth instead of measuring
so I think like printers like regular
printers in the short term it creates
more garbage at some point people start
thinking about recycling and it's a
little bit of an economics company's not
want you to recycles it's the usual kind
of thing but in the long term it's
possible with the digital manufacturing
we actually make things out of component
it's fully recyclable so the idea there
that you really print these things out
of grains of you know micro processors
and sensors actuators you can take these
apart like Lego and reconstitute it into
something else so you can take your fax
machine apart and build it as a printer
and it's possible and that's I think the
ultimate form of recycling but that's 50
years down the road hi I'm sorry bit
loud only Williams microsoft research so
you make the analogy earlier about with
sort of security and open source
software and which is obviously a
natural one and the idea is that if I
had downloaded a piece of software my
computer if that was a great piece of
software very well designed and
engineered we sort of rely on the fact
that my cpu is going to execute it
exactly like any other cpu would execute
it and do exactly the same thing so in
the world where we all have our own 3d
on our desk and I download a brilliant
design for an amazing thing but my my
printer doesn't execute that manufacture
perfectly is there any work on you know
sort of decentralizing things like
testing and ensuring that you know
especially if I may depart from my car
or something that it's actually going to
be good so we had a one example we
partner with lotus there now Lotus for
no GP so a Renault Formula One they've
been a long-standing research partner
and additive manufacturing and one of
the products about five years ago or so
was to take one file one build file send
it to their machine Senate on our
machine build it and pull all the
mechanical coupons that have them all
come out with an emergent there and that
took four months to get writing these
are the more complicated processes laser
sintering whatnot your laser has to be
really tuned and things like that but
the process is in general a lot more
complicated and it takes a lot more
attention than what we're used to but
it's certainly viable we have units we
have a whole supply she and set up on
that in fact but it's taking a lot of
engineering from the you know in the
near term let's do it now type
perspective and it took a long while for
computers to get to the point where
codes execute this exactly the same way
it didn't happen overnight there's all
of error correction going on behind the
scenes to make that happen and the same
thing will need to happen with 3d
printing I think an interesting thing
about additive manufacturing from a
quality standpoint is the ability to in
most these processes to look at each
layer as it's being created you know so
if you think of a part that's
traditionally cast or machine from a
block that was created you know some
other way you don't have the ability to
look inside of it we're here you're
actually seeing it be created so if you
have a good way to quality control each
layer and you have you know you know the
process parameters that go into the
interlayer you know variables then you
really can create more even maybe more
of an understanding of the quality of
that part from the inside out then you
can with traditional techniques which I
don't think it's been fully exploited
but there's a lot of work I know on on
looking at layers and looking at
especially for metals you know trying to
make sure that you've got zero zero
defects I think aerospace pushing that
most but medical interested there you
know as well yeah so this is angela from
purdue university so the printing has
been used before to create today's
integrated circuits
like opinions all transistors there a
lot then talking about this 3d printing
there how do you make a comparison then
the printing has been found having
disadvantages or number of issues with
it so so how do you see the road maps or
the when you make a correlation with
upbringing is useful in creating today's
integrated circuits so have you thought
about that okay down the road is the
future so so what's going to ya the road
how far this technology can go it's it's
difficult to say I think everybody's
looking at me I don't know you talk it
it's it's the I think it has to do with
with unleashing the this complexity so
what would happened with stealth or
graphic methods a micro fabrication is
that the kind the complexity cost of
complexity came down so you can make
billions of transistors fairly easily
and that allows you to make much more
complex things at the same cost this is
what's happening now so in the beginning
it's just about making conventional
things more cheaply or differently but
what is beginning to happen and this is
this is the road map you'll be able to
make things that a lot more complex that
we can anticipate right now and what
will those things be you know all bets
are off but but that that's where it's
going I think what you're finding if you
look at the you know the integrated
circuits community or if you look at the
two dimensional printing ink even inkjet
printing limit of that that we're
talking not just millions or tens or
hundreds of millions but billions of
dollars of R&amp;amp;D put into the development
of those technologies and right now the
entire marketplace for additive is only
a billion dollar so we haven't put
billions into 2 r.d but I was at a
conference this summer where a lot of
the major printing device companies are
basically saying we see this is the next
way
you know we've developed all this
infrastructure and technology of making
droplets to put them down now let's
start stacking those droplets and they
were demonstrating in videos that
wouldn't give us for many details we
showed droplet printing of copper so
they've got they've got working devices
now that can print metal at the melting
temperature of copper and once you and
there's other people working on how do
we print high viscosity materials
polymer melts and things like that so
what I think you're going to find is is
as this grows for the first time you're
now going to conferences and you're in
and not only are you bumping elbows with
engineers but there's investment bankers
they're asking you questions and there's
other people and that's now we're at the
cusp of once a lot of money gets put
into it things can explode quickly
because the people see where the
bottlenecks are and none of them are
technologically impossible there there
possibly difficult but they're not
impossible so if I Oh Bravo MIT so if I
put energy time and the amount of raw
material I take to make something on my
left hand and whatever it is I'm making
on my right hand and I say I do it
additive manufacturing versus
subtractive manufacturing it's clear
from everything we've heard that for a
highly customizable flexible part or a
low part count thing additive
manufacturing is going to win what is
not clear to me is that in many things
that have high levels of symmetry it's
actually easier to make a very simple
mold or something that makes that high
symmetry part and then chop it away to
make something customizable on top of
that so I think from everything I've
heard that it should be a balance
between additive and subtractive
manufacturing where you're actually
using the best of both worlds in the
same way like nature makes our own hands
and then uses apoptosis to cut it away
to make our fingers so that the easy
cases can be done but that have high
levels of symmetry cheaply with energy
time and few amounts of raw materials
and then this is used to customize
around that or do more complex things
that can't be done in that very simple
way would you like to comment on that
absolutely i'd say you're correct
because the hybrid the hybrid additive
plus subtract is without a doubt or even
just traditional subtractive is going to
maintain a major part of the marketplace
there's no there's no question about it
but to i mean to get back to i think the
question i think you asked about volume
back when Brett was speaking today if
you take some small complex say small
interconnects or something like that
using existing technology existing
machines depending on the size and but
you can make in some cases 122 200,000
little plastic widgets using additive
more economically than injection molding
and so we're already seeing with pretty
much just prototyping machines they're
not optimized at all for production and
they're not and and again almost
everything we've talked about we're
using we're transforming energy at a
point and moving that point discreetly
around there are a tremendous amount of
innovations that have looked at using
lines of energy or transformation or
transforming the entire area at a time
and then there's concepts for how do we
transform material no matter where in a
three-dimensional space when we move
beyond one point of transformation at a
time now it's going to become even
that's going to push that number higher
and higher even for simple objects in
some cases so but yet the for now
without a doubt simple parts a hybrid
approach or even just a simple
subtractive approach is going to win out
in most most case i would like to argue
to argue with you about this i think
that detector the other point of view
that the thing you're not factoring in
is that having a hybrid process is more
expensive because you have to maintain
two processes at the same time and
there's a cost of that so it's a little
bit like saying you know you can make an
analog circuit that's good for playing
music and you can have a computer that's
good for calculation and you want to
both but in the end of the day we use
computers to do all these things because
it's just easier to have one kind of
approach to do everything and there's a
cost benefit that factors in with this
unit with the versatility with in volume
in each one of our parts that we put on
aircraft gets traded against
conventional a molded parts that have to
have to machine I think the best example
though it may be what you're talking
about or not that I know of but actually
you can find instantiate it already is
in the area of tooling so tooling shops
there the tool is their final product
that's what they're selling what not and
there's a large number of companies that
are doing a very good job of doing like
a you know don't do the net shape
casting on machine that off and then
they'll put that into an additive
manufacturing machine and then put the
really really fine details I'm not
building up 50 pounds of you know you
know stealing what up but they will
hybridize that to an extent but it is
true though I mean you have to have the
other thing you have to keep in mind
with the other process is all the
long-term costs we if I wish I had a
picture of it right now we have a
warehouse and I think it's in Utah that
is literally five or six football acres
in an area like football field scenario
several acres an area and it's all tool
storage so it's we have two from
industrials directive especially eros we
have to think about the real long-term
implications of those trades early on
and a lot of design engineers will get
caught early as a guy yeah it's only
four bucks to injection well that's
great they're not the ones that have to
you know keep those tools maintained for
15-plus years so they're a lotta it's
very complicated situation but there are
some hybridizing alright this is RC from
Eastman Chemical Company I have a couple
of questions the first one is what is
the landscape of additive manufacturing
and how are developing country is
picking on that and next is one of the
killer apps could be in hobbies or in
pleasure activities in that case like
how the photography is is there how can
we follow the development in this area
is there anything like magazine or blogs
where we could you know read for the you
know amateur for
three printers something like that
Thanks well there's a huge industry
around this maker magazine and there's a
lot of huge industry around these hobby
3d printing but i'm not sure if there's
a magazine yet they have a great idea
there so go for it fabor maker i think
has one thanks for 3d printing for the
debt spectrum beyond 3d printing and i
think i've thought quite a bit about the
developing world and how this impacts
that I think there's there are very
clear and compelling ways that this is
this removes some of that angst between
know we're sending all of our labor and
our manufacturing to the developing
world because this allows a lot of that
to come back from the developing world
but at the same time without taking
anything from them because they can also
use that there as well and I think it's
a great equalizer at some level because
the infrastructure needed to do additive
manufacturing is quite small it's sort
of like the developing world is not
putting in landline telephones to now
get up to it's all Wireless right
because this is the new technology cell
phones is far far better you know for a
developing world infrastructure I think
in the same way we're not going to see
the developing world going in and
putting in massive at least in
up-and-coming developing places not
putting in massive facilities and
foundries and and forging facilities
they're going to say you know that's too
much infrastructure we're going to jump
straight to things we can do use the
natural resources here and print them
out and organize them well so I think
it's a major issue yeah you could see
the same thing already happening with
Fab Lab so it's a good example which is
kind of a fab labs for coming out of MIT
Neil Gershenfeld are these you know
hacker spaces where people make it build
things I'm one these are put in rural
areas let's say in Africa what happens
is that people make things they need
they have ideas they know how to make it
they make it they don't have to rely on
some big us companies to think that
there's a market they just go and make
what they need so this huge on one hand
the ability to make things and close the
loop a lot closer but the bigger impact
I think there is
there is a huge empowerment that follows
from that so we put open source 3d
printers in South Africa and kids
suddenly want to they make things and
then they come and say okay where do I
study about this suddenly there's a need
it can make something and then follows
the thirst for education and for for
innovation and interpreter ship so I
think it's a big equalizer like you say
and it's going to have huge impacts hi
Scott gel UC Santa Barbara so I'm
wondering if there are particular
challenges associated with using these
techniques to generate materials with
not only precise structural and
mechanical functionality but with
chemical functionality in particular i'm
thinking of applications and biology and
medicine where you may want to generate
materials that have particular
recognition factors growth factors or
enzymes which are very sensitive
molecules in terms of being subjected to
shear and temperature and so i'm
wondering what kinds of constraints does
that generate on these development of
these processes and are there efforts to
try and improve them talking of two
examples of that and I don't want to one
is people are using printing in custom
medication ideas that you print a pill
and it has different ingredients at the
right spatial configuration so that
dissolve at the right time and the right
combination that's an example where the
shape doesn't matter but it's the
chemical composition that actually
matters and it's tailored so it's
personalized medication if you like so
that's one example we're controlling
this kind of thing and then there are
other processes after with color and in
in another example of bio printing
people put different cell types and
different locations in order to create
models of a three-dimensional cell
culture so going from A to D petri dish
the 3d cell a heterogeneous tissue cell
culture for modeling the behavior of ave
so you can do tests in the kind of 3d
petri dish so that's an example
and we want to control the the chemical
gradients in very precise ways to
emulate to to emulate in vitro biology
so that's a is it to example so so I'm
glad you brought that up it's a great
example how you take this capability and
move away from geometry and think about
other kinds of things you can print and
use that that's a it's a big area I'm if
i'll be in Portugal at a conference next
week and there a lot of the stuff there
is on medical things where people look
at printing different kinds of tissue
different multiple material you know the
scaffolding and then in some cases like
you're saying putting certain shear and
and strain histories into them as
they're building them too because you
get a different response from living
tissue under those scenarios and
chemical gradients as well as thermal
and stress and strain gradients and what
what it's this is doing is it's making
people who work in the area of sort of
synthetic biology and other things you
get three dimensional responses that are
very different than petri dish responses
and people are saying hey we've come so
far with petri dish type things but you
know to go the next level we've got to
mimic the full three-dimensional
stress-strain chemic chemistry and yeah
a lot of people are looking at it it's
got a lot of any NIH money right now in
different aspects of that going on it's
historically those two things have been
separate the form has been separate from
the biology piece of it so you'll make
the form and then you'll see it with a
biology because of the you know the
factors of its things needing heat or
pressure or whatever to actually get
extruded so I think more and more you've
got to see those come together and that
that has to be a key part of being able
to build something like an organ you
know can function as machines being able
to do it real time you know in a layer
that's sealed off from other layers do
things that you you can't necessarily
get in and seed later so I get to keep
it's a key area I am so hopefully from
you Southern California um hide you
talked about the maker movement and I
think the maker movement is a very
optimistic movement and then it's trying
to give people tools to make things but
realistically there are a lot of people
who don't want to make
at all and I think the best example of
this is cooking probably even a lot of
us here don't want to make food which is
why we have Trader Joe's and food courts
and malls so I wonder if psychologically
speaking apart from the hobbyists if the
biggest application of these
technologies would be something like a
food court where there will always be
people who do small scale manufacturing
of custom products and you might go to a
mall and have a bunch of people making a
bunch of custom things using these sort
of techniques but then who cater to
people who want to buy things which
unfortunately is all of us that's that's
very much possibility we've had numerous
discussions of this type in the lab what
kind how this technology will play out
and we really don't know that it's
probably going to be all the way from a
printer at home to kinkos you know you
buy books on Amazon that are pre-printed
you go to kinkos to print a thousand you
print at home something if you want to
do you want a few copies there's the
whole variety it's probably going to be
all of these definitely there are people
who would like to be able to download
recipes and print them and it is more
automatic than making it yourself
actually if it's so it is convenient and
that's kind of my perspective as well
but if you're into making you know
sophisticated pastries but you don't
have a steady hand you can that's the
way to do that and maybe people who
can't do it right now would be
interested if they only have those tools
so I think there's a it's just a huge
space and apron and we'll see we'll see
how it plays out Chris badger Carnegie
Mellon um so I want to talk about the
legal implications about failure of
these devices right so if let's say i
want i'm interested in bicycle pedals
and i won shimano and i'm riding my
bicycle and this pedal fails for some
critical defects and I could say okay so
shimano has sold me this so they can
kind of go back and it's kind of a
centralized kind of responsibility right
but now we have a case with a.m. where
you have you know user convolved with
the material convolve with the MakerBot
for example
so you have the all these multiple
parties all linked up right so so let's
say that same example happens my bicycle
pedal fails and my son crashes into a
car or something terrible like that it
said then how do you how do you parse
out who's responsible for this right is
it it maybe there's a good design that I
download design is perfect but then the
3d printer is just slightly flawed in it
and that leads to problems of maybe the
raw materials are or out of spec right
so how does that kind of play out I
think nobody knows it's really literally
playing out it's going to it's a big
problem and nobody knows what to do with
this I know if there's anybody here in
the legal profession but that's
definitely something to you can make a
career out of thinking about this like
that question yeah so I had just going
to say for the medical industry I think
that question will keep things
centralized you know it's one of the one
of the big keys is that you know nobody
wants to take that rig that risk for
certain things but for for things that
are really critical you don't want to
take that risk you know and it's the
reason why these companies put you know
millions and billions of dollars into
research and testing and all that to
make sure that products safe at home
even if the design was right there are
so many I mean if everybody had ten
percent of the liability there no
everybody's going to you know disclaim
everybody else so nobody's going to have
any liability you know and I think that
that may work for some industries
bending the medical industry that's a
tough one so what happens today if you
download software that software causes a
problem it's I think it's not unlike
what is happening with so you download
it's very and it's running on your
computer and so there's a mixed
liability there so although it sounds
very complicated i think we are it's not
totally foreign these things that are
happening with the internet all the time
and somehow it works out but i think you
know from from production at boeing and
GE and medical that like you said
centralized repeat and you have to have
traceability back to the beginning and
so those are those are issues or that
are relatively straightforward i think
your question is like what happens if
shapeways somebody designs a bicycle
pedal and they advertise it on shapeways
i think what's going to happen in
Shapeways is going to say these things
are not fit for any use there just for
you know for looking at and try to hand
off they're off their liability and if
it
designer represents otherwise we're not
represented that's the case that's going
to cause big trouble for shapeways i
materialized another but i think at some
level they will end up you know passing
off some of that or they'll get sued and
go under and somebody else would come up
with a way to actually pass it off but
you know google has to handle with that
sort of stuff all the time right lie you
know Fourth Amendment stuff is all over
the place and so well I know a software
if you know banking there's plenty of
damage the software can do to you yeah
it's it's these thing a lot of the
things they've already been addressed
but in for anyone who thinks that the
quality controls straight for in trouble
I'd love to invite you to a duel
qualification meeting it says for an
additive manufacturing company takes a
lot of investment didn't make sure that
we have that one of the key points the
question though is as you get into
distributed manufacturing you get into
distributed lawsuits and that's you know
that's going to be a big business in the
future for some lawyers but you know you
typically don't do lawsuits unless you
think you can win something out of it
and so if you're you know suing a 12
year at a home the printed a plastic
part and someone got hurt from it you
know can you get money out of that it's
a big question it doesn't seem to stop
the recording industry though that's
true I think it's only now becoming an
issue 2 as you look at shapeways or I'm
materializing you look at you know
shapeways I know you look at most of it
you get a lot of jewelry and a lot of
things that aren't functionally you know
all that interesting I think only now as
people are getting more easy tools to
design something to fit their particular
bike or their particular stroller or
whatever it is you find you're going to
find more of this stops I don't know
that we've seen actually much of it
there are there's legislation on safe
haven for aggregators that merely
communicate designs by though I'm
responsible for them so I think it's
going to evolve but there are people
already who are designing you know
replacement parts for blenders in their
kitchen that are breaking on shapeways
and things like that now you've got
issues of flying
arts you got issues of contaminating
food and there's no warnings on anything
when you go to buy that so it's it's
it's a major issue I think you're going
to see a lot of lawsuits setting
precedents and companies it's going to
be really fluid for the next 10 years
would be my guess there's also a
copyright issues to write if you take a
Mickey Mouse and cut his head off and
put your face on it is that is that you
know new intellectual property or you
you know infringing upon that and so
some other bigger Loni love from Oak
Ridge National Lab last year hot I had a
similar experience my wife roped me into
helping a FIRST Robotics was a nightmare
but I the school did not have a shop but
they had a 3d printer and the first
night we sat down and taught the kids
cat and it really unleash their
creativity you know how can we get this
technology in every school because it
really kids need to be building things
and right and it really is an
interesting opportunity but well this I
can't be more enthusiastic about what
this is an education in unleashing
creativity and empowering kids to
realize they can design things it's not
about making teaching models it's about
letting that the kids make things and i
wrote the OSTP report about what what
the government needs to do with 3d
printing can actually I wanted the
government to stay out of it but I can
actually say that couldn't say so the
only thing I could really say is put a
3d printer in every classroom this is
what we really need most most adults let
alone kids have not seen anything being
made in their own eyes and I think it's
this huge empowerment and in engineering
and seeing that happen so I'm all for it
what exactly they would even move their
head as its printing yeah but there's
there's already i think close to 10,000
in educational environments right now so
it's it's exploded in the last few years
i think that's my recollection of the
number i heard this summer was 10,000
additive manufacturing
so that would be lovely yeah but it's
it's propagating much more quickly than
computers did into classrooms without a
doubt I bet we're way ahead of the curve
of propagating and education doesn't
mean we should sit on our laurels and
think it's going to complete it still
needs some work but there are programs
like society manufacturing in yours
bright minds that really speak to I
think the passion of everyone is
involved in industry then there are some
regular efforts the challenge has been
so we've done quite a bit of work in
education it's not the excitement is
there the challenge is to get it into
the standard curriculum ok because it's
it's packed so the question is how can
you teach square root with a 3d printer
better than without it and that's right
now that's what the point we need
control experiments data to showing that
having this in the classroom accelerates
learning and that's that's hard data to
get but that's the next step the
enthusiasm is there that's not a problem
to raise the lowest-cost ones are about
a thousand dollars and look like a loony
Columbia University so for all of you
may be more for HUD one image that keeps
coming up is the idea of somebody
printing something in his own home in
his own garage now and so I can see that
aspect and maybe they need for tools to
help people think what they want but in
terms of more like collaborative
engineering or collaborative geographic
distributed engineering and the
potential for if you will regenerate and
then 20 for engineering with like for
instance also with respect to computer
engineering but not just that so can you
comment on that and what additive
manufacturing can bring in what what are
the challenges yo it's the that's a
great column a great point you know I've
seen I see all these hackerspaces
happening in the maker movement and what
people tell me is that it's not the
tools that bring the people it's the
other people that bring people into
these places it's a place for quota for
nerds to hang out with like people and
they build things and it's really the
social element of making that really
makes that take off so I think I up to
the red is the collaborative element
that is also part of this bigger picture
of what these manufacturing tools about
manufacturing at home makes and amines
and what manufacturing and these
collaborative spaces means and it's very
empowering that way as well as people to
share ideas a lot more easily you can
ship ideas you can work on a physical
thing at different sides of the planet
at the same time so it's a that gives a
new meaning to collaboration and it also
allows people to work together in the
same spot in much more you know a
connected way than otherwise so these
are a great point and it's happening in
a lot of multinational companies where
they will actually do physical
production or prototyping and all the
various facilities in collaborate that
way a lot of people in this industry
talk about like if a picture's worth a
thousand words and how much is a part is
worth you know and everybody throws out
their own number but it's the idea yeah
really in the words million hello Bob
Barr Saudi Arkema any question about
what the resolution like the
state-of-the-art resolution for
different materials are in terms of
pixel size and how they'll become more
important as people try to put
functionality at exactly the right spot
and device or have a gradient for
medical application things like that or
are people trying to push that lower and
lower you know to get more specificity
and precision if it's been quite a bit
of time working on minimum resolution
feature size resolution and laser
sintering and there are technical
details with each process that are
different whatnot but in general the
first layer the first thing you look at
is your layer thickness is the first
thing and then after that you can get
into energy input minimum dimension so
you're typically on the order of you
know 100 micron 80 microns 50 micron
wanna depends on the process and the
materials and then the spot sizes are
also very challenging as well so co2
lasers or you have 500 micron spots for
the gradient wanna that gives you the
order of magnitude that right
typically you can build walls you know
down to if you're really really careful
three-quarters of a millimeter half a
millimeter functionally in robust
materials you can make really find
things that are you know there that are
just just this is just as good might as
well not be there basically but uh but
that's functionally we're at in terms
industry right now well a lot of is
driven by need so I often you know I ask
companies you know can you make it
higher resolution they say yes but why
what's the killer app that needs higher
resolution so I think it's possible to
bring it lower but the question is what
why and is that the best place in terms
of opportunity and like you say I think
most like manufacturing production ready
type machines are in the hundred microns
two to three hundred microns for some of
the words but you got jewelry
prototyping or wax production machines
that around 10 micron or below
resolution so it really all of these can
be has a changeable resolution the the
tighter the resolution the slower the
process is going to go so it's really a
trade-off in most cases you said you
were from arkema those are right yeah so
what the first question is a right back
at you how find you want to grind the
power so well different one of the
things you you can do also is you can
have in the center of the structure you
can have very coarse resolution and only
near the edge you need the high
resolution so you can be a lot smarter
right now we have uniform resolution
which is kind of not necessarily optimal
well let me make one exception to that
which is the electron beam process by
our cam now when they are doing a fill
they're using the higher power low
resolution but when they're doing the
outside contours they split in two
d melt pools that are running inside
simultaneously by moving electron beam
around so quickly that we have 50 small
melt pools doing the contouring and so
that's that's an example of well
electron beam is much more dynamic of an
energy source than a laser because you
don't have mirrors to move so you move
it so quickly that you can it acts as if
you have to so yeah but that's some the
souther it's coming but I think we need
to move on to it looks like you do see
people judging you know taking and
trying to decide whether you should go
lower you know layer thicknesses or
higher layer I mean there's some of the
processes actually moving up you know
trying to get move up because they find
more value from being faster than they
do from getting more resolution and then
you're finding you know variable layer
thicknesses as well as variable spot
sizes with a little layer so I think
there's a lot of that kind of going on
at once but it isn't all moving it isn't
all moving down you know some of them
are definitely started really low and
had great resolution but feel like
they'd rather have speed versus
resolution and give up some of that and
move move faster okay I think that's
going to have to have to do it at this
point one more question will get one
more my name is Whitney kilala I'm from
Pacific West National Labs thank you for
some excellent talks I really appreciate
the quality of your talks I just had a
curiosity question I was just trying to
understand where the technology is in
terms of cartilage replacement it looked
like you gave an example of replicating
person's cartilage and then injecting it
in place it seemed like that could be a
potential growth market that's the whole
area of there's all fields of emerging
field called bio printing which has to
do with with that with printing live
tissue and I'd say it's it's within
reach but there's a lot of animal
testing and that needs to be done to to
actually demonstrate that so it's a in
the lab it's being done but it's not yet
proven I would say even some of the
simplest structures like bone you could
think of as being fairly simple in
places that don't need load you know so
think of replacing a part of the skull
or some some area that's no
exerting a lot of force it's still not
there we don't see commercial
applications of those things yet and
cartilage is cartilage is tough you know
because one it's immediately under load
and function I mean it's got to be it
needs to be exactly as it should be or
it's going to get torn up and you know
chewed up really quickly so I think
those things are still some some ways
some ways off okay well thank you very
much we really appreciate</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
