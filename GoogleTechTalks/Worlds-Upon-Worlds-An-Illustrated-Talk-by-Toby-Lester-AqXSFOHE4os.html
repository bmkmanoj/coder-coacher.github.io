gay
America its name it's this map over here
it's called the vault similar map of
1507 and as I was writing the book
immersed in a period of history that
happened hundreds and hundreds of years
ago I kept on having the impression then
that the people I was writing about were
sort of a direct analog to you all here
it's something that I just couldn't
shake and that's because the story that
I tell in the book is about a group of
people who stitched together a whole
number of different cartographical
traditions and technologies harnessed
the power of some new ideas and some new
technologies and and in a kind of
democratic help everybody see and
understand the world spirit came up with
a profoundly new way of mapping and
visualizing the world that is this map
so in effect what they were doing and
what I was trying to capture in the book
was people in the act of doing this
namely cocking their heads looking at
the world that they've been taught to
know and trying to see it understand it
imagine it and depict it in meaningful
new ways that are going to be useful to
all sorts of people this is a book about
maps it's a very visual book it's a
visual story that I tell which is why
I'm gonna show a lot of slides today
we're gonna survey in short order all
sorts of weird and wonderful old maps
and diagrams the date to the period of
this map and before and I'm gonna try to
tell you two stories and they're the
same two stories that I tell in the book
one is the relatively small but
fascinating and pretty unknown story of
how in the years immediately leading up
to 1507 this one map was made this map
that I'll also be showing you on the
screen this copy of the map over here is
a full-size facsimile it's the one that
will give you a sense of what the map
really looks like this is a very
diminished version of it up here so
after the talk if anybody hasn't looked
at it already please do there's nothing
like seeing it face to face there's an
original copy at the Library of Congress
in Washington DC if you're ever there I
strongly encourage you to go
see it.this does a decent job of
reproducing it but it's not perfect this
is the map that gave America its name
the makers of this map actually coined
the name America and it's also the map
that in effect launched the 500 year
reign of the printed world map as we
know it today before the making of this
map you really didn't have a single
standard idea of what a world map was
you could mention the phrase world map
to ten different people and they might
imagine ten radically different pictures
of the world after this map and the
vision of geography that it presents you
start to see the world map sort of
fixing itself into place and ultimately
leading to the world as we know it today
this is sort of the mother of the modern
world map in a sense that in turn leads
me to the second part of the story that
I tell in the book which is not the
story of this one world map but the
story of the world map that we've all
known for so long until you all started
to mess with it so the bigger story that
I'm trying to tell in the book is the
story of how Europeans and others
starting about 1,200 individually and
collectively intentionally and
unintentionally gradually expanded their
horizons traveled more around the globe
gathered together fragments of
geographical information and ultimately
pieced them all together and decided
that they could imagine their way to a
vision of the world as a whole for the
first time the very first time and
that's what comes together in this map
it's a presentation of the world full
360 degrees of longitude it's a it's a
real milestone so ultimately this book
is a story not just of maps not just of
geography or exploration or adventure
although there's plenty of that in the
book but it's it's also a story of ideas
in the power of the human imagination
which is why it's fun I think and what's
certainly why I had fun doing it I
thought we could just start by looking
at the map and very quickly describing
what it shows North is at the top in
1507 that wasn't a given you know we
know we like to think of north as the
natural top of the map these days but at
this point in history it wasn't
necessarily the case but North is at the
top here we'll talk later about how that
came to be that means that over here is
the East that island up at the top there
is Japan and the Pacific then this is a
kind of made up concoction of India and
China based on the writings of Marco
Polo and other travelers Central Asia of
the Middle East the Mediterranean Europe
Africa and then over here is the most
famous part of the map its depiction of
the new world this is North America up
here this is probably Florida there and
the Gulf of Mexico there this these are
the big islands of the Caribbean and the
little islands of the Caribbean and then
this giant southern landmass is what
we'd call South America today and it's
actually South America that the makers
of this map coined the name America for
North America is kind of an irrelevance
at this point the name America appears
down here on what we would probably call
Brazil today there's a close-up of it
that is the first use of the name of
America it's kind of cool to have the
document that actually first introduced
everybody to the name until 2003 I
really didn't know anything about this
map I wasn't even much of a geography or
cartography buff at the time I was an
editor and writer at the Atlantic
Monthly and crossed my desk one day came
a press release announcing that the
Library of Congress for the sum of 10
million dollars had bought what it
called the sole surviving copy of
America's birth certificate ten million
dollars was a figure that got my
attention that turned out to be more
than the Library of Congress had ever
spent on anything which is saying
something the library has bought a lot
of pretty expensive stuff turned out to
be about two million dollars more than
had been paid at public auction for an
original printed copy of the Declaration
of Independence not long before it's got
me thinking how was it that I didn't
know anything about this thing that
seemed to be the jewel of the Library of
Congress's collection and that seemed to
be at open market apparently worth more
than an original printed copy of the
Declaration of Independence so I asked
friends and colleagues if they could
tell me anything about the map and
nobody could
so I thought being a magazine person
that I'd write a little article about it
that was the delusional beginning of
what became a monster I did a little bit
of looking into the story and was pretty
quickly able to find out the basics of
the story which I'll lay out for you
here you some of you may already know it
but I hope you'll bear with me if you do
everybody knows Columbus crossed the
Atlantic in 48 1492 and found land on
the other side but in 1506 he died still
believing that what he'd found was a
part of Asia in fact he believed what he
found was a part of Asia that was on
maps of the time already so in a way
although it was revolutionary that he
had sailed across the Atlantic he
believed that he had confirmed an old
vision of the world that he wasn't
actually adding to people's
understanding of the globe except by
joining the two pieces that hadn't been
joined before even a decade after his
death you still see maps identifying the
new world as Asia this is a close-up of
North America on a map from 1516 this is
North America here here's Florida the
Gulf of Mexico and you can see on the
mainland it's labeled a little
confusedly land of Cuba part of Asia so
and the western edge of North America
isn't defined it just runs into the
border of the map so you know obviously
they don't know everything about it but
they've decided that this is Asia this
edge of the map would naturally bleed
into the far eastern edge which is Asia
so this was the prevailing view in the
early days of discovery and it wasn't
just Columbus another of his colleagues
Amerigo Vespucci whose portrait appears
here at the top of the vault similar map
mate in the end of the 1490s and
beginning of the 1500s made a series of
voyages across the atlantic also but
what this which she did was across the
Atlantic and arrived in the Caribbean
region just like Columbus but then he
instead of staying there decided he was
going to turn left and go south and then
he followed the coastline of what we now
know of his South America for thousands
of miles below the equator and well into
the southern hemisphere into a part of
the world that people assumed didn't
have land in it
they didn't have inhabited land in it
and in effect what he done was sail off
maps of the time and that the South
nosov this continent that he was
exploring was what made a big impression
on early Europeans in the in the initial
phase of the Age of Discovery that
doesn't mean that he believed he was
discovering new a new continent
he was Bucci repeatedly called what he
was exploring Asia and an endless Asian
land he said at one point but it made a
big impression and a bigger impression
than Columbus in a way because nobody
could find this place on a map
when Vespucci got home he wrote letters
back to friends and family in Florence
and publishers there got their hands on
some of his letters and they did what
publishers always do they want they said
it wasn't quite sensational enough and
they themselves spiced it up with some
stories of sex and cannibalism and
adventure on the high seas and they
published one letter in particular under
the title mundus Novas latin for new
world and that letter became an early
bestseller in Europe this would these
were the early days of the printing
press all of a sudden you've got this
ability to rapidly disseminate
information in a way that hadn't been
possible previously so everybody starts
to see these these letters of Vespucci
describing the discovery of a new world
the phrase new world though didn't mean
then what we think it means now it
didn't mean a new continent Vespucci
always believed he was exploring a part
of the new part of Asia new world just
met a part of the world that Europeans
hadn't previously visited before at
about this time they were also
describing parts of southern Africa as a
new world
so forget this idea that when Vespucci
wrote letters and this this this tract
titled new world was published that he
was announcing a new continent Vespucci
letters like I said spread rapidly
around Europe as did some of the early
sailors charts showing the coastlines of
new world and they made their way to
among other places a little town in the
mountains of eastern France called Santi
a not far from Strasbourg in what today
is Lorraine and there in that town was a
small group of
scholars and printers who at the time
were engaged in making a world atlas
among them was the map maker Martin
vowed similar whose name would
ultimately be attached to this map and
they decided for reasons that are
obscure to us today that what they were
seeing on the sailors charts and what
this Bucci was describing in his letters
and that what Columbus was describing
for that matter wasn't a part of Asia
and that it had to be actually a new
continent it wasn't one of the three
known parts of the world Europe Asia and
Africa it was something different it was
a fourth part of the world hence the
title of my book and because they read
it about in Vespucci letters and vist
which seemed to be from the European
perspective the discoverer of it they
decided to name it in his honor
hence America so that's the the basic
story but there's more to it than that
because it turns out that they printed a
thousand copies of this map
a big world map like this before the age
of printing was almost impossible to
reproduce and disseminate rapidly all of
a sudden now in the age of printing you
have the ability to take a map like this
run off lots of copies and have it
reappear all over Europe and that's what
seems to have happened in the years
immediately after 1507 you start to see
references to it sketches of it in
primarily university towns in Europe and
by the middle of the century the name
America has caught on it filled a vacuum
and arrived at the right time it was a
kind of poetic counterpoint to Asia
Europe and Africa and caught on it was
even used by then for North America as
well as South America but the map itself
disappeared there's a catalog of maps
from the sixteenth century that
mentioned smart involve similar and his
Maps doesn't say anything about this map
at all which is weird because we
consider it today a national treasure
then in a map that gave America its name
what happened why would it have
disappeared one reason is that this this
is a wall map and what would you do to
mount a wall map in in the in the early
1500s you take each of these sheets
slather the back of it with glue and
then tack it up onto a linen sheet and
hang it in a room in cold Europe where
you'd have a nice big fireplace puffing
out so it
and the math would rapidly degrade the
other reason that the map would have
disappeared was just the pace of
discovery there was new information
flooding back to Europe in those decades
and this Maps depiction of the new world
in particular would have gone out of
date very quickly so people would have
done what they did when the Soviet Union
fell just tear it down throw it away and
put up a new one so this is an ephemeral
document and it might have disappeared
altogether from history had it not been
for a German scholar named Johannes
schÃ¶ner who some time before 1520
decided he wanted a copy of the map for
his own research purposes had a copy
reprinted and bounded into a folio which
he then kept in his library after his
death that folio somehow made it to a
castle in southern Germany where it sat
in the castle library for hundreds of
years basically forgotten until 1901
when this guy father Joseph Fisher who
was a teacher of geography and an expert
in the cartography of the new world made
a visit to this castle to look at
another map and while he was there he
visited this little annex to the castle
library in a tower and in that light in
that room on one of the shelves was this
folio and inside the folio lo and behold
when he opened it up he found this
pristine copy of the vault similar map
because he was an expert in the
cartography of the new world he knew
right away what he'd found and he
quickly announced his discovery and
published a facsimile and you start to
see headlines like this it was a big
deal for a little while people got very
excited and naturally Americans in
particular decided rich Americans
decided they wanted to buy it so you
have people making overtures to the
Prince of the castle trying to buy it
but they couldn't agree on a price then
came World War One World War two and it
really wasn't until the end of the 20th
century that the Library of Congress
managed to get serious negotiations
underway to buy the map which finally
brings us back to 2003 when they issued
their press release saying that they
bought it so now having having learned
all this I see I thought that I probably
could do in you know medium sized or
even big article about the map but I was
busy so I just
all of my vault similar material in a
folder and went on with my life and it
wasn't until 2005 that it came back to
it at the time the Atlantic Monthly was
moved from Boston to Washington I didn't
want to go I needed to make a living so
I decided I try to write a book and I
certainly had a great idea I'd go back
to this stuff I'd write the book in 2006
and then publish it in 2007 just in time
for the 500th anniversary of the making
of the map and the name of America and I
put the book out in 2009 so I didn't
that plan didn't work but I'm really
glad it didn't because what happened in
in the process of my getting into the
story was that I realized there is much
much more to this map than just the
naming of America almost everybody who
talks about it limits himself to the
naming of America maybe the story of the
discovery of the new world but there is
way more to the map than just that on a
historic on the level of historical
significance for example this is the
first map to unambiguously show North
and South America is surrounded by water
remember that other depiction of North
America that merged the western side
with the margin of the map that's what
people typically did here you've got the
continent surrounded by water for the
very first time in 1507 Europeans aren't
even supposed to have glimpsed the
Pacific until 1513 or sailed around
South America until 15 20 or so so
something weirds going on here these
guys either have really great
information that nobody else seems to
have had access to or maybe they made a
wild guess we can speculate about that
later if you want to but this depiction
of new world is something really
important because it's the first map to
surround the new world with water it's
also the first map to suggest the
existence of the Pacific that's a pretty
cool milestone too but there's a lot
more to it than that
this is one of the very first printed
Maps ever to show the full coastline of
Africa in an accurate way and that in
the context of the times was probably
even bigger news than the depiction of
the new world and that's why Africa
breaks the frame of the map here they
could have made the map just a little
bigger and fit Africa in there they
chose not to and they did this because I
wanted to make a big point
excuse me the point was there's a sea
route open now around Africa for most of
the century preceding the making of this
map Europeans had been obsessed with the
idea of trying to sail around Africa
make their way from Europe all the way
under Africa and over into the Far East
where they could do trade directly with
all these people who had had riches
beyond belief or at least were reported
to they wanted to bypass the overland
route through Islamic territories so
this map in effect printed distributed
widely for the very first time shows the
full coastline of Africa and announces
there's a sea route open we can do it
that's really big news there's an even
bigger first though I think and that's
what I alluded to earlier this is one of
the very first Maps ever to attempt to
show the world in a full 360 degrees of
longitude maps prior to this one that
were done using latitude and longitude
limited themselves to the known world
Europe Asia and Africa they depict that
and they give you a little bit of ocean
on either side and that maybe amounted
to 270 degrees or so and then they would
just leave implied on the back of the
map so 90 degrees or so of Uncharted
oceanic space that probably didn't even
need to be matte because it was just
water so here for the first time you've
got the world as a whole kind of spread
out and stated in kind of
incontrovertible empirical in an
empirical way that you can see the world
as a whole now and in fact they make a
reference up in this little legend to
how powerful it is to be able to see the
world at a single glance that's a phrase
that resonates I think a lot not only
did they make this map and show that
they also made an accompanying little
globe these are called globe Gore's
they're designed to be cut out and then
paste it onto a ball and you can see
here that they're also depicting the
world in a full 360 degrees this is the
very first mass-produced globe ever made
probably this is again they're taking
advantage of advantage of this new
technology printing and all of a sudden
making a globe that for very cheap you
know the cost of a single piece of paper
can be bought and then at home assembled
so they're just sort of a cascade of
historical first after historical first
but there's more to the map than just
that as I got into the writing of the
book and the more I kind of gazed at
this map I had a copy of it right above
my desk the more I realize that it
wasn't just a map of one world it was a
map of a lot of different kinds of
worlds map of historical time it's a map
of social forces coming together and I
wanted to try to write a book that
actually would recreate that
kaleidoscopic effect that I was starting
to see in the map so I came up with a
structure that I hoped would do that and
that was to have every chapter of the
book open with a little detail of the
map I started over here in about the
year 1200 at the very edge of what was
the West the end of the Western world at
that time and then moved first east as
Europeans began to move out to Central
Asia and meet the Mongols and then all
the way out to China with Marco Polo and
then came back to Europe and go down the
coast of Africa and then eventually come
across the Atlantic and over to the new
world the kind of cheesy idea I had in
mind that actually made some sense to me
was you know how some of those Disney
cartoons start with a picture of a
storybook and there's Prince Charming
and he's just on his horse and then the
camera zooms in and all of a sudden the
horse starts galloping and the story
gets underway well I want each detail of
the map to be like that a little static
picture that then you would then zoom in
on and all these stories and ideas would
come to life that approach allowed me to
explore this one map in great detail but
also to back away a lot and give you
this kind of big picture sense of all
these people crawling all over the world
almost like ants gathering information
going doing things and then bringing it
all back and having it all be
synthesized into this one picture of the
world that comes together in 1507 so
it's it's as much the story of this one
map as it is this bigger picture story
and I thought we'd now dive in and look
at some of the background of the map
from the big-picture perspective first
title is a good place to start this is a
universal cosmography and that title
right away signals to people that this
isn't just a picture of the world in
isolation it's a picture of the world at
the sin
the medieval cosmos which was not the
same as the cosmos that we imagined
today in the Middle Ages people imagined
the cosmos in the way that it had been
imagined since antiquity and in effect
it was a set of concentric spheres you
had the earth at the center which was
stationary and then you had this
ever-widening set of spheres around it
there were the material elements first
Earth was the heaviest so everything
collapsed in on the earth then there was
water which was the ocean wrapping the
wrapping the earth and then after that
there was a sphere of air and developing
everything then they surmised that there
must be a sphere of fire because fire
when you lit it it rose up it was
lighter than air then you had all of the
spheres of the planets the sphere of the
Moon the sphere of the Sun the planets
and then ultimately one giant sphere at
the top or at the outside circumference
wheeling around holding all of the stars
and the different motions of all these
spheres created the motions of the
heavens it's actually not a bad way of
guessing about the motions of the
heavens if you assume that the earth is
still the earth at the center of things
often was broken up into these three
parts this is what's called a teo
diagram you see it in countless medieval
texts and the teo name I think is pretty
obvious
you've got the Oh which is the ocean
surrounding the known world and then you
got this T in the middle the T actually
represents bodies of water as well this
T the stem of the T is the Mediterranean
separating Europe from Africa and then
these two top parts of the TR rivers
separating Asia from Africa and Asia
from Europe East is at the top so here
we've got one kind of mapping tradition
in which North is not at the top in the
in the Middle Ages and particularly in
Christian Europe East was at the top of
a lot of maps and there are a lot of
good reasons for people to assume that
that's the right way to map East is
where the Sun rises so that seems to be
where time begins East is also where in
the biblical tradition the Garden of
Eden is planted on earth and human
history begins Asia is the biggest
continent so you have all of these
reasons that made East seem like an
enduring powerful thing - at the top of
the map that legacy still survives today
you know when you
talk about orienting yourself what
you're doing is you saying got to get
teased at the top and then we can figure
it all out when people began to study
these maps more recently in the 19th and
20th centuries they a lot of them
decided that oh you know people must
have understood that the world was flat
because this map makes the world look
flat forget that that's that's a myth
that just doesn't seem to die Washington
Irving actually helped pedal it in a
biography of Columbus and in the 1820s
but there was evidence dating way back
to antiquity that people always knew the
world was round you've got lots of
ancient authors conjecturing about the
circumference of the earth circumference
and getting it pretty close to right you
got coins showing the earth as a globe
this is the Emperor Augustus before you
know a couple of decades BC showing his
global Empire clearly as a globe you've
got medieval texts that had very simple
proofs even for laypeople that the world
is round this one demonstrates that if
you're on a boat if you're on the top of
a mast you can see land approaching
before you can see it on the deck of the
ship that's because of the curvature of
the earth that's what this is designed
to prove this comes from a book called
the sphere so everybody knew the world
was round just forget the world is flat
stuff even when it comes to the Columbus
story Columbus knew the world was round
everybody else knew the world was round
that's not why they mocked him they
mocked him because his ideas of sailing
from Europe to Asia were so implausible
as we all know now it's employ if he
hadn't bumped into the new world he
would have disappeared forever so the
people who laughed at him were right
this conventional three-part world that
you see again and again was used in
religious texts it was used in
geographical text it was using
encyclopedias it was a kind of scholarly
theological diagram of the world there
were variations on the theme and just
spend a minute on one of them this is
also a tÃ­o map you can see this top
circle this is Asia Europe and Africa
surrounded by the sphere of the ocean
but then on the other side of the ocean
down here in the West remember East is
at the top is this weird semicircle
this map dates from about the 10th
century what what the semicircle is is a
hypothetical fourth part of the world
not showing you this to say that
Europeans had definitive knowledge of
the Americas at this point just to show
you that there was a strong tradition in
the Middle Ages dating back to antiquity
of speculating about the existence of
some great landmass across the ocean to
the west of the known world and here you
can see it in visual form it's it's a
funny scheme to look at if you haven't
looked at these before but if you rotate
it you can actually start to see the
world as we know it coming into focus
you've got a jover on the right you're
up in africa in the middle and then
across what we would call the atlantic
today you've got this fourth part of the
world so keep that in mind as we travel
toward the vault similar map because
it's a scheme that's obviously going to
come into play these teo maps really
were everywhere and by the time the
twelve hundreds or so arrive when the
book starts you see them being used in
lots of symbolic ways you see them for
example in form like this this is christ
crucified on top of a teo map and the
symbolism is great now the tea that's in
the middle of the map isn't just
symbolizing bodies of water that keep
the parts of the world apart it's now
symbolizing the cross that allows christ
to bring the whole world together
you see political symbolism as well this
is a holy roman emperor frederick the
first who's in that kind of standard
european pose of a ruler holding a globe
in scepter and again he's holding a
globe and that globe if you look
carefully is divided up just like a tÃ­o
map labeled a Jay Europe in Africa and
that symbolism is pretty great too he's
saying you know I'm a ruler I'm gonna
extend my reach right around the whole
world and I can have the world in my
hand political and religious symbolism
of this sort come together in the twelve
hundreds in a series of really cool very
elaborate and symbolic medieval maps of
the world often called map by Mundi
Latin for maps of the world this is a
good representative example and we could
talk about this map alone for an hour
and obviously we can't so I'm just going
to zero in on a couple of things about
it that pertain to the Volta Mullen map
at the top in the east you've got this
figure of
a kind of divine representative who is
gazing down at the world he's the only
figure this map is telling you as a
lowly earthbound Christian who can see
the world as a whole the divine mind is
the only one that can comprehend all of
creation that can comprehend not only
space but time in his right in his left
hand he's got a tÃ­o globe I don't know
how you can see that but it's there and
once you start seeing these things you
look at Cathedral windows you see them
they're everywhere he's he's hovering
right above the Rising Sun this is the
East remember here's the sphere of water
right below the Rising Sun is a little
cute Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden
so human history is beginning in the
east as well the geography the scheme
that we're looking at on this map is
basically a tÃ­o map the green at the
outside of the circle is the ocean
surrounding the known world then Asia is
at the top here Europe and Africa
separated by this T of water so it's a
basic tÃ­o map that's then been
elaborated pretty radically and what
this map really is is a map of history
as much as it is of time and this is
this is the story of human history
particularly Christian human history
kind of projected on to a geographical
backdrop and that's an important
distinction to make because maps in the
Middle Ages sometimes were called
histories and in fact history's tech
history texts were sometimes called Maps
the boundaries between what was a map
and what was a history weren't nearly as
distinct as they are today
this map is operating on a couple of
different levels that's something that
we've lost in modern mapping in a lot of
ways again until you guys have started
playing with it is this idea that maps
can can show you more than just
geography that's why this kind of map is
so interesting but as a practical guide
to geography it's it's not useful if you
squint at it hard you can start to make
out the parts of the world you know
here's a job here this is Italy a little
Peninsula but it's not it's hard to do
however at the time this kind of map was
being made another entirely different
mapping traditional was coming into its
own made by sailors
sailors charts which arrived on the
scene and about the 1100s and it's kind
of amazing when you've been looking at
medieval maps like these made by
scholars and monks and then you start
looking at sailors charts it's like you
just put on a pair of glasses suddenly
the world snaps into focus and you
recognise everything this isn't a chart
that sailors would have used this is an
ornamental copy but I've chosen it
because it gives you a very good sense
of what sailors charts did the first
thing is that it shows the Mediterranean
basin these maps were made by European
sailors who wanted to make their way
around the Mediterranean and out into
the Atlantic a bit and then even down
the African coastline just a bit there
crisscross with these lines locks of
drums rum lines are called
and the idea was that if you wanted to
get from let's say up here in Italy down
to North Africa you'd find the line that
best correspond to the course he wanted
to sail then you drag it over here with
your compass dividers to the compass
rose and then with the help of a compass
was a which was another new technology
at the time you could sail across open
water even if you couldn't see the stars
so that led to the ability to sail more
quickly from place to place you didn't
have to hug the shoreline shore lines
though are the other feature that's very
characteristic of these maps sailors
didn't care about anything except the
coast lines all of this stuff here
what was this is these are ornamental
pictures that are drawn for whoever the
recipient of this map was and I should
just pause and say that this map
although it looks like it's oriented
with Norse at the top actually isn't
you'd think so because of all these
people down here but if you have a look
at this little guy up here
he's completely upside down that's
because these maps were made to be
rotated and point them and in the
direction that you want to go so again
here's the second kind of mapping
tradition that doesn't have north as a
natural top if you look at a real
sailors chart you can get a better sense
of what was important and what we're
looking at is the exact same region that
we were looking at that last map
all you can see is coastlines if you
look carefully at Italy you can see
better what I'm talking about very
typical of sailors charts is that they
have these place names just press
together perpendicular to the coastline
and they define the coastline in a way
that's very accurate and unlike what you
see on the medieval map by Mundi it's
only with the arrival of sailors charts
that you start to have people describing
Italy as a boot before that Europeans in
the literature usually described it as
an oak leaf people knew it was a kind of
vague peninsula shape but it's only the
arrival of the sailors chart that makes
people see the world differently and
that leads to people sort of riffing on
it one of the very first people to talk
about Italy as a boot was the poet
Petrarch in the 1300s and what he says
is after having looked at sailors charts
he knew them well he says Oh Italy I can
see you here you're like a boot with
your heel about to crush those Greek
legs he didn't like the Eastern
Christians in the Greeks so now the
ability to see the world differently
gives you a feeling of power gives you a
feeling of visualizing and in fact
controlling the world and that's a theme
obviously that runs through the whole
history of cartography it was an
appealing way of looking at the world
and that's why you get these ornamental
copies pretty quickly that are made not
for sailors but for kings and noblemen
and wealthy merchants who just want to
gaze at this expanded and newly accurate
vision of the world
the problem with sailors charts though
is that they're all based on just
point-to-point observation you know
you're over here you want to take a
sighting of over there you sketch in
what you're doing doesn't take into
account the curvature of the earth it's
fine
for the Mediterranean which only
occupies a small portion of the globe
but when it comes to sailing across
large bodies of ocean of ocean or
mapping a much larger portion of the
globe you get more and more distortion
and they become less and less useful at
the time that this map was made though
you get a third independent strand of
mapping tradition that returns to Europe
after a long absence these are the maps
of Ptolemy the ancient
Greek sage who in the second century had
written a book called the geography and
in the geography Ptolemy in in effect
laid out the the kind of mapping that we
do or know best today latitude and
longitude and he also described how you
could construct three mathematical grids
projections onto which you could plot
coordinates and take into account the
curvature of the earth
this portrait of Ptolemy also appears on
the top of the vault similar map the
basic idea as it was presented in texts
of the time was that you would take
sightings of the stars in particularly
the pole star and that would give you
your latitude your latitudes just the
angular height of the pole star you'd
estimate distances east-west you do a
little bit of fancy astronomy if you
thought you were good at it
longitude was obviously really hard to
predict at that point and determine
accurately but people tried and then you
take your lines of latitude and
longitude and you would cross them this
helpful little picture shows you and
that would give you a coordinate place
on the map once you had coordinates you
could choose one of Ptolemies map
projections and plot all your points on
the map projection and you'd start to be
able to connect the dots Ptolemy in the
geography collected about 8,000
coordinates way more information than
anybody had ever gathered before or
after whether he actually made maps
along with his text isn't clear if he
did they were lost copyists who copied
texts over the centuries were fine at
copying words but they certainly
couldn't reproduce images in any kind of
reasonable and accurate way so they were
lost but it didn't matter because when
Ptolemies geography returned to europe
in about 1400 in effect people have the
information digitized at all those
coordinates and and they could plot all
those coordinates on one of the grids
that Ptolemy taught them how to
construct connect the dots coloring the
the whole thing and almost like magic
you'd have a vision of the ancient world
reassembled for you before your eyes
this vision of the world which has
Europe appear North Africa here and Asia
here was hugely important and
influential in the 1400s in Europe this
was the beginning of the Renaissance and
the whole engine of the Renaissance was
the reviving of the ancient world and
here you've got in one fell swoop a
visualization of that process here's the
ancient world like magic after it's been
lost early scholars were particularly
excited because they were puzzling their
way through all sorts of texts with all
these strange place names that were lost
you know Caesar's campaigns of Gaul he's
mentioning all these places that nobody
knows about how how they correspond to
modern places well all of a sudden here
you've got a world map and then a bunch
of regional maps that went along with
this that give you all those place names
so now people can actually work on
reassembling knowledge of the ancient
world and understanding ancient texts by
the middle of the 1400s though people
began to realize that Ptolemy had given
them not just a vision of the past but
also a way of seeing the future and a
very powerful tool they could using
Ptolemy and using mathematics start to
do what on medieval maps they were they
had been told only God could do that is
kind of back away and see the world as a
whole
Ptolemy mapped about 180 degrees he
started over here in the Canary Islands
at the zero Degree point and ended at
180 degrees over here so the vision the
field of vision has radically expanded
and you start to have people feeling
that maybe it's possible for any
earthbound human to see the world as a
whole in effect to do this to take the
globe as a whole look at it from a
distance like only God had been able to
do previously and start to render it on
a flat piece of paper it was a very
powerful idea and you start to see
people kind of waxing very philosophical
about it in the in the second half of
the 15th century you see and you also
see references to people kind of getting
together and gathering just to look at
Ptolemies maps in exactly the way I can
say from firsthand experience people
have these days gathered around a
computer to look at Google Earth I mean
the analog to me is very very striking
and you see see statements like this
this great work raises us above the
of an earth obscured by clouds
demonstrating how we can circle all or
part of the world pilgrims through the
colors of a flat parchment substitute
you know computer for parchment and
you've got the same kind of idea and you
see images like this all of a sudden
people are now imagining that they can
see the world almost from space
this is Ptolemies map kind of
artistically drawn on to half a boat
which is what which is the range that he
covered it was a very very powerful idea
the map shows Europe over here North
Africa here Asia over here there are a
lot of inaccuracies and even though
these maps were made well into the
sixteenth century and beyond
people retained the inaccuracies even
though they knew that for example North
Africa didn't look anything like that or
that Scotland didn't bend to the east
like that that's because people were
making Ptolemaic maps just as much as a
historical document they wanted to show
you what the ancient world looked like
not what the modern world looked like so
keep that in mind as well one of the
features of Ptolemies world that was a
big bummer for Europeans was that he
showed China coming down and joining
Africa under the Indian Ocean Europeans
at this point had been obsessed with
sailing around Africa and getting into
the Indian Ocean well here Ptolemy is
suggesting that you can't do it big
problem but Ptolemy didn't say that he
knew what the world looked like and he
in fact actively encouraged readers to
go out and explore more of the world and
revise the picture of the world using
his mapping system and that's what
Europeans did in the 15th century in
particular they decided they'd go back
to books by Marco Polo and others which
had been read primarily as kind of fairy
tales almost and they concocted a kind
of imaginary vision of the Far East
based on those they bumped the world
maybe another 90 degrees out beyond
ptolemies limit and then Europeans
throughout the course of the century
sailed their way all the way down the
coast of Africa well below Ptolemies
limits and in 1489 they made their way
right to the southern tip raising hopes
that in fact they could sail into
the European into the Indian Ocean hence
the name the Cape of Good Hope hope now
was alive again that was fourteen eighty
nine and in 1490 you start to see maps
like this one I don't know how well you
can see it the map itself is very poorly
preserved can you see it at all no
that's too bad well I'll just skip it
but I'll tell you that the map shows a
kind of hypothetical version of the Far
East is that any better that's a little
bit better bigspy silence and then
Africa over here the point being is that
you can now sail all the way around
Africa and into the ocean big news
thanks this is only two years before
Columbus so this vision of the world is
which nobody had ever done and we proved
to take years and would be very very
expensive or he could just sail from
Europe around that implied 90 degrees on
the back of the map China that's seem
like an easier thing to do that's what
he decided to do and in fact when he
made his first voyage he sailed across
the ocean bumped into a big island is
about what he calculated to be ninety
degrees and then bumped into a mainland
so not actually surprising that he
concluded he reached Asia that's exactly
the vision of the world that he had been
conditioned to expect to see Vespucci
also believed he was sailing along the
coastline
of South America of Asia as well I'm
sorry I could ask somebody to turn that
down just for one more what happened
when you when you look at the sailors
charts that dates from the time of
Vespucci voyages this is one of the
earliest new world sailing charts to
survive is that Vespucci sail bumped
into the new world over here started
sailing South expecting that it would
take a turn to the west and take him
into the Indian Ocean but it kept going
and going and going below the tip of
Africa and clearly by the time he got
down here it had ended yet so this was
not a show as it appeared on maps which
is why he described it as a new world
this is something that Europeans hadn't
known about Asia I guess goes down to
the south like this it was a chart like
this along with the speeches letters
that eventually made its way to sandy a
divulge in France which is kind of like
a proto mountain view this is where
Martin vult similar and his colleagues
were working on a world atlas a Ptolemy
atlas at the time and they decided that
they were going to halt the work on
their atlas and that they were going to
announce that what Vespucci had been
sailing along was a new world they were
going to produce a map of the whole
world we know their story because they
also in addition to the big map and that
little globe published a book called the
introduction to cosmography and in the
net book they announced first of all
they described the cosmos as we've
talked about it today then they
described the three parts of the known
world as we've talked about today and
then they dropped a little bombshell
they announced these parts Europe Asia
and Africa have now been more widely
explored and a fourth part has been
discovered by Amerigo Vespucci I don't
see why anyone should rightly prevent
this new part from being called America
so there you have it an explanation of
the naming America which is pretty cool
because obviously the other continents
nobody has any idea how those names came
about here it's being named after
somebody in living memory who in fact
was alive at the time and who had no
idea that it was being done but that was
sort of the minor event compared to the
big map and I thought we'd just wrap up
by zooming over this map and exploring
the ways in which the many traditions we
talked about tonight if today all come
together in this one map could start
with the center of the map its Ptolemy
and if particular it's based on this
addition of Ptolemy if you look at the
two parts as they correspond you can see
just how close the correspondence is you
again you've got North Africa Europe the
Mediterranean same thing over here
Volta Miller deliberately decided to
preserve a picture of the ancient world
at the middle of his map people
sometimes criticize the map because it
got Africa wrong that's beside the point
like some of these medieval maps this
map is as much a history as it is a
geography vault similar on this one map
is trying to show you the ancient world
you can imagine in a classroom setting
it would be more useful to have this map
tell you where Odysseus went on his
voyages or where Caesar was in in his
campaigns in Gaul then some map of the
modern world so remember that this is a
map made for educating humanists when it
came to expanding the vision of the
world you can't see it I guess but Volta
Miller borrowed from this map in his
depiction of the Far East and his
depiction of part of the African
coastline and we'll just skip over that
map because you can't see it and then
when it came to the full African
coastline he borrowed from sailors
charts if you take a close-up of West
Africa you can see actually the point at
which he stitches together a sailors
chart and the Ptolemaic version of North
Africa down here on the valta Mullen map
you can see he's crowded together all of
these place nines place names and he's
got a detailed coastline of the sort
that you would find on a sailors chart
up here though you've got North Africa
as Ptolemy might have mapped it where
the place names clearly haven't been
borrowed from a sailors chart so you've
got the point here where he's stitching
these two distinct traditions together
when it comes to the New World the
depiction on this sailors chart is one
that he borrowed from it doesn't look
much like the depiction on the vault
similar map but that's because the
sailors chart isn't a map projection
it's not trying to take into account the
curvature of the earth
if you compensate for that and you
compare a small part North America and
the islands of the Caribbean you can see
how close the correspondence is it's
clear that he's borrowed from that this
is also it has it has a symbolic
dimension it's a universal cosmography
as we talked about and that calls to
mind these medieval maps and evolve
similar in particular plays with this
idea of somebody at the top of the map
seeing the whole world in medieval maps
it was God in the Renaissance which
celebrated the power of the individual
you've got real people looking at the
world as a whole
this is Ptolemy on the left and he's
representing symbolizing the learning of
the Ancients which which Europeans are
now reviving and on the right you've got
Vespucci symbolizing modern scholars and
modern adventurers each of them is
looking at the part of the world that
they map telling him at this part of the
ancient world modern explorers after
Tommy figured out what China looks like
figured out what the new world looked
like for the first time all of a sudden
you've got two parts of the world that
you can piece together with the learning
of the Ancients and the voyages of the
moderns to get a vision of the world
that's accessible to anybody to any
individual earthbound person there's
also a political dimension that is very
seldom talked about but I think is
really cool excuse me this is a German
map it was dedicated to this guy the
Holy Roman Emperor of the German nation
and I don't know if you can see it but
in the back you've got the Imperial
double eagle which looks like this the
double eagle symbolized among other
things the Empire's
east and west looking halves and the and
implied the ambition of the Empire to
span the globe as a whole in the early
1500s you start to see the double eagle
used in unusual ways almost cartographic
ways this is a map that shows you the
constituent parts of the Holy Roman
Empire now you can see this figure of
Christ just like on those medieval maps
bringing the world together you've got
the double eagle heads looking east and
west
I had the copy of the Volta Mela map
above my desk the whole time I was
working and I kept on feeling when I
looked at it that it was like a giant
bird kind of getting ready to take
flight but I never could do anything
with that until I came across these
double eagle images and then I realized
that maybe implicit in the form of the
Boltzmann map was this German double
eagle and I think if you look at this
and then you start to look at the valta
map you can see how that might be
ptolemy and europe are the kind of
central beating heart of the map the two
parts of the world discovered in modern
times are the wings as they lift up and
then you've got the two heads looking
east-west at the top that was a nice
thing too whoops
I don't know what happened there so
that's where we were and that's where we
were oh no sorry
anyway I'll stay there that's a nice
thing to think about but it seemed like
a theory of my own that wasn't really
going to be anything I could confirm
until I came across maps like this which
were produced in the 16th century also
after the vault similar map that
actually do map the world in the form of
an imperial double eagle so I think it's
safe to say that encoded in this map is
a kind of political mention political
reference to the idea of the world as a
German world not something that people
talk about very much but that has
overtones so altogether it was a map
that really stitched together a lot of
Alta Pomona's colleagues took the
traditional idea of a 3-part world added
this kind of symbolic dimension to it
made the core of their map Ptolemy in
the ancient world a kind of historical
vision added to that this modern version
of the world that nobody can see took
information about southern Africa and
about the new world from sailors charts
infused it all with this idea of a
political Empire decided that they could
take stock of all that information and
see the world in a new way and then
overlaid this all with the idea that
maybe the hypothetical fourth part of
the world was a real fourth part of the
world and came up with this map that
we're all here looking at today so thank
you and if anybody hasn't
I'm happy to talk about it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
