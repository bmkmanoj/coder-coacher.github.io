to introduce Carrie here I'll give you
the background we we were I was in
zeitgeist when was that
five months ago yeah May in Europe and
it was in London they have it every year
and that's our big partner for him and
there was a panel in that that was on
innovation and trailblazers I think it
was called and the pail had three
different people on it and but I after
that panel I was so excited you know
that you know first getting here or
somebody that has a Nobel Prize that was
one piece but also of the three speakers
I want to spend more time with you but
you only got one third of that so the
first thing I did afterward was Charles
and I got together and and you know
talked about when we could possibly you
know put something together for Google
because I thought your philosophies the
way that you look at problems and stuff
would be a tremendous benefit to the
people here so thank you very much for
coming it took a long time to arrange
but I'm just so happy that you're here
and before I do anything I better get my
list of notes otherwise I will be lost
so it's nice to be here I've been I'm
totally dependent on Google in my
professional life and also in my
personal life too I use that I mean when
I I'm one of those little billion dots
that pops up all the time and it's
always on so i i i i really appreciate
google seems like a nice place to work
do what do you think pretty nice place
to work good deal they would just say
that because I'm here though I'm pretty
sure so let's let's start at the very
beginning you know one of the things
that was at zeitgeist was there's a
little a little tidbit about your
childhood and how that might be slightly
different from children growing up now
certainly my children for one thing you
know when I was growing up that was a
long time ago and they trusted kids to
like
by dynamite fuse I mean if you you
wanted it you would down it to the
hardware and you bought it and they made
a joke about you know what are you gonna
do blow up a bank or something no we're
gonna launch a frog into space you know
it oh great great you know and you
wouldn't get arrested for that and it's
like you know when we first started we
it turned out you could you can buy all
the kind of things that you need to make
rockets with as a thirteen-year-old boy
you know in South Carolina now I don't
think you can do that in fact if you get
a chemistry set these days or you look
at the chemist where they call chemistry
says there's no chemicals in there it's
safe there's nothing there's no way to
make something it'll explode and there's
no way to launch a frog into space and
it's just I don't know they've taken the
fun out of things because of fear and
insurance companies and all kinds of
stuff and it's a different world than it
was when in in South Carolina in the in
the 50s it was we were encouraged to
like launch frogs into space because
somebody had to beat the Russians you
know
so yeah it was a different world than it
is now I think well I I remember you
told a story about that rocket and how
high that rocket went well it we figured
that it wouldn't alkylated I stopped
being able to see it after about a 1
mile and a half and I was doing that
very kind of like with just a tripod and
a protractor mounted to it to say I last
lost I lost sight of this at that
particular altitude unassuming it went I
mean at that angle and if it went
straight up from where it launched with
usually they did this is how high was
last time I saw it and then a friend of
Mines father heard me talking about it
with him and and he has an airplane so
he flew over our launch site one day and
he said it it went past me at 2 miles it
was a pretty neat rocket you could make
it out we made it out of ya I had just I
had this little manual from place called
Fort Sill which is a rocket base in
Oklahoma or whether they've made guided
missiles or whatever and it said it was
for junior rocket people and it said
don't ever heat a mixture of potassium
chlorate and sugar and just without any
explanation just had that in a little
box down on the bottom and so I'm good
to go
good that's what you call a lead and so
I said I went up to the drugstore to try
to buy some potassium perchlorate and
because we had sugar in the house and
the druggist didn't have any but he had
but I said well what have you got in
terms of like oxidizing things salts of
potassium yeah it's way i potassium
nitrate and so I tried that and I said
well what happens when you heat that you
know and it melts with you when you will
you mix potassium nitrate and sugar and
lots of different ratios and like the
little piles they burn but they don't
burn terribly rapidly but the one that
burns with least residue which is what
you're looking for in a rocket fuel
there's something turn a solid into a
hot gas so the one that burned with the
least residue was about 60% potassium
nitrate by
wait and 40% sugar so that's the one I
said okay and I'll melt that see what
happens
if you melted it it'll it'll catch on
fire eventually it burns much faster but
if you melt it very carefully then it
cools off it comes a solid but the the
two substances have been mixed quite
intimately and also some stuff has gone
on with the sugar chemically but I
didn't know exactly at the time when I
was 13 what that was all about but it
makes it burn a lot better but it makes
it into a really neat kind of a solid
that will stick to the inside of a metal
pipe for one thing so it's and you can
mold it so you can make a hole down
through the middle of it so that when
you when you set it and make you have a
fuse going in there the dynamite fuse
going up through a little nozzle when
you pour it into there as a liquid you
like work it with a with a dowel
so that it leaves a hollow space so that
the the flame the the combustion doesn't
take place from the bottom to the top it
takes place from the inside to the
outside and so I mean you get he just
dart it makes it not only burn a lot
faster but it makes it go which is what
you want to rocket I mean you want to
start off slow and then go faster and
faster and it goes up as the square of
the radius of the thing is it's the area
that's actually combustion so it it was
kind of fun and then you just work with
that as a kid you you could make all
kinds of little things I mean you do
experiments and that's kind of about how
I thought everybody thought you know
that people did experiments when they
wanted to know something most people
asked their old man but like mine wasn't
usually home because he was a traveling
salesman so I had to do experiments to
find out what happens when you when this
happens or that happens and so it was I
I sort of had a nice childhood my mother
felt like she had four boys and she
thought they all needed little private
spaces so we had these four storage
rooms that
she didn't use and one of those was for
each of us and you were allowed to put
like a lock on your door and I had a
little magnetic thing when it I would
slide a magnet up the side of the door
so we knew it pull the nail that's is
that I kept your brothers out of that
yeah so it'd be my private place but I
mean my mother thought you we needed a
private place so it would be like our
little laboratory and whatever that's
great
so so it's a pretty big trip from South
Carolina to Berkeley I think yeah how
that happened well it was from Georgia I
was at Georgia Tech in Atlanta which is
about is like a as serious and
engineering places there is and it was
in 1966 when I graduated from there and
I went from there to Berkeley in 1966
with South Carolina Atlanta Berkeley I
think that last one that last year's the
toughest and I said I realize it I mean
I the reason I ended up at Berkeley was
because somebody's wife who was a social
friend of mine in there said that you
know Carrie when you we're at parties
together and you're trying to get people
to talk about things and they don't want
to talk about that kind of stuff at all
you know well they like to talk about
that kind of stuff at Berkeley that does
beg the question about what you were
talking about it turns out I mean it's
be like philosophical things they're you
know scientific stuff maybe but they
were into science at Georgia Tech they
thought it was a useful adjunct to doing
engineering kind of degree they have
some science but they weren't interested
in like where did that all come from and
what does it what are the big scary
questions and and what are those things
all about you know but what is
consciousness um and that kind of stuff
they were they were into that at
Berkeley because they were experimenting
with it all the time
and
and everything what was that that was
what I liked Berkeley a lot a lot of
things were relaxed there compared to
other places so the so one story that
they had mentioned at zeitgeist was a
was a publication you had done while
you're in graduate school there was off
field so first tell me how you got into
that to chemistry and then and then
about this little side project even I
know you're talking about the
cosmological significance of time
reversal yeah well it it sounds like a
funny thing but it was a nature paper
okay for somebody who is like a second
year graduate student in biochemistry to
write a nature paper with the name like
that and get it published it was quite
an accident actually I think it well
John Maddox was a newly installed editor
of nature at the time I was I was always
interested in things like cosmology and
and you could read about them anywhere
and now you can read about them on you
know you just go to archive X or
archive.org but you could read about
those things in all kind of magazines
and anybody really can think about those
things you don't have to be an old
astrophysicist to be a cosmologists I
mean my feeling that cosmology was for
one thing things don't have it I think
my brother and I decided when we were 10
that the universe could not possibly
have an end because there would always
be something on the other side of it
where we the end be you know it was here
where you stick your hand right through
it so it didn't seem to me that the
concept that the universe should have a
beginning was real there there was a
good place to start for an astronaut
Astro Astro physical type theory of like
the origin of the universe it doesn't
have an origin obviously I mean that's
the mystery
probably from our point of view but
that's where you have to start and it
can't really have an end in space either
it's got to go on you can't imagine that
the thing would end it just to me it
just seemed unreasonable so I wrote it
down and I tonight and I can put some
things
in there that you know made it
scientific and more cosmological few
formulas and stuff like that a couple of
formulas and and as they publish it by
the first thing you did is you sent it
right back and so I regular eroded a
little bit put one more formula in there
and and I sent it back to them and this
time they sent it out for a review and
the guy made the mistake the reviewer of
saying that this was a little bit too
much relativity for him to like for him
to he didn't say to eat swallow yes he
used the term swallow actually as part
of his review of my paper too much
relativity for him to swallow it and I I
came by said well of what the possible
scientific value can be the aesthetic
pinyon of a single individual in the
present in the in the in the case of
scientific like notions to the other
otherwise like contradictory
implications I think is the word I used
although I had no implications I was
just kind of felt like that sounded good
and Maddox apparently did too so
suddenly it got published and I became
an astrophysicist overnight and like
it's still in there I mean I showed you
in nature right in 1968 it's a it's not
it's not probably you I guess Google's
got a copy of its own oh yeah well
search for it after this and but it's
sort of I still decided become a
biochemist because you know that's like
if you can be a cosmologies just by
writing a paper overnight I mean where
do you go from there you know so and so
I became a biochemist which I thought
was a lot more fun and it's much more
party conversation especially in
Berkeley back then because if you knew
about you know things that were going on
in your brain with regard to chemicals
and how they work in all right you could
you could you were quite popular and
what else have you got in there I think
we should probably end right there no so
so so tell me about the you know one of
the things that I think was especially
at least in the description of PCR was
the was kind of how you thought about it
before how the how the world thought
about DNA at the time and in the process
that you went through and I know you had
like a Eureka moment you know on on that
and that changed the way that you
thought about it in a way that the the
world thought about it and was
eventually recognized but could you hand
time take me through you know that the
transition well I you know the the world
and I were alike in the sense that we
did not until I had this realization
that you could actually amplify it
people weren't looking for a way to make
more DNA they just sort of gotten into
this is about in 1983 it was pretty
clear that DNA was always going to be
that most the the least easily obtained
of the things that were involved in a
DNA type experiment that was going to be
the hardest one a specific DNA sequence
particularly whereas like organisms
usually had like five or ten percent of
DNA in them but not of any particular
sequence and so a whole bunch of
techniques had been developed at cloning
was one of them to deal with the fact
that the to study DNA you really like to
have a lot of in a particular sequence
of it one of them and I was trying to
figure that was true but I I didn't know
how I didn't really had not thought of a
good way to do it but I was trying to do
something else which was just to
determine the sequence at a particular
spot but I was also at the same time
writing computer programs it's like
which I loved this much molecular
biologists weren't right so if you write
you know programs you realize a
reiterative loop it's a really an
important concept in writing computer
programs and yet I mean most most
molecular biologists probably didn't
know what that meant but I had that in
my mind you know if you can figure out
something that can get you into a read
of loop that does something for you
which I had forgot that I mean so when I
mean when I first saw the fact that if I
do this thing over and over again it
will it'll double I mean it will double
the amount of DNA you know in between
the two particular sequences every
single time and so 20 times means about
a million times and 30 times means a
billion and that's about how many
nucleotides there are in the whole DNA
human DNA and so I could take this
process if I guess you know how that
process works now it's just a couple of
things I was working in a laboratory
that would synthesize little pieces of
the nucleotides a little short pieces of
DNA so I had plenty of those and I had
plenty of DNA so I didn't have to buy
anything new actually to test this thing
out once I I thought of it well I was
driving my car which is always a good
thing to do when you're thinking about
new things better than texting people
and stuff like that yeah it's I think
driving a car it keeps your hands busy
and it keeps you sort of from drifting
off you have some part of your hair
that's still available for thinking but
you don't it's like for me it's always
been a good karma kind of thing too it's
either the car of the shower that's the
place I am in a shower to the person
that I am a driver I would drive for
about you know three hours at a time
every weekend to go up to minister you
know I had this little place up there
and so that was a great time to be
thinking about what have I done this
week and what am I gonna do next week in
the lab and nobody would interrupt you
when you were in the in the car so any
that's that's that sort of popped out of
sort of that it was neat the fact that
if I had not been writing computer
programs I think I wouldn't have
recognized a loop right away and said
hey that's a loop that's that's a that's
a you could an index that thing and you
could like do it over and you don't have
to do the third or the fourth cycles of
a loop you just write down n is equal to
n plus one and then he goes again and
not saying you could do that same thing
you know laboratory isn't in an
automated machine which
well even after you had done that you
know from what I had read that not a lot
of people believed it right well it you
know people don't believe things usually
for the right reasons you know and the
reason they didn't believe this was
because of the fantastic result of it
not because any one of the steps was was
unlikely to work because the reason they
had employed me at Cedars in the first
place was to make oligonucleotide that
would in fact be extendable on a DNA
template and I was saying well you just
here's another way of doing it you know
you're extending it on to at the same
time but you're doing it with the same
enzyme and what you can do once you can
do twice and you can do it three times
and so what I wasn't asking for anything
new it shouldn't have been this will not
work because if it does it'll put my lab
out of business if it works I'm in
trouble
if this works what the hell am I going
to do why do we need to clone DNA yeah
if I can just want in one afternoon I
can amplify it all up and do it without
cloning it without you know the smells
of bacteria or their spells and well
didn't I think that was the real
resistance to it at sea this was the
result of it will be this and therefore
the way it works must be wrong that
that's the way people a lot of people
make their decisions about things based
on those kind of you know and they do
that unconsciously probably they don't
realize they're just responding to
something that's not got anything to do
with what they're talking about it's a
good thing to do the this this also had
implications pretty quickly at the speed
at which you could run tests and other
things didn't well yeah I mean it took I
think we had just finished cloning a
gene at Cedars that took 40 people six
months you know and I chose that is one
of those little models I was gonna say I
can do that in one afternoon by myself
now because I know the sequence is at
the ends so in some of these tests for
things like maybe it'll sell it may know
itself work it made that work and then
turned into all the you know the DNA
evidence kind of thing and the fact that
you can trace that DNA in all kind of
organisms back and watch it you know you
got a dinosaur around here somewhere I
don't know if we got the whole sequence
of dinosaurs yet but we probably will
well I think I saw it in a movie you
know yeah well they took drastic mark
certainly thought that we could do it so
we must be able to do is of it you know
build it on a frog's scaffolding I think
it's lather use we probably use a
chicken today so so you didn't stop
there or I obviously your career you
know when I'm in a bunch of different
directions well I you don't I guess you
don't get to decide to stop if you I
don't ever just I didn't ever decide to
start and I haven't stopped there i
thing I've been working on the with
charlie air for but you know for a
couple of years with Charlie but for
about ten years before that was totally
different it has to do with making um
trying to reach might come up with a new
method I come and come up with the
method already but it's making drugs
that will like be effective against all
the bacteria that are now the shaking
off their the whole that are antibiotics
had on them and this this new method is
sorry it's a very empirical kind of
thing that where you you find a psyched
some kind of an interesting feature on
on an exterior protein on some bacteria
that's giving you a lot of trouble like
say Staphylococcus aureus right now is a
good target and you find a unique thing
something on something on the outside of
that that that you can model with a
little peptide because it's a part of a
protein and you make uh peptide
synthetically and then you you select
using that peptide you select from from
a mixture that contains maybe ten to the
eleventh different DNA sequences that
you can make now on a machine
easily and you only get one molecule of
each one but you can make about 10 to
the 11 sequences and you know select
from those ones that will bind to the
site that you have selected on the
organism or to the model of it that a
peptide is and then you you do PCR on
that one molecule and you amplify it up
to where you have now enough of them to
be able to read the sequence of it and
from that you can synthesize it large in
large amounts and now that becomes a
specific little label that you can but
if you swallowed it and it was
stabilized so that it wouldn't go away
and you're in your cells
I mean in your interesting the fluid
intercellular fluid if you stabilize it
then that thing will attach itself to
like say if you've made it to a protein
on staph aureus that old catch to staff
or if staff is in your body now if you
chemically attached to the DNA sequence
that that kind of DNA sequence is called
an Optima now it has something to do
with fitting because this is this
sequence of that a primer fits on to
some molecule that you've chosen for it
to fit and so if you if you don't attach
to that app tumour a little label that
is something you're already very immune
to you have a lot of immune like
molecules like antibodies to this other
molecule you attach that molecule to
this you've not attached that molecule
that you're already immune to to
something that will grab on to the staff
and so it you become immune to the staff
and that's how the system sort of works
and so we're we're working out the
ramification it's not as easy as doing
PCR was because you got to use animals
and diseases and people that know about
diseases and all that kind of stuff so
we're having on fine time finding
collaborators around the world that'll
help us do that and but it's working and
and it's a simple idea thank you
so it's the thing has worked in lots of
cases and now we're we're sort of
pursuing it in a commercial sense when
we get it to convince you have some
success with anthrax there yeah we did
we cured anthrax with some people that
work the Whedon because I won't come
near anthrax and then at Brooks Air
Force Base that we collaborated with
these guys that have been working on
anthrax for quite a while and it it
cured anthrax 100% which is better than
40% which is the numbers you get if you
use like penicillin kind of like suffice
it bro is a drug of choice there but if
if you get anthrax inhalational e and
you know you've got it and you give
yourself this drug to get a 40% chance
and this with our drug just 100% so it's
better you would choose our drug and but
you're not going to get it there's a
whole lot of people in the world still
they were fighting World War two still
and one of the things that we ended
World War two I'm note was yeah we might
want to poison our enemies with
biological molecules are either with
organisms and we really aren't going to
do that but there's a lot of government
money available to do those kinds of
things they like to defend against them
and that's how we ended up with anthrax
I don't see a lot of anthrax you know
what's that did they fund your research
yeah the research done at Brooks was
already being funded I thought we just
win and I said why don't you use this
method and we supplied them with the DNA
the same guy that actually brought a DNA
synthesizer over to my lab that when I
was working at Cedars Ron cook who has a
company called bio search so we were
making camp before I invented PCR I was
making chemically oligo nucleotides and
in ron was a friend of mine who had
tried to make a machine that would do it
and he finally got one that worked he
brought it into my way
leaving me with nothing to do and so I
invented PCR
and which improves the Olga nucleotide
business by about a million fold which
run was in the old nucleotide business
that was it good they didn't need to
sell people machines anymore but so it
was right happy about that yeah yeah he
was happy because he sold them y'all
look at nucleotides is so good that's
great so so obviously a lot of people
here are computer scientists and and I'm
interested in your you know how you
think the ideas in computer science
computation large-scale systems I mean
do you think if I gave you you know a
hundred thousand machines do you think
that would help you or do you think that
matters do you think it's a hundred
thousand machines
what kind of mission other computers and
stuff oh I mean why you notational okay
like when you're but this is something
that I do this I mean there are people
that do it with computers but I do it
with computers at the level of say if
somebody's got an x-ray structure
chemical the absolute X ray structure of
some protein that's on the surface say
if something like Pseudomonas aeruginosa
which is another organism that we have
to worry about because it it infects the
lungs of humans that are compromised in
certain ways and and it's also developed
immunity to our like resistance to our
antibiotics so where I use computers in
there is like you go to a program that's
like on the net already where people
have have the structural details of say
surface proteins from Pseudomonas
aeruginosa you just look that up and
they're cute little approach that like
programs available now where you know
you reach in there and grab the molecule
and you can turn it and rotate it
whatever you want to and stuff and and
one of them that I just recently
discovered that I really like it and
then you could point at you say I can
that little piece sticking out right
there that little loop that looks like a
piece of that protein that's on the
surface of this molecule of this
bacteria that would be accessible from
this
I mean from out in the liquid and it
would it's sticking out so you can you
know that it's from somebody writing a
really cool computer program that takes
these these little numbers and turns
them into a picture of the thing that
you can get in there and manipulate I
just love that thing if I can say all
right let's grab that little lip and
turn it around like they say does that
look available yeah it does you know and
it's something that I know there's a lot
of computer programming involved in that
but I don't have to do that because I've
already got the program there but it
means I can I can easily pick a
substance or something on the surface of
a protein that it says that that's on
the surface of you bacteria that you
don't want that's how I pick them and
it's like I mean you could probably
write a program to replace me there but
it says the the the the interface
between the xr8 structural data and the
user like me has been so well refined
now by computer programmers that I can
just you know I can do what with it's
like it's so much faster if you can see
something and you can move it to sort of
pick through it and say here's a good
site and you don't even know all the
time I don't know if I had to write down
all the things I was looking for for a
site that would be cool
I don't even have a nice little
checklist I just sort of do it
intuitively because somebody has
designed a really cool over him that
somebody like me that can just reach in
and start playing with molecules they do
that for a lot of things you know I'm
not just the things that I'm working on
but it's a really I mean I really
appreciate that whole area of like
visualizing and and then allowing me to
actually manipulate like moving to take
two molecules and stick them to you know
push them together in a computer I mean
they have things that they can you can
do that now and it's really an
incredible amount of like computation
that's going on in there to do that
but it's tough that I don't even have to
know what it is I just have this little
molecule here
this molecule it does that's been fit
anywhere on it you know it's really a
kind of it's very I don't know how many
people in in computer graphics it took
to do all that but they've really I
think it's been fun for a number of
people because they've definitely made a
very good sort of interface between
chemists and the chemicals that they
work with and it's in I mean those guys
probably don't know much about the
chemistry at all but they don't have to
let me guess
but they've made this really cool thing
I appreciate that you guys did it
there's probably a few people that have
done visualizations once or twice here
no doubt about that so what do you I if
this is successful if your current
effort which obviously seems like the
hardest more difficult thing that you've
done and probably harder than PCR and
lots of different dimensions much harder
but what do you what do you think the
future of our ability to to basically
you know get rid of some of these really
horrible diseases alright it's it's I
think it it's there I mean that the the
the idea here is that you really don't
need to poison the organism you just
need to reveal it to an immunity that
you already have against something else
right you turn it in basically you fool
your own immune system in a way but
you're you're you're by having this kind
of like control at the molecular level
of things you can put your finger in
there where you're not supposed to and
you can mess around with it then you can
improve it because your immune system is
amazing that way I mean that it works at
all
but with us directing it it'll go a lot
farther and things like there's all
kinds of immunity problems that people
have but the biggest one I mean what I'm
trying to approach right now it's just
like if you get exposed to something a
lot of times you don't make an immune
response just to everything so you need
to be you need to be in the executive
seat in a sense and say we want to kill
this thing right now
today you know and and I can make
chemicals that are directions for you to
do that with but I have I need to have
that kind of information the input from
like knowing this bacteria that you
don't like happens to have this
structure on the outside of it and you
can you can use that as a way of
pointing that bacteria out to the immune
system immune system that's got a lot of
functions it's got a whole lot of tanks
and a lot of serious equipment that's
going to waste because it's it was made
for one disease and then once that
disease is wiped out it's not useful
anymore
you can't take an immune response and
retool it and that's what this is what
for this system that we're working on
does it take takes immune responses that
you already have that are more or less
they're useful to you but they they can
be much more so if you can't if you can
go in and change the the guts of them in
a sense to say you take the take the
guns and point them at this thing
instead of saying the way the immune
system works now if you get some new
organism that you're supposed to be
immune to you have to say now I have to
raise a whole new army and I have to
train it and I have to do you know
rather than just saying ship a few of
these guys over here and tell them to
point their weapons at that thing
that'll make that make make a big change
in the way we become immune to things if
we don't have to go through the process
of becoming immune to every new threat
we are we just use an immunity that we
already have that's what will make a big
difference but it costs you a lot of
energy to make a new immune response and
every time you do you have collateral
damage because an immune response is not
absolutely specific so we're trying to
Mozilla or worse on some I there's some
things are really really resistant to
the new approach well I think the things
the thing nothing right now has shown
that it's resistant to it but there are
things to see that the thing about being
resistant to antibiotics is there's a
reason for how come
you know bacteria learn how to avoid
them and and and this this doesn't have
that element because they don't they
haven't learned how to avoid your whole
immune system they've just avoided they
just learned how to avoid this one
little antibiotic this is not this is
sort of like going back behind the
curtain of the immune system and
sticking your hands back through and say
okay now we're going to change some
settings and and so that it's not
something that the bacteria is going to
be expecting the vision I get in my mind
is your your you know the guns are
trained to look for other guns and
you're painting guns on you know all
right that's what you're doing is you
you're putting your painting little
targets on things that you would like
your immune system to take care of and
your muse isn't quite capable did as
soon as it figures out this is a target
right it's it strains it something
missing any any any power it has playing
it has all the power you could possibly
trust some system to have in your body
you wouldn't want to give it anymore you
certainly wouldn't want to have the
immune system be able to do this by
itself you wouldn't want to have it
change an immunity because as a new
immunity is developed there's all kind
of checks and balances to make sure you
don't become immune to your own heart or
something oh all right so we're going
beyond what the immune system is capable
of doing and what you would trust your
immune system to do because we're saying
we already know what the structure is
that this thing and we're going to make
something that goes to get that and it
will make the decisions that otherwise
we're made by sort of like rote or by
like you know trial and error kind of
things in the immune system well this is
God it excite you because there's so
many you know things like cancer and
things like that that we end up having
poison bodies for that you think
thinking about cancer more than me you I
start with simple like bacteria
it's I mean the immune system is what
keeps you from having cancer in the
first place yeah so it's it's possible
that that'll be a that's this will open
up a toe area well that's fantastic so
stepping back a little bit there's been
a lot of talk on
you know the the decline of math and
sciences and the decline of our ability
to you know do math and scientists as a
country and things like that and you've
obviously got a lot of experience in
math and science has been really central
to you so you know how do you think from
a global perspective on math and science
education and you know research and
development
you know dollars and things like that it
seems kind of strange that you have to
go to the Defense Department for this
particular research well you know if you
read it by the way we went to the
pursuit fence Department for the
internet too so I mean I'm not I'm
reading a book right now about the
Middle Ages and sort of the how like
science sort of first got inserted into
into the world and it was it was
basically through military I mean they
were always still military stuff going
on it's like you know where the the cool
big machines like the trebuchet things
that was blowing up people I mean
smashing in their walls I mean I think
the military always has that that it's
always over supplied with the kind of
stuff that scientific minded people
engineering kind of scientific minded
people need so they just happen to have
it it's hard it's it's hard to explain
to them what it is that they have
sometimes it's a weird thing that we're
doing we're dealing with that still
today getting government grants right
and so you it's the easiest if you can
if you can explain it to them in the in
the sense of like some horrible country
might use this against us you know don't
you want to be argument is much better
than you know solving you know all my
just suffering people and we will screw
them I mean we're just worried about
whether they're gonna drop stuff on
Manhattan you know and what are we gonna
do about it
and and fortunately if you convince them
and I you don't have to do these the the
military is totally convinced that some
big country is going to drop
bacteria on us so they're willing to
fund that kind of thing you know but
really I mean the purpose for that is is
to keep people from having all kind of
horrible diseases yeah that's great well
it's good that there's a there's a very
positive side effect associated with
with that so it is I mean it doesn't
come from the nicest places that humans
have but it definitely is a positive
side effect oh yeah no I'm willing to
spend almost any anybody's money for
good things no no no problem there so
one of the things that I thought was
interesting in the zeitgeist is just you
know kind of innovation and thought and
the way you think about problems and you
know how you think differently about
problems and you know you know one of
the things that you talked about was
kind of the incremental approach versus
a you know other approaches I mean I
think the reason you've been successful
as you've thought differently but you
know well I I do happen to like not
really care where the idea goes I mean
I'm not really trying to when I'm
starting to think about something I
think about it and it's some same way an
engineer would actually which is more
like how do you fix this thing I mean
what would you do and I I I think that
also I'm not really worried about I I
don't know why but I'm not really
worried about what people think might
think of me you know it's coming it's
been to my advantage to be that way I
don't know it's it's very I think in our
genes in a sense to like keep our head
down like if you can think I imagine a
row of guys 2 million years ago walking
across the savannas of northern Africa
like hunting and stuff and you didn't
want to stick your head up too high you
want to kind of get down behind the guy
in front of you and because you might
get killed or eaten or whatever if you
make of sort of a noise or of like a
spectacle of yourself so we had this
really strong kind of need to let follow
and we don't it's not terribly conscious
but keeping your head down below like
the the line of fire
is a a it and it it works its way up
into like what will you do as a
professional scientist in terms of what
are you going to work on this month
you know and it's there's a there's a
whole lot of there's a real conservative
sort of a know we can't do something
that would be totally ridiculous that
people haven't done you know that's not
it's it's sort of like you want to do
something that that what people haven't
done but it's got to be sort of in the
line of things that they have done you
can't go against you know the the
general concepts that are floating
around in the field and so I sort of I'm
sort of a contrarian kind of a person I
guess my mother gave me a little true is
he a contrarian kind of person I believe
we have first-hand evidence I think it
helps to have a few people like me
around it to say I don't like any of
this and here's a better way to do that
one something like that and and I think
heaven heaven had had the opportunity to
be an experimentalist at the age of ten
you know was was a handy thing to have
it taught me a certain amount of
confidence in myself and I mean there's
lots of people like me there's not as
many of them as there could be so let's
follow up on that because I you know who
are the people that influenced you who
are the people that you look up there I
know you do a lot of reading and you you
know like history I read mainly for like
not who they are but like what they're
saying I usually forget who they were
the thing that inspires me to do stuff
is the stuff itself you know the fact
that you can do experiments you don't
have to ask somebody is it okay what
would happen if I did this you just do
it and find out and and I think I was
sort of I was bred that way somehow and
I was always doing and then I think
that's the most scientists have
something about that in them but a lot
of them pay a whole lot more attention
to like the the top the guy it's like
who's getting the most press attention
or who's getting this review
and you and and what does Francis
Collins think about this you know what
would would he fund this kind of thing
and and I think I'm I'm more driven by
the the fact does that tie into the
funding side too because of that you
know I mean yeah you know you after I
find myself begging people for money
yeah this is a strange thing I mean how
can you be as successful as you've
obviously been successful and have to
beg for money that we with reviewers
that have been a lot less successful and
I know in the computer science there are
some people I know that are as you know
you know have had the most contributions
of anybody I won't name names here but
they're begging for money in ways that
it makes no sense to me i I don't like
it that's always the way it seems to be
the guys I mean the people that control
things that run the big big funding
agencies know is that those people are
not themselves personally terribly
creative or reliable even in a sense of
producing things and so how would your
peers look at you I mean do they come do
they still do they still hate you from
things but one of the nicer things they
think about me is that I'm a lunatic
they have to admit that some of the
things I've done it's worked yeah so but
they don't have to admit that the next
thing I'm going to work on so you kits
that you can play max around yeah that
is the truth it's not it must have been
good luck before like is not some crazy
you know this was not gonna do anything
good so yeah I would I would have
thought that now I mean I'm 65 years old
and I'm still working you know I was
thought to be real easy to get funding
you know I take somebody like Charlie
Company across from one and they're like
say okay we'll put a few bucks on this
but not everybody I mean we spent a long
time with this idea probably ten years I
guess not on anymore
but haven't we spent a long time trying
to get somebody to fund it and all he's
getting money from like say from DARPA
they were willing to put up money at
first you know again they have a
military angle yeah that was funny you
talked about the experimental
experimentalist because I was talking to
my daughter about this this morning
because my dad and I laughed a long T
this is you know 20 years ago there was
a Dear Abby article and the Dear Abby
article was somebody wrote in and said
you use less water in a shower or in a
bath and so Dear Abby consulted hundreds
of experts and then the expert said this
and my dad just looked at me and says
why don't you just put a stopper in you
know I don't take a shower look at the
amount of water take a bath but nobody
is it's funny people don't think that
way yeah I think that way that was
immediately my response to that put a
stopper in the way you know is that
enough to take a bath oh yeah so yeah
the audience have any questions you know
I go ahead you want to use a microphone
here
there's a couple high-profile people in
the bio field and the other one I was
thinking of as craig Venter how would
you compare yourself to him in terms of
the arcs of your career well Craig is I
like Craig but I mean it's in spite of
the fact that my very first experience
with him was down in it was I think we
were in Hilton Head South Carolina at a
meeting and after the meeting was over a
bunch of us decided to go skinny-dipping
out in the ocean out in front of this
hotel where the meeting was that and I
Craig decided it would be a good idea to
steal our clothes because it was very
embarrassing between the ocean and our
rooms where more clothes could have been
found was a big area outside Bond bar
and a whole bunch of people and it was
pretty embarrassing to be sitting there
where the hell are clothes you know and
so somebody I asked some some some
waiter I said did you see somebody take
our clothes you've been in this area and
he said that guy over there in the hot
tub is the guy that did it and it was
Craig I knew that that he was not going
to be trifled with so I picked up a deck
chair and I walked over there and he'll
whatever his head and I said get us our
clothes that was that was our beginning
the beginning of her relationship we got
but he has a totally different style
than I do you know and his is successful
in the sense that he knows how to raise
a lot of money and get a lot of people
and buy a lot of machines and set up a
big industry kind of out of his his you
know his personal plans kind of like
what he's going to do like he wants to
sequence every piece of DNA on the
planet and and I think that's kind of
cool I mean he's he's a fanatic you know
but he's different than me and and and
more successful by far in terms of the
amount of stuff he's done but he hasn't
done anything
new he's just done many many times more
sequencing kind of stuff than anybody
else has so I I respect him but
everybody doesn't you know this same
reason that everybody doesn't respect me
because I'm just a little too weird for
them and I think but have you stolen
more any clothes that's the question I
wouldn't have stolen any clothes so you
spoke about this idea of painting
targets on bacteria
well that work for viruses as well with
that but yeah it works for viruses we're
one of the organisms we were actually
getting some pretty good data with
influenza until our influenza lady moved
to Minnesota so while she's shut down
we're kind of we're looking for another
influence a person but yeah it'll work
for anything that's I mean the immune
system deals with viruses it deals with
things like say influenza when it when
it causes your cells to start making
influenza viruses it puts a lot of
things on the surfaces of those cells
that that wouldn't normally be there but
that the virus wants to put there
because it makes it easier for it to do
its stuff inside the cell that's what
you use as a target you say any cell
that's been co-opted by influenza it's
going to have these little things called
mtoui which is a little target it's that
we can simulate with like a like a known
a peptide so we can make because it
makes these little little holes in cells
and have in order to do that it has to
put some of its proteins on there and
there's there therefore susceptible to
the immune system so we just direct
redirect an immunity to him to eat those
cells that immune systems a whole bunch
of a hungry cells basically that are not
allowed to eat anything they find
they're only allowed to eat it if it's
got a bunch of antibodies on it that
means this is this is for eating
purposes here and so that keeps them
from eating other things so we're
putting those antibodies on there
because they we find out from from
chemists what what the flu puts on there
what's different about those sales now
so you don't actually kill the virus
itself you've actually killed the cells
that makes the virus
thanks for coming here 10 or 15 years
ago you had some views on HIV and AIDS
that we're very controversial they still
are yeah well what I've come to the
conclusion for over long period of time
and and a lot more study in reading than
most people would sort of give me credit
for because I think get out of my field
you know they think it's their field and
that nobody else could possibly have
anything to do but I basic er to me and
and and I think the retroviruses are
going to end up a lot of times being
like this the the the thing that causes
AIDS is not a species of the retro verdi
it's the whole genus and it's the way
that that is it's there's some members
of the genus that are much more
effective at doing it than others but it
isn't caused by one like HIV one that
was that somebody sequenced that and
then they found hey every time we find
this every other patient it's a slightly
different sequence and that never struck
home in people like Bob gallows - we're
not dealing with a species here we're
dealing with and if you look at the
properties of the retro Verity the the
genus to which the HIV virus belongs the
way it works is it goes in it's a DNA
thing it like sticks its DNA into
lymphocytes and then the DNA just sits
in there until that lymphocyte starts to
divide itself rapidly and then the DNA
starts making protein or RNA and then
protein and then making particles that
are infectious and and that's it's a
cyclic kind of a phenomenon it goes
around I think if that infects new cells
and it starts doing it but it doesn't
immediately start doing anything it goes
into the cell and waits until that cell
starts to divide rapidly so what that
translates to in the immune system is it
once as a sequence because those
sequences mutate really fast because the
reverse transcriptase is involved in
there
replication and and that makes mistakes
at a hundred thousand times more often
than like DNA polymerase does so there's
a real that that genus is very very
heterogeneous inside of it and and
what's happening is you get a sequence
that that starts replicating itself it
makes some mistakes it affects other
cells it's at certain weights most of
the time it's just a piece of DNA it's
ridiculous to fight it at the only at
the time when it's proteins and it's
infectious particles that's what they do
I mean all the retroviral drugs are can
only be direct they only are effective
against the the RNA containing protein
form of the of the disease and they can
only just do so much they'll modify that
the rate at which it happens but the
real problem is that you've got
lymphocytes that have all these
sequences in them that are sitting there
waiting there it to their good time with
when the when the left side starts
reproducing itself rapidly they
reproduce it's when it's not they don't
so you can't kill it by stopping it at
the protein level you can kill it it's
action you can stop it from from taking
action right now but it's still got the
DNA sequence in in a bunch of
lymphocytes so until we figure out how
to deal with that problem I don't think
we'll have a useful drug against any of
the retroviral they're coming up with
new ones there's new things that have
been blamed on retroviruses and the very
first thing that people have to
recognize when dealing with them that
they're dealing with the whole that
they're not deceiving with one single
thing like one sequence is not just
because you can only detect that one
that you know that there aren't any nice
tests for retro verity in general there
aren't any tests so you because I could
you could give them to people if my god
people have got all kinds of
retroviruses but they only have a very
specific test for the proteins that are
involved in like in HIV so they can tell
you whether you've got that but I can't
tell you whether you've got a whole lot
of related things and that's really the
difference between people that get sick
and people that don't is that
people get sick have a whole lot of
different versions of the whole thing
this is my feeling about it and and it's
not just it's not an unsupported kind of
feeling it's from just looking at the
data more and more data is coming too
forward
that's that supports that idea that it's
not just HIV as originally defined by
Bob Gallo and and Luc montagnier
it's a whole bunch of things and they're
all they're retroviral but they don't
have the same sequence and just killing
one particular little cluster of those
guys it's not gonna stop the disease
well great I think we pretty much have
run out of time here I'd like to thank
you very much for coming today thank you
all very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
