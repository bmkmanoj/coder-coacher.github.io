thanks as well to those of you who are
joining us on VC my name is Matt I'm one
of the folks here who works on our space
related products and our 20% time moon
Mars sky and so forth I'm here today
with the great privilege of introducing
an astronomer extraordinaire who works
at the Vatican Observatory when I was
first telling people about this talk I
was struck by the number of people who
weren't aware that there was a Vatican
Observatory we live at a time in America
when there seems to be a sense that
science and religion are fundamentally
irreconcilable but the Vatican
Observatory has been proving that idea
wrong for centuries here to talk about
that relationship between science and
religion and the practitioners of both
is brother guy Consolmagno who is
astronomer at the Vatican Observatory
and author of a number of books and
papers and so forth both related to
astronomy and to the relationship of its
to religion there are a couple of his
books down at friend if you want to take
a look and learn more about what he's
talking about without further ado I give
you a weather guy consul Manya thank you
thanks for having me here before I get
into the talk itself I wanted to give
you a little film clip to tell you
something about the Vatican Observatory
just so that you have a feeling of what
it's about and this was a film made at
our Observatory last September when we
dedicated the new epic the 16th blessed
the new headquarters of the Vatican
Observatory it's a new set of buildings
about a mile from the old head of
quarters south of Castle Gamboa
accompanied by the Jesuits that can
wrecked the observatory they showed him
around the new installations telescopes
and pieces of meteorites from their
collection the Vatican Observatory
changes headquarters because it required
a more space to accommodate the large
number of students and researchers at
work there before the observatory was in
the summer residence of the post but for
security reasons the number of visits
were limited the new center has a
conference room more classrooms a
library and a space for the Jesuit
community that's separate from the space
from students and researchers the large
part of the activities of the
observatory are done at another Center
at the Arizona desert the Observatory in
Castel Gandolfo is still a point of
reference for astronomical investigation
with their Observatory the Vatican is
securing a place in the area of world
astronomical research well two stories
about that little visit the observatory
has been in its current form since say
1891 we've moved a number of times we've
most recently moved into these beautiful
new quarters which are air-conditioned
and the Jesuit residence upstairs has
more than one shower it's we used to be
in the Pope's home which was a castle
built in 1815 90 by Maffeo Barberini who
later became pope urban the 8th there
was that Pope who called in Galileo and
Maffeo Barberini the residence that was
an obstacle Observatory which is kind of
nice but the Pope when he came first of
all wanted to know about the peace of
Nakhla that I showed in the Maris
meteorite of course he wanted to know
how it came from Mars and I explained to
him as I'll explain to you epic how was
it that I a thought that because he
thought over no I mean at that point we
switched to English the other thing was
at the end of the talk and as he's going
out and shaking hands of everybody who
works there you know this is a typical
head of state come to visit he shakes my
hand
and he sees my hand with the big ring is
I didn't know you were a bishop so I'm
not a bishop I'm only a brother I'm an
MIT graduate a month ago when I was
buying this suit exactly the same thing
happened I was at the Vatican department
store I walk in the guy says you want
this size handed to me don't bother
putting it on trust me it fits and then
he said oh we got these wonderful bishop
robes oh no no no it's an MIT ring of
MIT bishops he has by the Dozen but he
had never met an MIT grad before so
there's a wonderful thing about having a
brass thread out there what I want to
actually tell you about in this talk
began not with science but science
fiction it started at a science fiction
convention in Chicago about seven years
ago and it was after you know a long fun
exhilarating day at the convention that
an old friend of mine from my MIT days
and her husband caught up with me with a
surprising question could you explain to
us how you make this religion thing in
your life work okay don't think they
understood that a person like me who is
a Jesuit brother and an astronomer could
exist because after all I do exist but
they wanted to know in a very practical
way how what are the nuts and bolts of
how I make my religion and my science
all work together and they were
interested in it they were interested in
religion at this particular point in a
way that they never were when we were
all just punk MIT engineers together is
that they were getting older they're
raising a family and they were asking me
because along with me being a Jesuit and
a friend I was also like them a techie
and they got me wondering actually what
does religion look like - a typical
techie now what's a techie a techie is
someone who makes their living as an
engineer or a scientist sure but it's
even more than that it's someone whose
orientation to the world
is pragmatic logical functional where an
artist is going to ask is it beautiful
where a philosopher is going to ask is
it true the question behind a techies
worldview is how does it work
techies see the world in terms of
processes to be understood jobs to be
done problems to be solved and there's a
common assumption out there that most
techies are atheists or at least
skeptics and yeah no doubt obviously a
lot of them are but equally a lot of
them are not with these endlessly boring
debates between science and religion
there's a simple fact that often gets
overlooked an awful lot of scientists
and engineers also happen to be
churchgoers and even the knotch non
church attendees are living in a culture
that is saturated with religion and they
and we are fascinated by it I'm on a
listserv with a bunch of friends who are
mostly engineers in science fiction fans
in Chicago and a couple of the people on
the server are on the list are Orthodox
Jews and there is more fascinating
questions but how do you make this rule
work how do you do that it's not an
issue of religion of sound an issue of
belief but just who a set of rules how
do these rules get applied this is cool
a few years ago I was invited to lead a
certain Bible study group in thinking
yeah Catholics we don't do Bible study
thank you a Bible study group in Houston
I'm going home specially in Texas we
don't do Bible study a Bible study in
Houston with a bunch of astronauts
astronauts I could do that yeah that's
cool
actually turned out half the astronauts
in the group were Catholics so much for
that but there is this one guy who was
not a Catholic who volunteered to me
that he wanted to clear right up front
he was a seven-day creationist you know
strict he was solid in his belief the
universe was absolutely created exactly
the way it was described
the Bible word-for-word and you know I
wondered to myself like had he ever
actually read Genesis the bit where it
says the world is flat and there's a
dome and water above and below the dome
you know where does the shuttle go how
come it doesn't get wet and then he told
me what he had done for a living before
he was an astronaut he was a test pilot
and it hit me you know there's an a test
pilot if not the kind of guy you want
who's going to creatively interpret his
written instructions there is an awful
lot of jobs where a rigid literalism is
actually part of the job description you
just don't want those people to go with
you to the Museum of Modern Art and part
of that comes out of our techie culture
and in fact there's a bigger issue
underlying this literal mindset more
than being able to puzzle out the subtle
meanings of Scripture or the sella
meetings of paintings it speaks to the
serious misfit between the typical
techie in the typical Church hundred
years ago for example the Catholic
Church in America was the Church of
immigrants as a blue-collar Church
there's a church of factory workers
laborers and a lot of the things that
the church was set up to do were dealing
with the problems and the issues and the
mindset of being an immigrant being an
outsider having to work 12 hours a day
to support your family so you had you
know big emphasis on schools big
emphasis on getting people to to rise
act economically nowadays the economy of
the world is dominated by high tech I
don't have to be here to point that out
to you guys and thanks to all those
Jesuit universities a lot of the
laborers of a hundred years ago have
grandkids who are now people working at
places like this their children the
grandchildren of the Polish immigrants
and the Irish immigrants and the Italian
immigrants
unfortunately I don't see a whole lot of
evidence at my church is responding at
all to the needs of techies religious
instructors retreat directors the kind
of people I ran into when I left by
technological job and enjoying the
Jesuits they spend an awful lot of time
trying to develop what they call the
effective side of our personality which
most of us who here is yeah I don't want
to be affected no that's not what they
met it's the part that speaks to our
hearts our innermost desires that's
challenging enough for a poet for a
techie oh I have no idea what the hell
you're talking about
such preaching just sounds like
gibberish suckie friend of mine
described boys he was going to a retreat
and the retreat directory said image
yourself as a rosebush so he's thinking
I guess the retreat director said you
know realize that you can be both a
beautiful flower and pretty quickly and
for me and my friend spent the entire
time there okay what kind of rosebush
what kind of image what would be the
right f-stop another case engineer
friend of mine decided he wanted to
marry a Catholic he figured well you
maybe he ought to be a Catholic so he
asked me to be a sponsor and I went to
all the classes with a million RCIA the
religious something instruction for
adult I can't even know what it stands
for and there was a nun who taught it
and been really good in talking a whole
lot about how you can learn to
appreciate it and get to know how God
loves you and my engineer friend
week after week was getting more and
more frustrated and finally after about
a month he said okay what's with all
this stuff about God and love what am I
supposed to do when are they gonna tell
me the rules and that's the techie
question how does it work well you know
you're gonna talk to techies you go with
the techies lip so
in April May of 2005 I was doing a
Jesuit program called Trisha which is a
kind of spiritual sabbatical that
Jesuits take after you bet in the order
of 15 years or so and so I actually
moved up to Santa Clara University you
recognize this is Silicon Valley you
could probably see yourself there I
spent six weeks driving up and down on
us 101 between San Jose San Francisco
interviewing friends and friends of
friends and friends of friends of
friends scientists and engineers anybody
who said that they'd be willing to talk
to me about their religious beliefs or
their lack of belief I probably talked
to about a hundred different techies at
the time and out of that I collected 25
stories that are in the book and I want
to share us some of them with you all
the names have changed so that I don't
embarrass too many people and so I
didn't have to get their permission to
use the stories I'm really embarrassed
because one of the people is that I
wrote one of the stories about us in the
audience no and I didn't ask her
permission but that's alright because I
spent the morning with Brian who is the
science comedian he was complaining
about how people still steal jokes and
I'm thinking of all the jokes I stole
that are in my pocket but these things
hang on one more thing to talk about in
confession next week the the names have
been changed and they're in alphabetical
order in the order in which I
interviewed people so it's Tuesday it's
mid-april I've taken the Caltrain in the
bard up to Berkeley and I'm sitting with
Ellen and Beth an astronomer and a
medical doctor they're in a shambling
hundred-year-old house and some lumpy
furniture house is full of character
there's this explosion of toys and books
only some of which belong to their kids
and Alan and Beth are Church shopping
just like my friends from MIT they're
facing the same issue of choosing a
religion for their family the needs and
the desires of the kids or what's
driving the issue kids are growing up
pretty fast
not a whole lot of time it's a decision
they can't put off much longer
so what are the product features that
you're looking for in a religion - Alan
the intellectual content of the religion
is what's important Beth says that what
she's looking for is more emotional
content to the liturgies you know chants
and drums that sort of thing but it's
clear that Alan would be put off by bad
liturgies and Beth by fraudulent
theology Beth is looking for a sense of
mystery which she says she feels lacking
in the Unitarians that they visited Alan
was raised a Unitarian he also describes
him as kind of sterile on the other hand
Alan was put off by the Quakers as being
too flaky
Beth notes maybe that's just a flake the
Quakers you get in Northern California
the editor of my book was a northern
California Quaker who got a good laugh
out of that and yet even to Alan and his
desire for an intellectual foundation to
their religion the core beliefs of any
given religion are not so much things to
be believed as only as things to be not
disbelieved things that are at least not
unbelievable they're not looking for a
religion that's closest to the truth
they don't think they could make that
judgment because they don't know the
truth they can't make that kind of fine
distinction they just don't want to
to a religion that's obviously wrong so
what religions do they think are
obviously wrong I asked them since
around asked people all over I'll ask
you guys true religions including the
two my friends came up with are always
mentioned is obviously wrong religions
in the mindset of a techie any guesses
Scientology number one absolutely the
other religion that they thought was
obviously wrong if you are attacking
Mormons number two which is really odd
because my thesis advisor at MIT was a
Mormon so it's clear that there are a
lot of Mormons who are techies but for
the non Mormon techies Mormonism looks
really strange and I think they're used
to that fact the features that you go
looking for when you're shopping for a
religion depend on the functions you're
asking the religion to perform you know
if your religion supposed to bring you
closer to God then that implies a deeper
question so what why would you believe
in God to the techie the question isn't
so much a search for the proof of God's
existence but rather even if God
believes or not what's the benefit of
bothering to care if God believes enough
these interviews I find believing in God
is useful to a techie very pragmatic
because for one thing it answers
leibnitz's famous question why is there
something instead of nothing it's not
the only answer it's not the only
possible answer but it is an answer that
works oh okay for other people other
techies it's useful because having a
religion allows you to orient yourself
in the universe it gives you the
benchmarks it allows you to have a
direction in life you know whether
you're making progress or not and for
some people it's just a response to
those questions you have at 3:00 in the
morning when you're wondering what's it
all about
what am I supposed to be doing and how
come nobody's told with that
it's what what the theologians called a
longing for the transcendent more from
my notebook Carol and David both are
scientists at NASA Ames I'm sitting in
their home outside a mountain view so
Wednesday evening it's about a week
after I'd been up to Berkeley Carol and
David are older than my friends Alan and
Beth their home is more sparsely
furnished over a mantel on the fireplace
there's two framed pictures his adult
kids and her adult kids now Carol
describes herself as a Liberal Methodist
and David as a non-believer and Carol
says that she uses her belief as a way
of orienting and structuring her life
and as she says believing in God makes
me a better person that's why I continue
to believe what she sounds like a very
functional answer but to both of them
the most compelling reason for belief is
in fact that internal urge that makes
you look for the transcendence even
David admits that he can be moved in
uncomfortable ways when he's attending
church with Carolyn you know Christmas
and New Year's but David is still an
atheist and he says to me you know I was
raised to Presbyterian and in my early
20s I went to this you know youth group
in my Presbyterian Church and one day if
the minister brought in a rabbi and a
Catholic priest and they're both really
good actually our Minister was really
good but I was realizing I was very
puzzled because I realized they can't
all be right so it seemed to me the only
logical possibility is that none of them
were right now when I tell non-techies
that anecdote they break out laughing
when I tell techies had added that
anecdote they go yeah I can see the
point
I feel it myself even though I
understand why it's actually not logical
it does say something about techies make
snap judgments about new theories but it
also you know approaches a fundamental
puzzle to the techie mindset if all
religions are trying to get you to
relate to the same one true God how come
there's so many of them so I talked to a
guy at the city of Santa Clara campus
I'll call him Ian Ian is an engineering
professor he through Eastern Orthodox
Christian he teaches a course for
engineers that examines religion using
the mathematical theory of chaos okay to
him different religions are different
series approximations to the truth I
don't think I have to explain what the
series approximation is here you know
some religions converge on the truth
faster than others some actually get
closed for a while and then diverge it's
a classic case of using techy language
and techie experience to make sense of
religion the trick comes up again day
after I talked to Ian I sign out the
Jesuit community card not bad I Drive up
route 101 almost into San Francisco and
then peel off into the rather ordinary
suburban neighborhood of South San
Francisco the only thing that tells me
I'm not back in Detroit where I grew up
is I can smell the salt from the ocean
driving down a street of cookie cutter
houses in front of one is a VW Microbus
up on blocks says free Huey on the side
you know it's something to do with you
in Dewey no sapphire sign theater fans
in the audience you guys are way too
young anyway I'm calling him Jules in
the book this is the one guy he is so
distinguishable that I realized I had to
get his permission and I was originally
gonna call him Justin and he said don't
name me for a boy singer so he's a
science fiction fan I'm gonna call him
Jules
he's a Caltech graduate he makes his
living as a professional photographer he
combines artistic talent with his techie
abilities in the darkroom
producer these incredible visions of
nature and that are all around us as was
sipping tea in its living room I
remember I wet any heat says would you
like some tea so we go into the kitchen
he opens the kitchen cabinet and there
are 27 unmarked jars of little leafy
powders and he says every one of them is
tea and this is something every one of
them is tea and you know he could tell
I'll take the log phone so Shawn fine
great
which lapsang souchong yeah with
surrounded by a thousand vinyl record
albums dozens of paintings a couple of
original cartoons by artists friends of
his and he's sitting there in this big
wide bright Hawaiian shirt with a big
peace sign on a chain that's I'm peeking
out from underneath his beard except the
shirts a whole lot wider than it was in
1968 and the beards a lot grayer but
other than that yeah I'm back in time
and I described my project to him and we
talked about it for a while like me he
sees himself as a techie but a techie
plus a techie plus someone is part of
the community and yet able to step out
of it and look back and ask questions
from the outside so being a couple of
techies we start enumerating all the
different ways you can approach the
question of why are there so many
different religions we come up with five
classes of ideas number one they can't
all be right so they must all be wrong
and even my friend David the astronomer
number two they are all right they're
just different descriptions of the same
thing all churches must be equally true
because they all teach essentially the
same thing content equals rules if all
your teachers churches come up with the
same rules they must all have the same
content and therefore they're all the
same I saw that in a friend of mine
though it was the seventh day by god how
do I put this he'd been raised a
Catholic he left the Catholic Church
because it had way too many rules then
he married someone and joined her church
and now he's a seventh-day adventists
talked about too many rules
number three different religions are
like different computer operating
systems
which one's right for you depends on how
you're wired in other words the choice
of the religion you follow depends on
your personal history your internal
needs your genetics the general question
of what you're trying to get out of the
religion and that's not the same as
saying they're all the same because
there is one religion that's right for
you because you're worried why you're
different from the guy over there and
like different computer operating
systems some religions have more
features than others but at the cost of
a higher overhead and the greater
possibility of bugs that sounds like my
friends the church shoppers number I'm
actually getting number four different
religions are different approximations
to the truth so approximate should
converge faster than the other and we
heard that before that's different from
number two or three because it suggests
there actually is one religion that
converges the fastest that really is
better at least in a functional sense if
not necessarily truer in the long run
and number five different religions
they're like different kinds of physics
you know Aristotelian physics is
perfectly common sense but it actually
isn't very accurate and it's a whole lot
less useful and powerful than Newtonian
physics and most engineers get by fine
with utonium physics but in the long run
in the really difficult cases Newtonian
physics fails and then you have to go
into quantum physics and who knows maybe
those steps beyond that so people have
different religions and seem to get by
just fine with different religions until
they come into one of those places where
the less true version fails them of all
the five versions that's the only one
that says at the end of the day only one
religion really matches the truth than
all of its completeness we get our grow
for us about which religion that is I'm
a Catholic and a Jesuit and you can kind
of guess where I came from but I happen
to know a lot of techies who would give
you a good argument the other direction
I talk to students to professors to
Young Turks to senior executives that
theoretical scientists engineers a lot
of differences among them but I do see a
lot of common pattern in my interviews
the typical techie has serious questions
about truth and religion when they're in
college it's usually a he of course so
there's more women techies today than
they used to be I have this picture up
there anybody here recognize what that
is you betcha
that's the the MIT Chapel and right
behind it is the dorm I lived in well
you can see my room with the large
speakers in it off to the left
that's Bexley Hall I gave a talk once
with a bunch of MIT types said you're
wearing a collar like that and you lived
in Bexley because oh you really did
Jake's drug seriously when you were
there how can I say not true okay so the
typical techie has serious questions
about truth when he's in college a lot
of them abandoned organized religion at
that point though they never necessarily
totally abandoned the search for God and
then they get married maybe they start a
family and they wind up going to church
again usually the wife's Church it
doesn't matter if the wife or the
husband is suteki it's usually her
church however even though they're back
in church they still never let go of
their skepticism just as when they were
out of church they never let go of their
desire for God techies who are old
enough to be parents are the ones most
likely to be coming to church but they
don't go there to obtain their values or
to obtain their idea of what's true
because by that time they think they've
already got that basically what they
just want is to be in a place where
they're comfortable in dealing with
those values and truths you know to be
challenged but not too much and a place
that will help them to pass those values
onto the kids the kids in the other hand
can be skeptical of organized religion
but they might still see reasons for
believing in their desire to find their
sense of meaning to help them discover
what this was to be doing with their
lives to deal with those big questions
of self-identity and defining their own
ideas of truth and value meanwhile
there's a lot of other aspects of
religion that seemed to me would be
especially appealing to a techie but
they're they're downplayed in religion
nowadays for example the church my
church and in various ways Christian
churches can claim a historical
connection to Jesus Christ in his
initial immediate followers something
that there's called apostolic succession
you never hear anybody in the church
talk about that anymore but in fact that
guy in the pulpit we're in the funny
suit who doesn't how to make the
microphone work was ordained by somebody
who is ordained by somebody who was
ordained by somebody and you can
actually trace back all the way to the
original people 2,000 years ago and if
you're Jewish you can do it even farther
that sounds like arguing from authority
and arguing from I've got the power and
you don't and therefore very unpopular
in American culture except when I had a
bunch of scientists friends of mine
visiting in Rome and you can buy a
poster in Rome that lists all the Pope's
by name and you know presumably pictures
of the ones we have photographs of and
the friend of mine is just blown away
you can actually do that you can
actually name all of them in a
continuous line like oh yeah you know
it's you know mean value theorem it had
to come from someplace
this very the sense of historical
credibility is so powerful that there
are skeptics who feminine off a lot of
time trying to disprove the line oh oh
well you made up that one in the middle
you man you know I really don't care if
you made up the one in the middle or not
that's as I say the existence theorem
tells me that there was a chain I don't
have to know the names in fact the
magnificence of st. Peter's Basilica
itself which is often an embarrassment
to American Catholics
and cited a real religious experience
another scientist was visiting me he had
come to Rome he has read brought an
instrument we were gonna observe an
occultation and we had a couple of days
free so he wasn't you know did the truth
sites go into st. Peter's before he set
foot in st. Peters he had described
himself as a fallen away Unitarian half
way into the church as he's looking at
the building he turns to me and he goes
guy the people who built this they
really believe this stuff yeah you know
and he and he's shaking and I'm thinking
you know there were drugs to help your
problem here but he went home he joined
his dad's churches Lutheran Church
became really active and it he's now
teaching everybody else how to behave
just as he was teaching them all it's
fascinating the power expressed in the
immensity of st. Peter's like the
apostolic succession is tied into this
greater issue of authority Minister
isn't your typical churches are very
often afraid of coming across as to
authoritarianism ility they want to say
well you know I'm just one of you guys
they tend to want to downplay their
ordained status the fact that they
actually had to study something to begin
a minister the trouble is to most
techies if you think about it authority
carries an enormous importance and
respect everybody in this room is an
expert in something down at all I know
it better than you do and if you're
saying you know I'm a doctor not a meta
physician down at all Jim it's because I
am a doctor and I respect that authority
and I don't like being called on to
being something else that I'm not and I
respect anybody else who is an authority
in what they do
and I expect them to know their stuff
and if they come on to me saying well
you know I'm just kind of hacking this
together I really don't know what the
hell I'm talking about you're likely to
take them at their word then why should
I bother listening to you why should I
listen to some guy
dress up in the pulpit who doesn't know
how to make the microphone work it's
interesting but I suspect one of the
reasons why Jesuits do well in techie
settings as because everybody knows
we've been way over educated you know
the typical Jesuit priest has the
equivalent of at least a master's in
theology and another masters in
philosophy along with whatever it is
that they've studied you know in my case
a PhD in planetary science and so you
can say okay talk to me about the stuff
you know and I'll listen try to tell me
something about stuff you don't know and
I'll squash you fair enough there's
actually a whole thing in the gospel
about the the Centurion who says I know
how to give orders and he says to Jesus
I know where you can give orders in that
same sense that sense of authority is
something that I swear more religious
people should get from anybody who's
actually trying to tell them something
about religion tell me why you know tell
me what you've studied and I think
that's a legitimate question that you
should ask
unfortunately it's tough to go into a
church and ask that because the guy
you're gonna ask it is going to see it
as an attack rather than that's the
honest question that you and I are
really asking back to my notes in
Silicon Valley May ninth I'm jumping way
ahead I'm talking to the Xavier Xavier
is 28 years old self-described atheist
this is the Cathedral where he works no
stranger to religious and evangelical
sales pitches no stranger to the sense
of the power of a centralized authority
he also tells me that you know he thinks
most people use membership in a church
for that sense of community and you know
his time in life he doesn't think he
really needs that okay but through all
of my interviews I've been getting this
sense that here we have this marvelous
theology in the Catholic Church and
nobody's bothering to take advantage of
it they're joining the church for you
know the the potluck suppers in the
religious education and my friend Xavier
says to me people are not going to
church for what you're selling you think
you're selling truth
your customers already have truth they
don't want truth from you what you're
selling to them is tech support so is
your priest or minister or rabbi just
somebody you called in when things are
broken or maybe you go there for once a
week scheduled maintenance still
thinking of repairmen I head off to
lunch the next day with the ethanol of
the ethnologist Julian or no this is the
real name he used to work at Xerox he
studied the Anthropology of office
workers he spent a year dressed up as a
Xerox copier repairmen living with Xerox
copier repairmen writing his doctoral
thesis at Cornell which he turned into
this book talking about machines he's
retired now he's raising sheep and the
hills outside of Half Moon Bay but he
was coming into Stanford to visit his
acupuncturist and so we agreed to chat
over a middle-eastern falafel you get in
a street cafe and at this point I've
been in southern Northern California for
two months and this all seems perfectly
normal to me he tells me how Xerox
copier repairmen
are given thick manuals about how to fix
the machines but in practice the manuals
are utterly useless machines never break
the way they were expected to break back
at the Home Office there's nothing in
the manual about what to do when
somebody leaves a bologna sandwich in
the paper feed instead what they do is
they sit around Denny's waiting for
their beepers to go off and meanwhile
they trade stories there is this deep
oral literature about how I fix this and
how I fixed that how I was able to cut a
piece out of this tin can and wrap that
and made it work and what they do is
that they take the book of rules and
they back engineer from the rules to an
understanding of how they think the
machine must be working because nobody
ever bothered to tell them how the
machine worked all that gap was this
book of rules and then it hits me isn't
that the way that religion practicing
techies deal with the rules of their
religion they over they agree with the
overall
all general goals that they hear from
the churches even if they don't have a
whole lot of respect for the
documentation that describes how to
reach the goals and just like with a
Xerox copier repairman there is this
unspoken contempt of people to just
follow the rules blindly and even more
of a contempt of the suits who insist on
such a behavior just following a
cookbook implies yet don't understand
the underlying technology and I find
exactly the perfect illustration at this
point a few days later I'm in a Denny's
again as it happens I'm talking to yes
now yes isn't a scientist in his forties
he's a devout active Lutheran now the
conservative one
he's pretty contemptuous of what he
refers to as he bobble-headed Jesus that
you get in some churches he wants
serious content to his church he finds
the presence of liturgy and Sunday
communion important but he doesn't
really go on about ritual extinct
general except in one instance he says
the most meaningful liturgy he ever
experienced was in fact his own civil
marriage to his gay partner so there he
is
an active and committed Lutheran
attempting to live living in a permanent
committed gay relationship than I can
see the way the gears are working
because you know I know his church
doesn't recognize such relationships but
his church does teach that sexual
relationships should be in the
monogamous should be committed that's
exactly what he's trying to do as far as
he can see he's following the rules even
if they aren't the rules that are in the
book their rules that he's invented for
himself in a sense but their rules that
match the Bologna and the sandwich
problem that he was faced with just like
the Xerox repairmen provide customer
satisfaction with repair procedures that
would never make it into the official
manual there's a side to all of these
conversations though that surprises and
impresses me it's the commitment that
all of these people have given to their
various faiths you know we techies only
have so many hours in the
one way you deal with the fact there's
so many different things we want to do
is to multitask so yeah sure science
fiction books or fantasies you play
games you listen to music you go to
movies yeah that's a play time when you
can relax it's a time when you're with
friends that's also a time when you
could contemplate the big questions of
life you know what are the kinds of
games in literature that are appealing
to us role-playing games fantasy and
science fiction games that are conducive
to self-reflection games that allow us
to examine our own goals and identities
to allow us to the distance to feel
comfortable in doing all of the above
you know when you're immersed in a
fantasy novel when you're struggling
with the hero's ideas of good and evil
when you're listening to a Windham Hill
music and you got a high-tech sound
system when you're imagining yourself in
the the life of an itinerant monk in a
role-playing game hope you have enough
hitpoints these are the techie versions
of meditation and prayer but meditation
in prayer is a spirituality which is
slightly different from religion so
what's the role of religion in life you
know is it just another lifestyle choice
of Starbucks versus Pete I think to a
lot of non techie religions that's the
way it comes across I recall when I was
thinking adjoining the Jesuits I was
showing a little some of their
literature to a techie friend of mine
who had known to the sca and she was an
atheist but she was looking through all
this stuff and going hey I could see why
this would be really appealing I could
see all these great buildings you live
in and these marvelous libraries and
yeah this looks pretty cool you know
except for all this God stuff here I
could get into this going back and
reading all of my interviews as all the
people I talked to reading between the
lines I have a hunch that those techies
who do belong to a church it's more than
just lifestyles of communities you know
you're getting something they're either
you don't get out of a bowling league
check
please do have a religious life when
they go to church it is for something
more than what they get out of going
bowling it is precisely for the God
stuff it's just that they we have a very
deep reticence about talking about it
even to a trusted friend even to a
family member even to themselves you
know but it's like here if you bring up
if you are religious you're not going to
talk about it because either they're
gonna misinterpret you as some guy who's
trying to push your religion on the
other fellows or they're gonna be
somebody's gonna want to push their
religion on you which is just as bad or
you're gonna be misunderstood or frankly
it's none of your damn business it's not
something you talk about in this setting
and I think that's completely reasonable
it's something that also makes it very
hard when you move to a culture where
religion is something you talk about
whether it's the deep south or I
remember in Kenya the first three things
people would ask you with you know what
is your name what is your tribe what is
your religion if you ask them are you
married and have families they get very
upset because their family in their wife
that's very private why do you want to
know but they'll happily tell you about
their religion it's just a cultural
thing and this is the culture where it
and yet because I had the caller in the
MIT ring I was allowed to bring these
questions up to my friends allowed to
speak knowing that I was just you know I
wasn't even taking notes I was kind of
memorizing it and typing it when I got
back I'm not making any judgments than
any of them I'm just curious the thing
that got me when I stepped back after
the two months is you know there was not
one person to whom I asked my questions
about religion who looked blankly at me
they all knew what I was getting at I
wasn't raising anything new that they
hadn't already themselves thought
through regardless of where their
answers came out there's there's one
more wrinkle than all of us
in this world in this technological
universe of the technological vastness
of the future curiosity about the world
is a basic human trait denying it denies
one's humanity and the ability to
understand the world in a scientific
sense empower is the individual it gives
you a habit of mind that looks for cause
and effect which a lot of point people
don't have they think crap happens and
that's all there is to it rather than
saying why did it happen what can I do
about it or what can't I do about it so
don't waste my time doing that go
someplace else
technology shows us how impossibly big
problems can be broken down into smaller
solvable problems the ability to
understand technology the ability to be
a techie is a social justice issue I was
in the Peace Corps I got fed up with
astronomy one day when I was 30 I quit
my postdoc at MIT I said I want to go
someplace where I'm useful so six months
later I'm in Africa and what do they ask
me to do teach them astronomy why it's
because astronomy is one of those things
that makes us human beings and not just
well-fed cows you know I've got a very
very clever cat my cat has never wanted
to look through my telescope if you deny
that to somebody you're denying them
okay a lot of techies are not really
good when it comes to talking about
Felix stuff it's true of a lot of us I
think the church has to learn how to
speak to us and I think those of us who
are techies and members of a church have
a responsibility to talk to our church
people about talking to techniques
because you're the guys who have the
cred on both sides of the aisle you know
set up a telescope in the church parking
lot at night and let kids look through
the telescope give a talk on Sunday
afternoon on the theological
implications of UNIX and
whatever you know how can a church
expect to reach techies except to meet
the techies where they live and maybe
you can eat even teach the minister how
to make the damn microphone work
remember Jesus himself was a techie it's
not just that Jesus was male and single
and smarter than everybody else around
him and when he tried to fix the world
he got crucified consider the word
technology comes from the Greek word
techne which to the ancients represented
the mere mechanical fashioning of the
physical world as opposed to the more
exalted idea of being a philosopher
Fichte no wonder that Jesus the
carpenter was about as welcome among the
Pharisees as a plumber and a
philosopher's convention you know my
fellow techies we feel just that our
unity at times but still some of us
believe yeah we're just mechanics what
God's mechanics thanks a whole lot for
having here and oh I should mention my
could the couple who I'm talking to
their younger son just got into MIT all
right thanks for coming
is this on yes okay so we have time for
just a few questions
please wait for the microphone if you
have a question so that those on VC or
in their future watching a video can't
hear the question and not just about
this you may want to talk about your own
experience so maybe you want to ask me
about meteorites or astronomy or why
isn't Pluto a planet or you know throw
it out there and I'll do what I can
know in the corner has the first
question let me just bring this over
there so one of the logical conclusions
of your talk is that we need a new
church that actually gets closer to the
truth is appropriate for techies the
very question implies the truth as if it
was a month one dimensional aspect I
think there's lots of churches out there
that are close to truth but are doing a
really awful job of communicating it
more than once I've had you know
friendly settings where I'll talk about
Catholic belief and at the end they say
well you make it all sound really
reasonable but I know Catholics really
don't believe that because that's not
what I see in the papers and you do have
to realize that the only topic that gets
more poorly covered in the news media
then religion is probably science and
technology okay next question
so as an agnostic who's married to a
Catholic and raising a young son who's
going to be raised Catholic this was a
very interesting talk to me on a
personal level
at one point you you spoke though of how
the church could stand to kind of
emphasize it's almost heritage more the
the lineage of expertise and I think one
of the the potential flaws in that
argument isn't necessarily that the
church isn't that doesn't necessarily
have the right answers or or isn't
necessarily an expert because there's
this long line of expertise it's because
it lacks a certain degree of independent
verification that someone else you know
someone from outside the church can't
necessarily look at that and and judge
independently or it's difficult to judge
independently whether or not they're
correct yeah they uh
that's again treating Church as
technology and I would say that the
advantage of going to a church for a
philosophical body of knowledge is the
same as the advantage of going to MIT
rather than buying a copy of holiday and
rhythmic on your own and trying to page
through it in theory you could do the
latter but it's not a very efficient use
of your time the other point of my
expertise argument is that if the church
itself recognized what it is an expert
in it might be less likely to try to
speak on the things that it's not an
expert in which has damaged its
credibility in lots of areas and so I'm
saying this as you know I'm not speaking
to the right audience today about that
I'm saying this most mostly to my fellow
church people that you guys will listen
to somebody if you have a reason to
believe that they know what they're
talking about give us the reason to
believe and yeah people of you know one
time somebody asked how can it be a
Catholic you have to believe everything
the Pope says infallibly well no that's
not papal infallibility which is in fact
very very narrow I'm one of the few guys
who I can say to my boss you're not
infallible about all those other things
unlike many of us to be able to know
that a lot of these questions have been
thought through and implications are
there that we don't have time to get to
on our own and that there are twists
that I would never have thought on on my
own not because I'm stupid but just
because I've got other things to do in
my life that is a utility of belonging
to an organized body of knowledge okay
in the back here hi I'm a lapsed
Catholic and I have two small children
my husband I are thinking about starting
to take the kids to church but I don't
agree with the Church's stance on birth
control or gay marriage and I'm just
wondering I don't know how do I overcome
that because it's a real problem for me
an awful lot
I mean rather than aiming at those two
points on a thing that's going to be you
know
where all I can say is I'm very
sympathetic with the problems number one
look at the people around you who are
living that life and I'm not one who has
to I've never had to deal with those
issues so I don't have the answer but in
general the body of the church and what
it's teaching is more than any two or
three data points as a scientist I look
for the entire cloud of data points I
try to see where the center is I try to
see where the inherent systemic biases
are going to be where is it coming from
who are these people what's important
and a number of things where I don't
have the answer because frankly even if
this wasn't being recorded I don't know
that I have the answer um you know in
gay marriage I've I've got around at
least 720 degrees on that one and I'm
probably still spinning because I can
see where I gotta bet I can see but I
can see but I can see as I get older I
tend to be more conservative but more
tolerant if you understand how that
works the way that the st. Ignatius the
founder of the judge would already put
it is take what comes from the church
and try to read it in the most positive
light that makes sense with your
experience of the universe what are
these guys trying to say what is it that
they're afraid of are the fears
legitimate but at the end of the day
after you've read after you've studied
after you prayed you have to follow your
conscience and I can say that and being
recorded and nobody's going to get me on
that because that's a fundamental point
of Catholicism Catholicism is not
following a bunch of rules if someone
else wants them to be the church doesn't
have rules the church has teachings
rules you follow the rules you're not
playing the game teachings you go well I
never thought of that okay but then you
still have to go back and apply it to
your own life okay any more questions
today nobody wants to know about Pluto
I was on the committee that demoted
Pluto that's why I mentioned it he has a
treatise on his website actually with
his position it read it's it's all
Vatican plot you know that all right
then if there are no more questions
let's all please thank you brother
I can someone you one more time Thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
