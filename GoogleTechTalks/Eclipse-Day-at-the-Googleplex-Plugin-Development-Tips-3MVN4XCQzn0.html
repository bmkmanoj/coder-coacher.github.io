plugin of element tips and tricks my
name is Chris anis ik I'm currently
known as the PDO technical lead over at
Eclipse I work for a small start-up
known as Conine I'm a principal
consultant over there and before I
actually get started with you guys how
many here actually developed plugins or
have developed plugins show of hands
so that's a decent amount ok so you know
the beginning of this talk is gonna sort
of basically give you a little brief
overview of what PD is and sort of
general plug-in development things and
then I'm gonna sort of jump into these
various tips and tricks that you know I
find useful you know I've been working
on PD for quite a while now in Eclipse
and I have all these little things that
I have learned you know along the way
that you know help me in my daily daily
job so you know I'm very informal when I
talk so if you kind of see something
that doesn't make sense to you feel free
to stop me and ask a question just raise
your hand and I'll stop myself and get
to your question so that's ok with
everyone I'll begin so here's one of my
favorite screenshots you know that you
know you know we've came up with over at
the PD team so basically this is your
shot a screenshot of the Eclipse
workbench and then you see what the
workbench all the little different
colored pieces all come from different
various components within eclipse you
see you know you got the workbench you
have user assistants that provides the
help you have the perspectives you have
all these various little things that
come together and you know all these
things are seamlessly integrated
integrated together and you know they're
all plugins right you know everything is
a plug-in that you see on the Eclipse
workbench so what is PDE what you know
what do i what do I work on it's the
plug-in development environment so
basically anything that you use to
develop plugins is something that is
from PD so you know we have wizards to
create an export import/export plugins
we got templates for new plugins a lot
of you whoever actually contributed
something to eclipse you probably used
those fancy little new templates we have
for like adding a new view or you know
adding a little command so that's all
part of PD we have internationalization
tools so anything that you do within
Eclipse regarding plugins is something
that is provided by the PD team so you
know just like everything else in
Eclipse PD is implemented as a
set of plugins built on top of the Java
development tools you know we're
seamlessly integrated into eclipse and
you know just like everything else in
Eclipse we don't get any special
treatment from you know the JDT or you
know the platform in terms of how we
integrate so you know like like I said
it's plugins all the way down you know
to basically build on top of Eclipse you
got to write a plug-in to extend Eclipse
you got to write a plug-in to write a
rich client yeah if they're you know
rich client application you have to
write a plug-in try to no SGI based
application you have to write a plug-in
so this talk is all about basically a
little tips and tricks that you could
use basically on your own plug-in
writing adventures so you know the first
one I have here is target management how
many how many you were familiar with the
concept of a target platform in an
eclipse so okay that's see some now so
basically to explain this is and when
you launch eclipse and you start
creating plugins PD bye-bye it's by
default points to your running instance
as the target platform so when you
create a new plugin project you're
basically developing against you know
what you're currently running against
what what's common for people to do is
you know they'll download the latest
eclipse they'll get like three four
maybe Ganymede you know you know
tomorrow when it officially comes out
and say they're developing a product
that maybe runs on eclipse three three
so you could use the latest Eclipse and
you could point to you know another you
know target platform maybe being your
product based on three three and have
everything you know magically work you
know able to self host and all that good
stuff so you know the target platform
feature in Eclipse allows you to do that
so yeah it's pretty pretty pretty simple
straightforward most people don't
realize that you could actually develop
against older versions of Eclipse using
a using your target platform so there's
another good one in Clips called the
plugins view so if we go to the plugins
of you let me show an example here let's
see here so we have the plugins view in
Eclipse a common use case for people is
a lot of people that do Java melon Clips
probably use the shortcut control shifty
you know is that familiar for people you
I guess it's an apple shifty you pop up
and you got like a bunch of classes you
could you could browse to so in the
plugins view besides there's listing you
know the plugins that you have available
for you work with there's a neat little
thing where you could basically
let's find a class that on Finland let's
add all the healthy all the help ones so
you could right-click these and there's
an option called add to Java search so
you know what that does is basically PD
adds these plugins to the java search so
now when you search for like I help
something you know I help shows up in
your in your search now which you know
would did not show up before so it's
just a neat little way to basically have
these classes available for you search
so what's common for some what's what
some people do which I don't recommend
depending on performance is they'll
basically select everything in that view
and add it to Java search so it's just a
nice little way to jump to things based
on what you have in your and your target
in your target platform we don't you
know people have complained to us that
we should sort of do this by default but
you know in the interest of performance
we don't do this yes you have a question
there so if if if you so there needs to
be source associated with these somehow
and there's a couple ways of doing that
in PD there's that a source extension
point or it could actually be bundled
with the jar or there's a new way using
a special Eclipse source bundle header
now but the source has to be of it PD
has to be where somehow of how to get to
the source so that's interesting so
now it should it should work so I'd have
to see I don't you know after the talk
we could we could look at it to see if
that that solves your solves your
problem so okay so that's that's the
plug into you you know some people find
it useful but you know like like I said
you know adding things a java search is
quite useful if you're quickly using
Apple shifty or ctrl shift e to jump to
various classes let's see what else do
we have next on the on the on the plugin
tip list ah the error log so you know
your classic error log view and a33
it was very plain but in three four
which will be out tomorrow we've added
quite quite a few cool things so let me
let me demonstrate for you because the
best way to do is actually show you
so now let's see let's see we make a
little bigger so we added some filtering
so you could actually search you know
fur for log entries if you wanted to
right but other things we have done is
there you could group now so you could
group by session so a common thing for
people to do when you develop plugins is
to self host a lot right you know you'll
you'll you'll you'll make a change in
your plug-in you'll launch to test and
you keep you know keep going for that
iterative process so you could group by
session and you could see basically you
know which you know the various sessions
where they are what happens so you know
that's kind of a useful in that regard
you could also group your entries by do
by plugin so you got to see where they
come to so if you're only interested in
a specific set of plugins you could
easily browse that another cool thing
that we did is if you use eclipse you're
familiar with probably the concept of
launch configurations and stuff like
that so you know you typically self host
by creating a launch configuration and
launching it
so the log view is now aware of the
various launch configurator you have and
also what you have launched in the logs
of Sochi with it so for example I have a
launch configuration just a typical
workbench which pretty much just
launches you know all the plugins
enabled that you have in your workspace
on your target and the log view here is
aware of that and you could jump to that
log immediately associated with that you
know with that launch configuration so
you can see a bunch of stuff so this is
this is basically you could see the
location here where that bad boy
actually is so this is quite useful if
you're dealing with a lot of different
launch configurations and you need
to be able to quickly get to them you
could also jump back to the workspace
you know back to the home place too so
if you need to so just a little you know
the log view got a little love during
the three four release so it's just a
good thing to know about some little
things that could help you for your
journey now moving on to sure yes
yep yeah yeah so by default you see that
it launches you know here's a launch
location right
and they actually jump in there see if
this works oh it works oh so basically I
believe you the product whatever name is
you're asking basically this feature now
allows you to instead of browsing to the
log manually like I'm doing here with
the with the runtime configuration you
know you go you know you basically have
to jump to the the workspace location
and dig and find the logs instead of
doing that you are now able to just do
this simply via the log view so you
could just go to that launch
configuration and I'll jump to the log
that's located located there so that's
basically what the the brunt of is a his
question was doing so yep you could that
does it for all your all your all your
various launch configurations all right
let's see what else we got here
ah execution environments how many
people are familiar with execution
environments at all probably not many
it's a OSGi centric thing but basically
when you build plugins right you know
you're usually building them to target
something some type of environment well
execution environments are basically a
way to say that you know your plugin is
only meant to run on maybe Java 1 4 or
maybe you know baby Java 5 oh it's using
fancy generic so it you know it you know
it's minimum as that and you know this
is what's cool about this is that the
the OSGi runtime or you know with an
eclipse will actually enforce this so
for example say you're you you know your
product needs to run on 4 so you're
building a bunch of 1/4 plugins but you
also want to use some five-o stuff so
you build some 500 500 related things so
in case maybe your customer actually
runs on 5 oh they'll be able to use
these things so what the runtime will do
is you know if when it launches it knows
all its plugins it knows all the
execution environments associated with
those plugins if you're using a you know
one for it's not going to load your you
know plugins that specify an execution
environment of as FIFO so it's it's
quite neat in that order also when
you're actually going to build your
plugins it actually sets up the proper
compiler settings and stuff like that to
make sure it's get it gets built
properly you know if using one for you
know you hear the magical settings and
you do four one four and same with five
oh so it's a it's quite interesting it's
it's not it wasn't you
that much in the past because there
wasn't really good tooling for it in PD
but in 3/4 now you'll notice that when
you go create a new new plug-in project
you will see that what's cheap plug-in
and you plug-in projects you'll notice
that pretty much you're giving you're
given an option immediately now to
specify an execution environment so
we're trying to get people to adopt this
best practice in terms of specifying
these and you'll notice if you have old
plug-in projects that you import into
3-4 PDE will actually flag them with a
warning say that no you guys should you
should set something this is a good
thing to do so keep that in mind when
you're developing a lecture sure
so you yeah sure but so they could run
so they could run so they could be one
poor okay okay but Kenya is so is so is
it okay for you to run on one five two I
mean it should be all gravy right so if
you need to
so if you set your Bree as we as we call
it the execution environment you could
set it one for that implies so it's
gonna set up your compiler settings to
be all one for gravy you know you know
the one for a gravy train when you're
building when you're going to build so
what's up so then what you would do is
you would specify uh so you could
specify both right so if you specify so
we actually do that so you could specify
uh we do this with the found the
foundation type you know you're familiar
with foundation so basically certain
things we need to compile against one
for but if we could run on foundation
one one so you specify one for an
foundation you get specify multiple
breeze here so in your case you would
have an odd case where you specify one
five first and then one another one for
breeze so basically when you go to build
and compile I'll use one five but you're
saying you could also run on one four
which is which is quite weird I don't
know how you exactly do that but we
could we could talk about that offline
so but basically when you go to build
when you go to when you go to build it
uses the first entry in this list to set
up the the proper settings sure well
we'll talk afterwards so I mean it's
it's a little too too much for the
audience maybe okay so that we we have
execution environments done let's let's
look at something else so uh
oh it's ji launched configure how many
how many in the room are familiar with
the OSGi is is that is that like a hot a
lot term for people yeah so that's good
so P D by default you know PD for a long
time as supportive plugins you know
Eclipse has had the concept of plugin
for a long time in a three hour time
frame we actually chose to adopt you
know OSGi is sort of the plug-in
modularity layer PDE provides good
tooling just like you know you use the
Eclipse application launch configuration
we have an OSGi launch configuration
where you could specifically tinker with
various OSGi environments by default of
course we work with the OSI framework
that ships with Eclipse which is Equinix
what you're able to plug in your own if
you wish and there's some more advanced
settings for people to to to toy with
how many you how many were going to
quake back in a day
lots of quake people in here yeah it is
they smell remember that quake console
you had you know you set up god it was
like ID
cutie or whatever so um eclipse has a
similar concept we have we have an OS GI
console so it kind of gives you that
same power there may not be like a god
mode but um but you slow up yeah so so
if you launch eclipse with uh let's
let's find a little example here let's
find my little hello
let's see your bum let's put a dash
console here so if you lunch with desk
console OOP you go to the console view
you got this little osei prompt you know
so if if you type help you'll get a
bunch of commands but there's a you know
tons of commands around status you know
SS like short status you'll basically
see the status of sort of all the
bundles you know available you know to
you within the run time you could do
things like you know let's see org
eclipses that high hasn't started so you
could start Oregon clips high you know
it starts you could stop it you know all
these cool little things you could do
within the console you could diagnose
bundles so if you're you know if your
bundle is having a problem you could
diagnose it with diagonal it'll thing to
use sometimes to basically help debug
certain scenarios you could also pass
basically um here's another sneaky not
really a secure way of doing things but
if you launched a console and you put I
believe a let's see it's a magical four
five six seven oh it's already running
so I can't do that let's do it again so
you could actually put a port number
after that and it'll launch the
workbench and you'd listen here and
you'll get a little console such a Mac
Mac noob still what was it four five six
seven maybe not well yeah so here we go
I'm now working in you know you tell net
it's sort of a cheap way to do remote
sort of administration or you know
diagnosis in case you know maybe your
environment is on some server and you're
just launch it to debug with so it's
just a different way to
to work with things so what's cool about
this console also is you could also
provide custom commands right so you
know if I linked an article up there
which you'd go to and I'll show you
basically how to sort of contribute your
own command to the console when when I
was chilling out outside outside this
room I wrote like a quick little example
that contributed a little command so I'm
sure some of you are familiar with sort
of like the you name type thing you
names a very common unix type thing so
you know I just created this little
command so if I go back to my console my
plugin will start a you type you name
you know I'm running on Mac so so you
could also provide custom commands here
you know for your own application you
know in case you need to do some
debugging of some type or have some
hooks into your application that you may
not you know have available to you so
it's just a nice little way way to do
that so there's a good article I link
that I wrote a while ago that shows you
how to do that with some some nice some
nice examples so there's the disperser
so testing OSGi console commands
so yeah that's possible like the so he's
basically asking as someone created some
type of test driver to you know
basically to test OSGi bundles and well
you know I mean you're probably asking
for more than what is provided by sort
of PD and the test framework right
because you know we could launch you
know J you know plug-in tests and you
could test your series of plugins you
could also run this headless if you want
to even the OSGi TCK
it comes up with a way to sort of
remotely do this where they'll deploy
bundles and they'll run in and test them
so I don't think there's anything out
there that you know as you've probably
easily grabbed besides what ships with
with it with Eclipse so but we could
chat offline about this issue if you're
if you're interested in it alright where
was I OOP no more quick so there's the
display so this is less a plug-in
development tip more of a normal Java
development tip because there's also
using a user usable in the in the Java
context so how many how many people are
familiar with the display view at all
not many okay so this is actually
something that needs to be shown live so
I have a here we go I my little bundle
activator here I have a breakpoint so
people probably familiar the consummate
breakpoints breakpoints are good allows
you to sort of basically go somewhere in
their code and stop so let me let me
launch this bad boy and so you know it's
in the bug mode asking me to you know
basically it'll break down oh I have
another breakpoint here so I got one
here so let's see here let's let's do
another way let's continue on okay
listen I wanna go to so we have this
breakpoint here and we see that it's you
know you know creating various things so
if you go actually to the display view
if you open up that that guy here you
actually have access to sort of code
completion yes so so basically what
you're doing is based on where you have
stopped in your breakpoint you're able
to do certain things right so you could
call you know this method actually how
about this let's do this system dot out
dot print line below so you could
basically execute
a line of code in in the in this in this
context and you know get a value so
basically allows you to sort of stop and
maybe toy with certain things that you
have it's it's quite nice so this is
sort of a I use this probably like on on
a daily basis to like debug various
aspects of code you know stop at a
breakpoint and just chill for a while
and see you know we call this method see
what happens so it's it's it's quite
nice and you get code completion in this
view this is one of sort of the hidden
gems and it clips that most people just
don't know about because it's probably
not really widely widely publicized so
the other tip that kind of goes with
this one see oh sure sure man in the
back yeah so so his question was you
know it's it's kind of clunky the way
I'm executing uh the way I'm executing
this is that I have to actually select
it and then basically hit execute for it
to do something so uh if if you have
sort of a better you know way to do this
you know eclipse is an open-source
community and you know we love patches
so if you have like sort of you know a
better way to do it you feel free to
contributor back I would be glad to see
because you know it is kind of annoying
that you know that you have to do that
but so back to back to this one so
conditional breakpoints people know
about conditional breakpoints they're
like my favorite thing in the world yeah
this guy this guy knows about you know
Robert knows about conditional
breakpoints so now that we kind of
understand this breakpoint concept right
imagine if we actually you know write a
little Java code to actually basically
say that you know I want to stop here
based on certain conditions maybe you're
entering a method with like as like a
parameter called string ID right you
entered ID and say you know that method
is called by like a million people right
you know it would be nice to maybe set
up a little breakpoint that says you
know if I D equals maybe whatever I
wanted to and have it just stop there
instead of hitting do to do to do you're
just gonna keep iterating until until
you get through so we actually have a
concept of we actually actually can't do
this in any clips yes got it what's
okay
so I'll go back to the whole question of
we're welcome to contribute contribute
anything you want but so so the good
example I have on this one so I set one
up before I for my presentation here so
since since I'm pretty snazzy and sort
of know you know the internals of you
know the you know Equinox framework and
and stuff like that there is one
particular method here in it's called
bundle load or load class so basically
every class that is loaded by OSGi or
equinoxes case is going to go through
this method and so if you're trying to
debug like you know for example you have
some class and you get some word class
loading you know issue right
if you imagine iterating through like
the bazillion classes that happen when
you load in the clips workbench it's
gonna take you an eternity right yeah
you'll age really quickly so what I've
done here is I've set a breakpoint just
like you know you normally set a
breakpoint you want it you want a target
it there then there's this fancy
breakpoint properties here right Oh
enable condition right this sounds good
right so I'm gonna do that and then I
look at this method so I got I got name
as obviously here so I want you know
name you know equals you know you know
you know calm that Google you know my
class right so you would do that and
then get okay and then you notice to get
the little question mark which implies a
conditional breakpoint so now when you
go to launch it's actually gonna test
that breakpoint for that condition so it
will actually stop and stop when it you
know it satisfies the condition it's
quite nice I mean I use this quite
frequently so I highly recommend it if
you know you've ever had that moment
where you're sitting to the bugging code
you're like you know crap I gotta
iterate through you know however however
many times I need you to get to what I'm
really interested in so it's a it's
quite useful so this this little this is
one I like if I have like top top ten
breakpoints and Eclipse this one is like
like number two or something like that
because if you ever fighting I guess for
me more so since I'm do more the
low-level internals type stuff but a
pair of fighting like class loading
issues you start there and then you just
see what's going on
so it's
just a little tip for you guys if you
ever go go go to that uh that aspect all
right know that we're done with
conditional breakpoints what else oh he
got aa
plug in to Bennett dependencies you so
wow so I remember looking at the eBay
presentation that went on and and there
was like I don't know how many you know
projects in their workspace so you have
a sort of same problem when you're
developing plugins right because you
could have maybe like you know maybe you
have a really big product and you got
like a hundred plugins your workspace
sort of visualizing those dependencies
is quite difficult so in PD we actually
have a plugin dependencies view so let
me show you this live in action here so
if I go to plugin dependencies I have
this nice little view well--that's turn
this turn this off so let's focus on one
of the let's focus on my PD plugin PD
core
I actually know it's yeah yeah through
PDU I see that one
so look at PD UI and we have this
concept of a show you know Callie's and
collars so right now you could directly
see and this view what PD UI is
depending on so if you look at the mat
if you actually look at the manifest
item F inside of plugin you could see
you know you list all your dependencies
this is sort of just a visualization of
that so you could just go through and
drill down and see oh you know these are
all the guys that are depending these
are all the these are all the plugins
that Pui is depending on you'd also flip
this around and you can actually see you
know who is depending on you know who
needs PD UI so you flip around and you
see ah you know these are the guys that
are actually depending on you know use P
UI in some way so you sort of get the
the reverse perspective here what's also
cool is you know some some people like
pictures right you know pictures like a
thousand words for people I guess that's
the old saying so we have another way to
visualize plugins so if you we have this
project in the PD incubator called I
guess the graph plugin dependencies view
so which gives you sort of visualization
of things so if we launch this guy graph
plug-in dependencies OOP guys see that
okay so we could focus on let's focus on
P core here and boom you get this nice
little picture here that kind of shows
you
you know what's what's going on you can
see the various dependencies all
highlighted what's also cool about this
you could also see so for example you're
looking at all these crazy dependencies
and you're like all right so these are
my direct kind of dependencies but
you're also like you're also dragging in
update core you're like why do I need
update course so you could do a
dependency path and you click update
core and then you can see ah it's this
just this guy that's dragging in that in
that beast for me so you know it'll be
nice to get rid of them but you can't he
just stays with you but um but and you
could also do things like take a
screenshot and you know all that good
stuff so movies a little preview so it's
quite nice you know if you're trying to
just sort of visualize maybe your even
your architecture of your application
you know it's a good way to sort of do
this and so this code right now just is
in the incubator we haven't been able to
bring it in the SDK yet but you know
it's one of my dreams to actually do
this because you know people find this
visualization very useful yes you have a
question
so right now this strictly works on the
PD classpath classpath container so if
someone wants to write some
visualization that worked on something
else you know they could I mean right
now this this actually is not too much
code surprisingly it uses a lightweight
drawing framework called zest it's
actually used to be part of the Milan
project but now it's part of the
graphical editor framework project and
it's it's great stuff it allows you to
create these basically you know quick
and easy graphical editors with not
right you know not focusing too much on
actually like the graph and UI code you
don't worry about like layouts and all
these crazy things you could just work
you know focus on like giving it a model
so any oh here's my model here's what I
want to do with it here's a layout I
want and it'll do all the magic for you
so it's all good yep man in the back
so this specific code that you're
looking right now is part of the PD
incubator and it is quite tightly
coupled to PDE but the actual
visualization you're seeing here that
the stuff that enables you to do this is
not it's it's off to the side part of a
part of DF it's really small it's like
it's like you know I basically impede
eu8 this concept of a state right you
know here's our state the state has all
the you know plugins how they're related
here's the state you know here you know
it's like it's sort of like je fais if
you're used a face like oh here's my
model here's my input right similar
concept it handles all the you know
graphing and all that stuff for you yeah
it's very cool it's really it's really
like zest is one of my favorite projects
out there and Eclipse because like if
you ever done visuals eight
visualization is hard it's a hard
problem you got to worry about you know
it lines intersecting and all these
crazy you know layout type things
zooming all the stuff so zest handles
all that all that for you so we could
chat about it afterwards I could point
you to it it's good stuff all right what
now what next we have in the plugin
developers toolkit ah organize manifests
wizard so here's a little obscure thing
that not many people know about we have
this tucked away actually let me go back
to slide so we have this guy took towei
in the PD Tools menu but basically we
had this little cute little wizard
they'll basically allow you to sort of
we call it like scrubbing your manifest
we've got that little scrubber icon up
there in the top right for the wizard
but basically it will go through and do
certain things in your plugin right for
example one thing we do in PD is or
actually in Eclipse in general we have
this concept of exporting all of our
packages right you know basically your
plugin you know we want all our packages
to be seen because we found that our
adopters no matter how much we want to
try to hide stuff they always want to
use some crazy internal things so we
have to export everything this wizard
provides you sort of a way to do it
automatically because it's sometimes
common you know you're creating a new
plot you have an old plugin you add a
new package and all you forgot to add it
to you know the manifest to export it it
does other things all actually you could
actually scan and remove unused
dependencies one thing that sometimes
happen is you're working on a plugin and
you know you decide to add a ton of
dependencies to it right this could
actually scan and try to remove unused
dependencies amongst other things you
know you know another common thing is a
nls keys you know sometimes your
working on translation and you know
sternal izing strings your factor things
around and you leave some strings
externalize that you didn't really
aren't you really using anymore this
thing will come and come and catch catch
that issue so I mean it's really easy to
do so if you look at if we go back to
the project Explorer let's go here you
just right-click a plugin let's go to
this one this one's over there you click
that you do organize manifests it's
really a bad location but actually the
other will let me open this guy the
other way to get to it is if you go to
the overview page it should appear in
three four yep we it's here so you could
do organize manifest you click it here
and then you could show basic little
things you could do so you know mark
things internal if you know if they have
internal in a namespace type thing
all this good stuff so it's there for
you to use it's it's often used by the
eclipse team you know before we actually
usually commit something we usually run
it through the organized manifest wizard
right before release just to make sure
everything's in tip-top tip-top shape
all right what's next product editor I
mean if you're built if you're building
products in Eclipse you know if you're
building RCP based applications pde
provides really good tooling for you to
develop these things that provide stuff
here you know what I'm a big fan of
actually just trying to do stuff so
let's see if I could do this live live
demos are fun so I'll create a quick
little plugin project let's call it our
CPL we have a fantastic example that
ships with that clip so if you wanna
create a rich client application hit yes
do do RCP mail template hit finish
magical so you do that and what we could
do is uh so let's see here so if we
launch this guy got a splash screen oh
we have a little product so we have our
own little custom product application
it's kind of a base template that we
ship with so one thing basically that
you know you need to start focusing on
when you develop products as you know
you basically have to specify you know a
common questions well you know should I
bundle a GRE with this product how do i
bran this thing all these little things
they need to do so we have a concept of
a product configuration
in PD that helps you control this so I
could create an art let's do it may a
lot product based on the existing
product I've defined I click that and
bam I have this file that basically you
know allows me to sort of specify all
the plugins my product depends on in
this mail application here's what I need
I could specify custom config denying
eyes which is kind of advanced concept
but it's useful for some for some people
when you go to launching you could also
specify you know maybe my product needs
you know j2se one five right you know or
needs you know Java one four so you
could actually specify you know
basically you know a JRE here and you
know when you go actually go to build
this product it'll actually include the
JRE you know with with your product so
it's it's quite useful you could specify
you know you could specify the launcher
name you could maybe you know if you're
writing Android you know maybe you call
it Android that exe so it's just a way
of customizing the bits and pieces of
your product you could do program
arguments vm arguments all that good
stuff you could customize the splash
screen so for example if we we wanna use
a sample we want a difference splash
screen we could do this actually what's
a let's try this one
so you save that I'm gonna go to launch
I think we should get a new splash
screen oh I broke something that was
probably twenty me things so I probably
broke something do do do specify none
that's the bad thing about live demos
things break sometimes all right let's
try it again if not all I'll just move
on yeah so you get this you get this
customized little sprite splash screen
right so it just it just saves you a
little time when you're developing your
your product and there's also things
with branding so common thing is you
know branding a product with various
images and you know welcome screens it
stuff like this so this is just like a
one central area where you could all do
this so it's it's quite nice because
what's also good about this is um if
you're familiar with building plugins or
building products and eclipse building
building is quite as an art form I like
to refer to an eclipse it's it's a
difficult task you could actually drive
your
build using this file so you know when
actually gotta build you point PD build
to this file and i'll you know magically
build what you need to based off this
file so that's quite nice in that regard
but oh man in the back
so we don't in the product file we don't
provide that out of out like and out of
box thing you could do but when you
actually go I think we have this in the
actual product export wizard let me do
it the let's just let's just call this
something wah oh come on
stop being uh so I'm pretty sure come on
let's just put this guy somewhere slash
ops no we don't have it for that no so
you could do it when you export features
and plugins you could do that but we
don't have support for that like sort of
in a UI way but via via like sort of
headless and command-line you could do
it as part of PD build it's something PD
build PD build provides but we don't we
don't we don't have to expose in the UI
for products we could talk about it talk
about it later
but you could also contribute it back if
you wanted to if you want something any
why they're more than welcome to okay
doing okay here externalized string so
you know you know eventually you know
you could try to develop everything in
english but you'd be surprised there's
someone else who wants to use it and you
know some different different locale so
we have an easy wizard in PD called the
externalized string Wizards which
enables you to externalize things really
easily so you know over here I have my
little mail product so I could quickly
go PD tools I could do externalize
strings and I got this awesome little
wizard that will basically show me all
the well you know basically externalize
everything it finds for me manually so
you don't have to do this by hand that's
quite nice it's kind of like the Java
the Java tools provide this type of
thing so quite nice sets it up all for
you don't you don't have to worry about
it don't have to think about this just
just make sure to do it every so often
when you're developing so what other
cool stuff do we got here so when people
when develop eight when the about
plugins probably Moreau two versions
right you know the way in Eclipse you
have a major minor and a micro version
so you know four three four we have
three 4.0 well there's
there's another dot you could put you
could put 3/4 0 dot qualifier I think
that qualifier is something that by
default when you go to build or export
your plugin it's set it's set at at you
know for today's date or whatever time
like timestamp it just gets a timestamp
but you could actually customize this to
be whatever value you need depending on
whatever requirements you have for your
products so it's common for for people
to to use this and we also in the feet
and in the export wizard you could also
set it to be whatever you want to
because we have common cases where you
know for example you have a lockdown
product and you want to be kind of you
know you don't like reinstall your plug
and you kind of you kind of could be
naughty and like set it to be whatever
the date was in that product export like
drop it in and restart and it's just a
little way away to sort of do things but
I highly recommend always specifying the
the dock Paulo fire it's harmless we
also have the plug-in registry view
which is really cool so remember that
console I showed you well you kind of
view this as almost a visual
representation into the console so this
basically shows you everything that's
currently running in your current
application here so we see that you know
a couple plugins are all launched and
I'm good to go you could do you know you
could show extension points only so you
could quickly browse various extensions
and sequel things like that but the cool
little thing that we added recently in
3/4 was this little show advanced
operations thing you click that oh and
now we could be really naughty and we
could start like you know you know
starting things and I don't want to stop
that's bad
so you can start and stop things all
from this visual visual thing and your
boat you're also able to diagnose
plugins you know there's a problem with
it you don't know why you know you'll
get a nice little informative pop up of
what's going on so what's that oh yeah I
didn't show the cool thing you could
also use this to like you know for
example you're looking for like the
night like maybe maybe something like
the log view you could type like log if
you maybe yeah and you could see like
various it just quickly shows you all
the extensions and all the good stuff
that's contributed by very people it's
quite nice interest of time so another
common thing for people to do is you
know you're developing plugin
and all the sudden you have like some
third-party dependencies maybe you have
like hibernate or you have something
else out there that you need to drag in
some like Commons net Commons whatever
so we have nice little wizard called a
plugin project from existing jars so
what you do is you launch this wizard
you point to the jars you want and when
you hit finish I'll generate you a new
plugin project with all those you know
jars embedded into it in all the classes
they're available for reuse so this is
you know a nice way to sort of bundle
any any external dependencies that you
have that may not be plugins already so
this allows you to convert external
dependencies into into a nice plugin yes
mr. Rob
yep okay
is it because you want to generate your
own yeah well yeah that that code is in
itself is quite tightly coupled to to
the UI but what's here we could talk
about offline because there's other
tools to sort of do that there's
something called BMD that does something
similar but we could talk we could talk
about that later I'm thinking breezing
through here
okay let's talk about some of the newer
stuff in in three four so here's a your
something called I call plugin spy so
you know let's let's show you the the
normal example I like to show so a
common thing for me and Eclipse was you
know when I started developing as you
know I see some cool code out there and
all I see like the air you know the
common case for me is you know I was
developing an RCP application I see the
error log view and I was like I want
that in my application right you know
how do I get that or you know or how do
they do this you know with code so the
plug-in spy and sort of the sort of the
way like Firebug works if you ever use
fire but you know Firefox or did some
like web app development kind of does a
similar thing to eclipse you're able to
introspect the workbench so basically I
have the log view selected and if I hit
alt shift f1 you get a little pop up
called the plugin spy and what it shows
you is that the view that you're looking
at you know it's the error log view you
know the class that implements it is log
view so you could you know immediately
jump to that class if you wanted to you
know it comes from this plug-in here's
the identifier that the views use here's
any like help context IDs associated
with it so within like a click you're
able you know to jump to the source for
what you're looking at right you can
even get fancier in like you know for
example say you wanted to contribute to
the menu of you know of like the plugin
dependencies here you hit it here and oh
I did a run shortcut you know here and
you know now you're see that you know
the active view is a package Explorer
part and you know here's you know that
active active selection here's a
classpath container so you're able to
sort of introspect what's going on in
the workbench it able to quickly see
what you may be interested in so it's
just a common front this is really born
out of my frustration of trying to find
stuff inside of clips are finding a
magical ID that I that I needed so you
know it's been quite popular with with
people and you know I hope to extend it
in the future with some some new
abilities another cool thing a lot of
you are probably familiar with the
control shift T basically searching for
Java classes
so I decided to come up with something
similar in PD so basically it's called
open plugin artifact you hit the command
command shift a and now you could search
for things like org eclipse and let's
say you JDT misspelled it and you could
quickly jump to various plugins
extension points
you know extensions and even packages
exported packages so you're able to jump
within sort of one quick shortcut to
various various places up to extension
you'd you know eventually jump to an
extension you'll see oh there it is so
it's quite nice it's you know you kind
of get used to these shortcuts doing
Java development want to do the same
thing with plugins alright moving on
ah API to lean this is my last one I
believe nope we could skip target at her
but
so API tolling was something new that we
came up to in Eclipse basically the
biggest problem you have when you start
developing plugins you start module eyes
on your applications sort of keeping
consistent with versions so for example
in Eclipse we have this thing so if we
if we have API in three three right and
we move to three four we have to
guarantee that API works so what you do
is when you declare API you have to be
careful like you know maybe changing a
method signature is gonna break binary
compatibility right so you have to be
very careful when you craft your api's
and this is always sewing painful that
we dealt you know basically every
release at the end of the release we had
we had the API police right and they
would go and scan code and try to figure
out who broke what you know who maybe
added a method or remove the method that
would break compatibility so we actually
created tooling and the three for to
release to do this type of stuff so I
actually have a little example that
shows some of the power that you could
do with API tooling so this is a not the
best example but you'll get you'll get
an idea of what you could do so I have
like a sample of little buek I created
and I annotated it with something called
no extend it's just a little Java doc
thing that API tooling use this you
declare no extend and you could also do
this on method level two so you could do
no override so if we look at another
plug-in I have another plug-in there
that actually extends this guy I have
sample of you to write the
got hands sample view and if you notice
in the problems view we have some
warnings for us sample view illegally
extent our sample view to legally extend
sample view and we also have simple if
you to illegally overrides this stuff
and this is the type of stuff that API
tools allows you to do and it's actually
quite highly configurable so if you look
at the at you know this is where you
could you know set your what considers
an API warning or you know binary
compatibility issue you could set you
know all these various things to
basically tweak you know how you want to
do with it also hit you know handles
version management if you could declare
API and you forgot that and you forget
to add a sense tag and eclipse we like
to you know you declare API will add
since three point four since three point
three it will catch these issues for you
and like throw up errors and markers so
this is really cool stuff if you are
really worried about about version
management so I guess in the interest of
time I will open things up for for
questions if yep so for a QA does anyone
have questions
I mean I'm available also offline pretty
much until the end of this for for
questions but any questions before I
wrap things up or that will close it up
