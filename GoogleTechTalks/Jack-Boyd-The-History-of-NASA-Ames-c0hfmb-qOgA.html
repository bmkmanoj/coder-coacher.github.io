Silicon Valley history talk and this
time we have with us here Jack Boyd who
is a longtime professional of NASA he's
been in many positions at the NASA Ames
Research Center to which he came to work
in 1947 a long histories behind him
the reason I'm especially excited about
this talk today is that sometimes in
like we lose track of all the important
people that run systems you know we at
Google have a large sre group which is
like not so known outside of Google but
which does serious a very serious job of
running everything we do here I would
dare to say that NASA Ames Ames Research
Center did such a serious job for the
NASA program as a whole some of the
things they've done through the history
of which will her today have made
actually the space program possible and
you know I quit out it's I doubt that a
lot of accomplishments would have been
made especially like during the lunar
years and even during the shuttle years
so please welcome Jack Boyd here and
giving a world walk and thank you very
much can you all hear me okay
I'll start off by saying that I was also
having been with NASA for many many
years I was also at University of Texas
for some time as a chancellor for
research and while there and Richards
was governor probably heard of enriches
and she used to say a good talk in Texas
what's called a longhorn we had two good
points a long way apart with a lot of
bull in between so there will be some
bull I'm sure but there's some good
points to be made here I'm gonna go
quickly through some of the past hundred
years of aerospace and then Ames part
that we played in it first chart
this one I want you to kind of look at
I've I'm always struck by this from
night you can glance at these icons and
see what they are but from 1900 when the
Zeppelin first flew to the first
supersonic flight by Chuck Yeager was
only 47 years 47 years it was only 69
years from that time to the first lunar
landing 69 years now look over here on
the pier 69 we landed how many years
before we go back more than 50 I doubt
49 is right anymore but it'll be a long
long time we seem to have lost the knack
somehow
unlike Google was doing things fast
accurately and at cost that's another
problem we're happy but that's just some
thoughts of the last hundred and twenty
years the next chart we'll get into a
little bit these are just a another set
of icons I wanted to comment on a few of
them we weren't here when this started
but we were soon thereafter here and
we've covered most of the spectrum of 50
years with NASA those are many of the
things we've done I'm going to touch on
them a little more a little more
accurately a little more in detail
before we're finished but what I really
want to focus on as we go through it is
the contribution of these people made
from this little Center which is next
door to you over the past 70 years
incidentally this December will be our
70th anniversary I've been there for 63
of them so I've seen it change a lot the
next chart kind of gives you this is
before even I got here this big hanger
that you see which we are hoping to
replenish the Navy built it of course
many years ago for the makin and it's
not we've discovered it has contaminants
in the surface so we're gonna have to
fix it some way the Navy will D scan it
who's gonna risk in it is the debate
we're having right now so that comes
later but we hope to use that again
someday and the next chart shows
something out like this Macon I'm an
aero engineer by training
I was intrigued by the fact that it
housed inside its structure and it's a
rigid airship remember like Zeppelin's
are six of these little vehicles and
they would actually come up and hook on
be sucked up inside and send them out
again on scouting missions so they would
release from that part right there which
and come back and hook onto it very slow
the SAP would go very slow of course
that would come up and hook onto it that
was going on in the 30s but just before
now NACA will formed Ames out here and
the next chart shows us at ground
breaking this is December 20 1939 long
long before your folks were born who
started sorry Google I was born but I
was not thinking about coming to
California in those days I lived in
Virginia this gentleman right here on
the far right that you see became one of
our stalwarts but he was the NACA person
who came out to help us break ground and
the next chart shows kind of a little
bit about the various laboratories NACA
which you may not have ever heard of was
called the National Advisory Committee
for Aeronautics started 1915 I think it
was the same year that Einstein formed
his general theory of relativity so it's
a pretty good year and the first Center
was Langley field in Virginia the first
aeronautical research center they were
the ones who started this whole business
in the mid 30s Charles Lindbergh he
played a big part in Ames it turns out
for several reasons decided after
visiting Germany many times that there
we were real trouble in the aeronautical
research world and we needed a second
center and the president said okay if
you think we need the second senator go
find where we should put it well East
Coast we had one Langley fields in
Virginia he got as far away from Langley
field as he could find it was a Navy
base here so in 1939 he picked this site
named after this gentleman here who is
Ames was the
president Johns Hopkins University and a
member of NACA NACA ran the four centers
you see here Louis which is now called
Glenn in Cleveland was the next Center
and Dryden in the desert in 46 but that
was the core of NACA that's what formed
NASA all we did in those days was low
speed high speed Erol research we became
NASA things changed quite abruptly next
chart I say plate apart
this is our first director our first
associate director and Charles Lindbergh
in the lobby at the building 200 if
you've ever been over to Ames having
their picture taken he came out here a
number of times and just an aside many
years many years later you've heard of
Sofia the high flying 747 aircraft we're
gonna do infrared astronomy on we got
that from United about 10 to 12 years
ago turned out it was an Morrow
Lindbergh clipper which was on the front
of it so we're gonna replace that on it
so Lindbergh's family has been connected
with us for many years the next chart I
thought this would be kind of funny NACA
computers these are our computers when I
came out here and got data out of wind
tones would turn it over to these young
ladies who had IBM calculators and
you've ever heard these days you say
someone married their computer is
married too many times we married the
computers you know some of the engineers
actually took us up I did not but many
of my friends married the young ladies
who did the data reductions for us and
that was back in the 40 41 42 era now we
got as you know the next chart the new
computer we got here not so enchanting
not so endearing but very effective very
efficient that's the newest computer
we've got at Ames I think it's still the
third large computer in the world it's
we go back and forth people leapfrog us
the military of course has the two
biggest ones doctor award and I
director says that he like this is the
biggest peaceful computer in the world
so and it sits there as you know we had
one talk Columbia just before it next
chart I said people now these are people
I find I worked with I find very you
know it was a remarkable experience to
be able to work for these people this
man right here again since you're in the
computer world probably never heard of
him he developed a swap back wing he was
a researcher at Ames and for the first
time ever airplanes were flying with
unswept wings he said is she gonna go
fast
particularly up to Mach numbers of one
which is the speed of sound and beyond
you better start sweeping the wing
behind the so-called Mach cone and he
was laughed at for me it for a number of
years finally he proved it in the wind
tunnel and a man named boo saman they
don't lose smart in Germany during the
war was doing exactly the same thing and
they didn't know each other they didn't
know they were doing it so both of them
has to be given credit but after the war
that they became very good friends and
Bustamante ended up at university
Colorado this man another remarkable
person Alan as you may have heard he's
the manager developed a blunt body
concept the blunt body concept is what's
used on every vehicle goes into any
planetary atmosphere including the
Gemini's Apollo's the Mercury's I'll
talk a bit more about that as a young
engineer working with him we kept making
airplanes thinner and sharper to go
faster and faster
he said no if you want to come in really
fast like entry speeds and he'd been
studying meteors you better make it
blunt so some the shockwave will
essentially dissipate the heat and take
it away from the vehicle
as opposed to making it sharper and
sharper because it's gonna burn up you
know the sharp edges are gonna burn up
so that became designed for every
International Space guys it goes into
any planetary atmosphere this is the
young fellow you may have heard of since
unit computer world he started out
computational fluid and
it aims and therefore small size and
bigger and bigger confuses dr. Vincenti
who was a mr. Vincent he actually keep
calling him doctor he was my first boss
and the first man who did a lot of the
supersonic analysis for aircraft fighter
aircraft in the 47 48 49 timeframe he
was very active he later went to
Stanford as the professor he's now
emeritus at Stanford sending back young
engineers to us even though he's retired
the same where was dr. van Dijk
interesting Van Dyck came to Ames and 48
or 49 he had a PhD he was the only one
who had a PhD and Allen would introduce
everybody in the room as dr. so and so
and so and Milt would say my god does
everybody in this place have a doctor's
degree no nobody had a doctor's degree
except milk but these people were
instrumental in starting the basic work
that's kept this Center going for well
70 years next chart
I should when we started at Ames we were
supposed to be a high-speed flight
research activity therefore we started
building wind tones and as you've ever
been to Ames you know we've got we built
on the order of 15 different wind
tunnels different sizes different speeds
but we also got into flight research we
probably test flight research every
aircraft that the military had at Ames
for them this is the big wind tunnel at
Ames with a swept-back wing in it this
is George Cooper and I'm sure all of you
are Peter must particularly know George
he retired about 20 plus years ago and
went back home to Saratoga California
and built a vineyard called the Cooper
Garrett vineyards very nice wines if you
hadn't had it good tasting room so if
you ever in Saratoga gotta go see it but
he started out and developed what's to
call the Cooper Harper rating scale this
tells you how well an airplane can fly
you can test it in a wind farm all you
want to you put on the simulate all you
want to but the pilots the final judge
of how well it can fly so he had a scale
that was developed it's used all over
the world today so these people start
many things that other countries picked
up next chart I'm gonna speed this up a
bit this is somewhat closer to your era
how your areas of interest these are the
folks who really started us out in
computational fluid dynamics and help us
build a big computers that we now have
at Ames you may know some of the names
you may not but as I said I want to pay
tribute to these folks who started this
business early on and had the concepts
to build computers and other facilities
which I'll touch on as well Dean Chapman
had an interesting career he was a
computational fluid dynamics guy he got
interested in tech types and where they
came from so he went all over the world
collecting tech types how do
tektites are meteorites that succeed in
getting into the atmosphere without
totally burning up had a great
collection of them he picked him up
mostly in Southeast Asia and in
Australia so he evolved from a CFD R in
Aero space into a space see if the air
for entry vehicles next chart Flight
Research as I said these are some of the
examples of the older airplanes which
most of you won't recognize this is F
for D we had the p80
all the early research aircraft that the
military flew we tested starting back in
the in the early 40s this one is of
course if it's there where tiltrotor
this is one of the more recent versions
the tiltrotor is a vehicle we developed
at Ames the Marines picked it up and it
now is flying in Iraq and other parts of
the world it can it's got two rotors he
can take off vertically the road is
actually tilt that's why it's called
tilt they tilt forward then you can fly
it like two 50 100 knots 250 300 knots
so it's very effective and it can carry
something like 20 personal soldiers and
some equipment so that's another place
we've been in business for years next
chart
a natural evolution from flight research
and wind tongs is how do these airplanes
gonna fly and how can we check them out
before we fly them okay so we get the
aerodynamic data from a wind tunnel we
put it on the computer the computer like
the vertical motion simulator which is
six degrees of freedom can simulate any
vehicle you want to put the right
aerodynamics into it can simulate a
helicopter can simulate a Space Shuttle
it can simulate a fighter and astronauts
all trained on this when they come up
it's a six degree of freedom three
people can get in the cab and they can
really feel like they're flying the
shuttle and the nice thing about it is
when they crash they can walk away from
it so that came naturally out of our
flight research and wind tunnel data
next chart Advanced Computing came
naturally for a different reason
before the seventies illiac we had one
of the first parallel processes in the
world that we stole from the earth to
Illinois one of our directors did it's
for doing computational fluid dynamic
all the way through this whole era we
developed faster and faster computers
until we got this one here doing
computational fluid dynamics now now we
use the computers for much more than
that we can model of climate we can
model you know when the shuttle had
problems and the first time when they're
young foam came off it's a leading-edge
damaged it badly so the shuttle did not
succeed in flying back to earth now in
real time
every time we shuttle is launched we
bring this computer up so we can
calculate in real time if something
comes off it can calculate the velocity
and the mass of it we have to judge to
see what the impact for my
characteristics and the damage might be
so it's a real time lifesaver for the
space shuttle next chart this is kind of
we built up a number of these things
most of you probably aren't familiar
with wind tunnels per se but basically
it's a closed loop circuit generally a
closed loop with a compressor in it
so it blows air past the wind a model
the model has inside it a balance which
measures over forces drag pitching or
what have you and these are the ones we
built we built low speed wind tunnels we
went on up to larger wind tunnels and
the biggest one in the world which is
the 40 by 80 120 over here that is the
biggest wind tunnel in the world and
these sizes I'm talking about these
sizes means the diameter of the Test
section having nothing to do with the
length of the wind tunnel or anything
else it tells you what size model you
can put in the wind tunnel
in addition to wind tunnels though we
decided we need other kind of vehicles
that keep going faster you should build
a wind tunnel then try to go marked in
the air tends to freeze up on you so you
can't go much faster than 10 or 15 Mach
number you want to get up to Mach
numbers of 25 or 30 like entry speeds
back into the Earth's atmosphere we
built ranges and we built our Jets the
arc Jets are vehicles that put you can
put an enormous amount of heat into so
you can look at the heating rate of a
vehicle coming back from the moon or the
Mars into the Earth's atmosphere which
is about 11 12 kilometers per second
very high as an aside we also helped
develop a spacecraft to go to Jupiter
back in the 70s the entry speeds into
Jupiter about four times the Earth's
Earth's is about 11 kilometers and the
Velata the heat goes up as a cube of the
velocity so Jupiter space probe was
almost half heat shield but these
facilities would develop both the
aircraft and spacecraft the next chart
I use this chart sometime and it's the
only chart I used to give talks I try to
put on one chart 70 years of what we've
done I've touched on a lot of these back
here like the swept-wing the blunt body
the lifting body was another thing we
did back in the 50s and then actually
turned out to be the precursor for the
space shuttle there's a great debate
going on when the shuttle evolved from
Apollo as to whether it should be a non
lifting body or a lifting body because
of some requirements that the Air Force
had had was decided it should be a body
that has a lateral range to it as
opposed just coming in and parachuting
down so the Space Shuttle came out of
this lifting body work tilt rotor I've
talked about I'll go to the current
period we talked about the computer we
talked about the biggest went all out
here now we've got three things going
Sophia which is flying now and science
will start later this year there's a
high flying infrared telescope in the
747sp Kepler which you've probably read
about in the last week or two there's a
spacecraft we just launched to look for
habitable life planets that might
sustain life in other galaxies it just
we had a real important event it was
launched about three weeks ago but day
before yesterday the telescope blew the
dust cover there was a dust cover to
protect it when it was launched and it
successfully got got rid of that dust
cover so now the telescope can start
looking and start gaining data they'll
probably be flying up there for about
three years trying to we to determine
whether or not these other planets may
have water vapor cushion look for water
and it does it by an occultation
technique if the planet goes in front of
the star just briefly you see a
diminishing in the light output that's
oil will detect the planets L cross
which is another fun wind coming up it's
going to be launched now about June 2nd
I think it's a little piggy back vehicle
it's going on a spacecraft going to the
moon
should be interesting this from your
Google moon moon stuff it's going to
release the spacecraft and gets into
orbit around the moon a piece of that
spacecraft will crash into a crater
while the little one orbits and slides
through the plume hoping to pick up some
information on what the content of that
plume might be and that's coming up in
June so these three things all of our
important to us this year may depend on
whether we keep our jobs or not I don't
know I hope they all will be successful
one of them has been Kepler has got a
good start next chart I've touched on
these two so I've got a series of charge
for aims contributions to Aero stuff
stuff and I'll show them briefly this is
I've mentioned Flight Research I
mentioned the Cooper rating scale
actually put in the short hold vehicles
that we developed here the swept-back
wing this is one I worked on myself
conical camera is just something you put
in a wing to make the drag less it was
put on the b-58 bomber it was a
beautiful delta wing airplane and the
one thing I was a project manager in the
six by six foot window on it one thing I
remember about we used to have a Air
Force colonel came to visit he's a
project manager he brought these two
little boys with him one was Ron and one
was John his name was Colonel Gooch in
Norfolk and ten years later so he came
and said I'm gonna hear my son sing do
you want to go with me turned out he
said buddy's changed his name to John
Denver so it's no longer Deutschendorf
so that's how we got to meet John Denver
but that's why you get to meet a lot of
people in this business in fact I got
one at the end it shows some more
interesting ones next chart we'll go
quickly through these because I've
talked about some of them air traffic
management something I haven't mentioned
actually we've been in this business
since back in really the 60s working
with the FAA to try to help the air for
the flow through both on the ground and
in the air we developed algorithms we
pass them on to the FAA they put them in
place to help the air traffic
system that's been going on since the
late 60s and it is still going on and I
put a person's picture on him he kind of
started the whole business and he's
still working I'm actually working for
the University of California but for us
the next chart that's air traffic this
is mercury and Gemini I told you we had
ranges we fired models of the both
mercury and the Gemini capsules in these
ranges to determine their
characteristics this happened to be a
picture of the he was a vice president
in that's Johnson if you don't recognize
him
when he came to visit and this is a
gentleman I've talked about before on
his trajectory entry physics studies
next chart I'll do this Apollo I
mentioned Harvey he'd develop a blunt
body which made Apollo possible really
in the form that it took but we also had
some other interesting contributions to
Apollo our people that Ames developed
the guidance system on Apollo it was
very critical because when Apollo came
back from the moon it had to go within a
narrow ice I call it a window but if it
hadn't gone right into the right spot it
would either skipped out and gone beyond
the earth or dived in and burned up so
this was a very critical design it was
passed on to Lincoln labs and they built
a guidance system lunar surface
magnetometer we had some scientists at
Ames who were working on science of the
moon even at a time in the 70s and they
put a magnetometer on the surface of the
moon and on three different Apollo
configurations
life sciences we got into the business
in the mid 60s and I'll go into that
with another one but these are the kind
of things we did was Apollo we actually
tested is it's a picture of it here's
the shoot the first shoots in the big
wind tunnel that big wind fellas come in
very handy for a lot of things other
than helicopters and aircraft we tested
the Emmy our parachute the little Merc
and it's failed 10 months before launch
had failed they had to go back and
redesign it and it was the only place in
the
probably in the world that you could get
the right dynamic pressure that exposed
the forces on that shoot in fact
yesterday we just tested the MSL
parachute didn't sail but it's a really
incredible this shoots huge the 40 to 80
120 test section is also huge you
haven't seen it but it opens up and
deploys completely as though it we're
coming down in the Martian atmosphere
and it worked so we're okay there I
think next chart this is Space Shuttle I
mentioned again the lifting body this
gentleman is the one who helped develop
a lifting body and of course we tested
the Space Shuttle for ten fifteen
thousand hours in the wind tunnels
before we ever designed it in fluid it
we tested it in the big wind tunnel we
tested it is no supersonic wind tunnels
we tested the configuration as you
recall the shuttle is transported back
and forth on the big 747 well there was
a worried way back that when they
dropped tested it at Dryden wouldn't
separate smoothly and easily oh what'd
he get sucked back into the 747 well we
tested that in the wind tunnel and had
two stings that went into the back
actually separated the two vehicles and
showed that it could indeed be done
right but the pilot on the 747 was still
kind of shaky about it but at least he
believed the day didn't work okay
next chart astrobiology we got into that
business with the dark Guardian dr.
Klein in the mid-60s also looking and it
turned out that we have a series of
fantastic people working in the astral
body community that's the least of which
doctor very Bloomberg who was a Nobel
laureate who I think he came over here a
couple of times when he was visiting is
when he was working with us he now is
retired in helping us with a lunar
Science Institute but that is another
discipline that we started in the mid
sixties that we still got going the next
chart similar with the lunar exploration
I've talked about it I've talked about
the the work we did on Apollo
it's a does little spacecraft we
launched in 98
to look for water on the moon again and
managed out of Ames this one I've talked
about already there's a future we're
looking most of the wind tones and the
art kids now are devoted to looking at
the Orion and some of the new Apollo
shapes which are just large Apollo's
with how they put the characteristics
are in the Mach number range we can test
between about one and a half and three
and a half the next chart
Mars exploration this is what you're
interested I think this gentleman again
is the one that had the developed
experiment for the Viking spacecraft
which landed on Mars in 76 we had two of
them landed on Mars we did not manage
that project it was managed by Langley
well we had the principal investigator
on it and the mers as well which of
course as you know lasted much longer
than we anticipated there's a picture of
the chute I mentioned being tested in
the big test chamber they unfurl it just
as though they were coming down through
the atmosphere for both Meranti MSL
tests
interesting the Air Force runs that for
us now and they were kind of shocked to
find that the first test the Air Force
had in the wind tunnel had nothing to do
with airplane with the Mars parachute
next chart slants our exploration as
well I've talked about most of these
we've had spacecraft I didn't mention
the Pioneer spacecraft I should back in
71 72 we managed a small spacecraft that
went well 75 I went to Venus but the
first one that was launched and it's the
first man-made object to ever leave our
solar system it was launched in 71 we'd
be on the planet Pluto some years later
we thought it would last about a year
and we ended up having to turn it off
about 30 years later it was still
beeping faintly from beyond you over to
Pluto no interesting data no useful data
but that was one of our first excursions
in the project management which we are
currently working fairly heavily in next
chart
here we go now this is kind of where we
are today in terms of our active vehicle
this is the big one if you've not been
there you probably should try to get a
chance to come around and see it it's
got the small testing I'll call it the
small test section it's 40 by 80 it's
right here the big test section is right
here 8520 this is the inlet which sucks
the air into it and you can put
full-scale airplanes the power
spacecraft in there and test them
full-scale the simulator is still
working the unitary playing wind tunnel
it's just a series of test sections
which go from Mach numbers of one and a
half so for the same sized model you can
go one in half two and a half month
numbers and get two characteristics
Sofia I've talked about we have shops
there we can still manufacture things to
cook the supercomputers the ranges and
the art kits are still operating I put
this on just for fun because as you know
we've got 75 years ago the making crash
last year and almost of the day this
thing came back and we dedicated the
Zeppelin that now flies if you using one
of the big hangars not this one we have
three big hangars so we lease it to them
and they let us use this app sometimes
to get data atmospheric data
I think we're there advertising now you
can fly on it for 199 bucks
I've been up to point out historic sites
for them it's kind of fun very quiet
very peaceful flight anyway those are
the kind of things that are happening
right now
next chart and this is fully a technical
capability I'll just let you go and sign
for arrow just some air sciences high in
confusing we're into a small satellite
world with Pete Ward in the new director
we've got two Institute's over there a
national volume
virtual Institute so there are
universities all over the cut will
actually the world that are part of that
because Institute's and as I said we're
still working on for the new spacecraft
going to the moon
we got idealistic our charter we have
about twenty four twenty five hundred
people about half a civil servants half
our contractors and the annual budget is
on the order of seven hundred million
which is small for you folks but very
good size for us so total NASA budget of
like nineteen billion dollars we get
about seven hundred million of it nice
chart these are so we we've got a
Research Park that you've some of you're
familiar with probably now when the Navy
was here we had a central four hundred
acres which we still have for the NASA
site but they had about eighteen hundred
acres when they left in 93 they gave the
whole parcel to us so we're making a
research park out of it with a number of
members and as you know we have
agreements with with Google and others
to do certain things on the property
over time we've always been heavily into
education I should mention this summer
convinced that we have an international
space university for the first time is
gonna be at a NASA Center about 120 kids
from all over the world
that'll gather there for about twelve
weeks and study a special curricula that
got set up most of them are advanced
degree people who've got their PhD
already so we're setting up a special
place we can feed them outside the main
entry gate outside of the inner entry
gate the main gauge they come in to over
by the big hangar we've got a place
we're gonna set up for the kids for the
summer so it's gonna be a very active
summer with anywhere from four to five
hundred young people flowing through
like Google why would tell people if
you're gonna eat lunch you better go
early not get food if you don't next
chart just got a couple more this is
kind of what now this is what we think
before we get a new administration in
which situation is gonna be this is kind
of the way we think we're gonna be
headed toward the next ten years or so
until we return to the moon on the order
of 2020 next chart this is one the
students like I like to show this
because this it compares the Space
Shuttle with Apollo with the two new
vehicles this takes people into orbit
the new one the Ares one
this takes cargo and the rest of them
all the way to the moon so we now have
two vehicles the thrust of this one was
about four and a half million pounds of
thrust of this one was an order of six I
don't know where they need to be able to
seen this the most impressive thing I've
ever seen was an Apollo launch I don't
know the first one I saw
Apollo 8 I'd like to take pictures so I
took Cameron was one of those old
cameras it has 20 shots and before this
it moves so slowly before it got more
than like five hundred feet in the air I
was used up all 20 shot but it looked
like it was gonna fall over it actually
really moves like this whereas the solid
booster when the show really goes
zapping up there this was all liquid so
verse love anyway that's kind of the
architecture for exploration that we see
coming next chart I think I just have
two or three left
that's that's the current exploration
roadmap was the next lunar landing if
things go right about 2018 but the
budgets got to be just right and
everything has got to fit just in place
for that to happen
we'll see and the other things that are
happening the lunar lander there are
robotic precursors of course before that
and L cross as I mentioned is the first
one in June the next chart I tell the
kids this this is something somebody
showed me when I was in Texas if you
stop exploration they said did you know
the Chinese and for
thirty-five had vehicles that was this
big over here on the far right compared
to Columbus this vehicle and had they
not got an emperor in place who said
let's stop exploration this nonsense we
don't want to do anymore and he didn't
let them build vehicles more than three
mass somebody said they may have
discovered America from the other side
before Columbus did much bigger sailing
business
thousands of people on board and they
traveled all over the world in them
until they were stopped by this guy so
the next chart led me to this next chart
oh this is something I came across the
Hoover you guys know better than I how
nonlinear technology can be this is a
Hoover Commission our president who back
in 29 they predicted in a linear way
these four things happening they missed
their really major things that were
gonna happen in the next 20 years even
though having looked at that and being
told nothing is linear maybe you can go
a year but you can't go five the next
chart led me to saying we got we're
gonna do this we're certainly gonna do
this in the next 50 years we're gonna do
Mars we're gonna do the solar system the
last one I didn't know what to put on
now I got a 10 year old grandson who
said sir why don't you put a quantum
gravity machine at the end of the arrow
I said what the hell is a quantum
gravity exact he said I stun is wrong
you can go faster than the speed of
light I'm gonna build it and prove it
and that's what I'm gonna call it so
I've been using down the chart now for
two years and he still hasn't come up
with a quantum gravity machine he's not
12 years old
hope he's working now the next one and I
think maybe the last one so this is I do
with students I found it interesting
that these people who all of whom you
recognize of course made their early
contributions at very early age
so you can do it if you want to if you
get the right education you've got the
right education and you're already doing
it the next chart doesn't want to leave
that one huh these are some I found it
to be a real privilege to work with this
place but these are some of the people I
got to interface with you recognize most
of them
my wife says this is the worst serving
chart but the students like this this is
the one who told himself squirming but
she liked having a picture with boys
over but these are the folks you know
who these are the first of doing many
things right Lindbergh
Yeager and so on bob crippen most people
may not know but he was the first
children flight commander so it's the
last chart I've got I know it's this is
a fun one this is a picture in the big
40-minute window in 1965
1965 in the big wind tunnel we tested it
and we set it out on the ramp and on our
light aircraft flew over and took a
picture of it in the next morning in the
center of a mercury news it said Ames
captures flying saucer well this is a
VTOL it really was a VTOL hovercraft it
was with one person in it and indeed it
was a saucer shape completely soft shape
about ten feet in diameter so we invited
the folks from the Mercury News to come
and see it and the next morning and said
Ames refuses to admit it captures flying
saucer so we gave up and that's it thank
you Thank You Linda
sure do you have any questions I will
try to answer them no questions Peter
you've bound to have a question
had the better faster cheaper I think
Scotland's doing it in a lunar
prospector or don't get along that's a
cycle things change in terms of progress
well I wouldn't go back before golden
though I think the Pioneer was one of
the first faster better cheaper
spacecraft we did it was done in late
60s and early 70s I think two things
were that I remember when we had we had
a very capable guy who used to be in the
wind tunnels who managed the project
charlie hauled pioneer after we sold the
project for whatever millions of dollars
and it wasn't it was probably 60 or 70
the headquarters people sort of got out
of the picture they got out of the way
and they said okay manage it to cost and
the schedule and went and I bother you
reports every three to six months and we
did it you know we got it done when we
had a good we had a guy was very capable
he would only have stand-up meetings you
wouldn't have sit-down meetings he
wanted to have project reviews but he
wanted a quick fast to the point he had
a he ran a tight ship in terms of the
funding who had a small contractor at
TRW I think it was and there wasn't a
lot of reporting back but it was also
not a very big dollar project so people
weren't too concerned about it you know
in the late seventies and early I'm in
the late sixties and early seventies
everybody was focused on manned
spaceflight man's so the little unmanned
vehicles just we kind of got left alone
so I think two of the reasons we
succeeded in doing it rapidly is we were
left alone and we had capable people now
I shouldn't say we don't have capable
people now but there are so many loops
you have to go through to justify the
project to keep it on track we have
meetings every month on project
management and you have 50 people there
you know and people from headquarters
calling in so I shouldn't say it's not
the right way to do it maybe this day
and age we have to justify every dollar
we spend but it's certainly not the
efficient way to do it
a golden has the right idea I think but
three of those together may not work
maybe two of the three would you guys
know how to do faster better cheaper
than gold and did it seems to be yes if
you know she let it contract out it
isn't in the right part of the country
you get free politicians jumping on you
by saying why don't you do it in Florida
or it's a nature I think of the Beast
now when we change administrations
everybody wants to get their own or in
the water as to which way we want to go
I suspect we may be in for a little bit
of that coming up so nobody knows how
that's going to turn out but you're
right there a lot of I don't know how
you justify going over by two or three
on a project even no matter what it is
Mandarin man but you almost I almost
want to conclude and I know it's not
right that the people aren't that we're
using orange capable as the ones we used
to use just maybe we don't find the
right people because I know they're
there you know I've got a smart
grandsons two or three of them
but I mean like the president it's not
just this one I mean Kennedy it's not
it's not just NASA it's the whole system
I think it's changed and gotten more
cumbersome I think I don't know how we
can streamline it though if anybody can
it would seem to me the things we
learned from companies like yours ought
to help us streamline things because you
certainly do things in a streamline what
I can tell and I'm not a computer person
I'm a wind tunnel jockey yes
I met over right one time he passed away
the next year he only he came
both he and Lindbergh on the NACA
committee and they used to come to
different centers for their meetings
that's the way it happened
most people think he died in 1905 I
guess had to be after 1903 this one
the Air Force is running the big wind
tunnel we we had no it turned out that
we kind of phased it out because we had
a little use for it not enough to keep
it going and we posed the question to
the Air Force if they would like to pick
it up and operate it for us so that's
what they're doing now yes so whoever
comes to it the Air Force is sort of
screens and decides who's going to do
the who's going to test on what have you
so they're on-site managers for that big
one Tony yeah we are actually just not
new to us because many years earlier we
had the we I guess you call bailed one
of our we have to 7 by 10 subsonic wind
tunnels but we bailed one of those to
the army to do helicopter research back
in the late 60s other thing so it's not
unique yep Peter
about who William Shatner interface I
had with yeah well he came up a couple
of times one time he came in and he was
looking for information to write a book
about things that were in the Star Trek
movie he said which ones are real and
which ones can ever be done so he had
that discussion with some of the folks
at Ames and then he I forgotten how he
came up he said to me I would like to
meet that would tell her and I said well
I know Edward pretty well why don't next
time you come up we'll take you over he
said no I want to meet him today
so I called dr. teller and he said who
is this William Shatner I said it's
Captain Kirk oh oh I know Captain Kirk
bring him over so he took him we took
him over to Edwards house just three
hours for there and he said Shatner
walked in and said I want to know about
quantum mechanics and string theory and
Teller said well I'll tell you what I
know but you won't understand any of it
so just took him her back for a bit but
then they got together and for about two
hours ahead of her interesting
conversation I look better when theater
though when I was in college at 17 I
invited you ever heard of Shirley Temple
I invited Shirley Temple to come to my
prom okay
she didn't come of course but she sent a
picture beautiful picture of a 16 year
old she was 16 I think that was 18 and
years years later well just three or
four years ago my wife found the picture
and it had written on there - Jack
Shirley Temple sorry I can't come I
don't know who wrote it probably our
press agent anyway she so she lives
close by so we invited her to come over
to Ames to talk to some students and she
came very bright lady she had a good
interface on a computer with students
answering questions
and I told her about this occasion she
said well it's been 60 years though why
don't we have a date now so let's go out
to lunch she and my wife and I got to go
out to lunch together 60 years later
she's still living in near Woodside
somewhere but you do get to interface
with lots of fun people okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
