if you don't know me I'm Alan Hutchison
I'm the test manager in London and it's
my very great privilege to be able to
introduce mr. James Lindsay who is here
for whopper this week from London James
has been in testing for about 20 years
and is currently independent working as
a test architect he and strategist he's
been a great resource to us in London
and I'm sure that we're all going to
enjoy the talk today one note is that
this talk is going to be published on
google video so if you have any
questions that deal with an internal or
confidential matter please hold them
until the end of the talk with that mr.
James Lindsay Thank You Alan LaLanne
says my name is James Lindsay I'm a test
strategist and that's kind of a nebulous
thing to be somebody said to me the
other day how'd you get bid test
strategist and the only answer has to be
we first you have to make up the title
test strategy is about arriving at a
plan as a test strategist I help people
with how they plan what they're going to
plan perhaps what they're not going to
plan and that leads me to a point where
people ask me questions about what's
going to happen in the future well the
thing about test is is they should be
able to predict the future it's one of
the things that testers do we predict
what things should do how they behave
you should be able to look into the
future a little bit so this talk is
unlike just about every other talk I do
this talk is about some ideas about what
the future of testing could be like it's
not an experienced report although it is
based on my experience I'd like you to
take something away from this and that's
the idea of the possibilities that could
happen in testing plus the potential at
testing has got but also the problems
that it suffers under so one of the ways
to look at the future is to have a look
at the past and I went back to
maybe 10 11 years ago when i was first
consulting independently and i thought
myself what was going on at that point
this guy here was well known for
carrying around large guns and blowing
things up this guy here was well known
for being the governor of one of the
largest states in the Union now 10 11
years on has changed well this guy here
is one of the govern one of the largest
states in the Union and this guy blows
things up so the world has certainly
changed and less we forget 10 years ago
this was google at stanford 1996 lego
brick model with I think 11 4 gig drives
in it the world has changed in the last
10 years the world has changed as my job
changed well my job these days consists
of talking to people about testing I
talk to people about their manual
testing their automated testing their
exploratory testing I talk to people
about their test techniques their test
methods the things they're testing the
kind of problems they find and I'm not
convinced that very much has changed
really confused by this the world has
changed around us but we as testers
perhaps have not changed I don't know
why that is but I do know that there is
pressure there is tension building there
is a change coming so let's have a look
at some of the potential changes that
are on the horizon well here are the
standard set increased complexity
everything's getting more complex reduce
time-to-market we have to ship very
quickly and finally everything is
getting faster and cheaper and my
personal reaction to these except
straightforward trends is these are
rubbish and I will refute them one by
one I hope is the world getting more
complex no the world is not getting more
complex the world is getting simpler
simpler like this this is all the music
I'm bringing with me for this long trip
scutum one for this long trip I've got
14 hours worth of music on a thing with
five or six buttons on it the world is
getting simpler and simpler on the
outside much much simpler that has a
direct effect on us as testers simpler
on the outside world's not getting more
complicated reduce time-to-market
there's also a lie not talking about
reduce time-to-market would talk about
zero time to market we can take web
updates we can take changes to my system
software on this mac and their ship to
me on my demand not at a point when a
software company chooses to ship it to
me but right now right when I want it
the change is made somebody has found a
security hole I get that particular fix
on this thing I use a web service I have
absolutely no control over their updates
when they do them what they do them what
they make and what they break reduce
time-to-market misses the point the
point is zero time to market and finally
we've heard of Moore's law everything
should be getting faster and cheaper
frustratingly a 30 words MIT typer I'm
still marginally faster than Microsoft
Word so things aren't getting faster
this laptop cost much the same as the
last laptop and that cost much the same
as the last desktop I spent money on and
again we're going back ten years or so
is everything getting cheap
no what's happening is things are
getting more powerful so let's have a
look at these pressures simplicity zero
time-to-market increased power what do
we find well we find that the world is
changing and pushing us in ways that
perhaps we weren't expecting we're being
pushed towards commoditization and
ubiquity let me give you some examples
this is my bank I want information from
my bank at any time of the day or night
I can get information from my bank at
any time of the day or night I can ring
them up I can surf their website I've
got multiple points of entry I've got
any time to choose what I want is the
information and I wanted all the time
whether I'm in America whether I'm in
Europe various different things i'm
surfing through I want ubiquity always
want my information this is or rather
was my phone what do I want from my
phone I want it to work when i'm out
here in California I want it to work
when I'm in London I wanted to work when
I'm up my mother's in Somerset in a
signal is poor it works everywhere I go
in the world more than that I can take
the sim out stick it into any other
phone and that will also work anywhere
in the world and pretend that it's my
phone I want ubiquity if I can take the
sim out change it around i also want
commodity don't care what the phone is i
just want to be able to get hold of my
phone numbers don't care how i talk to
the bank I just want to get at my
information it's bitter of mac mini you
know we talked about how things get more
powerful I've got one of these at home
in fact I won't open it up I've got one
of these in my bag here it's a more
powerful unix server than the unix
server i first trained on when i first
worked in the city 12 years ago it is a
more powerful unix server
what's more it's also a commodity it's
very cheap I can shift information in
and out of it if it goes wrong I'm not
really bothered i buy another one slot
it into the same place put the back up
back on I don't care so what's happening
to us in testing we're being pressured
by greatly increased power and urge for
ubiquity wherever we want we want to get
hold of our data we get hold of it
ubiquitous access and commoditization we
don't really care how we get that access
so those are trends those are pushing us
as testers sometimes they're helping us
sometimes they're hindering us and those
tesh those pressures are what are
building up into the tension that I
think we see in testing and the reason
why I think there's a change coming one
of the reasons I'm in testing is that
it's got extraordinary potential
remarkable potential as with many
testers when I first started testing I
was wondering what to do I knew a little
bit about coding I found it fascinating
I found that I was digging deep into it
I found that I loved it because it was
so difficult so interesting so varied
testing has got such huge potential one
of the reasons it's got such potential
is because the breadth of requirement
that it serves lots of different people
get lots of different things from
testing testing as a service i'll only
have as much testing as i want that and
no more i'll test for two weeks I'll
find the bugs will gamble on a release
testing as a standard it must be tested
to this particular approach it's quite
different ways of working quite
different sets of information come out
of it quite different results for the
business that is asking for it I taught
the class yesterday in the class I said
how many people here engaged in making
software it's Silicon Valley
out of 12 people 12 arms went up I also
work in companies that make soft the by
software if I did the same class in the
City of London I'd say how many of you
engaged in making software I'd see no
arms I'd see 12 arms and people buying
software testing is quite different at
these two ends of the scales it supplies
different information to different
groups sometimes we're testing just the
software just a tiny part sometimes
we're testing the system testings got
potential because it talks to so many
people across so many different elements
of a business elements of an
organization it's one of the reasons
testing a huge potential some ways to
see testing I see it as a lab scientific
lab filled with exploration and rigor
interesting kit new ideas new
discoveries that's one way to see
testing some testing works that way
another way to see testing is as a
kitchen people making things that are
good with tools they expect to use with
approaches they expect to use to
accepted standards of quality and
they're usually making them at speed and
on requirement two different ways of
working with testing two different ways
of seeing testing I often see testing is
something akin to journalism the
production of information the discovery
of information and sometimes that
journalism is like working on the local
paper all we're producing is information
that basically says all's well nothing
big has changed there's nothing
important that is broken everything is
fine other times I see testing as
investigative journalism we dug into
this it looked good we found that it was
rotten to the core different ways of
approaching testing different things
that testing can do different ways of
seeing testing
this adds up into this idea that testing
is strategic one of the reasons that I'm
a test strategist testing is strategic
it produces extraordinary information
that information can't be got hold of
unless it goes to the customers unless
it goes and gets out into the real world
produces extraordinary unfindable
information in an otherwise impossible
time scale that's the great value and
potential of testing but testing has
another perhaps darker potential there
is split a split in methodology a
splitting ideas something that should be
used by all projects as a pair not as
this works this doesn't but as a pair
I'm talking about the difference between
highly scripted approaches and highly
exploratory approaches fat split here's
to be widening to me and I think it's
widening for a reason and I think we're
as the reason is good the idea of using
one of the other is clearly poor let me
talk to you about why i think that split
is occurring here we have diagram one a
software testing or at least the first
half of diagram one and software testing
this expresses stuff that I expect
outside things I don't expect the other
half a diagram one things I get these
things are get these things I didn't get
and there are overlaps in this diagram
out here are things I didn't want and
things I didn't get so we'll leave that
one well alone inside here things I
expected and that i also got that's
important it's useful it means that we
did some work and we got some value from
it the other areas are interesting for
testing two over here we've got things
we expected that we didn't get clear
if you expected something you didn't get
it there's a value issue here you paid
for something you asked for something
you put some work into something you
didn't get it that's a value issue if
you start by moving through your
expectations then you'll find out a lot
about value value that's missing value
that you've got but doesn't tell you
much about this part of the diagram if
you scan your deliverable it'll tell you
about what you've got some of which you
expect some of which you don't expect
stuff you don't expect is it valuable we
don't know is it risky we don't know it
needs a little bit more assessment so as
you scan through your deliverable what
you find out is risk things that you
should know a little bit more about
before you let them happen scan through
your expectations find out about value
scan through your deliverable you find
out about risk those two things should
be used together so that you can find
out about risk and value for your
overall effort but the problem is you
can't deal with your deliverable until
you get it a lot of testing work you can
and should do early and you pushes
further and further and further upstream
in some senses however with the
deliverable work can't do it early you
don't have anything to focus on so all
this early work focuses only on one half
of this diagram I think that's one of
the reasons why the split is turning up
so they've took to some of the pressures
on testing and we've looked at a
potential split in testing look at some
of the assets testing has this is a
photograph of a building in London in
1846 and mr. kirkcaldy built the
kirkcaldy testing works which was a load
testing laboratory thus London is the
heart of load testing as far as I can
tell and this load testing laboratory
could go up to a load of 400 tonnes the
beam is still in place I like it
because of this note in the top of the
window facts not opinions this talk of
causes opinion based so value it as you
wish but facts not opinions that's what
we deal with as testers and we can get a
lot more facts out of the kit we're
working with by having a look at the
various assets we've got to work with
let's have a look at some of the toys
and technologies arisen in the last ten
years or so or a bubbling around us
right now test Thomas's unit testing
there's an increased emphasis on unit
testing partly this is because of that
shift upstream and downstream there are
unit testing tools they're all tools
that support testing within the coding
process tools like Paris often agita
great tools out there and also great
processes in fact test-driven
development not that that's a test
technique but it produce a different
kind of code so a lot more testing going
on a lot earlier finding out about code
coverage certain tools are now built
into the development environments of
particular operating systems to tell you
about code coverage to automate your
unit test within the operating systems
themselves we're starting to see more
ultimate more potential for automated
testing more potential for automation
some scripted languages we're starting
to see these turn up to bring testing
within the realm of testers who up to
now haven't coded simple things to use
very powerful things to use important
tools for testers we're seeing tools
that help you test that helped me design
your tests there's a tool called case
maker from days and he'll to show test
make case maker will work through
equivalence class equivalence class
partitions boundary value analysis
various other bits and pieces combine
them all in a combat on combinatorial
way and produce tests that would
generally take a test analyst quite a
lot of time to produce and provide
requirements link back there are tools
out there that help you deserve
mine tests so as testers we're getting
better code we can perhaps get involved
earlier on we're able to do more testing
we're able to design our tests more
easily more effectively got a whole new
world of emulation I start to use
emulators maybe five or six years ago we
stun see a lot more emulators turning up
emulators allow you to do so much for
the testing environment sometimes you
get bugs that are associated with the
emulator but most the time those
emulators are hugely important to being
able to vary the tests you're doing to
be able to replay the test you're doing
the power of being able to go to a coder
and say what doesn't your work in your
environment here is an environment in
which it does work and give them a disk
with that machine captured on the power
of being able to go to somebody and say
here is a machine in a state that is
about to fail your software is about to
fail here you can replay it loads of
power there in emulations we've all come
across capture replay tools capture
replay tools are fine we understand
capture replay tools we understand some
of their problems but caption replay
perhaps aren't the most interesting
tools to use they are problematic one of
the things that is coming up now our
capture monitor tools tools that allow
you to capture what's going on monitor
it in a whole bunch of different ways to
be able to rewind what the system has
done not just as an emulator but to be
able to look back over log files
synchronize those with test events
capture and monitor tools tools that you
can use to slow down your observation
and finally we've got a whole new rafter
tools in particular i'm thinking of
holodeck here which modify the
environment you're working on how do you
run out of memory on a pc do you take
memory out do you run another program to
reduce the memory possibly or you could
get hold of a holodeck license and
holodeck allows you to reduce the amount
of memory in the pc to reduce the
network access to turn dll's off it
allows you to ask the program to behave
as if the disk is full
it's an extraordinary tool to help
testers test what they want to test
quickly and easily so we have a whole
bunch of tools out there for testers a
lot of big changes that come and have
come in over the last few years got a
change in methodologies as well I've
talked already about test first design
not a design technique non-test
technique a design technique but does
produce quite different code
qualitatively based on my experience
test produced by a TDD team is different
it has different kinds of bugs in it
much more but much more to do with
emergent behaviors problems in
integration than with direct coding
problems or design problems very
different to test under this methodology
evolutionary delivery so that we're
releasing frequently we're releasing
into a test team maybe every couple of
weeks maybe more frequently than that do
we repeat to all our testing no we don't
do we leave it all out no we don't we've
got some decisions to make and new
methodologies turning up Harry Robinson
who works here at Google is one of the
proponents of model-based testing one of
the clearest ideas a model-based testing
is the sense that there's an unlimited
number of tests well we always testers
know there are an unlimited number of
tests Harry and others have found a way
of getting at the unlimited number of
tests so testing is like turning on
attack not filling up a bucket that's a
new way of testing finally we are seeing
more testing integration to the software
life cycle we've seen some stuff early
on in unit testing we're seeing things
later on in monitoring testing in a live
system the idea of overall cost of
ownership through the life of the system
is interesting to businesses and testers
are being used throughout that and we
can see that trend in the way that the
tools companies are changing their
presentation to the marketplace I
finally got some tools that enable us to
do different things as testers workflow
tools we've all seen them as bug
trackers
workflow tools can change the way we
work as testers because they make
certain elements management quite
obsolete if you've got a workflow tool
you can flow bugs into your developers
you can flow fixes back out you can put
that in together with the flow of tests
that are likely and useful to do and
prioritization can happen on a quite
different level you're no longer as a
test manager trying to pick and choose
and plan which tests to do next now
you've got a workflow tool you know what
tests are there they flow in they flow
out so testing becomes like a pipe
rather than like a postage service
things flow through testing the sense of
momentum rather than the sense of up
here we are we've been landed with a
whole bunch of tests web services are
turning up allowing us to cobble
together tools and ideas and information
sources allowing us to put things
together not just in a live environment
but also in our test environment all
these pressures on testing also can help
testing web services introduce huge
complexities of testing yes but they
also introduced tremendous potential and
over the last few years I've seen
companies slowly starting to embrace
this I can see this going much further
collaborative documentation it's get
away from requirements documents held in
word and being obsolete from the moment
they're created to requirements held in
collaborative documentation tools where
we can see all sorts of information
changing as the system changes where it
changes in the way that code changes
let's not say we get away from change
control is to say that we can see a live
document rather than a dead document and
finally we're a state where we can
combine some of the web things we can
combine the speed of what we're able to
harness and start using genuinely
real-time metrics which once again
changes the way that testing works it's
hard to ever feel that somebody has not
told you about a problem if you've seen
their metrics at the moment they've
posted them you've seen their metrics
straight after they've done the test
the testers feel they own what's going
on as real-time metrics ramped up I
finished this test watch this change
real-time metrics very useful when you
get them working and now they're
tremendously easy to get working and
they start to become ambient they start
to become part of the scenery a screen
sat on top of somebody's cube with a
graph on that changes during the day
during the week something that has got
colors on it you maybe can't go up to it
and interpret its finest detail but from
the other side of the office you can see
how well testing is going and how well
it isn't going suddenly testing is
integrated it's not as obscure as it can
be in some organizations so that's the
situation we find ourselves in we've got
pressures on testing those pressures on
testing come from simplicity they come
from zero time to market they come from
the extraordinary power that we're now
able to bring to bear on our testing
problems and we've got different ways of
thinking about testing thinking about
testing as an information source
extraordinary information being able to
be bought out of the testing effort in
hardly any time perhaps we can find
terrific information of genuinely
strategic importance and we can start to
use different tools and work on those
tools to get lots of changes happening
in our organizations now that's the end
of an analysis of if you like what is
happening in testing at the moment but
there's a second step to this what
futures could we achieve as testers
because we have not changed much in the
last 10 years at least I've not seen
much change perhaps it's the position
i'm working in
perhaps ideas are coming in testing lots
of different sources so you'll have your
own ideas as to what may happen in
testing what may happen in your jobs in
the future let me give you a little bit
of perspective from my point of view
about what may happen in the future by
all means disagree with this but if you
do disagree I'd like to hear from you
some of your perspective so that I can
learn what do I think I think that we've
all got to deal with these pressures but
I think that they're also creating lots
of things for us to do sorry they're
also creating lots of opportunities for
us to do the things that they require
with simplicity comes things like web
services to allow us to bolt things
together ubiquity and commoditization
isn't just happening to the outside
world it's happening to testing as well
we're able to now abstract some of our
tests reuse some of our tests make our
tests commodities if you like now that
is having a problem creating a problem
and it's creating a problem that is a
problem to some countries and not to
other countries because as we
commoditize our tests we're able to send
them elsewhere and testers that's a
little bit of your jobs that get sent
somewhere else people who can do the
same job because you've come audit eyes
the testing is the solution to that to
not commoditize the testing nope the
pressure is to commoditize this will
happen a lot of testing work is already
out sourced because it's abstracted this
generally makes it better testing
abstracted testing is repeatable
effective can work extremely well but it
can also be outsourced and that pushes
that testing effort upstream we can do
more and more testing early we can
change the quality of code that is
happening and that is one half of
testing but the other half of testing is
concentrating on something different
all this push up stream looks at the
side of testing which is to do with what
is expected but all the testing that
looks at what has been delivered and
assesses it for risk that's still in the
same place and that's still now very
close to the release date so it may well
have to overlap into life this
downstream testing is looking at things
like emergent behaviour problems that
nobody expected surprises that nobody
thought they'd see not mistakes in
design not mistakes in coding emergent
properties it's also looking at
resilience how well will this work in
the vast number of different
circumstances we have to put an object
into can we put something into the real
world or will it only work in a test lab
and I think our solution to that is to
become tooled up a tool with a full with
the tool is still a fool and we all know
that acronym even some of us can't say
it but a tester without a tool is going
to look increasingly foolish I've done a
lot of exploratory testing I've done
load a load testing I've generally used
tools for the load testing my hands for
manual testing more and more I'm using
tools for the whole thing you will
always have your hands on the keyboard
you always have your hands on the test
that you're doing but increasingly
you're going to need to use a tool to be
an effective tester rather than simply
behave as a user behaves through the
simple interfaces that the user has
you're going to have to take a tool and
work through the more complex interfaces
that are available to testers because
those the complex interfaces are
available to all the other players in
the game that are interacting with your
software who aren't the users so that's
what I think about the future of
software testing and I think that it's a
good future a positive future I think
its a bright future and i look forward
to taking part in it
is it a different future i think is
radically different it's a tremendously
different idea to be working too short
time scales with such complex things we
can't use what we've used before have to
integrate ourselves with other parts of
the process and we're going to be using
a lot more tools is it radically
different yes I think so but is the
future that I've got in my head
achievable is a future that you've got
in your head achievable how do we get
there there is pressure on us to change
if we don't as testers change with
liable to be left for a while
potentially left behind and out of a job
so my question then to you testers is
what do you fancy doing do you fancy an
evolution or do you want a revolution
and that's my question to you if there
are any questions for me that'd be great
more information Oh from a long way up
more information contact me there thank
you very much
question
then we go</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
