open source at google Tech Talks and
this has been limited to Googlers that
are using open source or are interacting
with the open source community we are
now trying to open that program up to
outside computers mostly people we know
if it was like summer of code and today
that brings us Matt Handley from the
alien project he's previously a Summer
of Code student and this year he's a
summer of code mentor so he's going to
talk to us about any of today please
welcome mat so I guess before I before I
get too much of the presentation there
is this disagreement among developers on
how to pronounce a name of the software
so i call it idiot some of the other
developers call it a vm and this goes on
to type of memorial so not really worth
discussing here but the moment i want to
introduce you to a duck in the corner
there in the left corner this is baby
our mascot i'd say i'll say hi excellent
all right it isn't says hi back so get
started maybe wondering what exactly
idiom is a is an instant message client
for mac OS 10 only to find that affects
you the best instant that's my goodness
dennis is the best one for a variety of
reasons that I'll get into later but
anyways it not just being a rate is less
fine it's also open source and it's on
the mac acknowledged and that's kind of
special because there isn't as much open
source of ekadashi as there is safe or
linux or is sort of other communities so
that makes a miam kind of an example are
in the Macintosh open source software
community so in examining 80th and
trying to figure out examines history
charting its progress we're going to get
an idea about kind of how open source
works and found of how some of the
favorite stories that I tell about 80
and maybe some of the pavement started
to know from your own open source
projects so I'm just going over the talk
i'm going to talk about the history of
idiom is by these old faces sony's early
years kind of matured into a better
piece of software it got popular and it
kind of joined the recipe of the source
party i'm going to talk about its impact
and its current developments that are
now and we're going to be doing the next
couple years so in the beginning maybe
we'll look like this
and I've ever created and open he
stopped our Mac os10 in this field to
find this very familiar this is a
project builder project before xcode and
here's my interface builder window well
and being brought moment and difficult
the buttons on off send this buddies
update and this was original 80 it began
because this guy in an atomizer who was
a college student at the time wanted to
teach himself cocoa about 2,000 to cocoa
does kind of came out in 2012 one with
the introduction of mac OS 10 so he's
like I won this new objective c language
I'm get my hands dirty so he created a
program called Coco aim and the time ago
I support aim and he felt that by
himself for a while eventually made this
little nifty chat program as the of
course one of one of the things you need
to do when you're developing a software
the final logo so into that logo in the
upper left hand corner it's a messenger
Bert you see the messenger bird well
many people didn't see if s introverted
instead they saw a duck so idiom would
so a couple am as be named 280 I um ck
to get it together to see it's like a
duck and medium well a lot of people
also didn't get it so they just dropped
the ck and they called it a tee so of
course in the beginning the development
was just just an aim client wasn't as
multi-protocol customizable
beast like it is now it just really
focused on doing aim well it used this
old toc this old stock library implement
talk was provided by AOL and they of
course they actually go protocols for
Oscar and it lets you do all these fancy
things like change status messages and
sending which is that before but talk
was sort of their freely slimmed down
version of that which wouldn't even let
me do things like change status messages
so in the original version so its own
this early immerses opinion in order to
change the status message we used apple
script to tell aisha or a waltz official
client tattooed asian status so in
dillia chatting in the am then we want
to change that as he is a little happy
good so of course development at this
point it's just a tiem just Adam
managing everything so everyone is sent
Adam these patches in the verge of
Buckingham no source control mark them
but as these people kept using this
little Jeff program and everyone wanted
a feature they were just submit a little
passion it kept getting more and more
powerful and what about useful one or
more stable and it really gained a loyal
user base now as the people started
using it and started demanding you know
my patch be accepted and this person's
patch started Lee debating and mailing
lists Wars i'm sure all sorts of fun
things started up
the transition to the source mortgage so
they have a source for CBS sort of setup
and the interview got to understand good
at the developers this time are pretty
young so I'm 24 and soon will be 25 and
I'm one of the older developers that
have worked on this I was shocked to
learn this so Adam aye sir I mean it's
got a little bit older than I am Evan
Schoenberg the current developer easy
under than I am and about my age and
it's to promote the developers that just
looks ready anyway so these guys are new
and development they're not haven't
really been exposed to professional
software development so they don't do
feature releases where they say okay
well version 1 point 0 is coming out one
point I was going to have XYZ features
and then we're going to ship one point
one which has new features no they just
sort of haven't patches and patch the
fashion patch and so everyone ran the
night leads it would ran the nightly
versions as a feature release was like a
year old and no one ever used that
because the night leads have all these
new Oscar images and as a result of the
fact that pretty much everyone could
contribute these patches and it kept
getting cooler and cooler and better
piece of software income became at this
whole hacker clock because in order to
really won the best and latest and
greatest version you had the compile
from source so are you restricting our
user base to just these Packers and you
can customize practically everything so
this point developers they've sort of
guided ATM all the way up to first 1.6
and where's 1.6 with the last sort of
original ATM release this was notified
was 10 which is the original 80
employees and they set their sights on
creating idiom to point out which was so
customizable he'll grab your pants that
was the second
so these feet just start getting added
you can control everything and some of
these magic key strokes are actually
still in 80 so engineer even though this
is my favorite one I just learned about
this one in your sent in your ear taps
window that you type there's this queue
of these buffers there and you can
browse through this q by using the
control up and down keys so we going to
attempt there so say I say I'm talking
to my friend David or something so I
could say this is an example the message
buffer get haven't sent that message but
I can type ctrl down and now I've got a
new window or i can say something else
and say that I go back onto my first
buffer and I've got my original masters
they're all right and that's not
document or anywhere right that's it no
one knows about that but it's in there
right there's all these little
management features in this time so this
time in the open source or ahora natives
development it was like we gotta at
every future be possible to so
at this point though and there was a
name date him to named pretty well and
there have been about that temptin sort
of an msn client but it wasn't really
sufficient and take advantage of a lot
of innocence sort of weird working us
and people really want on msn and so he
look to its neighbor oh that's right
I have destroyed my car presentation on
site
or that all right figure so at this time
ain't really wanted to become this
multi-protocol chat client and they
wanted but they didn't really know how
to do that so they look to their
neighbors in Linux by then there was
this tool they're called game and so so
this was the gtk it will his message
protocol and these public eyes were this
great piece of software and these game
people they were chatting in you know
aeolus a messenger and they can do icq
and they could also do msn they can do
da foo and they can do at least little
one to know God who got you to Q all
these little people his name have no
problem they were having a big time or
clinics plan and so these Mac developers
said you really want to use your
protocol code and they looked at the
code they found that it was pretty much
this the complicated mess of user
interface gtk stuff combined with the
actual protocol code so they were able
to convince the developers to separate
these into two pieces one the user
interface into this library which is
able to do all of this protocol business
and they called it live game and live
game of course was very very not talking
about very very undocumented very very
didn't want to you know risk of the
rapid AOL so but but England to sort of
borrowed that and added it so suddenly
aid him to do everything that came to do
and at this point let his first one CD
s-type didn't stop working for them
God's I'm so popular everyone is on
doing so much craziness but frankly snow
enough that they really said we really
gotta switch to subversion so they did
so switching providers with this point
that this idiom client is still
incredibly customizing so for instance
I've got a couple screenshots of ATM
what would have been a two point O exact
81.6 so this is the screen if you want
to configure the dock icon they all
right let's you to choose the color lets
you say exactly how fat fast the icon
should flash you know when everybody
does something you know here's them
exactly how large the wojtek should show
up for the map that should automatically
just sighs with that should be a fixed
size maybe there's so many options here
and just for the dock economy I mean
this is where statuses looking it's at
the color each one of the varies mains
or buddies in the contact list and you
can say how fast on that status I'll
kind of flash and I mean this is this is
not spam and there's pages so how would
you want your interface you look like a
single window multi window even do
remember you want a team you can
customize it with look however you want
to look and
this becomes overwhelming right so so
many offices so many purposes so about
how 2004 doesn't fly at this point so
new developers came on someone
developers buckets to focus t1 and
everyone pretty much realized there are
way too many cup options and this is
becoming overwhelming so they said
rather than going for so customizable at
your craft advanced to so easy a
grandmother can use it and they did this
by not taking out well it didn't take
out a few of these customization
abilities what they do is they just
really shows a lot of sensible defaults
for them and these sense will be
involves meant that someone wouldn't
really know what they were doing can
just go to pop on and use ATM and still
get a lot of benefit out they would
actually to go to all this greatness
customization so the goal here is not to
overwhelm the userid options for
instance one of the ways they made it
really easy was rather than using their
own custom-built message view which
shows all the messages in a job they
borrowed one where the motivational
colored leaves an icq I RC plan and it
is built off of WebKit which is this
Apple's case of software that rivet that
does all the e story behind safari so
and that message here you see when I'm
typing is really just a big HTML page
using some JavaScript to cleverly add
the chat mattresses at the bottom now
this'll it me less people do is they let
them come with a really wide variety of
you know ways a deluxe the middle one is
certainly one what I liked so the
default one but also other ones you know
the couple of dark one clap or
the right and people who are not
programmers can you know do this they
just happen a little bit of CSS a little
bit of HTML him out 2005 the original
developer atom becomes fatal busy with
other things your public along this is
about the point where he graduated from
college so when he graduates he gets a
job I think it amazon and goes off and
by this point athey his life is so
complicated or whatever if you busy and
has retired redundant now in some
products is that we might be a definite
or something but an alien has such a
large number bella permitting system
largement of users using it that it
doesn't die if Evan Schoenberg just
steps up defensively developer and even
can start anew and and about the time of
course Google starts with their summer
of code project in 2005 this is a
perfect opportunity for a small small
boat open-source products like aenean to
get on board and really participate and
really get a lot of cool features from
this talented pool of college students
but they missed the boat that year they
don't know about don't fear about at the
time so they missing someone probably
literally hawthorne probably someone up
there said hey iniyum developers you
need to do this this is a mistake cave
de mis of this year next year no miss it
so 2006 take out board
now they're few things that were
implemented during this during this time
xmpp support whichever using a library
called smack which is this in java
library alright so so sorry moving away
from the game they're trying to put this
whole team using java and this coco de
java bridge and that was course with
that behind wrist monitor we added some
disability support which really improve
the accessibility of application and we
had these really cool tabs like idiom
tabs really fun not just statically you
can drag him around you can put it on
the left at the top of the bottom of the
right and it really customize a lot of
ways and that was really done like Kent
settlement it was gone does all sorts of
other things so they sort of at this
point is sort of footing with job they
have this didn't this guy both this new
version of something like live game but
he called it a Oscar and it pretty much
everything a little game did for a
mother protocols it was in Java
Handsome's reliability and had a feature
that were really liked so it really
didn't have much better java java
threads grabbin that games have been
through and it really gives a lot of
things just really a lot better so when
Amy of X 1 point 0 and this is the time
when it was very cool to end your
mattress application
so wait impacts won't footnotes go to
come out they said we're going to use
Java instead of lifting and using this
magic Coco Java bridge so it's written
in cocoa and ejector seat but we can
call java java and use it as if it were
referencing classes and so they're
flying flying pretty high in 2006 here
because during that that summer's world
wide developer conference at Apple Apple
shows off its new compile types of its
new product Xcode and you just a medium
as an example app for build x so and
even now it still does this route the
page that there now does their textbook
with one on build project and here at
test results based on a bill time of 80
and 1.2 so this is a big deal because
this is the local source product being
notified of being being noticed by Apple
which is Cena good company your members
who insisted that's pretty high praise
however during that same worldwide
golfers conference I will defecate that
Coco Java bridge so as much as the work
that address had put into trying to get
this job of Jabbar support but the smack
wide array is what his work they've been
to using to Oscar it all had to be
scrapped and had to immediately throw
them game back yet so in nap 2007 Summer
of Code came along and there we
implemented all the chapter stuff in
purple which is not
and it when a disability to unlock
groups which is really handy pitch you
have several group panels if you have a
lot of groups there's a really nice
Bonjour sephora in case you're smart
people under save some time and of
course then I come a lot of my goal is
to expand the atmosphere support so is
my slight digression from idiom to talk
about meeting my summer court experience
i encode a little bit I have a computer
science degree from st. Olaf end I've
been quite a bit of coding but I'm like
to haven't been involved with
open-source math user kind of out there
was fine with what I have I don't they
have products and really get involved
and was sort of this weird thing to me
because I I didn't really know what I
was supposed to do so much and have that
spark any ignores really go and do
something I have this desire for a
future i'm just going to implement i
don't really have that yet i need an
extreme summer job with extreme
flexibility this summer i have four
weddings to go to which is crazy and i
had to really long weekend trips and had
a pregnant wife and when you combine all
these together you don't want a job when
you're gone 40 hours a week again can't
do that and so this this all seems like
it was our colder than my thing except i
never use anything but I'm at
never program about Windows and Linux
guy so this is not only my mole of
expertise so i'm looking through the
list of software a huge list two calls
clicking on each one right under the top
of this program aenean I've heard about
a via one of my friends have used it so
I checked it out and turns out it's a
Mac was ten application and they do
cocoa which I know how to do I not only
that and my old job I did a lot of apple
script extensively so hey I can do this
product that they're recommending where
you implement an apple scripting a great
because Ames implantation was a little
little scared so I spent the whole
summer trying to improve it and two
months later I hope I succeeded felt
great because now my features or my
changes were employed an applicant an
ATM 1.2 so I think these new person
adium out well that was different your
fingertips is amazing
and if you have any refreshments or bug
for Susan to talk me out so my advice
anyway to new summer of coders is it
don't be afraid to make mistakes it's
not here sort of pull back and worry
about what happens about changes I have
my little branch it's the first I can
whoever I want I could have written the
whole thing to be a lightsaber I wanted
there's no there's nothing that stopping
now whatever I did was was was was safe
from harming the rest of the ball so I
should I quite gone back I'd be much
more forthcoming and trying to implement
this change or try to fix that up try to
change this and so I recommend that the
names of a coaster don't try new and
great evening things this is he was
going to happen anyway back to you so
the main features of adium nowadays
pretty much up the law today is these
tab chats now of course they're very
college back in the day and ever since
80s haven't even these totally lysate
features we organize your 10 different
chats coming at one time it's just a
single window they have that amazing
WebKit messages potato chip talk while
already it has these things called
extras so in an attempt to make things
easy to use they've really leveraged
apples plug-in architecture so that i
can say i want a new set of sound
effects for my adium you can just drop
in this one file into the application
support folder and voila ATM recognizes
that and i have access to all the sounds
or a whole new message displays its job
on a new file it's very simple to do and
it's in course Apple slogan art expert
in Tulsa designs
so pretty much anyone can join our
program so pretty much everything is
customizable still emoticons dock icon
status icons the message view and sound
effects it also integrates very well I
was 10 so if you're in your computing
the address book application and you
coming across a record there and want to
send a chat someone you can just click
on there and say I like to send a chat
using aid and the idiom pops them has
some great alg gift so if i wanted to
send a message to my life without 50 so
so they can chat with contacts there
people of the day with new chat window
and intelligent window please send a
message and that was gripped this
supports for deployment let's do some
pretty amazing things divided upon say
so myself and also integrates very well
rall which is a notification system so
money comes online or what I see a chat
it's not the homeless application I can
get notification what's going on and
also if you haven't played around with
the provinces and a medium it's called
about this offense system but the basic
format is 1x happens to do y and X can
be things like someone comes online it's
a friday The Sun has crashed into a
nearby star I don't know it can be a lot
of things and when that happens you can
do 10,000 things including one Apple
script so pretty much didn't do anything
wrong with this is a very important very
easy to use mechanism but also for those
security conscious people supports
off-the-record encryption
don't let anyone else skip it what
they're doing it support very
transparently very easy to use it also
does automatic updates by the sparkle
system and if you have your sparkle and
if you've been trying even basically
more complicated you'll be amazed at how
easy visitors you just every week every
week oh I meant the check stadiums app
cast and says hey there's a new version
it will ask you do you want to download
version who say yes but to download it
it'll download it it will install it and
we launch the application without you
having to do anything which is so so
nowadays for this year's summer of code
people were asked themselves what should
we suggest as projects we took care of
some of our biggest pet peeves that was
51 in order you do we do for this year
at this point Evan Arlene developer
knows I don't know sixteen seventy
percent of the codebase pretty well and
he's the only one who knows such a large
about that code so people's mock people
started worrying that there was a high
cost factor to this code maybe that mmm
were at Evan were suddenly become very
busy with the medical school he's in
right now maybe the couple's vertices so
we really want some automated test some
kind of way to ensure that other people
can work on the code get add those
features and they won't bring some small
subsystem so there's a couple of tricks
with this one is that a lot of what AM
does is over the network so that means
we're having a lot of locking of our
objects
test and also because amy was besides
the network parts also been doing harm
and so I'm going to do a lot of GUI
testing which is not very easy to do
using unit tests so in order to kind of
get around that we have some excellent
applicants Nazir of a hangar driven
testing behavior-driven testing project
is the Arcadia Ruben Garcia and measured
by Colin Barrett and he's going to
create some framework which lets us be
able to scoop our GUI very simply and
say just test our goalie automatic bj
homer which is why students and pecos
vote for chrome entering this year he's
implementing a bunch of unit tests for
just a little more low-level subsystem
Virginia lava marketing and finally
there's a daily practice data detectors
system our project suggested by Deborah
prospered and he's working on now that's
a system that's new and Matt was 10 5
which I haven't played yet but it lets
you sort of treat certain data of
certain text in a very special way and
so we can do a lot of social talking to
use to talk another simple example is a
thing is to be given a hyperlink in the
text will realize as hyperlinks when you
click on the positive browser there's a
lot more exploiting to do with that I
think these data effectors that he's
going to
maybe some more interesting things more
interesting effects besides you're
totally rather so easy and do a lot of
the background with her BFF Cara so
these tests that were at money should
allow for more people to implement new
features vaulted to progress a little
bit faster than has been so overall the
impact of a diem has been in the early
2000s there were there were three
officers for their three chapter
aftermath that were multi-protocol we've
got got fire which is the team
California Proteus which is a shareware
a prostitute killed firing points those
kind of all cementum overtime fire sort
of sort of some of the fire developers
super Betania men in the wreck hadn't
told mr. installed and they decided
we're not going to release any more
versions erroneous because it's
shareware that its commercial it's a
little bit harder to track the
development what they say they're going
to go over the source for a while but
they haven't and I think they're just a
little disorganized is trying to find
the way there again so mid game of
course as I've said as cotton from other
chat programs in existence of game are I
have all this functionality it was
convincing those getting people to
separate their library to encode a lot
of opens but a couple of pieces of
open-source mac software come out of
opinion so brawl was originally Canadian
only thing and they said hey this would
be very useful for other applications
let's release it at its own that's
release it as its own Beast and so it
did so and it also is one which you just
come on quite recently called photo
hyperlinks and this is something which
sort of identifies any pretty much any
kind of URL looking thing in text and
change it into HTML which the graduation
all for that way right now I've been
told Liam has over 200,000 users which
is pretty good because the all max come
with a check and ichat choruses does a
lot of what Indian does so these are
people who want something beyond what I
too have if you want some more
functionality wants a different protocol
feeling something something better
in turn in the land of future
development there's been a lot a lot of
talk about voice and video support me
really wanted voice support for a while
now video support so chat wise Aidan
does a lot of what shouldn't do so just
couple of more versions 80s but it
pretty much done when comes to just test
so there's been a lot of people wanting
to do voice and video and there's been a
lot of attempts by the developers to
start getting into that but they're not
experts in this field sort of been
installed on Garth haven't haven't
gotten anywhere the new mac OS leopard
has some really nice features that
should let voice of it'll be a lot
easier to do but we need someone to take
lead and say I'm gonna do the most video
I just do it so right now the shaker 8
and 2 point 0 have this voice in video
features
also good morning about what about any
money iphone all that'd be cool because
chatting on iphone it seems like a great
environment but the problem the robbers
think have a reason that the I minus
decay is technically idiot
non-disclosure agreement on theta so
until Apple listed in da can't lose the
source code that hat that exposes the
API that supports on the iphone so but
the GPL requires at what released the
source so until that restriction on that
novel human disappears I doesn't look
like just going to be any kind of iphone
eating which is so finally there's been
a lot of talk about using a distributed
version control system over and above
the subversion placements person and a
lot of arguments back important about
this particular one some people are
saying we all needed as far as you
people are consistent like how do you
live about this going back and forth I'm
sure this is just like I'm talking to
the audience of mostly subversion people
and so I'm thinking that this is sort of
like my friends talking about Max and
vs. pcs but anyway there's been no
resolution and no decision I was
actively proceed so I don't see what
happened to that any one country boys
joined the involvement no bull
from
I'm not sure I'm not sure what those
features would be so i don't i don't
know i'm not an expert in this sort of
sort of software however some people is
seeing to the exports by the strength of
their arguments they say no this is this
is an absolute must I mean this is this
is as vital as air the mercurial this is
by the way
I think so yes are the problem
costco so just come first I don't know
it's hard it's hard to judge we have a
battery of these people in person so
it's hard to judge and being certain
that
well it's possible a fact it back to
eight it's over the moment 1.3 grams one
point two point five something 16 and
1.3 is going to have a better having of
metal contacts so let's have one contact
for multiple protocols better life
contact searching it's also going to put
a facebook chat so the other thing is
kind of nice one point portion you're
going to have handling certain events
and status changes which are sort of
throwing things at the moment but i'll
focus on that one point for improved
chatting and who is a description people
probably awkward really hard to use and
so 1.5 is focused on trying to improve
that experience and finally two point oh
I've already said to have a lot of voice
and maybe video support so just to wrap
up human I've been told I really have to
say hi to a bunch of people so for for
Augie he'd like to say I could get
something to throw their life not here
also I also like to give a big thanks to
David Smith catfish man
and cozy boards oh also answered a lot
of questions or get into the development
software and in schaumburg are the
developer often they help of course less
he offered aid them before giving me
this opportunity to talk about you so
they have any questions at all about 80
and more any questions about sort of
where things are going and feel free to
ask them out
thanks so much so you mentioned doing
things with the iphone sdk has anybody
thought we're doing android I don't know
if I NDA or what the deal with
personally I piping is that the amount
of work idiom is so built in cocoa it is
so happy to provide it to put its so
happy and it does so many things for you
and it really helps you build a back
post an application of looks and acts to
suck my most applications really follows
the guidelines and people expect certain
things out of fact programs and it
doesn't good job is important enjoy
being a totally different ellesse is
going to have its been a hard time just
saying this for the math experience to
port to other OSS all including animal
so even though my license issues might
not be a problem there the problem is
going to be more sort of user experience
i reminded of when apple ported safari
to windows and people complained about
the fog render know this on windows and
one says all the fonts are so brewery in
the foot but to me it's like well if
they would find it look much better than
those little windows computers but
really it's distorts the bottom is ugly
way so you going into those arguments
comes user experience so you have to do
a significant beer out of ATM to get its
birth
Oh No
yeah so
well I call it idiom this is it this is
it this is a difficulty you bring up an
excellent point let's see here let me go
back
here we go so it was used to be called
Coco lame but
but that bird that's the logo look like
a duck so they call it in mck because
that was that was cool right that's
that's so cool and I didn't and the ck
were quick
see it's like aim and duck see the inner
wall because it's cuz it's clever and
what was the idea i think it i think it
was explained to me and this is this is
hard but i disagree thinking people's
memories here I think they expect he is
a sort of like a dr ian aim for
something but I've no idea why is that
someone good you know interestingly
enough there was all of the source you
know when your program that goes 10 you
always name your source file started
with the initials of developers so if I
would write a class i call it mah
something which goes along with apples
ms something for next level but and so
in any of all the stuff is a I block
pretty much and Brad why Sir but now
that means 80th it's funny
but ridgely apps
so how many active developers
I depends on what's going on recently I
was on IRC and David Smith told me that
it was a good day because four different
developers had contributed completely
different code a few times in the day
and it's almost like a push towards a
new version just sort of a comment so I
think I think there are really like 10
developers and I think that they vary on
their level of how much they continue
the main developer heaven contributes
like Paul's daily and that's really
awesome work Peter hosing the Germans
probably almost not quite as much on
there also non first month is still
quite so there got this really good core
group of developers have that keep it
going and it got up you know so side
developers like myself who ever saw him
step in and say oh hey look at was good
bug fix that hey look a big problem with
the way 500-year fix that so it's really
good it's really good
you are a fine for summer of code this
uri finding that able to find students
for like your higher priority projects
or you feel like a two-match month with
products of work
well originally I applied to be a
student listen and also he began testing
but they asked me hardly a mentor
instead so that I could help out they
had three excellent unit testing
application didn't have a lot of
excellent original ideas but they have
perhaps but pretty much they have this
little wiki page that says here some
suggested project and people just look
at the sickest products and building
suggested so I wasn't part of the whole
because I was a student I'm not affected
I was part of a whole deciding of wish
to deepen so i can tell you about what
the applicant pool well from what I can
serve infer via testing was a big player
because how could use of work and it's
really cost me to fix something heroic
have something else great ideas
so hopefully that quote I'll disappear
after some serious
200,000 active users or whatever do you
ask for get donations yes can donate on
the webpage
practice users by their Sparkle
downloads it's an optional thing you can
add said I would like to be tracked or
not and every time you done on something
and every time you upgrade it sends that
information for two servers pensions
traffic so if you want to get a good
idea about what Howie developers are
using software won't have the platform's
I have computers that sort of thing it's
all available on the website which I can
come with
despite go to the put it ain't all you
don't see it
I don't let me see a printout
dogs and gobs
oh my god
so
but now Hey look look I pro two
certainly is there any of them who's
using it exactly what software platform
sees and what versions of the softening
follow it down quite collecting dust
assistance none of its personal
information is also doing
I one of these guys
I want to go
so any other questions well yeah this is
just free online jobs have that spread
lies just if you check this out okay a
lot of us of the durations</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
