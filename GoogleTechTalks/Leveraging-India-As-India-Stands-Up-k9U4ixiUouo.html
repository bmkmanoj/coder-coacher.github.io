are a few of us here I'm Samir I recent
addition to google and work on the
corporate development I the acquisitions
team will be moving to India later this
year that's a little bit about me dr.
June June voila just a brief
introduction there these Institute's
called IITs in India the Indian
Institutes of Technology some of you may
be from there some of you may have heard
of it he was department chair has been
teaching in that institute for over 25
years he's also an entrepreneur and that
sort of his hobby ways helped many a
company especially for rural India he'll
talk to you about some of those stories
he is on the board of multiple companies
I think 15 over time very involved with
cellular and telecom policy one of the
awards that has been awarded to dr.
Junction voila by the president is the
padma shri it's a very coveted award in
india i thank him for taking time out of
his busy schedule to give us a little
bit of knowledge that he has about india
and the opportunity it offers us in the
near future
thank you very much I have titled my
talk leveraging India as India stands up
through innovations in technologies
business models and policies I'll lovely
talk about India what are the things
that are happening in India what can
happen in India what are the challenges
I think many of the things that I'm
talked about is relevant very much to
google because i think what google
represents to at least us outsiders is
the direction that india seems to be
moving and therefore there is lot of
common ness and i just thought that i'll
still talk about india in this
particular place do interrupt me as
often as you want to so that we can go
interactive as I go ahead and talk first
let me talk about what is this changing
India that I am talking about this in
India changing india i am talking about
the changes in last 12 to 15 years in
there is a very different country than
what I return to in 1981 why I'm sorry
saying is that I returned at IIT Madras
as a faculty applied for a simple
telephone line or in chennai in Madras
the third largest city in the country in
the middle of the city and it took me
eight years to get a telephone this is
the India that we used to know of and
suddenly India has changed and while
talking about changing India oh I always
feel like starting with to understand
India one needs to understand its
billion people and where they are and
this slide to some extent captures it
this is slide which shows the income
levels for the about 65 million urban
households and 135 million rural
households these are household incomes
and if you see the urban household most
of the incomes is around two hundred
dollars if you talk about those with
thousand dollars plus you are talking
about hardly
two to three million households so
really if you want to do something in
India you need to be able to at least
attend to those who are living here with
200 million two hundred dollars per
month household income typical household
is five people similarly when you talk
about 135 million rural household almost
700 million people you are talking about
those with income between sixty two
hundred dollars my feeling is income
level captures very well what can be
done what needs to be done what is a
direction that one has to move it is
this understanding that when we design
products when we design strategies when
we design what we need to do it makes it
becomes tremendous sense as we keep this
income in the mind so it's a large
market a billion people is a large
market large country but at the right
price point so what is this changing
this probably the biggest impact of this
change is felled by understanding
telephony 1994 India had seven million
telephones today it has close to 150
million it is adding six million
telephone lines per month at 70 million
lines per year it is the number one
market in the world for telephony and it
was adding a million line per month in
1994-95 barely ten years back what has
happened it has happened once you
understood that if you want to serve
hundred and fifty million household
their average paying capability is only
seven dollars per month so you start
with that that seven dollars per month
is what they will pay and you have to
build a business which satisfies them
and which makes the business some money
and which essentially meant that the
infrastructure capital expenses had to
be brought down very very significantly
it used to be a thousand dollar per line
infrastructure expenditure in 1994
today's hundred dollars the handset
prices are negligible forty dollars
onwards and this has certainly made once
you get there you suddenly become the
market explodes as is happening these
are the first time it has happened many
of you may know of that in India in 1992
we had 10 million television by 95 we
had 100 million television and the kief
change took place because of two reasons
the first reason is that a
black-and-white television was
introduced by a company in India at
fifty dollars now it is not that
everybody actually bought it at fifty
dollars but that was a starting point
and there the television which was one
hundred dollars and two hundred dollars
it basically brought in whole lot of
people there only about 15 to 20 million
people who bought at fifty dollars
television but it actually gave the
breath and you suddenly got the volume
the second important thing that took
place is a cable television which when
it was introduced one had to pay two
dollars per month can you imagine how do
you provide in two dollars per month how
does an operator make money how does it
make money take care of their capex what
about topics in two dollar per month now
it is this these are the challenges
which were met I can tell you how those
challenges were met but it is when you
met that and of course the content which
in India fortunately because of the kind
of movie industry that we have had for
years was not a problem and suddenly all
the three came together and it and I
believe that similar growth in fact even
on mobile telephony will grow up to
around 200 maybe 250 ml million and then
we will certainly slow down and we then
need to reach rural areas where the
income levels are only one hundred
dollars per month the average revenue
per user will not be seven dollar per
month it will be more like two dollars
per month how do you build
infrastructure which will enable you to
earn money at two dollars per month and
a half a cent per minute today it is two
cents per minute is half a cent per
minute these are the challenges which
kind of let
you use may be the same technology but
upside down and when if you are able to
do that you build something substantial
now today we'd our operators make money
at seven dollars per month nowhere else
in the world any operator makes money at
less than fifteen dollars per month
question is having earned learned how to
do it at seven dollars per month are we
ready to take to take on the world so
once it has learned that is this
possible and this is something that one
is imagining one is looking at our
business houses are looking at expanding
their our company countries which are
little worried about it then what will
happen if the Indian telcos will come
but that's a direction one is what is
moving in fact I don't know how many of
you know I was actually party to this
whole thing I was at the Board of vsnl
the adviser to Reliance we bought tyco
and flag tyco and flag are two companies
which together own sixty-five percent of
undersea optical fiber around the world
these companies were bought by Indian
companies with the objective that as and
when this bandwidth will be needed we
are the ones who will have this
infrastructure the companies had
invested huge amount of money two to
three billion dollars but were bleeding
one hundred million dollars per month
per year and they were losing and their
value was very very low these companies
came and brought this is something that
we couldn't even of thought of 10 years
back this is what's starting to happen
in India and it is not just telecom
industry those of you have traveled to
India in recent times would be amazed by
the kind of growth that has taken place
in airline industry not I it is true
that our airport infrastructure is
terrible but we will solve that problem
also today the airline industry is
booming today at around $35 you can fly
from Chennai to Delhi something that was
unimaginable lower middle class people
can certainly start to travel by air it
used to be two hundred fifty dollars
earlier this is what the cost used to be
two years
back once again what is what is
happening in India which is making these
changes one after another auto sector I
don't know how many of you have heard of
Scorpio tata indica 99% developed within
india projects worth hundred fifty
million dollars research projects these
are the kind of projects that we are
taking and building products which can
stand against anyone else we are already
today it called the auto component
capital of the world how has this
changed taking place what has gone
behind it and today there are some very
interesting experiment public-private
experiment to take us further forward
all of you know about I tnite enable
services 28 billion dollar last year
likely to touch 50 billion dollar in
couple of years time and many of you
must have read this book the world is
flat and I remember meeting him last
year at the iit alumni association the
author of this book and i told him well
if you think that the opportunities have
become equal and the world has become
flat you haven't seen it yet today you
are talking about it because 250 million
three hundred million urban people are
able to compete what will happen when
the next 700 million rural people are
able to come into this market and
compete with others in the world and
that's a changes that we have to look
for these are somewhat visible changes
anyone who has been reading papers know
about this let's talk about some other
not so visible changes I think one of
the change that we properly know of and
it still doesn't do drill does not
register to us we have today 400,000
engineering students graduating every
year the number used to be 25,000 when I
went back to India there are hundred
schools and it was all in public domain
private schools were not allowed and
though there was a huge desire by a most
Indians to study study engineering I'm
taking engineering as one example just
we had bottle
we are not allowing that we of course
did not allow that in the name of
quality and quality is a serious problem
but we opened it up and the quality of
many of these colleges improve there are
uneven quality there are poor quality
ones they have good quality ones the
quality is a major problem we need to
solve that that is a challenge that we
have rather than sort of bottling it up
and sort of saying what we will not
allow the students to graduate the
course this it is this human resources
which I build the industry IT industry
IT enables IT service industry IT
enabled services industry over the last
15 20 years without this in the altar
changed and if you know many of you may
be hearing what South India all this is
happening North India is not happening
the South India is the one which started
all this thing's opening up the
engineering colleges I remember 1984
when in Tamil Nadu was the first state
which opened this up I most of us
opposed it and we were wrong we oppose
is saying that quality will suffer work
yes there was a problem of quality but
gradually the quality can be improved
you can't bottle it up another very
common theme amongst politicians amongst
Indians there are politics is obstacle
to growth and with the recent
reservation debate unsure many of you
may be repeating this again and again
but I think it's a more of a cat more
last 20 years worked with in India have
seen many many governments around the
world and really there is not much of a
difference we make our mistakes just
like anybody else tools we are more
ready to correct it and I'll give you
one example the example of in telecom
sector which is a sector that I know
very well the 3g Licensing in Europe
with a hype surrounding 3g that it will
solve all the world's problem all the
operators in Europe bid astronomical hi
licence fee but since they had bid it
and they were awarded the contract they
had no option the licence fee had to be
paid if they go down let them go down
most of them had
sell off seventy percent of their stake
to simply survive British Telecom is not
thirty percent of what it was so does
french telecom France Telecom German
telecom just to survive who garmin
couldn't do anything well it was a fair
bit it is a democratic country if we go
and help them somebody will accuse us
india went into a very very similar
situation 1994 when we opened up indian
telecom and asked for bidding
astronomically high bids were placed by
people wise we looked at 250 million
three hundred million two hundred
million middle-class and we multiplied
it by twenty-five dollars per month the
income levels for that was available the
average revenue per user from telecom
there is available in the West the
calculations were all done from here and
said how astronomical money can be made
nobody understood even somebody look at
the income levels one could have seller
said well this is not possible but well
we made the mistake and since there was
huge astronomical bidding when the
operators are awarded license nobody
could actually roll out anything if we
almost went into a situation by 98 most
of these telecom companies they're going
bankrupt V in academia along with other
inteligencia took initiative saying this
is not going to work we require went to
the Prime Minister requested him to form
a committee and we were all part of that
committee we changed completely the
rules of the games even though they had
bed hundreds of thousands of billions of
dollars which are sort of sort of say
wave it off make it a percentage of the
total revenue his license and India
Indian telecom took off what I'm trying
to say that we seem to be our politics
seems to be more ready to face reality
than many others in spite of being a
democratic country and now I won't say
in spite because of being a democratic
country and you see the kind of things
that we are doing I will briefly talk
about among the changes that I'm talking
about i will talk about some of the work
that has been done by our own group is
call it a Sten the story of
group telecommunications and computer
network group is a group within IIT
Madras a group of faculty something like
16 or 18 faculty members who have you
baited about 18 companies in last 10 to
12 years incubating entrepreneurs in a
university balancing economic growth and
social development has always been in
our mind and yet I think we have done
something significantly different
basically we believed that one of the
key learning for us was that if you have
big dreams for the nation
intrapreneurship successful business is
the best way to drive this development
dreams this was a big learning for us in
80s and various events in 80's with us
small event like selling of shampoo in a
sachet or a PCO operator assisted PC or
thought or something like this and by
end of 90 we are very firm that it is
the successful entrepreneurship which
can drive big dreams and we then started
in 1994 as i pointed out our group group
dare to dream that in 10 years time we
like to get 100 million telephones when
we had only 7 million telephones I
remember we were laughed at but these
academicians they don't know anything
but we just saw a said we will not give
up we'll work on policy level the policy
was to open it up and allow competition
to come in since none of our business
houses knew had any experience with
telecom be short said will help you grow
the telecom company that's a reason I
got under the board for some of these
companies and at the same time we
recognize the primary bottleneck is
average revenue per user capex and opex
does not match and the key cost is in
the local loop that was the dominant
cost and we knew that as long as you
depend on the copper local loop you
cannot get hundred million because the
price point will not go down and the
capex won't go down op x1 don't go down
and we created a company called Midas we
introduced the concept of violence in
local loop broad cellular telephony and
as we crossed 100 million lines last
year mitis cross two hundred million
dollars worth of revenue may appear to
be small
but in Indian context thousand crore
rupees is a huge amount of money we got
royalties of the world were of three
million dollar satiety when it's
something else I far as we are concerned
we made a significant difference to the
nation when we had dreamt of hundred
million telephones we are taught the
number is large enough that it will
cover all parts of the country and will
cover urban and rural areas by 2001 it
was very clear that this is going to
happen but this is going to happen only
in urban areas ruler are not going rural
areas are going to be left behind no
operator I was in the board of many of
these operators no operator thought
rural areas as a business and it is here
we decided once again to carry out
innovation and so say we will work out
to connect every village in India and
this time it was not just technology but
a lot of business model innovation we
saw said we'll have a business model
very similar to operator assisted PCO
model which has worked so well in urban
areas will go to every village find a
local entrepreneur help them set up by
internet kiosks and get them to drive
services and you are able to do that at
twelve hundred dollars go to a village
and set something like this up but the
most interesting thing is that as we
start learnt how to do it and we were
able to start doing these things the key
question came that is communication the
top priority communication was very
important browsing email was very
important but the priority in the rural
areas or something more and we soon
realize education health care and
livelihood is the key priority and we
sort of said well this is the key thing
that we need to change and we changed
our vision statement from connecting
every village of India to doubling the
per capita rural GDP of India it's a
very bold statement we made that we are
very serious about this we have made
very little progress on it just like
from 94 to 98 we had made it very little
progress on 100 million telephones but
we have done lots of preparatory work
for example we started incubating
companies people say well how are you
going to do work in rural areas people
are not literate we serve all the people
are not rec'd rate will bring
video conferencing and we worked on a
company which do a low bitrate video
conferencing and we started multi-party
video conferencing they started using
that as the primary medium of
communication doing all kinds of things
we were told that well the office
package it's a try the minimum thing
that you need to do is all in English
and we created a company called ck
Shakti which came at a fraction of a
cost Indian language of his package in
eight languages we actually did office
spreadsheet so we had a word processing
spreadsheet email client database and we
actually were able to provide something
like that returns key we are already
using video conferencing to connect
patients in the village to doctors in
the urban areas and it was being used
effectively and when we went back to the
doctors that are you satisfied with it
they said yes but only if I could
measure the temperature of the pressure
patient or if I could get the pulse and
we created another company called
neurosynaptic which made a device which
now we introduced at the kiosk it has a
remote stethoscope the stethoscope is
put in the rural areas the person in the
doctor in the urban area here's the
heartbeat along with the video
conferencing you can do remote
temperature measurement remote blood
pressure measurement pulse count ECG
monitoring the key thing is this device
costs only three hundred dollars created
a company started doing this we
recognize that if you want to make a
difference in rural areas we need to
create enterprises micro enterprises in
rural India for which we need to take
finance to the villages and we started
working with banks why can't you now
with the internet being available do
fire banking in the rural areas and the
banks Allah said yes we could do that
but you know in India you need to
deliver physical nodes only if I could
put a ATM in each village but the ATM
cost twenty thousand dollars for a small
village of thousand population $20,000
makes no sense we took up the challenge
and created a company called vortex
which came up with a ATM and we are
today selling this ATM at between twelve
hundred and sixteen hundred dollars it
has a fingerprint authentication
it has it works with soil nodes now one
will say why soil nodes one of the most
interesting thing that we learn in the
village is that when we took it to the
village and we had taken a new machine
with brand new nodes and somebody drew
the money looked at the node and sorrow
say he's a gentleman we said why are you
asking this question go to the shop he
went to the shop and the shopkeepers
refused to take that saying that doesn't
look like genuine and we saw a said well
it was a soil node it has passed through
so many times if it is passed through so
many hands it has it gives us confidence
and suddenly we went back to the drawing
board and the key to development is not
just for the new nodes but for the soil
nodes and most ATM machines don't work
the that whole technology doesn't work
and we had to work on it took us six
months but we did that to try to make
agriculture and we have this is just the
beginning we have created another group
which has developed a complete weather
monitoring station at each kiosk now we
put something like this measures the
temperature the pressure the the wind
speed the wind speed the rainfall
humidity completely it measures and on
internet it's now stored in a central
place costing only two hundred fifty
dollars again lot of innovation the
interesting thing is that something like
this enables us to do many many things
one microwave the prediction number two
we have introduced very interesting
concept called rainfall insurance in a
village in agriculture the only
uncontrolled variable every the other
variable is a controlled variable the
only uncontrolled variable is rainfall
and we sort of said well that is on
which we need insurance so if the if the
amount of rainfall in a village is less
than a certain amount you have a certain
payout it is above a certain amount you
don't have a payout and it's alternative
to crop insurance and we finding that
much less cheating goes on and it
clearly works much much better well this
is what we are doing in rural areas 100
million phones who are already happening
in urban areas and the question that in
rural areas of course we had to do many
more things driving education was one of
the key thing microwave franchise itn
able services telemedicine I can go on
and on but there's not a talk on which
I'm primary going to talk on rural areas
one of the most interesting thing that
we are trying to do is using the IT
infrastructure in the rural area to
outsource distributed production making
a wine bags making of embroidery and
unfortunately I can't show you this
slide my laptop doesn't work with this
but it's a very very interesting site i
wanted to show you that we have not
taking IT enables services to the rural
areas this particular slide would have
shown you an animation of a work done in
four villages where it's a educational
work which had flash it required
translation into local language it
required recall voice recording and it
required synchronization and putting up
the product this has been done in four
different villages and delivered to a
client in urban areas by something like
this if india has become a so confident
by actually delivering services from
urban india to the west if you can take
this to the rural areas and if people
are even rural areas with computer and
connectivity we are available with young
people very determined hard-working
people if they can start delivering
services will change the rule in india
and this is what we are trying to do
going back to the urban areas 100
million telephones were done we saw said
well we like to see broadband happen
because broadband is highly enabling
education commerce entertainment and we
have hardly two million broadband
connections today 2.2 2.3 so we sort of
said we'd like to see 50 million
broadband connection next five years
time and we are doing everything on the
one hand we are working my dad's got
converted into a broadband connectivity
player and it is coming with all kinds
of innovative technology wireless dsl
cable wireless understanding the indian
kind of situation understanding the
indian price point this is a company
which is actually driving correctly the
same time something which i may be of
immense
interest to you then we are clear a
company called no atrium which is
driving a network PC a multimedia thin
client but this if there is a broadband
the servers are located in the urban
area in the with the telcos and this is
there at the house this has no storage
it's a device which can be turned on and
turned off and therefore nothing no
ashore maintenance no issue of
upgradation no issue of backups and very
very low cost we are looking at eighty
to ninety dollars plus the cost of the
monitor how have you done that we have
done that by doing something very
interesting we actually moved away from
x86 device my Intel we've actually used
a processor that is used in cell phone
or digital single processor and develop
the whole client using the DSP what does
the DSP enables us to do it enables us
to now not only put first of all it is
enables us to do all the multimedia in
the front parent audio coding video
coding audio decoding video decoding
that itself is the primary CPU power the
otherwise the server would have taken we
do all the graphics and screen handling
in the front end and of course all the
mouse and keyboard and all that and find
storage and number crunching otherwise
has done in the back end this concept is
just starting to pick up I believe can
make immense difference because today we
are using the DSP of today's generation
in six months time instead of 1 30
nanometer device will actually get a 90
nanometer technology or internet device
and soon we'll get a 65 nanometer and we
can build it to be as powerful as any
other pc with no more than 1.5 megabit
per second to 1 to 1.5 mega bug and grab
it per second which requires which is
required for bringing the impact for
kind of movie as the broadband
connectivity so this is a kind of thing
that we are trying to drive we believe
that something like this is extremely
important the concept of networked
computing concept of shared computing we
are taking the shared computing goodness
the server is shared the software is
shared
the device is now at home instead of
device being at the at a cyber cafe
that's a concept that we are actually
introducing what never the dream with
which we are working on we want to
create a few couple of billion dollar
product companies out of India and
remember about a year back I introduced
this concept to my group and everybody
reacted that what's happened to Jenn
Jenn wallahi first talks about in dollar
and then he talks in billion dollar we
are a university this is not our dream
and I told them something different i
told them see look at what's happening
to the telecom parent companies from the
West whether it's an oral or ericsson or
loosened alcatel see males they are all
receding because the key expansion is
taking an emerging market and they are
not able to compete who is winning their
huawei ZTE from china this is an
opportunity for indian companies to
become that big and we are probably the
best position to drive those
opportunities and we are looking at
companies like Midas doing all kind of
innovation they look at companies like
teachers that we all create doing some
very interesting work in STM 14 16
becoming tying up with mortals of the
world or motorized of the world
competing against huawei ZTE growing
rapidly into something very significant
companies how to leverage this changing
indium let me give a few thoughts one of
the thing for example is a very strong
desire throughout the country amongst
youngsters amongst inteligencia amongst
women politicians scientists that can we
now think of becoming leaders in a few
technology areas we have done well but
we're still not leaders amongst the
leaders well not there's not necessarily
that you you can be at number one number
two and you believe that these are again
something that 10 it has to drive at
least in one area or maybe two areas can
we each can we try to push us central
leadership wireless is one such area
that we have identified and we believe
there is a grill opportunity in eight to
ten years to become amongst the leaders
we have a very interesting thing that we
are trying to do just outside IIT Madras
build a research park very similar to
Stanford Research Lab we have seen the
bringing together the faculty students
and Industry RND personals together what
does it do both in terms of innovation
incubation entrepreneurship as well as
driving established complaints and we
got we went to the government were able
to get a land we are building this
facility and hoping companies like yours
can come and set up their R&amp;amp;D facility
work jointly variety the back gate of
this goes to IIT and it becomes extended
campus can we these are the kind of
things that we need to do try to these
are successful in u.s. you have seen not
just Stanford Research Lab if you go to
the technology highway on next to MIT
and Harvard if you go to the North
Carolina triangle you will go to the
South Ferry Florida research park these
are kind of things that has been
successful and we are hoping to do
something like this let me come to some
other challenging problems which we
probably haven't sufficiently given
thoughts off to and they're very serious
problem and we need to nearly come to it
and we believe technology can do a lot
in something like this for example 20
million children enter school every year
in India they get very poor education
most of them because they are very for
infrastructure very poor teachers and
teachers cannot be created overnight if
you don't attend to this will land up
into serious trouble can we use
technology to overcome the shortcomings
and find solutions in a very similar
manner i talked about college education
and i'm not talking about not just
engineering huge two million people go
into college most of the college are
very poor teachers but there's enough
very good teachers can we use technology
to enable in absence of sufficient
number of quantity of good teachers
we are fairly focused on making india a
product house conceptualize build and
drive new products from india use indian
talent use indian academy we are very
clear that one of the key strategy has
to be the developer work for ourselves
not for the Western market for the
emerging market because if you develop
that you will develop it at the very
different price point you develop it at
that price point you are the leaders you
are the leader because once you develop
it at that price point you can go
anywhere else in the world it has to be
tested sufficiently in India if you
straight away go to the west well those
corporations which drew that have to be
actually driven from the West not from
India dreams like 50 million broadband
connections are not should be 10-8
dreams these are the dreams but Google
should drive this will really create
huge market and what are the kind of
innovations that are required we are
doing lot of innovations these are kind
of dreams and a drive or doubling the
per capita rural gtp once again has to
be nations dream has to be dreams of
lots and lots of people within India and
outside and 10 years will get there we
we have to do lots of things for example
the key bottleneck in this is not coming
to come from other things it's going to
come from power distributed power
generation 25 kilowatt 200 kilowatt
power plant in every village grid
electrical power reaches but that our
supply our generation is always less
than the the demand and it will be all
sab dinner bulerÃ­as only the leftovers
will go to the rural areas as and when
there is a surplus no industry can
thrive in rural India with something
like this can we have a distributed 100
kilowatt power plant whether it is solar
power plant or a biogas or a biodiesel
whatever nor wind these are challenges
that we have to do today it is possible
to start moving in that direction their
ventures that can be set up you don't
need to be an expert in these areas you
need to be a very general expert and a
determined entrepreneur to solve this
and these are something that can grow
necessarily you will do it in six
hundred thousand religious well and you
need to have a business model of
actually running these plants somebody
running these fronts and distributed
power well I'll just take one minute
about this because I don't know how many
of you know about a program called
National Rural Employment Guarantee
Scheme it's one of the largest social
program ever designed anywhere else in
the world a world it is a very simple
program that every household in India
rural household in India will be given a
minimum of 100 days guaranteed
employment now the number of households
are large 170 million so it's a very
very 150 million it's a very powerful
program now one may say does this kind
of give out really work I mean of course
all of us react to it but remember that
if you can do something like this first
of all it eliminate hunger and
eliminating hunger is extremely critical
I learned this from my one of my
teachers 15 years back tamil nadu
introduced this noon meal scheme in 1985
in simple that when you go to school
middle of the day you are going to give
me given once me if tamil nadu today is
doing so well and then Andhra and
Karnataka is doing so well all of them
introduce that one after another it is
because of this it's only when you feed
children or otherwise going hungry you
are making sure that their brain
develops this program could
theoretically build rural infrastructure
it can significantly add to the rural
income the biggest problem is most of us
believe that there will be huge leakage
and hardly anything will go to the
radius that's a reason many of us
opposed to this program and you of
course wanted a very time limited and
become and can we use technology to
overcome something like this leakage
corruption there are many things that
has happened in India may technology can
be used I can talk more and more about
it I will stop here by just saying that
India has changed immensely over last 10
years it is not 12 15 years not the same
in d
is a very confident India I often sort
of say I went to iit kanpur one of the
best schools in the country had some of
the best teachers in the world very
convert but I know one thing that I show
me one from our best teachers are sort
of say technology is something that the
West can do today I find youngsters
coming to the our Institute's or any
other Institute they feel they're as
good as anyone else in the world that
confidence has come in India I'm sure
that is come in China this is what is
making the world flat that confidence
can we capitalize on this and what I was
also pointed out that while immense
number of things are being done we have
immense number of problems I am NOT
trying to list most of them this is a
time where those who care not just for
India this is the problem if we solve
the problems were India will actually be
solving the problem for most the half of
the world or a 65 person of the world
which has been done otherwise deprived
and most of us people like you have
immense capability I think question is
are we willing to get into this and do
something which will be driven by
entrepreneurship spirit but something
which can change the world I believe
that's the google spirit and I'm come
here requesting you to participate in
that thank you very much
I'm any questions comments discussions
thank you for coming dr. ginger douala
when I left India for the first time it
was still this was in 92 it was still
taking years and years to get jelly
phone line and I lived in India last
year and I was extremely surprised to
get a telephone telephone line in one
day so I do know what you mean by it's a
change to India my quest I've also been
to one of your n log kiosks in rural
Karnataka and my question to you is that
you seem to be doing glass smiled
through RF and not very far from this
kiosk I saw those orange milestones that
BSNL puts up where they lay fiber so the
quiz and I I was shocked to find out
that eighty to ninety percent of the
fiber is unused so is there anything
happening with BSNL and the dark fiber
being lit up all right there is huge
fiber in India going to everything look
headquarters does not go beyond that
Dalek headquarters which is like a
County headquarters 15 to 20 kilometer
radius you will find at the center of
that a town where the fiber goes the
fiber used to only belong to BSNL today
you'll find at least two operators
bringing the fiber BSL or Tata reliance
Bharti as soon as you have introduced
competition everybody has started
changing a year crack it was almost
impossible e connectivity at that
particular point used to be so expensive
that my whole income of the kiosk will
go into something like that and it was
to be very poor collectivity eight
months six months back we switched over
to another operator in all these places
things change too
just that operator but BSNL also
provides almost as good a surface what I
am trying to point out that there has to
be ways you can go on knocking your head
against a wall it sometime doesn't solve
the problem price point is significantly
dropped I all that I can say it's about
one-fifth the price point that we used
to pay till about a year back we today
are able to get a 64 kilobit per second
drop 128 kilo per second drop approx at
100,000 rupees so we have built our own
rural backbone we are in 32 locations
today we have our access center and we
have built our own location thing we can
take 256 512 whatever we want 2mbps as
the demand grows and it is not really
very very expensive and then we actually
provide 150 to 200 kiosk in that area
that's how a we are doing it your price
points have dropped very simply I think
today it is almost okay but I price
points are going to further drop I'm not
worried about that anymore we have
learned that introducing competition is
one of the best way to try to deal with
incumbent particularly government or
functionaries they will either become
irrelevant or they will cooperate what
is the legal status of private power
generation in India can i generate power
and feed it to the grid good question
two years back it was not allowed today
the bill has been passed in the
parliament and you are allowed to
generate power and distributed there are
still some licensing issues which are
being sorted out by the time we really
solve this problem will sort this out
nothing in India happens very fast you
need to do things understand particular
when you deal with politics and you deal
with bureaucracy you need to be on it
you need to plan it be on it the right
things are done thanks for the talk this
was most wonderful and really exciting
to see the changes you're talking about
the vision and ambition that you have
for for everything going on in India on
the last slide you ended with a call to
to us as individuals and I said Google
to participate in the in this vision
that you're painting here and the
changes that are going on did you have
any ideas about specific ways that both
individuals and companies can
participate in in what you've outlined
um this is one of our failures that we
still have not been able to get
individuals to participate well maybe
our own limitation maybe we have to
brainstorm maybe we have to think about
it maybe some of you have to but some of
us don't understand what you can
actually do how much time or energy or
other things companies like Google I
think I have a better understanding they
need to promote almost every single
thing that I pointed out can this be a
project that can be done by between
Google and IIT Madras standard group
that will how to train to an email in
general I'm sure one can at least make
an attempt at it you may not succeed
does not can we take their how to make a
significant difference to the college
education dreams like doubling the per
capita rural GDP can you create a group
it's it more difficult for us can you
create a group in first google
officially but can you create a group
here who will work with us there are 10
15 serious people bra broadband in india
it could be a group with can work with
us Bray brainstorm and then find
whatever needs to be done individually
it becomes a little more difficult when
individual you right i mean our
bandwidth gets limited they are already
trying to do probably too many things
many other things we are messing it up I
don't want to paint a rosy picture I
think we mess up lots of things only
thing is that you learn to learn
I have been given signal that I have
only one more minute you mentioned that
the the telecom industry actually the
mobile telephone industry had a lot of
technical innovations and business model
innovations to get to the price point
where they did it sell us a little bit
about that I think very very interesting
one of the companies that I will talk
about is party two years back they
decided that they will outsource all
their IT work all their out I t work
including billion customer care complete
IT systems etc to a company and believe
it or not rose IBM huh outsource it to
IBM not by paying them anything saying
that you manage for my whole network
complete this you put in your investment
you put in your money you put your
equipment take a fraction of the total
revenue so if I am getting seven dollars
may I will give you thirty cents out of
it I mean this is first step that they
took one of my student who did PhD with
me one of my student was driving this
program first year use a total mess
because they got their experts within
IBM to come and define the kind of
infrastructure that is required and
remember that this is a company which
tries to sell infrastructure so they try
to maximize not optimized so they sold
to themselves huge amount of
infrastructure and they bleed it like it
anything at the end of one year and then
I remember he came to me and said this
will not work what do we do hmm this
also you throw all these consultants out
look for totally different who know how
to optimize you need to reduce costs and
they worked out and since it's a large
company it was able to work it out the
second year they made money same thing
was repeated saying all my base station
etcetera is outsourced to let's say
Ericsson I don't remember which company
they did that
they put their mothering they'll get
certain sense out of my art pool very
interesting innovations in the model and
not giving it to smaller company giving
it to the top class multinational who
has the wherewithal to find solution to
problem like this and finally as you
grow so today the whole business model
party is that I will only own the
license and all the qur'an the customers
and the backbone nothing else everything
is going to be out sourced very
interesting business model bringing in
efficiency of course how do you they
also did a lot of work was done to try
to optimize infrastructure lot of
optimization of infrastructure lot of
use or local stuff as much as possible
those were parts of it beyond that we
need to do a one-to-one discussion to
get into it I just give you one example
for example one of the things that they
decided not to use a single Cisco switch
till that time they were using only
Cisco switch IBM recommended the 3com
switch no not even three comma I think
that company from Taiwan that which does
one of the cheapest switch I don't
remember the name but they use their
switches I mean simply when you want to
optimize your sort of say okay you throw
it out after two years now then up front
load it and then bleed I guess my time
is over so I am being a given signal my
time is over I am over available to you
informally right now for a little while
if you want to discuss something but
thank you very much for inviting me and
letting me give my talk sorry that what
are two slides I couldn't show you
properly thank you very much
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
