type of speaker dr. cousin started from
god's garbage Aramis and then he has
been done my supervisor in there also my
very close friend and everything and I
think quite happy to her brother is hot
on the mobile revolution calculating the
boundaries of the unfunded we just copy
and then you can think the any like the
job in the to say something Oh Christian
okay and then I start please break up
the look the customs aren't a very much
and it's a pleasure to be in Japan this
particular pleasure to be here google
I'm trying to collect to see how many
Google shots I can visit around the
world this is my second I have been to
London but I'm working my way around so
hopefully before I retire and have at
least three or four under this so I'm
going to is a little bit daunting
because of course as an academic I'm
trained in trying to catch people's
attention by giving an interesting title
and then desperate try to live up to the
hope that you have that this type will
also be met by a talk that can install
you about this issue and and the problem
I have is of course that all of you and
live this life we all live this mobile
life and daily basis so all I can in
essence hope for is to try and put some
words on your own experiences so it's so
is I'm not one that's been to the moon
and come back and show you what the moon
was like and you would not be able to
tell anything whether we correct or not
because I would be the only one having
experiences this is really a talk about
the shared experience we all have and
I'm afraid as a representative for the
community globally is unfortunately also
an aspect of life that we know very
little about so when when Moscow did his
ph team would be a year scene he
finished in 2003 and and I decided that
I was going to write a book based on his
ph.d and other PhDs that came after and
I managed to finish the book last year
right so I'm very slow in writing books
lately but nobody had bothered doing
anything similar so there is so little
research on the subject of the mobile
world and one of the things I've got a
report on today some of the research
we've done with the commercial company
in the UK and even the service we then
are very unusual or relatively unusual
so here we go so we can start with a big
picture so I'm afraid for place like
Google I'm going to do something unusual
i think i'm going to go back in the past
and then move my way up to the to the
press and then hopefully get a bit into
the future but if we look at what what
is called the spaces of capitalism and
if we start with a 19th century it was
basically you've seen it in in the
movies it's like him with funny hair the
speaking funny having kneel on the
trousers and basically consumption was
that was for the very few and so when
there's about when there's about a
million people in the UK back in the
1850s or so there was about 50,000
people in the in England or Great
Britain that crash for buying a book and
he was not until the invention of the
penny press that that honor if you can
afford buying a newspaper and neither
was attacks on newspapers because they
were dangerous people might often create
an authorizing against the powers but
this emerging middle classes were sort
of beginning to aspire to some sort of
function as we all know because we all
children of the 20th century the transit
center is about consumption of products
and indeed mass consumption of products
and we have consumed ourselves to death
and we are threatening the planet
increasingly but but the ends of it is
that it's transactions of products and
all our industrial complex has focused
all its attention to be good at ensuring
transaction on a product transactions
and to spread that to as large and
audience as possible so now in China and
India they want cars and one of my
Finnish friends once said I fear the day
that that everybody in the world wants
to use toilet paper because then there
will be no more trees left in Finland so
this idea of a mass a global mass
Society for the consumption of products
is there is a 20th century and everybody
is talking about 21st century and the
server society and the knowledge society
and of course a company like yours is
there is a key institution of that
society and what I want to initially
here would argue is that that society is
in many ways different from the previous
one at least in terms of making money
it's different because it's about
providing interview ization it's about
providing support to individuals through
through relationships and services and
there are lots of exams on that and I'm
gonna briefly discuss some of those late
later but the point is of course if we
look at that the need for various kinds
of technologies that these are radically
different and a lot of the logic that
that you see in the way organizations
behave a very much based on the 20th
century and which is also of course why
Martin companies like Amazon and Google
and Apple have been able to cut through
marketplaces like they're like a hot
knife in warm butter because the
existing organizations have absolutely
no clue how do we organize themselves
and in the process there's lots and lots
and lots of consultants and guru
make tons of money trying to help them
and to absolutely no avail if you look
at this you can argue that mobile
technology far from being just an
incidental innovation this idea that the
technology drives the tribes society you
can easily look at from the other point
of view that society drive innovation of
course is that is the Americanization of
all of the forces of a modern day
compared capitalism of making people
into individual consumers is one that is
very meaningful to the understanding
that there's each individual need to
interact with each other individual if
you look at this there is a master post
in a massive first for this this
innovation the fact is that there's at
least more than 1 billion mobile phones
in developing countries indeed one of
the success one of the most successful
athletes the business models for mobile
telephony in developing countries is how
small increments into spending your
money on how most multi of increments
you can you can pay in storm and what is
clear is that people cannot afford it
still are desperate to pay for mobile
connectivity there are lots of these
studies you an offer for every
percentage of mobile phone ownership
what is the percentage of light years
that you make more money every month and
all these economic investigations but
the key one of the key points i think
has been expressed most succinctly by
alien ship chaser back in two thousand
seventy usually some sort of it not
reserved for not yet and ebay see says
well you have your keys represent
shelton your money your credit card
represents uh students that represent
the fact that you can you can buy some
food and your mobile phone represented
security that you can always get in
touch with somebody if you've lost your
keys are not any money and the ipad that
we have made throughout our research in
the group
heading in in London is of course that
that the fundamental change is merely
but very importantly that the closer you
rent technology to the body the more
important if it comes to you so if some
of you are familiar with English culture
you will know that we have something
called bar might is the yeast extract
and then it said what you normally say
about my life it's a love and hate
product and either you love it or you
hate it the mobile phone is like ultra
Marmite you both love and hate it at the
same time and this is one of the
audience i'm going to make later on so
this is the cost rain which you might
all know it but it isn't one slide then
I think there's a world market for maybe
five computers that was IBM's chairman
from what thomas watson 43 there's no
reason fine individuals have a computer
in his home that's decks mouth and
recently deceased can open in 77 engaged
when it's incredibly conservative
microsoft was founded with a vision of a
computer on every desk and in every home
forget it i'm enrolled in at least three
or four computers on a cycle of you know
this ipod on my hand and you know this
communities like this one so forget it
damn it as my eyes at night you want the
most profound technologies are those
that disappear that they weave
themselves into the fabric of everyday
life life until I indistinguishable from
it so the point is of course this is
what is happening this utilization of
technology and what that leads to will
experience in a moment I'm going to go
through this in detail but but but this
basically shows how fast it has
developed from 1866 when the first
telegraph transatlantic cable allows
communication from Europe to to America
and then in 1910 as you in case you
didn't know it was the first mobile
phone ever it was ericsson last magnet
ericsson he built a mobile phone for his
wife's illness calm unfortunately she
had to stop the car and have a guy who
oven and attach the area of heavy piece
of wire up to the telegraph cable for
telephone cable to talk
and then of course ah sponsor Osborne's
thesis of prediction in 1954 which is
you should read it it's fantastic
amazingly predicted that in the future
when a person is born they will get an
ID mobile phone number and then we
launched with and throughout their whole
life and you be like a national security
number and I'm sure the powers that
Google would love that to happen because
you would make such much easier there
will be one there will be one key that
will easily decide something now now the
mobile phone itself across this w will
know it was hot in Cooper's about the
role of the made a phone call from a
handle phone to a speech lying phone the
doctor Jo Ingles at Bell Labs saying
haha it confirmed like Seaver Simpson
the guy's name he goes like I had been
because these two white boy locked into
a battle and the most interesting thing
about this story was it took it took not
relatively long before the first first
first one gene network in some place you
might remember because it was NT teen so
it was here and he was only six years
but he took much longer before sweets
America because of reg regulatory issues
but he's look at some 1973 until 2016
West his perspective to be 10 billion
mobile connected devices this year was
groundbreaking mrs. first time in
history there were more mobile connected
devices and people in the world right
yes so far nobody's bothered to really
much research on effects of that so so
this is a this is the kind of technology
that started out there I thought of you
more personal this is from 1998 this is
my first mobile phone I thought at least
I could be metrosexual about my choice
with mobile phones and then a science 5c
and I could read email on the train to
London mmm of course this is a picture
from 2010 and I'm sorry there's no input
from
nicely I think it's early 2000 tell you
because this is looks like an iphone one
but by this of course and if you look at
this development about the
infrastructure and these clients parts
of of both GPS and Wi-Fi are all sorts
of things and our track these I believe
from like 10 years mmv and the game boys
on all of them it refuses to die I think
it's fantastic it's that if I have
something that's part of our DNA the
game boys but but the point is of course
we have to look at this as an
intelligent infrastructure and this is
important part of trying to understand
the effects of it and we had to
understand it as intelligent
infrastructure that does not only
include the mobile phone it includes a
very importantly NFC I mean being in
Japan your of course surrounded by NFC
technology and the rest of the world is
test we trying to work out what you use
it for I talked to somebody who makes
NFC technology components or catches in
Japan and he says the problem is every
time when it talks about NFC in terms of
money and banking but there's no money
in doing NFC money so which is because
my google I more like to success than
others simply because it is not
important for Google's make money on the
NFC payments it's a completely different
deal your advertisement company so so
here you have just listed just a small
part of what you can imagine what you
can imagine ups or complete technologies
but one of the first one of the most
important aspects of that is is in terms
of machine-to-machine communication
which is storming ahead and becoming
more more important until the day where
Skynet will officially do out with all
of us and so the same picture cause is
this one is is that in every pocket and
handbag and chair and wherever you can
imagine there will be there will be
stuff in involved with collecting data
today turn it will be deeply
personalized and they'll be very fast
connectivity to various men cloud
services this is like this over this now
there's nothing contentious about that
I'm a small picture that shows my extra
bit difficult to see there but he just
chose a funky Congress the basically
shows so the Aleut devolution of
personal computing from 1975 on tip 2011
and you just see these all these kind of
devices that are real down mobile or
portable devices so here is that the rim
and what's between one as the simian on
oh sorry yes symbian one oh yeah I used
to know the sum of the city of people at
this moment you are supposed to mark you
supposed to be sympathetic okay so so
you have so you have this incredible
growth and of course somebody wants to
told me I can't remember who but but if
you if you take the world expenditure on
communication and measures that against
the world total expenditure on
computation then there's no competition
people in order if you are much more
willing to spend money on communicating
on communication products or services
than they are on computational products
or services so this idea is a mobile
phone here's an ETA which one is going
to win the mobile phone is now going to
be the PDA weather and of course in
communication people spend a little
money on television radio CDs movies or
this idea of human interaction either by
proxy or directly it is in current much
great expenditure then this idea that
you can you can you can have a a pc on
your desk and if you look at the rate by
which and drawing an ipad a knife
and bring the incredible strong the
diffusion code here is of course example
of the fact that they meet they tap into
an under demanded need I'm sorry I
should have taken a Google+ by the team
but who the is not not yet the
third largest country in the world ok
there's China and India and in this way
hey go married it like sensor I had
expected we're so so pleased p % of
users Facebook they go on any day and
young him how much time do they spend 40
90 this is Professor young in you is
very famous he's from Temple University
he's come just to listen to me so I'd
better do well there's a professor would
I hit return from Chalmers universities
and my wife so I'm in trouble no matter
what I did so the time is of course you
know so that when I first saw facebook
about my account and I thought this is
useless when I got twitter i thought
this is completely useless and look how
wrong I was we were lots of you were
wrong about this but it has somehow
tapped into a knee and we want to
explain it sort of it in larger terms
this is actually a is from from
literally than you and this is you you
are you so this from a cable they wrote
where they basically argue that the
process that we experiencing one that
has three forces that comes together in
a perfect storm the first force is your
mass scale so the fact that everybody
has access to the technology the mobile
technology and Internet technology
together you can in this mobile all I
would say portable you can carry it with
you and then it's a convergence and
digital versions we will talk about that
late for this idea of as a converging
various media into one that creates this
incredibly strong force that allows new
thing
to happen in fairly unexpected ways so
I'm just going to pause a bit and and
just relate to a stud there some studies
we did just to give you a glimpse of
these global life reports we wrote with
carphone warehouse some years ago from
2006 2008 so we looked at why this life
across the UK u.s. Germany Spain France
and Sweden in a number of service and
they're all available on the web you can
download reports I don't know how
relevant they I anymore because the last
one was done in 2008 literally collected
the data just when the ice on had begun
to launch so it just goes to show it's a
lot of it is old news but since
communication is such an incredible
important part of the use of mobile
technology so it will be still relevant
so so if you look at the 6 to 10 of
atoms in the US and UK has one or more
laptops in 2008 if you look at the
roaring now special area computers are
on the way down people want some sort of
portability the seventy percent of
people make 125 all the days or what we
saw was relatively low intensity of
calls and we saw we saw SMS messages
replacing voice calls but we also saw
already in 2008 that the group of 16 to
18 year old Americans they were thing
with using SMS messages like you you
couldn't imagine it was on average like
16 to 20 a day and that's average the
incredible heavy intense shoes I think
one factor that could be the popularity
of blackberry because these message has
been were free only for Team seven
people will turn the phone off
completely when having sex and this was
a month step 17 thousand atom and took
nipples in 2006 so there's two
informations of this what is that that
AT&amp;amp;T people are so passionate that they
don't have time for husband all when
they throw themselves to each others
arms
having lived in England for nine since
1995 I can refuse that so it is clearly
cousin Cici people Trump think of the
option of turning it off it just has to
be turned up on that way of course the
iphone button of silence and not silence
is described genius because all you want
is to not have brain but they want to
know if anybody tries to call them
further the 13 set of adults admit to
having shipped check their parent that
they're heartless email or internet
search history and one in ten minutes on
the same to a friend I won't be
embarrassing here and ask you to have to
put up the hand but this I don't have a
third of adults they admit checking
their partner's Bob on phone so it is a
it is of course to see if they have been
up to something which of course
statistically they have the certain set
of youngsters interact with strangers
online very disturbing and in ten
percent admit to being bullied on a
mobile phone sorry when I came in this
youngster what would a true and so I
think it's a bit we get our children and
they're not at all so we do there's some
legal issues so the survey we got we did
was in England but between I think from
the age of 10 up to the age of 18 so
let's say open so a bit too Tencent of
the people of atoms admit to being
addicted and then why did i write this
so this is a new talks i'm being
possible okay so this is what i said ok
so what this is because if the man to do
it sir
hey Sarah so what happened what happened
when you look at these data is if we
make a distinction between between moral
issues and educate issues so the
modeling issues are like what is really
right around I now have not killed by a
neighbor's wife or something yes without
you're not possessed thy neighbor's
stuff all these there are moral issues
then there is incredible homogeneous
attitudes across all countries again
across all age group like what is right
and what is wrong so if you ask people
you know which I think we did was it
right for you to check your partner's
mobile they would also hope it's not
very right but I did it anyway so that's
like a moral issue whereas the etiquette
issue is like if you have mobile phone
call if you're a mobile phone I call now
if your phone would vibe right now how
many would would go out and pick up the
call Wow one no I think because you're
Japanese you feel that if you want it
says it just be polite so these matters
of any case what really is the case here
is that people find it very difficult
they're very very different attitude so
the younger you are the more they think
is right to text and talk weather with
other people with once you reach the
third thing should run 40 beds like no
no you never do this but but you look at
the behavior the actual behavior people
still do some people still even even
though they don't think it's right that
there's this notion of how you behave is
changing this one here and ninety
percent and this was in that this was in
two thousand eight ninety percent
exactly the same as you as in UK says
that they access even access incident
are when your holidays to write perk to
read personal email 19th century's
connectivity is not to change the
weather current affairs and not even
work email least a few of you can't stop
you want to connect to other people so
we asked people which of the following
they had done so that finished a
relationship by text message talking
over phone
we'll look I take Jimmy Thomas Biggs
message sending a text message
containing a line saying sorry but text
to avoid the principal room and but the
one but what is of course yes so what
are you Canadian I don't know if I'm up
French cause but but it's right and so
it's funny right of course it's
interesting find the difference for
what's really interesting is how
people's etiquette changes this very
very nice cooker matter an academic book
by which link called new tech new ties
on MIT press 2010 when goes through in
great detail and really explore social
life of how social life is both the same
and very different through the use of
mobile technology and there's also of
course we also found that the UK is that
it was the most texting nation of all
the six nations we studied and one
reason for that is the obvious is that
the UK mobile sector of our mark is more
advanced than most of the other markets
we stood studied but also that I think
in ink in English cited this idea of
creating some distance between you and
this is clearly a very important use
that is and this is warmed me up to one
of the main points I'm going to make
that the technology has two
contradicting purposes at the same time
which is on the one hand you can be used
by people so SMS messages can be used by
people who would like to create a
distance is easier to fire somebody on
text message you can't hear them cry it
was like I'm sorry I'm really really
sorry but we have
60 characters your file on the other
hand you can also argue like this any
copper from Paris who argues that that
is constant demand constant connectivity
it creates a connected presence in
connecting couldn't it contains the
opportunity for beauty who sends a kind
of presence by connecting to each other
very frequently so that to sort of be
gave the distance by having these
constant use that somehow makeup makes
up for this lack of core essence so this
is an important point we're going to
touch upon later so this is Massoud but
either should I say miss our son of a
side of Dharma or this one myself this
was massage ram one of the models here
we came up with through his PhD where
what you can say is and I want to sort
of dispute this model today that's my
whole purpose so to say something has
happened since 2001 and so we have of
course at this mobilisation of
interaction leads to a spatial fluidity
of course that you used to be rid of you
confined to only talk to people when
you're the same room now you can cross
distances at least within the planet and
temporally you can also argue that what
used to be defined this you can say the
linear clock time you now interaction is
now replaced with what's called social
time that the temporalities is socially
defined you all know that because I shoe
mostly they're working projects in the
beginning of the project time is very
slow strikes out at the end of the
project time is very on strips and very
short so you have this event the social
definition of when are we busy when I
will not be see how late are we is that
is is changing through this ability to
stretch time and compress it with mobile
technology and of course contextually
that our context the context where baked
in a used to be substantiated by exactly
who we were with what resources we had
what we were doing now to be much more
flexible coordinate because because all
of our phone does really is it
penetrates one context and connect
to another and then people will have to
make up this and say hello are you
visiting what are you doing is one of
those common things you asking because
they don't know so what's come out of
all of this I'm glad you stand over
heaven is is sort of a technological
mess okay so there's this technological
complex mex mess of gadgets and services
but but what's really interesting is
when you look at it sort of in the wild
it also creates this emerging mess and i
just want to point out one picture
because my wife will recognize this is
that when we went to venice in 2004 when
a very romantic trip with a gondola down
the canals of Venice and this man's on
the mobile phone the entire time talking
to it to the auto repair shop and his
car repair and I thought I one is enough
Atlantic point2 why did you come he's in
Venice but so we see this this mess and
of course in in terms of work if you
look at it that's what I prepare so my
stubborn and our colleagues have spent a
decade of all studying is what happens
but always at work and of course what
you can say is that you can distinguish
between co-located work and remote
working and stationary work and mobile
working so this is sort of local local
movement and this is more remote
positioning and you can say the
traditional office work which is based
on one place and not moving they even
have a medical profession of thetan you
go round so they have to go where the
patients are because they've got broken
legs and stuff so yes you have to work
as a professional and then you have
virtual team work or teleworkers to have
fixed locations but remotely and of
course what's happening is this strong
move up towards mobile working where
where you not only do not know where you
love you can't get hold of the very
quickly and exactly interesting
companies martin companies like Google
they take a very dim view to to a mobile
working very very very interesting and
for meanness and that's an interesting
sign and this is one of the main
arguments I'm going to be
today but all this technology allows
these huge explosion of all the
boundaries which means you have to
invent new ones and it's so difficult or
vent new ones that the easiest one is
just to say you stay here there are
reasons for that when so this is a my
friend in quotation marks team man and
he is the grain computer since the late
70s and the Union IV and we invited
keynote speaker at a concert once some
years from 2005 and he sent an arm even
with a PDF say I would love to be a
speed it will be fifty thousand dollars
this is the stage I wanted the lighting
and and so I moved a small academic
conference so since then I loved it
every single time I guess so so I want
to ask the women in the room and this is
a ritual whether it is in technological
development is always an improvement so
you can see what Steve space the answer
is you know it was awesome anyway so the
price of this I'm not crying but but but
the plight of the slide is really that
he has spent is obviously the entire
academic career trying to invent
technology that allows him to be a
cyborg and yet we are all now cyborg we
all have cameras up with our pockets in
our phones we all have everything he has
we have now is just called smartphone so
the point is all this is spoke hardcore
stuff that costs a fortune is now with
everybody's pocket is slightly different
but the effect is the same and that's
very very interesting because that means
that he's with the very true thing book
on when when everybody in the world and
surveying you you can use this stuff to
survey them and this book was actually
quite at his mind because what you see
now is of course this Monday journalists
from the odd right in his North Africa
and all of that is examples of how
people use this technology very famously
in Iran during the riots in Iran that
that this technology is used as
distributors means a lot of surveying
the one who serve a oz this is very very
interesting however the problem is and
it provides one thing mainly and which
is dirt cheap connectivity so this is
what we get this is that this is an old
honey will pull at
from 1981 what the heck is electronic
even the most is to take the most
precise description to me of what
electronic mail is as I hope you will
learn remarried and so so what happens
can be explained in terms of sort of
simple metaphors then you have stability
in the old offices and actually which
Martin companies like Google of course
are trying to reinforce and maintain
namely you have the boundaries of office
buildings that you have you have what's
called what modern law called regions so
you can play likely to seek and of
course you can't play hide-and-seek
anymore because you have your bloody
mobile phone with you where is in the
old days you could play hide-and-seek
and this is how an insurance company
back in church it is in New York all the
way not sitting in the middle sitting
straight all the men are sitting in the
science more slapdash it's an as well my
wife has asked me to say this then take
the replacement of you say networks for
this notion we have is that we live in a
networked world where we have all these
network connections but the problem with
that but it doesn't work because it is
not a stable state this is an
intermittent state that we never
experience well maybe when we had our
first event experienced it but now we
have moved on because this one has this
notion that you're still in control that
you're in control of connectivity but if
I give this a quick straw poll I would
guess that most people here would not
know who the next email would be from or
when you would get your next call it
will be your surfing so so you are here
at surfing and he saw always you surf
the pipe sometimes you what they and how
I call in the washing machine when you
when you fall off the wave and you get
down there for a couple of minutes and
the problem is of course that you are
not in control it's a fluid state when
you're trying to come to terms with the
ever changing its situation throughout
the day I'm just going to see what's
going on oh yeah
okay i want to be able to finish but
it's okay you won't know what you're
missing so the problem we have is is
that the way we see the world is often
like in this product of the elders
pictures from kunssler house in vienna
is this is a catalog of children's games
from the Middle Ages and medieval times
where this is interaction then you meet
people and you make pizzas you make you
make fun and you have connections and
it's a and you can be on Facebook and
Twitter and have you can have people
here this is a facebook and this is
Twitter over his Google+ is little bit
on its own another way we're soon it
ever know but then but the point is of
course this is a big fake pictures the
fourth picture is one without boundaries
and the problem is the biggest problem
is this is not scalable this
unboundedness interaction is not
scalable and that's the problem we have
now I'm going to skip this one sorry
it's a really good point I'm gonna skip
present there's a paper that is complete
just so that you know that did a visit
in its convergence hello Bob you should
follow him I have another question up a
new computer can i tape a movie from a
cable TV that's exit from a measly I'll
to my cd-rom and even if my brothers say
to the phone so you can make a copy on
his neighbor's camcorder match the
situation and what that does just to
give you the eyeliner walls can see what
that does it takes all these nice nice
verticals between content education
infrastructures and just explore the
boundaries so here i can replace apple
with google these new and with amazon
and with facebook these new institutions
comes in they can stretch the concert
application and infrastructure and grab
the control it is a different it's a
different topic altogether but but but
the technological development is one
where you move from desktop PCs and
laptop PCs and washing machines which
are pervasive that knows what you have
dirty the closes and other times
information technology and you end up
minister of your beauty sation of
Technology access and you had this
notion that people then have your
Victor's interconnectivity you can just
you can do anything you want anytime you
want that's a that's the whole notion
but not always because the problem is
opposed in all of this anything can be
screwed up more
computer it can multiply the screwing up
to this is a a new story recently
volkswagen turns up blackberry email
after work hours right so the problem is
is we look at the relationship between
humans and technology then this is a
process of continuous mutual adjustment
and if it's just the product is not such
a big deal it's a fairly straightforward
issues so you get a new pair of shoes
you walk in the Navy can your shoes the
problem we have is when when its
services then it involves a constant
mutual adjustment between the user and
that service that they in any quit and
of course a good you know that really
well because the way you innovate is to
try small changes and then people have
to adjust and see how they how they
think about this adjustment the problem
is also that this relationship between
the customer and the services they use
it cannot be described in the same
simple manners if you take this as a
computer musician from the Bay Area in
San Francisco so he has both very fixed
and very fluid working life so he sits
at a desk and when he needs to sleep he
rolls back and then he drops in here and
he he sleeps and then he goes back to
work sits very fixed work but his work
is all on the computer all on the
internet this notion of the relationship
between the technology and him is a very
complex one so so I know he wrote a
paper in 2003 basically are you like
philosophical argument that the way to
understand the relationship between
people and technology and for example
the mobile phone is is as a paradox
there's a paradoxical relationship so
let's take an example so this is sort of
an attempt to codify aspects of our
lives so who we are we are both adult
and child we are both producers and
consumers we're both mother and
breadwinner we're both private and
company so they're all these aspects of
our lives and then you take this this
affordance of the technology and drops
in the middle of it and we cannot assume
that there's a straightforward
relationship between these so there's
not this old-fashioned notion that their
forms would lead through a linear
moments based on a purpose when he says
is of course that this affordance that
can be all sorts of directions to meet a
certain purpose so take the example of
the mobile phone it liberates us and
enslaves us at the same time you're
infinitely free to go wherever you want
but you can always be reached all right
so it said so it's both sides at the
same time and indeed this relates
although Arnold hasn't got a clue about
it but it relates directly to sew some
work done with it marketing by making
Fourier on this paradoxical notion of
modern consumptions there come a
postmodernist so we don't be invited but
it was an interesting paper from 1998
where they say well any technology will
make your comforts in an income from at
the same time you're both fulfill needs
and create things it'll engaged or
disengaged you you know so anybody who's
been with a teenager and start talking
to them and then they are texting at the
same time the absent present problem
then of course you're both engaged and
disengaged its freedom enslavement I was
five minutes left I mobster so the point
is of course in that that complex
relationship the way we look at it is
it's not like this and the way we feel
it is like this so the way we at least
solve it by the people who produce the
technology is that the technology is
straightforward and simple it will make
us happier it will make life better but
but the company the complex engagement
in that is something we are not used to
so one of the key things is I have in
the book I've written about mobile
technologies of work is that it would
take the technological opportunities and
have them meet the everyday paradoxes of
life then this life of technology is
this so far is companies combinations of
you to emerging actions and planned
actions but what really happens now is
it mostly is this cider is winning is
this it becomes fluid and what we really
do not engage so much with are trying to
establish boundaries for this fluidity
and this is very difficult because they
are not like the usual boundaries where
you just say this case you often stayed
and talked with whoever come find
wherever your meetings with or this
issue
family only talk with your family it's a
much more complex complex challenge that
involves us trying to continuously
negotiate these boundaries and so far we
are complete amateurs with the
technologies we haven't started doing
that yet but you can say examples Google
bus anyone you know the examples of
services they clearly creates this
explosion of interaction that doesn't
fit and then they are rejected and then
there are others that are managed to to
stay more limiting and there will be
successful in my view one of the main
reasons why Facebook is successful more
than more than my face was not only the
facebook had better technologists they
have better coders and say that in my
face it was also they started out being
very limited you can only be Facebook
friends with your real friends with
somebody either you knew or that was at
the same school as you now that's not
the case anymore but at the inception
there was this clear boundaries and I
think this is important and part of the
success I like to drop this one I'm
sorry it's very readable I want to get
your conclusion just this is the first
time I've given a talk to advocating
clear overshot significant three minutes
left perfect so this notion that
interaction happens every anywhere with
anyone in time it's been sold to us
again and again again but inter actually
is always sometimes somewhere someone
it's never just anytime anywhere there's
always particular reasons the problem is
however if our its action drifts so we
ended up thinking that you know that
life is symmetrical interaction is never
symmetrical just because I want to be
your friend doesn't really mean that you
want to be my friend you know that's the
know I used to have 20 years ago and I
nope your gate he doesn't know me so the
point is in everyday life this
technology thinks that what is important
to us is that everything is like the law
of entropy then everything just is
is it all barriers disappear that is not
the case you can say so there's a factor
then our YouTube channels it is an
example to try is ok we need to organize
on Barry this around your understanding
or what is your YouTube as an example
now these polarization boundaries this
this needs to be an easy to be advocates
on how if you look at the successes of
the platforms there's a platform that
fences with with apple and at the
Android and iOS platform is the example
of this anchoring so people think when I
don't know what I can do but at least if
I have to choose between half a million
app I can just go into apple's app store
there's five acts against that I just
choose those there are rankings they're
also the ways of putting up barriers to
this massive amount of information and
hear that the real issue is that the
instant connectivity doesn't it only
leaves the main tech make the mazes of
the relationship to each individual and
if authorities shall make our lives
better then we will have to somehow
increase if you rely on the technology
to mediate the relationships and not
only allow allow us to create them and
then maintain them ourselves and there
is the technology so far is mostly based
on breaking boundaries rather than
directing meaningful meaningful ones and
that's the balance that clearly I need
to design turn these to change and then
the last life and the point days I think
that most technological and most
important innovations and most
technology companies they assume a very
linear relationship between the user and
the technology and it is like a pair of
shoes that needs to be worn in by the
use of every day to take on new meanings
and that if you look at it Apple they
stroke lucky by really reluctantly
allowing App Store the App Store and
that was simply a very easy way for them
to allow the the smartphone to become a
pair of shoes you could walk in yourself
but but this notion of a relationship is
of course nice two different talk and I
can give that but then I would require
large fee because the talk about that
how do you understand
in this negotiation is really really
difficult because of course anytime the
technology listens to you it also
observes you so the primacy usability
trade-off which we are all discussing at
the moment is really problematic because
we will have to give up our privacy at
some point this is not whether or not is
just the price and the curve how fast we
give it up that's important that's it
I'm done on the slides at the end
there's and lots of stuff on what I've
done and what we're doing and lots of
names Oh God by emerging as a reporter
free and somewhere I've done with over
here other reports he's going to be the
best microphone all the messages all the
references idea thank you have the
monthly attention wow wow there's
another one so you just an essay is that
it's pathetic Christian and the comment
and job it is the old bench or third I'm
not sure I'd by the Ohio nice it was a
different port i'm not sure i'd buy it
you have to give up privacy it seems
like people they totally understand what
you mean in that if you send a message
to someone or some people it took you
some effort to write it that then if it
has many recipients it's a
multiplicative effect to this that cost
this the friction in the center however
if you're anonymous it sort of takes
away some of the social norms of
reciprocity that you expect from your
physical acquaintances if a people never
complain about that people never
complain about why that I know that you
sent me an email that's not it well you
find to find that I didn't respond to
your email so it's good if you can
filter a lot of things at once you cope
with this problem yeah and if you're
anonymous it's even easier to filter
because maybe you don't even know who's
reading right yeah and so communities
can self-assemble in this new space
that's like disoriented from everyone
but it could it could be a relatively
smooth transition yeah if you have any
new material things important yeah but
but I think the example I'll use I can't
find that I have one these these cars
supercars so in love and we have the
oyster card and my ib will always be you
can choose between just topping off
yourself putting money in or you can
have it linked to you on the web to your
bank account so every time you your
money goes to a certain level ii just
tops up automatically and the point is
that alcohol i'm saying is that for me
is perfect I never had to queue up it's
so easy I never took you up on the other
hand if I was a young 25 year old muslim
going through the tube system in London
every single day using this card and
having it linked my identity and credit
card I will be nervous because the world
of the future is full of false positives
but just because I went this time and
then some other bloody idiot he's
exposed the tube station like they did
in two thousand seven two thousand five
then then I'm I'm suddenly I'm suddenly
this in the life of some stupid false
positives search now every time I travel
my credit cards get blocked because I
traveled to places where people scam
money away and then it's all false
positives and therefore I think the
problem is is whether you trust the
system not to slam you with a false
positive and that's it and and and that
takes time because you know obviously I
am I am never afraid of amazon slamming
women
when I buy a book online i have only
good experiences fine books i'm terrible
experience buying their cloud services
but that's another when they bump even
three hundred dollars for something I
didn't spend but the point is the point
is before we get all these experiences
that we can trust it that then it has to
be small steps but when the technology
companies like yours is very eager
because it's driven by geeks who say it
is better and you're right it is better
but it doesn't mean people will accept
it and also it takes it takes a lot to
gain trust but it only takes tiny bit to
eat or even hearsay to remove it so the
problem is of course whether this young
Muslim in London will will dare have his
identity link to this car where this
this trace of behavior around the
network for 10 years suddenly leads to
you're in a cell somewhere that's what I
mean that's a real problem yeah if you
have mentioned about the technology I
think what do you think is it a choice
of person that connected selected
technology options yes so this is the
old argument than technologies neutral
and that's the wrong argument technology
is neither neutral nor not neutral so
it's neither positive nor negative
non-neutral if you can't say it it
doesn't make sense it is always neutral
and always not neutral at the same time
a lot of people talking about
technologies through their live and old
forward information yeah but you have a
choice to turn off the volume the water
power yes so that's right that's right
and then all your friends say why can't
I reach you so the point is of course
what is happening here is what's called
institutionalization it is processed
where you you have individual choice and
suddenly this is an institution build
around you that means you don't have
choice here's one institution can you
can you go up to can you go to Shibuya
and send work all day we can't gives in
your office I assume where's the
authorization you don't so the pipes of
the point is if you can say is it's
right so individual choice is part of
the solution I agree but the problem we
have is that these individual choices
are shaped this is rich links book you
take new ties is about
is about how our social relations they
they change over time so of course of
course in many places now whenever you
can even go to a meeting housekeeping
first turn off your mobile you know you
hear that all the time so we have to
have these rituals and these are
routines and that is sort of common
etiquette but the problem is a lot of
these are very very difficult to have
because our social process of generating
the etiquette is much slower than the
technological development of giving you
opportunities but it is clear if I mean
lots of people are now talking about the
death of email that it's just it just
becomes not good enough for the purpose
because it is too intensive for what you
get back where's you know you know all
and yoga they take them use even as a
union Facebook teacher product facebook
if you are to coordinate I'm still
old-fashioned you know so I'm still you
should see this evening but young people
they use other means that are more
effective if you look at Twitter for
example is it very it's very successful
because of his asymmetry the Astron
cushion who's got like now four million
he was the first in the world had two
million a friends followers he doesn't
follow 22 million he followed 215 or
something so the point is that he can he
has a baryon asymmetry and this is one
of the arguments in some of the slides I
had to skip and fortune when you can
read the book nevaeh the Medici book
calm these one of the problems we had in
current mobile technologies they only
allowed Tuesday's Portability and
communication Portability and
connectivity that's what people mostly
use their mobile phones for they don't
allow you easy to prioritize so your
example exactly is would they be nice to
have more advanced filters to
automatically you know filter things
away but we need to understand what what
what trends is to do that on because in
the old naka phone I had I can make all
sorts of filters but it would take
longer to update those filters
constantly that it would for me to
actually use them for something that
might as well just talk to people that
called instead of updating the filters
and this of course my technology
companies like Google who will have
increased in increasing in aggregated
information about as now behavior would
be able to offer us these kind of
filters but it requires that these come
understand technology in other terms
than those of technologies so the basic
point is technology is far too important
to be left to technologies because in
the hands of technologies it will be
very interesting but also very damaging
in the long run at this stage you know
that the newest Android allows you to
like you don't the call right now a
message on yes it's very very good so in
retrospect you got the message fantastic
yes any more questions yeah one thing
you might find personally very curious
to these grand pages on social networks
like coca-cola gap as a page on Facebook
yeah and they seem people seem to
interact with them yeah it seems if I
understood your presentation right it
seems like there's an imbalance here
because companies and governments
already do in personal relationships but
people are just tuned personal relations
yes so do you have any thoughts about
that it seems like this could be a huge
denial of service on human yes the
tension well yes of course but I mean
saw themselves the brand pages on
Facebook are not about the brands but
about the communities she's so it's
about this about communities about I
pledge my allegiance to this brand I
want to chat to other people on the show
yeah I certain if you take the Sun so I
joined twitter when Twitter was a couple
of weeks old or something so I to add a
Twitter account so then so then I posted
a message saying hey test and i'm
already on Twitter's front page to see
if i can see von message Michael it was
already too late so I thought myself
this is useless what do i need this for
and then half a year ago I ended up
having like 45 or 50 followers on
Twitter so I tweeted my second message
why are you following me after the fight
for the fight is
some height is of course people follow
me it's not because they want to listen
to what I twin because I don't tweet and
their followers that comment on the way
is not that the 45 came to first minute
after no they come right up to an hour
before i send this message now they just
all I want is a form students to be
honest this just means that yeah I know
this guy I know he's on my iPhone not
trendy little they know I don't tweet
anything but the point is the same with
these do you want that you want to
create community and you can use the
argument I'm making the same sense it's
a way in this fluid or be atomized
pulverized world to get some sort of
village going the old-fashioned village
with inbreeding and having sex in a
while you are a novice thing and getting
up early in the morning and having a
good healthy lifestyle and dead type in
your 30 they serve is really is really
about communities and how people are
desperate to get these communities which
of course is why Facebook is so popular
so Google search in the beginning is
brilliant as an engineering feat I mean
I started my first use of google was
before you guys were born almost even
when the Google you either was this long
before was called google and it worked
much better than all the other search
engines but the point is it doesn't
create any community so that's what
people want is barriers and boundaries
and villages but they have to be fluid
villages where you can join 11 at the
same time and this is this is about
directing boundaries bounding the
unbounded and it's very difficult
because immediately we hit with your
argument people should have a choice and
and and I think there's one thing we can
learn from apple before the ipod we had
no clue we needed one before Facebook we
had no clue we needed it so the world of
technology development is one of not
letting people do what they want but to
tell them what they can do and then let
them see that this is actually much
better this about having thought
leadership and create boundaries not
about just following the ones that are
there yeah we're done
we are time as we're supposed to be in
