these days I'd like to obviously thank
the organizers that did a fantastic job
with it it's my job to kind of close out
the sessions here I want to just talk
for a little bit about the mission which
you've probably heard 50 million times
in all the different talks which is to
organize the world's information and
make it universally accessible and
useful and I think it's worth stepping
back and saying just how close to that
are we and I thought my view is we're
not very close I think we have this is
my misinterpretation of where we are
right now we have gathered a relatively
small portion of the world's information
and users with enough patience and with
the right queries are more likely to
find it than not and so we're pretty far
away from where I think we need to be or
where we can be or where the information
actually you know I think can justify us
getting to the so it's interesting to
kind of look at the evolution of
computing and just see what happened
along the way to get us where we are and
where we're going to go when I started
which is a pretty long time ago they a
few gray hairs in the audience that
remember the time when you were working
on big mainframe computers sitting in
data centers typing in punch cards
shipping something off getting it back
and that was the model for a long time
in over my career things have gotten
progressively smaller you know we went
from mainframes to you novax's too many
computers to you know now Android style
devices went through this whole
evolution and my firm and fervent belief
was that we would get to the point where
you didn't need mainframes anymore you
didn't need data centers anymore
everything you wanted was in the palm of
your hand you could throw it away get a
new one and everything was still there I
mean how many other people believed we
were going to get there how many people
still believe we might get there but it
didn't happen you know and it didn't
happen despite incredible scaling in
that period of time you know CPUs 12,000
times faster than 25 years ago
memory 50,000 times cheaper just 4
million times you know cheaper in that
period of time it is almost now that the
whole library of congress you can fit in
the palm of your hand which i would have
argued 20 years ago with the equivalent
of having everything in the world at
your disposal at that time but what's
happened since then you know is that the
definition of information has changed
collect considerably right now
information has just thought the Library
of Congress that isn't the end-all and
be-all of information right right now
you have the web you have maps you have
satellite data you have books you have
papers you have images you have videos
your products your blogs you have tweets
ad infinitum right and some of these
things have gotten exponentially more
data associated with them like videos
and pictures and stuff like that during
that period of time so the first problem
is the definition of what all the
world's information has changed
considerably in a while the second is is
that you need now to distribute data and
computation a long time if that wasn't
clear even five years ago that wasn't
clear and there's a lot of people that
still separate the two you know you have
big file servers and you know they that
handles all units or data we do that to
have big file servers but to solve the
class of problems we need to solve you
can't do that you actually have to
distribute computation and data which
means that the Android even if I could
put you know all the world's information
on this which may someday plump be
possible i have to pair that with a
computational equivalent and that's
going to be much more difficult because
when I said those ratios CPU ratios and
dis ratios actually haven't even come
close to keeping up over the last 25
years the other problem is is that the
pace of change has has gone up it is no
longer you know you know possible to
change software every five years you
actually get a new version of gmail
regularly if you use gmail because it is
downloaded to you even five years ago
shrink wrap software you would buy
shrink wrap software you would update it
you know maybe if you want to pay
another three hundred dollars or
whatever it is and that's still model
but for some places but it's changing
really pretty rapidly I mean why would
you want an old version of something you
pay for it why don't you get the newest
version every time I think I don't
remember how many applications are
downloaded on average on Android but
it's huge you know it's like 20 you know
applications and they're updated
automatically so the up you they don't
even ask you some time actually an
Android they do ask you if you want it
updated but you know you know that's
going to go away you're just going to
get the most recent version all the time
in the future the other thing that's
changed is sharing everybody wants to
share things you know even if I had all
the data in the whole world and all my
data on my android all the time I'd be
perfect if I didn't want to share
anything but the current world you know
sharing is actually sometimes more
important than the data itself and
therefore you see new applications that
address that you know it's kind of sad
in some ways because you know the the
world of a single CPU application was
kind of our bread and butter for many
years you know I you know I in ninety
percent of my computing career I never
wrote an application moving to
multi-threading was actually a big step
let alone multi you know multi-threading
multi CPU multi-platform loyalty cluster
multi geography that's the world we live
in almost every application that's built
at Google has all of those components in
it almost no application runs on a
single CPU I can't think of any and
that's changed pretty dramatically in
that amount of time and the way that
we've ended up having to attack these
problems has changed pretty considerably
there was a time when you could just buy
some off-the-shelf hardware you could
run your whatever you want it on it
everything would be done but now the
scale of the problem makes that you know
impossible we actually have to build the
data center we have to find the places
for the data centers where the power is
cheap and when the network connectivity
is there we have to build the data
centers from scratch using techniques
that we think are much more power
efficient much more effective for
deploying our applications we've got to
build the platforms and you know the CPU
is we don't we don't make chips right
now without everything else
really we do we have to you know put on
the right software on it almost all open
source software almost everywhere in the
company but we've got data centers we've
got networks we got architectures we've
got platforms cluster management
distributed systems machine learning AI
we have to obviously testing systems are
tough on this operating systems client
software user interfaces applications
video encoding puter vision translation
databases browsers you know privacy
security encryption we're working with
flash we got multi-core we've got social
applications I mean just I if I missed
any of your disciplines in here it was a
mistake it probably is on this list and
I didn't get to it that's the set of
problems that we now end up having to
solve because we tried to take on the
big problem rather than just you know
some subset of the problem what this
means is that we have a ton of work to
do I mean all of those problems are
challenging and the combination of them
i think is even more challenging and
what makes it i think a little harder
for us maybe then some people is that
you probably heard Larry talk he has a
very bold vision of where the company
should go and the size of the problems
that he wants to take on and there you
know honestly they're very difficult
they're going to take you know 10 years
15 years to actually get to I wanted to
spend out just a minute on what's next
because somebody may I think I was
actually in the description of what I
was going to talk about not that i
actually wrote that description somebody
else wrote that description for me but
let me let me just go through and tell
you some of the things I think are next
and what's hard about our discipline i
think is that is it if you can dream it
in computer science you could probably
build it I mean there are very few
things right now that you can't actually
build now maybe their cost prohibitive
maybe they're really slow maybe you know
there's all kinds of things maybe you
don't have enough data maybe maybe it's
true that this generation is not going
to do them but right now pretty much you
can build almost anything and a few
things that i'm pretty sure looking not
far in the future but even really close
in the future
I think we're going to build I think
machines are going to become a lot
simpler I think OS is going to be a lot
simpler I think all of them are going to
be open source I think browsers are
going to be open sourced I think all
most of the applications that you get
will actually be downloaded and you will
get the most current version and frankly
most of them are likely to be free I
think you will be able to I think we
will be able to organize the world's
information where organization means
that it is not just that you'll be able
to find a piece of data if something has
been written about it which is what the
current situation is but there will be
data which is structured in such a way
that it is actually composable you know
Wolfram introduced a search engine or
you know what they what is kind of a
search engine for mathematical data and
even though it's rather limited there
are data types in there that you can
actually compose you can take one piece
of data and compose it with something
else and that model is something that we
don't have in search engines right now
at all another way to say that is I can
find something on Google but it's hard
to learn something on Google it's hard
for researchers to go use google it's
more like a library right now and it's
less like a tool that you can actually
combine information and learn some new
thing that's never been there before we
cannot compose information we can't take
two pieces of information one on one
website and one on the other and
actually combine that to give you new
data we have to be able to do that to
kind of get to the next level that we're
trying to get to I think the development
environments of the current day are
pretty archaic I mean it's just hard to
believe we are using the same roughly
the same tools matter of fact they
usually have the same names as 25 years
ago I would never have predicted that
especially if i look at the advancement
in every part of our discipline the
tools that we use to actually build
programs are more fragmented than they
have ever been
less powerful than they've ever been it
takes more to learn to get a simple
thing done that it ever has and I you
know I think that state is one that we
have to get out of if we're going to
make progress it's a little bit like the
mobile industry right they they were so
fragmented that you couldn't deploy an
application across all of them and they
lost out to the web right because the
web it did have that property I feel
like our future if we don't do something
about it in development environments
will cause us to have the same kinds of
problems and have a smaller and smaller
segment of the population that it can
actually build things than deploy them I
think some things are going to happen
that I never expected to happen like I
think very soon if i look at the speech
technology i look at the translation
technology and i combine those two and I
you know get Mike and and Franz to talk
together long enough I think it should
be possible like now to be able to have
you know me speak in my language and you
listen in your language it should just
happen and and it's not quite there I
mean there's some speech to text things
and you know on both sides but it's very
close chat right now you can already do
chat across languages and that's
something that I certainly never
expected in my lifetime anyway I just I
went in by thanking everybody for coming
I you know one of the things about
Google is it really is an attempt to
emulate a university environment if you
look around you you probably felt pretty
at home right except the food's better
right but everything else if it feels
like you know it's got technical talks
it's got smart people it's got people
with high energy people are packed
together you know that's not just an
accident right that's what you do in
universities and that's what creates
energy there's nothing that more energy
draining than walking into a field of
cubicles where nobody's actually there
and one of the reasons is because I
think you guys know because I think
almost all the great ideas that have
come out in the last 25 years have
actually come from universities and we
are you know working on the back of all
of the work that you guys have done and
will do we also appreciate your students
so thank you they're very smart they're
very well trained
do a fantastic job for us so thank you
and you know finally I just like to once
again thank the staff that put this
event allah and i think they did a
fantastic so so with that I'm happy to
answer any question about anything I
don't know that much by the way but what
I do know i will try to tell you good
yeah d care to give some suggestion
conjecture on what the futures
development to look like here view i can
tell you what Larry wants Larry Larry's
view on development tools is he wants
something that where there's no
distinction between clients and servers
that you should be able to run people
that things should migrate you know from
one to the other as necessary where he
would like a something that's much
simpler and much more usable he would
like to go back to the mac toolkit kind
of thing where there's a set number of
things that are very very well supported
and are very well defined that there
aren't an infinite number of them and he
would like that programming environment
to you know seamlessly migrate between
servers across clusters across machines
across geographies they'd like data
actually migrated to the places where
it's really needs to be done he'd like
caching to be automatic he'd like it to
be really easy you know if I have a
phone and it's got a you know a you know
a sim card that holds a lot of data on
this and yours doesn't he'd like more
things to be on my you know cash locally
online versus versus on yours he'd like
latency to be really really low you know
so he like fast applications rather than
real applications he doesn't like layers
at all so the idea of build
software with twenty seven layers of
things just drives him nuts you know and
i think his opinions are pretty well
shared although the idea of trying to
solve all those problems simultaneously
is a pretty hard one so in thinking of
coming to this meeting I occurred to be
one of the the reasons would be to get
an idea of what Google's interested in
and that may feed into strategic
thinking about research directions but
yes I've gone through this meeting i'm
thinking maybe it's really the opposite
because if there's something that Google
understands that they want a need
they're going to do it and do it really
well and that probably may not be the
best way for my research group to spend
their time but rather try to dissipate
you know what is that Google doesn't
know that they need or doesn't isn't
seeing it all and that may be the way to
think can you guide me about this is
that that's the right way to think I
mean well first I don't think I think it
should be deeply suspicious of any
companies to tell you what to do you
know because I remember when I was a
graduate student I remember going to
companies and at you i went to harris
semiconductor i remember and they were
telling me what little narrow thing that
they should be worried that we should be
working on and none of that really
mattered you know i remember when i was
in college i was going to take a i was
going to a co-op program and and i had
changed my major from mechanical
engineering to computer science i
remember the coop person saying look
I've talked to a lot of companies
there's just no work in computer science
you're going to need to stay in
mechanical engineering and I ignored
them at that stage so just be careful
about that the reason I think that your
that your characterization is it's
probably not what I would say is because
if you look at the list of things we're
doing every one of them is stuff that
you're doing right any advancement that
you make in that area you know I think
will be beneficial to us I hope that
advancements that we make will also be
beneficial to the research community and
that we will be able to share some of
those advancements and be able to push
the envelope in interesting ways it is
never true though I I don't think that
that we because of our resources because
of our people or anything we will be
able to do things and nobody else can do
I mean that was the mentality before
risk right nobody can build a cpu right
it's impossible
you can't advance the state of computer
architecture and that was changed rather
dramatically by smart people and
universities throwing out that
conjecture and actually doing something
radical and simple most of the ideas
aren't that we work on we work on with
small teams of people you know usually
you know a handful maybe six or eight I
mean really the style is actually just
like a university and you'd be surprised
I mean those people can't take it to off
into full-scale production global
distribution and stuff like that but
they can get to the point where we know
this idea is going to work and I think
you can too I go into yeah he's got the
mic person with Mike wins so let me turn
the question around how do we tell you
what to do my address is a google my
phone what is the most effective way to
get ideas into a place where where
Google might be interested in picking
them up and and I'm putting some
resources behind them to get them to the
large audiences that Google has access
to home so they I'm I'm a big believer
in bottom-up everything right the whole
culture is bottoms up of a very flat
management hierarchy which prevents
micromanagement and prevents
hierarchical decisions at one point in
my life I remember going to somebody and
say maybe I should spend more time I
time actually interacting with a lead
and the sales organization and they said
no don't do that if you make your
relationship with omid stronger more
things will come up the tree toward you
you'll have to solve more problems so
don't do that make it as hard as
possible for things to go up the tree
and back down the tree and make sure
that everybody at the lower levels of
the company actually works together so
that's kind of philosophy so for you I
would say that my email address is going
to be useless right that you should do
you all have contacts here probably
zillions of contacts here you know my my
advice is you know if to talk through
your contacts to understand what's going
on you know to be able to come in that
direction our whole University grant
program is actually you know exactly
that don't you know proposals come in
you know they're evaluated by people
they have sponsors here that actually
say yes this is important to us or could
be important to us it's a relationship
that gets built not just a check that
gets written and so I would use those
those contacts I would use the people
that you have the student city i know
that some student that you guys have is
here or somewhere at Google and I would
use them to you know try to understand
come give technical talks you know
that's another great way of interacting
with the company if you have something
you think is really exciting your work
at the University of the relations team
come here you know you may draw a crowd
of a thousand you may grow across a
crowd of 12 depending on your idea and
what it is but you will get it you will
get a chance to interact with people so
there's there's lots of different ways
and we have locations all over the you
know all over the world so it's not like
you have to travel the mountain to you
you know if you're new york you can just
go to the new york center color light
coming in your perfect world vision of
the future do you see google's
relationship in terms of the user
perspective between you and that other
company in seattle some place as one of
seamless is rap ability for users or you
know the two camps to each its own or
one lives and one dies or what how do
you really your perfect vision of the
world how do i think i think i think the
the the press team wants to really
highlight the differences in the
companies and and really you know put us
in this heated battle and I think there
are lots of areas that we are actually
doing things they're quite different
than theirs there's no guarantee on
which of these two things is actually
going to succeed and there's certainly
no guarantee that one of them is going
to be a winner and another one is going
to be the loser and I'll give you an
example just soon you know our apps
product so we're giving gmail calendar
all these kinds of things you know we're
you know selling at a pre low price to a
bunch of different companies some of
them think that's the best thing since
sliced bread some of them are extremely
happy with their you know current setup
you know
love exchange servers they do all this
kind of stuff you know they're not going
to change for a very long time
regardless of the economics right now
the interoperability we are not big
interoperability fans I will say that
you know we we are we are we are very
standards driven so we actually try to
change the standards processes and work
with the standards bodies like in chrome
and other things we're pushing html5 and
you know all of that as much as we can
we care about interoperability from that
point of view but what we don't care
about is what I call feature
interoperability or you know kind of you
know doing the same thing they're doing
the same way you know we're not going to
build an app's product by looking at all
the features of exchange and copying
those you know we're not going to build
our docs product so that it actually you
know will interoperate seamlessly with
word and you know you know all of those
programs that that's just not in our DNA
what we'll try to do is build a system
that is workable and usable and gives
you ninety percent of what you want but
if you want you know the last ten
percent you know probably you could go
to the other company and I don't think
we'll change that you say that Google
looks like University it looks like an
engineering department but certainly not
like a humanities department and Moe and
Moe of your problems are not technology
problems you know do you learn the risk
of being a geek geek accompanies it
believes it everything he served by
better technology I think that's a very
valid concern I mean we are an
engineering company I mean more than any
company that I've ever been with it is
an engineering culture if you look at
the top of the company and what we call
the executive management group it's
dominated by engineers and even some of
the people have weren't engineers
actually a word engineers in their
previous life like Omid in the business
side and so we do have a lot of
engineering things which is an advantage
and a disadvantage there are some areas
where I think we're weaker at because we
don't have I mean it's not that other
perspectives aren't represented in a
company because they certainly are I
mean engineer
ring is is it's a safe consent of the
company but it's not the whole
percentage but I do think in in other
areas and some of our product decisions
and other things I think other
perspectives would be</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
