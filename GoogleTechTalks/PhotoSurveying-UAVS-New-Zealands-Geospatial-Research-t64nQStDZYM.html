about uavs in New Zealand I met David
when I was down in New Zealand doing a
little trip for Google and the
government introduced people to use
service folks said what he interested in
I said well one of the side projects
that i sometimes help with very minor
lee i should point out is some of our
imaging efforts and they said oh well
you have to talk David Park and I'm like
whoa ok so we met via videoconference I
said boy you know this guy's real a
kindred spirit with some of the folks
here at in Mountain View and so I
invited him to come and speak and he
graciously accepted so I don't wanna
spend too much time on this it will be
recorded for google video and will be
exposed externally so keep that in mind
we will have Q&amp;amp;A at the end at which
point we will stop recording so you can
ask your real questions so there you go
David thanks very much Chris and I do
apologize I'm a proper academic at heart
so I've got about 60 slides here I'm
going to charge through the middle rate
of knots and hopefully we'll have some
time left at the end for questions and
answers if anybody gets too bored just
throw something or doze off or somesuch
now I'll know to move on and so what
I've actually got here is an
introduction to my research centre the
geospatial research centre within that
or a range of things and so we've got a
bit of background and then the fun stuff
a quick technical overview of the
research areas that we cover some of the
skills we've got some the experiences
we've got a right to imaging UAV sensory
integration that sort of thing once lied
about the future and then hopefully as
we've heard a chance to talk and engage
in discussion so without further ado
let's charge through these bit about my
background was put in context so I did
my three degrees at the University of
Nottingham civil engineering and built
motorways for a while and it was quite
hard working in the outdoors and got a
master's in artificial intelligence and
robotics and then my PhD was in airborne
digital photogrammetry winter apps the
real world for a while at the University
of Nottingham spin-out company basically
doing developing contracts and managing
contracts in the European Space Agency
European Commission and did that for a
few years went back to the Nottingham as
a senior research fellow responsible for
generating cash and initiating new
research ideas which included underwater
positioning unmanned aerial vehicles and
range of other fun stuff as all that was
going on I reached the ripe old age of
30 and thought wait a minute there's
more to life than this being just a
senior research fellow in a world
leading University I won't ever go
myself and so in March 2005 and it did
take slightly longer than the time it
takes to say this I had an idea about
setting up a new research center so far
so normal I actually wanted it to be
world-leading fine but I'd enjoyed the
flexibility that I've had it in industry
and being a company I wanted to have a
research center that was academically
excellent but commercially aware and I
was looking around for somewhere there
was no incumbent and so I identified new
zealand as somewhere that didn't have
the sort of things we were talking about
so rang up the New Zealand Embassy in
London said I've got a good idea can i
have three million dollars please and
they said well can we meet you fair
enough and so I said well up we're going
to provide you with this world leading
the center and these are the sort of
technical areas that it's going to be
really excellent in and they said that's
great for 18 months they did actually
listen to me and then fly me down to New
Zealand for a quick trip and we had
various visits discussions with
potential partners all sorts of
feasibility studies lots of phone calls
in the middle of the night depending on
what time of year it is it's either 11
12 or 13 hours time difference between
New Zealand in the UK I'm a big fan of
skype now and but by October last year
and would finalise the number of things
so Christchurch was confirmed at the
preferred location we're actually chosen
to set up a limited company to be the
vehicle for a joint venture between the
university of nottingham university of
canterbury and the regional development
agency area it must mean it's getting
dull already I guess we'd secured my
three million dollars from the
government in the region and a seven or
eight underpinning documents were
finalized and agreed and that was a bit
of a feast for lawyers I'm afraid joint
ventures ip's shareholders agreement
service level agreements etc we
commenced operations 13th in November
last year it's not just me I brought
some of my colleagues from Nottingham
down with me as well the guy in our left
is our pilot the rest of us all came
down from Nottingham every small startup
there's a pilot I fear and this was at
our launch event which was held in a
just gone and we've got a good team good
experience all reasonably young
reasonably enthusiastic with a range of
skills and again if we have chance later
that will go into some of the details
but you'll see as we go through the
presentation the various skills of these
guys are bringing to the party just in
case none of you have had a chance to
visit New Zealand Arthur I better put up
a map showing you where we are in the
world so on the left-hand side there
that little island that isn't actually a
real red ring around us to keep folk out
that's just where we are next to
Australia down to enter to go down the
bottom there and I made the short hop on
the plane yesterday over the Pacific
which is why i'm slightly dopey at the
front here I fear Christchurch on the
right-hand side there you can see it's
down on the right-hand side down in
South Island so two main islands in New
Zealand and we're down to the middle
right on South Island again if none of
you have had a chance to visit the
beautiful garden city then the
population is about 300,000 which is a
third of all the people on South Island
which is about the size of England so it
gets pretty crowded and you can see that
on the left there that's just above a
couple of extinct volcanoes which make
nice Hills for gliding off apparently
and just some touristy shots showing the
mountains in the background and how
barren the whole place is that's
actually all of Christchurch that's not
just downtown there that's actually the
whole lot so this is what we do very
well there is more to it than that for
things the rest of it's just flat all
around the side for things that we
actually do really well the first is
positioning so GPS ultra-wideband sued
lights which are ground based GPS light
transmitters laser systems Laran you
name it we understand the systems the
antenna the electronics of the receivers
interesting I'll just carry on until
someone shelves it's fixed so we
actually do positioning and its widest
sense thank you and that's from
processing understanding the systems etc
related to that is orientation so
accelerometers gyroscopes inertial
sensors dead reckoning systems
magnetometers camera systems multiply
antenna gps systems you name it various
different ways depending on price or
budget or performance or weight
limitations etc to actually give you an
orientation solution as well as my
background in photogrammetry one of my
colleagues is an expert in computer
vision machine vision image analysis so
we've got an imaging strand as well
it's not designing sensors but it's
actually getting data from them
calibrating sensors getting useful stuff
out of those systems and sensors in the
real world the fun stuff and by far the
hardest bit is actually optimally
integrating some none are all of those
together in the real world against some
sort of application or need either
internally driven or externally driven
that's it that is our core business
that's what we're really good at the
application of those and this is just
what we're playing in at the moment is
reasonably limitless I've not yet found
a meeting or organization or a
department or a group where we haven't
got some sort of link across and there's
just a flavor of some of the things
we're playing in there across a range of
application across the range of
platforms sorry so we've been going for
five months we've got five staff
employed I've got a ridiculously
overpowered board of seven people
including the former governor of the
Bank of New Zealand and etc etc they all
seem quite keen to support what we're
doing got two PhD students already in
post jointly supervised with mechanical
and mathematics departments at
Canterbury I've got eight more great CV
sitting on my desk at the moment fact
we've not have it sized at all these are
folks just already proactively
approached us from the US from South
Africa from UK from within New Zealand
saying look we've heard what you're up
to wanna come and be part of it here's
my CV please we've secured a commercial
contracts already worth about three
hundred thousand dollars and you can see
the organization's down here a couple of
UK companies the rest of new
zealand-based trimble just down the road
in sunnyvale and so it's a reasonable
mix already of contract work so not bad
for five months in the long term vision
as you would expect to imagine in-house
and collaborative R&amp;amp;D at the PhD and
postdoc level I don't want to teach
masters or undergraduate students and
we've got big locks on the doors to keep
those great unwashed out of our lovely
Research Center we will develop great IP
and hopefully make our millions
commercializing it maybe we will be a
world-class scent of a geospatial
research training education and grow
sustainably it's only going to happen
with as we know the strategic and
effective links with companies in
academia both in New Zealand and more
importantly overseas I'm now going to
charge through five
what I've called internal research
themes and activities and again this is
where we drill down to some of the sort
of technical activities that we've done
in the past or are doing now and I've
also put a quick few slides up of some
of our our plans for the future as well
obviously with the commercial contracts
we've got within reason we do what the
client wants and we deliver it and we do
it very well it is all related to our
core business we don't go around
building wardrobes for focal anything to
untoward but internally while we're
still ramping up the workload we're
actually developing a number of things
internally that are related to our core
business and so this is what I'm trying
to give you a flavor of now first these
is positioning an orientation so we do
have the proven ability to integrate at
both hardware and software levels a wide
range of navigational position sensors
there's a list up there we've never done
all of them at the same time I can't
quite see a situation where we might but
individually or in smaller combinations
we've played at some level with every
sensor that you see up there and lesser
or greater extent understand the systems
the error models etc so we've got a
reasonable experience there one of the
key bits of IP that we have is our
internal integration software called
point which is an incredibly flexible
interface for integrating sensors so
internally for the first three months
while we were still getting warmed up
this was the focal point of all of the
effort of my team more we weren't doing
external work or charging around trying
to get contracts was actually putting
point into some sort of reasonable
former it's got documentation it's all
in the same language it's got robust
interfaces that are well understood and
documented and so we can actually just
define different measurement types
position type velocity type attitude etc
and then that allows us to integrate
systems very quickly for example GPS on
s or GPS and barometer and odometer you
name it those can all be defined as a
position type if not we can define a new
one and integrate it into the system it
provides our core GPS and GPS rns
processing engine of all types so cheap
and cheerful up to very expensive and it
can process Galileo data which doesn't
exist yet which is Europe's GPS system
modernized GPS you name it we can do it
in there and that's all internal and all
under our own IP which is quite a nice
thing to have the integration itself is
fairly flexible
and so a number of carbon filters
running a prowler we can just keep
adding more to the bottom as long as we
can define a class it could be a
pressure could be arranged could be
about acceleration whatever it might be
lungs can understand the sensor model it
we can integrate it and get some sort of
optimal solution the position
orientation velocity etc out to the end
it could be real time eventually at the
moment it's just post processing I've
just put a few examples here of work
that we did just as we were leaving the
UK just to prove a point of it's not
just nice software it's actually out
there working with real data in the real
world and getting data that I will be
careful what we say is at least as good
as that available from commercial
systems so this is some work we did in
marine trials with three different
grades of inertial unit which we had at
Nottingham navigation grades out of the
nose cone of a cruise missile low cost
we mean a few thousand dollars mems sort
of sensors and after a 30-second GPS
outage suggests on the inertial alone
these are the sort of position
accuracies that we were getting
horizontally and vertically running
through our our point software and
that's better than what you can get from
the true thing systems that we had with
us here's some more data just to prove a
point so in an urban area dgps I don't
you can see the yellow dots there that's
the only places where we've actually got
GPS coverage the rest of its using about
three four thousand dollars worth of
hardware and China both in real time and
there now post-processed get the best
position and orientation solution so you
can see on the right there those of you
play with GPS know you need at least
four satellites to get a fix if we're
opening in a standalone mode we're
hardly getting that it's almost the time
it was just two sometimes three but as
you can see from the blue dots we were
within about 5 10 meters in real time
and then post-processed we were then
better than a meter to the solution and
it wasn't just position we were
post-process getting the heading error
down to better than a degree so this is
real things in the real world with real
data with real problems and that
underpins a lot of what we're trying to
do is actually say it's great to be
sitting in ivory tower and all academic
bugger all used to the rest of the world
get out there prove that something works
in the real world and get a solution
that's as good as if not better than
what already exists if indeed one exists
at all so we've got a range of
real-world experience and these are just
some slides mostly of stuff that we did
in the UK
but it's the team that I've got with me
that did this work on a range of
vehicles in a range of environments top
right slightly comedy looking piece of
hardware that's actually got four
different types of inertial
ultra-wideband sensors two different
types of GPS and all sorts of data
loggers which is why it looks ungainly
but was proving some chance for indoor
outdoor positioning research that we
were doing again I'm charging through
these and hopefully we'll get some
discussion at the end the internal plans
that I'm happy to talk about for what
we're going to be developing or looking
to develop internally related to this
area includes low-cost GPS attitude
estimation so a couple of low-cost GPS
antenna on wings of a UAV for example
and doing cinta metric positioning with
low cost a few hundred dollar type GPS
receivers over short baseline for which
I mean ten fifteen kilometers precise
point positioning so anywhere on the
planet using dual frequency rtk
solutions to get your position two
centimeters without a base station and
actually evolving the point software and
to include more dead reckoning sensors
particularly but actually making even
faster to just plug and play sensors
together based on some external
requirement or need and then looking at
the ultra tight GPS rns integration
which I'll come back to you later which
is actually required to get into the
software tracking loops of the receivers
you can't do that unless you're a
receiver manufacturer which we're not so
we've worked round then we have a
development along the lines of software
positioning receivers which I'll show
you next which starts enabling us to do
that sort of research so signal analysis
one of the key things in this area for
us is that apart from the satellites GPS
the Chinese be do system the Russian
GLONASS system there are other RF
sources existing in the environment
surrounding us as we speak that you
could use for positioning cell phones
high-definition TV ultra-wideband Wi-Fi
bluetooth etc so why can we not develop
some sort of magic black box in software
that integrates all the available
signals dynamically in real time doesn't
exist yet but it's a nice vision there
are a number of as i mentioned benefits
in terms of processing if you can
actually start getting down to that
level and so we're exploring what we
need to do to make that vision a reality
on the right-hand side is the
integration filter that's our point
software we've got that already
left hand side there's all sorts of
senses in the real world fine they exist
already and will continue to be
developed the digital acquisition
front-end we've now got and we've proven
that exists so now we're working out how
to get streams of bytes on a hard drive
into some sort of form for the
integration filter can make use of which
is not an unsubstantial task but we're
working on it we've already got it
working for all of the satellite
navigation systems that exist at the
moment so the hardware just to show that
it's not just talk again this is real
kit that we've got and so a high-speed
fpga-based unit for actually grabbing
any bits of the frequency from zero
hurts up to at least 2.4 gigahertz as
far as we've gone at the moment and you
can actually work with more than one
source at the time so we can be going
out there recording this information and
at the moment dropping it onto a hard
drive for post-processing you've then
got to do something with it once it's
there so we've actually had to get the
software working to actually make use of
that data now you've grabbed it so those
are into the GPS in the middle there you
can see a classic l1 acquisition there
and this is all using a software update
that we've extracted from the digital
front end there are a number of benefits
GPS receivers typically only record at
one two or four bytes we're recording at
16-bit sorry and so there's a degree of
benefit there in terms of processing in
what you can do we can mitigate all
sorts of problems like multipath based
on that extra data and you can actually
integrate many different sensors at the
same time it's not there yet it's not
out in the real world there's not a
commercial product and but we're moving
reasonably rapidly forward in this space
so in this area then we need some
prototyping tools are we going to
develop just so we can actually start
being a bit more responsive in signal
processing requirements and non Gina
says signal activities GPS fingerprint
positioning so in this room for example
unlike to be any direct GPS but the
multipath particularly from terrestrial
positioning and ranging signals would be
reasonably consistent so we can actually
position ourselves from the multipath
and the error sources and we've proven
this with buildings in New Zealand and
GPS you can actually position now that
way rather than needing the direct
signals themselves if Galileo ever goes
off the ground and get yourself sorted
out then there will be potential to
rapidly prototype suing the commercial
signals that will need to go against
that based on the system's we've got
image analysis and visualization all
right charging through this I don't need
to tell you guys this but images are a
very rich source of data increasingly
prevalent sources of information you
know a few dollars or less sensors and
ubiquitous we've got a picture of one of
our videos taking a picture of one of
our UAVs and the worktop there and what
we actually need to do is do something
useful with that information trying to
tell us something about what's going on
there and what's happening in that image
easy to say easy for us to do as humans
very tricky to program effectively as
many of you will be aware in the
computer land we have three areas of
interest in the image analysis area and
this is quite a complicated slide so
I'll just go through the headings the
first is actually to take imagery and
models of the real world and work out i
neva gave in the real world using that
data so i see something or have a series
of images of somewhere i can work out
based on my knowledge of that
environment where i am and where I'm
pointing and you can actually combine
knowledge of where you are and imagery
to actually create models so the classic
example would be able in photogrammetry
we're flying along we know where the
sensor is we're taking images of the
ground and we can reconstruct that
afterwards to actually create 3d models
of the environment that we flew over for
example the fun stuff is actually we may
have heard of slam simultaneous location
mapping we're actually from pure imagery
alone in theory and generating the
models of the real world and some idea
of where you are and where you're
pointing it will rely on certainly in
the short to medium term input or
integration with other sensors to
actually aid you in that could be gps
eyeless etc those are the three broad
areas underpinning it some fun stuff and
again it's all incremental steps with an
end game in mind so one of the important
areas is to do motion tracking
preferably in real time so this is a
nice example of one of the PhD students
of one of my excuse me colleagues
which was real time tracking juggling
balls which sounds nice and easy but
it's actually quite complex if you've
got identical juggling balls and looking
to do it in real time with just a
consumer level webcam and say work that
one out and that was fine but
distinguishing between objects using
knowledge of
real world and the physics of the real
world to actually constrain your
solution dealing with occlusions etc and
there's another nice one that was done
tracking ducks which again sounds nice
and easy but actually has a pretty
tricky problems associated with it if
you cracked it and can understand how to
do it then there are potential benefits
elsewhere again feature matching so a
number of ways of doing this this is
some internal data that we actually
captured from one of our UAVs this is
airborne data there were our own
creation that we're playing around with
this on so again it's relating it to the
real world doing it in the real world
we're looking for features that are
invariant ideally to translation
rotation and scale now put within reason
there you can take a picture the top of
this table and then something way over
there from underneath it and hope for it
to work but within reason we're
certainly up to plus or minus 30 degrees
on the rotation for example at the
moment you can then match those
invariant features hopefully across one
image or a number of images or a number
of data set based on that invariant
description but again it's getting out
there and doing that it's not real time
the moment it's near real time once
you've got that then we can start
looking at stereo matching so if we've
got features we've got the ability to
compute epipolar geometry between images
for example if you're given a point in
the top image and the green line is
there p polar line and the bottom image
an area-based matching and this is real
time will actually then pick the most
likely point for the match so again it's
getting out there it's doing it other
folk may be doing this as well but we're
doing it as well from our own UAV data
in this case and all of these skills
underpin that vision as I alluded to a
few slides back so this is just another
example one of our little model aircraft
UAV and again that the data the bottoms
captured from that UAV and so vision is
a navigation sensor we tracked points in
the world and then the knowledge of the
movement of those points through frames
actually gives us important information
to either give us the position
orientation from the aircraft will help
constrain the solution that we might be
having from the GPS on it so I'll flip
back and forwards between these two
slides in a moment but vision and on its
own is pretty good determining many of
the things that we may need to sort out
for ourselves and it is another source
of information into the solution and so
if you look at the pictures at the
bottom there so these are consecutive
image
is you can see it's tracking features
it's then working out where they've
moved to the opposite of those is
effectively where the aircraft's
actually moved sounds simple but again
get out there and do it very simple
sensors that we've got a few web cameras
video cameras digital SLR various bits
of software both externally procured and
internally developed for calibrating
cameras detecting features matching in
stereo and bottom right there is a nice
instrument Texas Instruments board that
we're procuring at the moment you for
delivery this week which we're quite
excited to be playing with offers all
sorts of potential and we're hoping to
secure a thermal infrared sensor within
the week or two as well which again
could open up all sorts of application
areas for us so just some pretty
screenshot so laser scanning bottom left
at Lincoln Cathedral top right some of
our UAV data going through like a
photogrammetry suite which is a
commercially available mapping software
bottom right is a bit of software from
Australia called australis for
calibrating cameras very quickly and
rapidly and it's generating these
value-added products it's putting it
through the whole of that process
training then exporting it in some
format that's of use to somebody
externally that it's CAD video a pretty
picture augmented reality you name it
and that's up to if you like some sort
of external client or requirement
short-term plans I think I've mentioned
these so exploring further the use of
vision is a navigation sensor for
example aiding the I Annette robust
techniques rather than the slightly
broader together systems we've got at
the moment for repeatedly generating
models from geo reference data that's in
its broadest sense airborne terrestrial
in doors etc looking at whether we can
actually do some of this slam type
research run reference data and then
looking at moving at real time as well
which is a requirement for certain folk
motion analysis feature detection
modeling etc all good stuff there's
years of work behind each of these
probably electronics and again this is
just to show you some of the enabling
things that we're playing with if you've
any electrical engineers in the room
they'll be probably slightly
underwhelmed by this but we're quite
pleased with what we're doing so just a
simple little data logger that's time
stamping and reading reason any serial
digital or analog data solution so you
can see at the top right there that blue
and white squares in SD card just to
give you an idea the size so the whole
things about this sort of size you can
all the white development board on
and it's actually getting in there
messing around with with the firmware
messing around with the hardware to
actually enable us to do the time
tagging task off an off-the-shelf sub
hundred dollar data logger we can start
stringing these together and actually
get solutions that work in the real
world real-time data transmission again
one of our little model aircraft is
designed specifically for operating as
comms research aircraft and there's some
fun things were going to be planning to
do there but getting data off real time
looking at 2.4 gig and so we've got
these sensors which are pretty reliable
using some of the spread spectrum
techniques that are available now some
of the directional antennas that you can
see there and again it's working it's
out there it's in the real world and
we're also exploring some common
solutions up to 60 kilometers for a
couple of potential clients at the
moment and again we've got some skills
around that area to be exploring what's
going on in flight data collection board
and again apologies for the fact that
the top right it looks a bit odd
together there but it works it's out
there it's flown over a hundred flights
so it's recording raw GPS data at five
hurts from too high sensitive receivers
one on each of the wing tips and then we
can actually collect as much other data
as we want from other sensors we might
choose to put on board other air data
for example and store it for
post-processing and then put them right
just trying to solve all of these issues
that stop you're doing stuff in the real
world so power supplies at a range of
voltages that are robust that are
reliable we've got lithium polymer
battery packs and actually then the
means to Blake that down in turn I can't
remember the top my head is 35 minus 12
12 a range of voltages that the onboard
sensors need on the UAV for example but
you can see from the size that double a
battery there that it's not the largest
thing in the world short term plan on
the electronics then we're going to
carry on looking at different sensors in
its widest sense that we can use for RF
positioning and then looking at
integrated nose into our point software
one area of interest for us based on
some experience we've had to date is
actually a miniature low cost data
storage device that can grab data for
example up to 400 megabytes a second and
that has some potential applications we
think and then looking at the longer
range ideally no cost preferably public
areas of the frequency spectrum for data
transmission or flight control etc UAV
systems and again i'm charging through
this i started this program a couple of
years back in not
with one vision in mind which is safe
reliable low-cost access to sky I'm not
an aeronautical engineer and not a pilot
but I wanted to get senses and systems
up there I could see great potential if
we could do that in a reliable fashion I
don't personally think the UAVs at least
the moment are a replacement for people
on the ground or aircraft or satellites
but there are a number of application
areas where they could potentially
provide some sort of cost-effective or
actually inhibited enabling opportunity
our areas of UAV interest hopefully
fairly consistent message now nav
Gardens controlled sensory integration
data image capture and analysis
presenting data to users we've got some
experience in VR augmented reality etc
and developing systems to use across a
number of application areas so although
eventually a spin-out might drill down
to one particular client or market or
opportunity the technologies behind them
should ideally be fairly underpinning so
in the UK we ended up with six small
aircraft none of which was weighed more
than 20 kilograms bottom right and
couple hundred dollars just a simple
Judith 40 model aircraft and that had
micra pilot autopilot infrared horizon
tracking coms twin GPS antennas
real-time video transmission a 2.4 gig
all within a payload the size of large
matchbox weigh less than 200 grams top
right carbon fiber Kevlar 30 kilogram
payload capacity up to 20,000 feet 170
580 kilometers an hour potentially and
we never pushed it that far but that's a
place called Park Aberforth which is a
missile range out in West Wales and
they're used to folk doing silly things
with technology and so we could go and
play that one there on the left hand
side was just a large if it is in
modelers around a double sized senior
teller master incredibly stable platform
it costs a lot that was 700 pounds to
build so then what the exchange rate oh
no it's probably over a thousand dollars
but that had a 10 kilogram payload it
was just a great aircraft for trying
things out it just flew in up to 30
knots of wind it just took off it landed
the aircraft in the Aeronautics were not
the research area and that's what we
were after these are some data products
are flying a digital SLR so on the
left-hand side the ground resolution was
about 20 or 30 millimeters we've got
thousands of these images is you imagine
once you start flying these things
and then putting it through like a
photogrammetric sweet creating the
author photos down on the bottom right
there small area to start with but
actually getting it through the whole
chain which was the point here in New
Zealand and the internal R&amp;amp;D for the
first few months was actually did that
point software so the Vav programs only
been going since March so what you're
seeing here is two months of effort so
no apologies for that and but we are
getting on with it and the guys are
putting all their free available skills
&amp;amp; expertise into this now we've got
three small platforms the research areas
there again should be coming hopefully
fairly consistent with what we are doing
and we're looking at the commercial
potential even now even this year you
can see our pilot whose present the
model aircraft association in New
Zealand flying at a our west melton test
facility there and the three main
aircraft we've got kakori key which is
named after the new zealand parakeet
turn off me two wings been 3 kilogram
payload that's actually a proper-sized
senior teller master so again within
reason unlimited budget unlimited
payload any idiot can pretty much do
something the fun stuff is actually
getting it to work for a few thousand
dollars in a few kilograms all this on
the right hand side Cory Mac oh there's
an electric variant and there's a glow
fuel variant both flying quite
successfully again even smaller and and
that's all that we want we're just
trying to see what we can do with
minimal effort if you're like in minimal
cost those cost about four hundred
dollars all in to build and this is our
final UAV kakapo instead of a UAV we've
got none vehicle dare real man and i
think i should trademark this because
nobody else seems to thought this one
yet so that's one of my PhD students
james who jumps out of planes and does
Dolph stuff that's Christchurch from
about seven thousand feet i think my
house just off by the coast over there
university just under his right elbow
which is where we're physically based so
yeah watch out for that kakka pay by the
way is a flightless parrot and which
breaks its wings falling out of trees
reasonably regularly so not wishing
anything ill to yeah absolutely yeah
yeah he's got gps he's got camera
systems you know he's he's reusable and
yeah hopefully and one of the key things
and again this goes without saying I
hope to do with the UAV operations is
actually prioritizing safe operations
everything that we do has to be done
safely and in an operationally safe way
so we've got procedures in place
operational procedures in place for both
new aircraft and getting most flights
for operations in the field working
closely with the Civil Aviation
Authority in New Zealand to develop a
framework for mini UAVs in New Zealand
for example we've already got frequency
secured that's UAV specific in New
Zealand and we've got inputs going into
the world radio Congress from New
Zealand this year related to that
activity a number of other longer term
actions if you'd like to try and secure
a safe framework that is agreed by all
we've got Jill redundant control systems
on every single UAV even the smallest
ones segregation of the control systems
in the payload entirely and we've got
two or three safe areas that we're
playing and so with smelting you saw a
hooker Dale Thorpe is the furthest away
that's about an hour away and that's
just enter the foothills of the southern
out and there are a few sheep around and
idiots from the GRC sitting in their
land rovers they're pretending they're
working hard ya know there's pretty good
at hurting them I've seen a commercial
potential there we're going to slowly
whisk these things around and they're
clear no so this is just a summary sober
a couple of months in so these are the
systems and sensors that we've actually
got up and running and integrated into
the air frames and they're at a research
level nothing's at a commercial stage
where I could go and sell this on mass
but behind all of these and there's been
a degree of research a degree of
activity a degree of real world and
actual research and getting these things
out there and testing them to make them
work ubiquitous imagery shot so these
are just the top left is the very first
flight we ever did bottom right was one
where would actually sorted out some of
the vibration issues so again the flying
at about 100 meters 20 mil lens on the
400 d cannon getting about 20 millimeter
pixel size on the ground and
we're flying repeatedly when we have
control from the ground over when the
camera triggers or not and focuses or
not and we can consistently get three
frames a second for as long as we want
till the memory card runs out and we've
got a large memory card in there so
stitching them together good overlap
putting that through the photometric
processing tools and again you can see
some of the field work the yellow stuff
is Trimble GPS kit the white plates are
a4 sheets bonded onto metal backs
because this is actually a paddock with
grass about this high that we're
operating out of and so that was doing
some of the photometric true thing and
also just some of the scaling when we
were zooming in these are some of the
simpson systems that i am demanding the
team has in place by the end of the year
as is my right as head of the place I'm
quite keen to move it forward and we've
got down to the end of platform
stabilization now texas instruments is
this week's job and thermal imaging next
week the front end we should have within
a month we've got three autopilots we're
exploring at the moment and to have
grown one commercially available and so
we'll just keep on testing those
trialing those and comparing the
operations of those and work our way up
to Susan hopefully one sort of variant
as we move throughout the year the
operation operations operationally
longer-term just keep on getting that
experienced and there's no replacement
as you guys know for getting out there
building these things integrating the
sensors flying them learning from the
real world and your operations there
continue to work with CIA to sort out
the operational and legal issues
potentially and there's already folk
demanding this develop may be larger
certainly longer duration aircraft so on
the right-hand side there you can see a
four meter wingspan aircraft we're
speaking with an Australian company
about developing I had contact with the
white heron in New Zealand and explore
potential for early commercial
operations even as early as the end of
this year where we can operate under
model aircraft regulations if needs be
and deliver something of value that
someone will pay for short term plans on
this get that photogrammetry process
chain a bit more robust speed up the
time to actually generate in the dtms or
those value-added products look at the
issues of long-range by which I mean 60
200 kilometer real-time video
transmission of both thermal and in for
red sari visible and infrared data the
whole issue of autonomy and that has
safety issues it has technology issues
looking at the operations their launch
and recovery in difficult terrain so we
need to be able to launch without any
runway and launch catapult launch we
need to be able to recover in the same
if we're going to be actually doing some
of the things that we think impossible
so there's a mech in just use to do
there during the initial analysis
probably on a commercial basis of the
cost-benefit analysis of the systems we
are developing and seeing whether that
stacks up for some of the early
application and markets that we think
we've identified this is it nearly there
now just two more slides and then we can
get into the discussion so future plans
aspirations just one slide really choose
a random date 2010 we will be and we
have to be world-leading I want people
as we are now with first from Cambridge
nails we're knocking on my door saying I
want to come and do a PhD with you I
want to come and do research with you
and that's what's happening already and
funky looking like this because of you
know they seem really excited or they
want to go and jump out of planes in New
Zealand or I don't know what it is but
they're coming along and we've got to
keep that going industrially focused
expertise and skills both in terms of
the contract work we can do externally
and the internal R&amp;amp;D that we're doing
choose random numbers for size of staff
a number of PhD student researcher I
mean that's what's in the business
planner that's what's in my mind but
it's got to be sustainable and it might
go one way or the other a source of
successful commercial spin out and
within reason as long as it's legal and
vaguely ethical and deal can be done
that all parties are happy with then you
know it's there to be discussed and I'm
not going to try and Prejudice what
route all routes that may take so just a
final quick reminder after all the
flapping around and all the looking at
all the lead details final slide just to
remind everyone ignore everything else
that is our core business that is the
core skills that we actually have the
integration and underpinning knowledge
of position orientation imaging sensors
and systems getting them to do stuff in
the real world and that's have used to
somebody externally I thank you very
