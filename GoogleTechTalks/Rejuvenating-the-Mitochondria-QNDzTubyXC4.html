Google to talk about our research and
like you know other great things that we
have going on in um and thanks for the
support that Google giving a provides
for organizations like ours so we are a
non-profit research foundation that does
research into anti-aging and to sort of
start you off with our concept of how we
think about aging and how it impacts
disease
the traditional way that that people
that medicine thinks about intervening
with aging is is attacking the
pathologies so you've got a disease
heart disease or cancer and you know
you've got a cancer what is cancer it's
you know too many cells and a tumor so
we've got to get rid of the tumor so
we're going to zap the that you're going
to cut out the tumor and zap it somehow
that's that's a pathology approach to to
dealing with a disease of aging it's
been kind of hip lately to to go back to
the beginning and look at metabolism so
that so the sort of the root cause of
all aging is the byproducts of
metabolism so there's all kinds of cool
genetic tricks you can do in animals in
model systems where you can genetically
manipulate them and slow down their
aging you know 10 20 even 100 percent
and some model systems and you know
maybe you'll get a doubling of the
lifespan of a of a microscopic worm or
or a fruit fly and you know and that
works on up into mice but people are
looking at trying to intervene at that
level I'm saying is there a way that we
can drug some of these pathways and see
if we can slow down the aging process a
little
and that's a fine approach but our
preferred method is to intervene at the
level of where the damage is
accumulating as a result of metabolism
as a way to treat pathology by either
reversing or preventing damage that
causes the pathology to step back for a
moment and and talk about what our
foundation does in the big picture we
organize outreach events we do some
interaction trying to get policy changes
say the FDA and such like that and most
of that is focused in on different
conferences that we organize the last
three years we've been organizing a
series called the rejuvenation
biotechnology conference in the here at
the Bay Area which is focused on trying
to nucleate a rejuvenation biotechnology
community around companies and academia
nonprofit research trying to build this
this industry another aspect of our of
our work non-research work as our
educational mission
we the the main aspect of our
educational mission is our summer
internship program and that's where we
we screen hundreds of applicants it's a
very competitive process and we get some
of the best and brightest undergraduate
students in the in the country who are
focused on biology biomedical research
and bring them into our labs here in
Mountain View or distributing around the
country to affiliated labs where though
the work on a project that that that you
know has some interaction with our
mission and then they also learn about
our philosophy and our process in the
way that we are trying to tackle the
diseases and disabilities of aging and
then
hopefully going out into the end of the
world and being advocates on our behalf
and then along with our educational
mission we produce videos you can go to
our website to see educational videos
about lectures about the biology of
Aging and and some of our approaches to
tackle it there's a bunch of celebrities
that have endorsed us and it's great to
have their support and they help us with
with fundraising as well as as a world
class scientists on our research
advisory board um people who we will
convene to advise us on on our science
and our and our approaches so this is a
little bit of an of an old slide but it
it tells the the right picture which is
that you know overall US health care
spending is just ballooning the sides of
years old so but the one point two
trillion dollar is probably low and the
National Institutes of Health are the
the main funders of biological research
certainly biomedical research in this
country and they spend a bit over thirty
billion dollars a year on research the
National Institute on Aging has is a
piece of that NIH pie and their budgets
a little over a billion dollars their
actual expenditures on stuff that we
consider relevant to damage repair as a
means of tackling the pathology of Aging
is somewhere down in the low
double-digit millions of dollars per
year which brings it down comparable to
our budget which depending on how well
fundraising is going at particular years
somewhere in the three to five million
dollars a year so that's that's kind of
a picture of you know that we're
actually having we think a fairly
substantial impact on on the basic
research in this in this field but also
how far there is
in terms of stimulating research in this
area so we we have in our research
program aspect which is the main aspect
of what we do at srf we have research at
our research center which I'll tell you
a lot more about in a few moments but we
also fund external research so sometimes
we go out and we have you know project
that we want to tackle say we want to
tackle the damage that's caused by
glucose floating around in your
bloodstream we'll go out and find the
best researcher in an academia or
industry and we will fund a project
usually a pilot project to try to get
some energy started in that in that area
that can eventually develop into
something that can be therapeutic so
these are some of the topics that we've
that we've funded over over the years
and they cover some of a lot of the
different categories of damage that we
that we associate with aging so you know
cell loss and cell atrophy you know when
your cells get a little bit stopped
dividing you can't replace the cells
that you have that's when you start
talking about stem cell therapies when
you're looking at a stuff in the
extracellular matrix which is the space
between your cells that can stiffen up
with with age and we're looking at ways
to try to clean that up here's an
example of that kind of research that
I'm just going to touch on that's been
really quite successful in in recent
years and our researcher David Spiegel
is a professor at Yale that we have been
funding on this project it was known
that a certain kind of glucose
cross-linked so glucose is a molecule
that everybody here is familiar with
right it's a it's a unit of energy that
our that our body uses to transport
energy through the bloodstream it's also
a fairly reactive molecule and so we can
react with say you're the
all of your your arteries and cause them
to stiffen up with age because we always
have whether or not you have diabetes
which is just a little bit too much
glucose floating around your bloodstream
or the normal amount you still have
glucose floating or blood stream and
it's going to react with with anything
that it touches slowly over time those
reactions build up and eventually you
get stiffening of the arteries you get
diabetic neuropathy and associated
effects of aging along those lines so
what what David was able to do was
synthesize one of the main chemical
cross links that forms synthetically in
the lab and now we're working at
figuring out ways to break those those
cross links to both diagnose detect them
in in the body and break them and
another mission of ours like I was
saying before is to try to stimulate a
industry here and so here are a few
companies that have spun out of our
technologies that we've developed at a
sense Research Foundation icar where
they are working on therapy for Emeka
degeneration based on some enzyme
therapy research that we did in our lab
ocean which is a competitor of unity
that you may have seen in the news
recently raising an awful lot of money
to try to kill senescence cells
senescence cells being cells that
accumulate with aging and then just sit
there and don't go away and gum up the
works and ergo sand hrb that are working
on cracks and the atherosclerosis
therapy and so like I said we our
headquarters is here on the other side
of Mountain View from from Google
headquarters and it's much smaller than
than Google for now but we have a small
small lab here in Google that's been
open since
late 2010 and we've been doing some some
cool research in house there ever since
and these are the three projects we have
going on there right now the aqua
sentence project is a cancer project
that targets telomeres which are the
ends of your chromosomes that shorten
with every cell division and they're
important to keep long for cancer cells
to be able to survive and that's headed
up by Geraldo Silva who's here with me
today and you can ask him questions
about it later if if you're interested
but he's developed some really cool
technology for being able to detect how
it is that certain kinds of cancers are
are doing that and we're working on
trying to screen for ways to to kill
those cancers we we have a small project
on screening for drugs that to get rid
of the really bad cholesterol which our
cholesterol is caused by nation products
of cholesterol and let's say a small
project that we're hoping to spin out
into a small company this year as well
as perhaps the the cancer project make a
lot of some exciting news on those two
projects in the coming year and then
finally a mitochondrial project which is
one of our other projects that we've had
going for a while that we've recently
had some really cool success and I'm
going to dive into a bit more deeply
here and most of the work that I'll tell
you about mitochondria most of the stuff
I'm going to show you is it was
performed by a doctor with a boom in the
found who's here with me today who will
answer any questions that that that I
can't answer
so the the mitochondria is the
powerhouse of the of the cell it's it's
it's an organelle that lives inside your
cell you've got hundreds or in some
cases over in some cells over a thousand
if these mitochondria floating around
yourself and they generate most of your
energy and they do it in an extremely
efficient way
mitochondria are really weird and
interesting in that they have their own
DNA and this is the only place that you
find DNA that's not in the nucleus of
your cell being what we usually think of
as the genome that we inherit from our
parents one copy from mom and one copy
from dad that the mitochondria is is
totally different it has its own DNA
it's a very small circular DNA and you
only inherit it from mom this is a this
is a problem for aging because when you
generate power say at a coal-fired power
plant you generate a bunch of pollution
right and the same thing happens when
you generate energy inside the
mitochondria you you generate byproducts
which are called free radicals and free
radicals are very reactive to DNA and so
this isn't a great combination that
evolution has come up with of putting
these these two things right next to
each other so it's a little bit of a
leftover of evolutionary history that
that is responsible for this so what we
are are trying to do is figure out ways
to to replace these genes when they go
bad using a gene therapy approach so um
I want to say a couple of words to
convince you the feasibility of this
project people say what you're going to
try to you know fix or replace an entire
genome well it's a really tiny genome
it's only about 16,000 bases long and
for for comparison there's three billion
bases in each each copy of your nuclear
genome so it it's tiny in comparison to
your to your nuclear genome there's only
13 genes protein coding genes in in the
mitochondria they're all essential genes
and we're working on all of them but the
the nucleus where the recipe of genes
are kept they code somewhere thousand to
fifteen hundred genes that help regulate
the mitochondria as well so it's a tiny
minority of
the genes that regulate your
mitochondria that are still stored
inside of a mitochondria and then the
last thing that that I want to remind
you about is that about the
mitochondrial genetics is that there's
that the mitochondria speaks on a
slightly different language I like to
call it a dialect then your nucleus the
nucleus does so that ATC's and G's that
make up your entire DNA world are coded
they code a slightly different amino
acid language in the mitochondria than
they do in the living class so just hold
on to that little bit of tribute for for
a moment so these are the 13 genes and
the role that kind of the place that
they are in the mitochondria so this is
this is zoomed in of one part of the
mitochondria where all the energy is
being made and all 13 of these genes
that are inside of the mitochondria they
take part directly in energy generation
process and so these are the the ones
that we're working on the last two
they're 86 and 88 are the ones I'm going
to talk about today and they are
essential for the actual end of the
energy energy generation process the
creation of ATP which is the the
currency of energy in your cells and how
what how about chemically biochemical
reactions happen in your in your cells
is is from ATP as the providing energy
to chemical reactions so um to tackle
this problem a few years ago
Amitha and I put our heads together and
you know we've been working on this for
several years already and kind of having
intermittent progress and looking at
other people in the field and looking at
their interment in progress and saying
we need to do something different here
and so we went looking for some cells
that that totally
that didn't just have a few mutations
and a few copies that are mitochondrial
DNA that might be affecting aging or
might be affecting a patient in a
complicated way that's that's difficult
to pin down in the lab we went looking
for some extremely rare patients that
have extremely severe mutations in the
mitochondrial DNA and particularly ones
that have mutations that would
completely destroy the activity of one
or more of those thirteen genes in a way
that we could pin down something very
specific to work on so we found a some
cells from a patient that were published
in the literature that had a very rare
mutation in a TPA that totally shut down
a tp8 activity and then totally shut
down the function of the ATPase which
makes all of your energy so of course
this young person was very sick and a
researcher collected it cells for for
for further study and we got a hold of
those cells and did a an awful lot of
work to make them perfectly clean and
mutant so that we could study them and
so I'll try not to spend too much time
on these blots which show proteins and
where they are and such like that but if
you see the arrow on the left it shows
in normal cells where that protein is
and then the right just next to it
there's nothing there which means that
it has none of that protein and then we
were surprised to find looking over on
the right side where you see 86 that
that the mutation that affected one also
indirectly affected the other I won't go
into the nitty-gritty of why that
happened it took us a while to figure it
all out
but we ended up having a cell line that
that was deficient in not one but two
genes but we thought we could tackle
this problem and if we could then it
would actually be kind of twice as cool
as as a as a project where we only
solved one of them so looking at this
cartoon in the in the middle there that
the picture of the 86 and 88 genes this
is kind of how we engineered them we
first on that on the left it says the g1
mts we took a mitochondrial targeting
sequence from a different gene that we
that it was known from the literature is
used for one of those other thousand
genes that's normally in the nucleus and
we took that and we stuck it on the
front of of our genes and this is
actually we've done trial and error with
a lot of different versions of these and
this one we found a few that work really
well so we found one that worked really
well and we stuck it in front of the DNA
for our two genes then we had to recode
our genes to make them speak the nuclear
language again so they were speaking the
mitochondrial language so now we recoded
them so that they speak the nuclear
language and then we stuck on the on the
end of them a tag a flag if you will
that we could use to detect them inside
of the of the cells and over there on
the right you can see them there's kind
of a progression here of a little bit of
an example of some of the trial and
error that we went through to get the to
get it working temporarily in cells and
then eventually permanently and getting
it into the mitochondria and so it stays
there long-term and so that was all
successful and we were able to also get
it into these rather fragile and sickly
mutant cells and we could do it
simultaneously with both the 86 and the
HPA genes and it's so it's kind of like
a gene therapy that we're doing the
cells we can put this into viruses that
that you can put that you can infect
cells with and and give them to either
temporarily or stabili Express Express
these these genes so just one more of
these these blots and then I'll show you
how the cells are doing this I'm just
going to ask you to take my word for it
this kind of blot basically shows in
that second panel from the left that was
two
dark lines there okay I'm going to do it
I said I wasn't gonna do I'm gonna run
over to the board pointed out that these
two here this show that you're actually
getting our protein that we can detect
with the flag tag into the mitochondria
and into the right place on the
mitochondria and it's assembling into
the ATP's and then the next one next to
that in that third panel when this these
are showing up here but not in the
mutant that means it's reassembling
completely in the in in the mitochondria
that that protein complex is
reassembling so now you have an ATPase
there so here's some more data the light
up front is a is a little bright but I
don't know if you can see in the the
middle two columns at the at the bottom
on the top you have red that light up
the mitochondria in cells so you have
maybe I would say 10 cells on the on the
slide and then all those red dots or
where the mitochondria are always
standing with a guy lights up
mitochondria and then the green on the
second row then those are the the flag
tag which we've made fluorescent here
and you can see under the microscope II
that the the ATP 8 and the ATP 6
proteins are lighting up and then if you
can see the the yellow color in the on
the bottom row in those and those Center
2 panels there the yellow means that
they're Co localizing they're going to
the same place in the mitochondria so
what does this actually do for the cells
are they are they are they happier they
healthier so why why do we breathe we
breathe to make energy and we make
energy in our mitochondria the oxygen
that you breathe eventually it's it's
essentially it's only function is to go
inside your cells and go into your
mitochondria and take part in the energy
generation process so
um we can measure breathing in cells in
the lab we can stick an oxygen meter
down into a petri dish where some cells
are growing and measure how much oxygen
they're consuming and this is a this
graph is a measurement of that so the
two lines at the bottom are the mutant
cells that have pretty much shut down
their their energy generation process
and and therefore their respiration and
so these cells are basically not
breathing at all um when you look up to
the three lines up above the red line at
the top those are normal wild-type cells
and they breathe just fine and that
first row we do different things with
drugs - there the first row is the first
set if before that all the myosin comes
in you can see that the top is with
their basal respiration and then that
third section there is where you can see
their maximal respiration and so when
you look at those second two lines there
that the black and the orange you can
you can see that the cells that we're
rescuing that we're putting back just
atpa alone will get you up to two orange
and they're doing pretty well and then
you put them both in together the 88 and
the ATP 6 and there they're aspiring
quite well so that's one really cool
measurement of of mitochondrial function
that we were able to show almost
complete recovery of in our rescued
cells and here is another there's a
dozen or so different measures that we
can do of this and I'm just going to
show you a couple of them here we're
just growing cells but we're going cells
and feeding them to different kinds of
food and unfortunately one picture is
covering the the other usually this is a
PowerPoint presentation where it's
animated on top of each other so
apologize for that so you can't see all
the cells
cells grown on glucose they can survive
the way that you know petri dish not
really they can survive using only
glucose to to grow on you know or some
other sugars but you know glucose is a
pretty Universal sugar so you can do
anaerobic or aerobic respiration and so
they can survive with you know doing the
old-fashioned kind of energy generation
like bacteria do and they can survive on
glucose however if you grow them on
galactose which is a different kind of
sugar that can only be used for aerobic
respiration in the mitochondria and so
if you have cells that can't do a
respiration in the mitochondria that
can't generate energy in the
mitochondria then they're going to
totally die and so if you look you can't
see that the second panel which which
has those the cells the mutant cells
very well but the last panel on the
bottom there's like no cells there
whereas there's hundreds of cells on top
when they're growing on a glucose
however when we put back the H beam in
the ATP six they can grow again and the
better illustration of that is the
actual quantification which you can see
on this graph the the cells that have no
88 or 86 in them they'll pretty much
completely die in like five days on this
on galactose if you just put in a to b6
alone basically the same thing is
happening but if you put back in 88
with or without 86 then you'll get a
much better survival and then we can
actually go much further than five days
and they can you know slowly recover and
continue growing fairly normally during
only aerobic respiration so those two
those the this those are two examples of
how successful we were at completely
rejuvenating these cells basically
bringing cells that couldn't survive
under under growth conditions that
require them to be able to to breathe we
restored them completely with our with
our cellular gene therapy if you will
and and brought them back to life and
close to normal function
so I'll just I'll wrap up a little bit
early here in in the next couple minutes
in sort of talk about where this kind of
technology can go where we hope it will
go and then I'll take any questions that
anybody might have so we're we're taking
this particular gene therapy that we
developed for these cells and we're
going to try and put it into a mouse
soon and unlike those working on some
proof-of-concept experiments for that
and the in the lab right now trying to
translate it into the end of the mouse
code and we're starting to get that
working we're also working on not just
these two genes but like I mentioned all
13 of these genes so sometimes like I
said it sounds like an intractable
problem but it's only 13 genes we've
already been basically completely
successful with one gene a second gene
to back it up is working fairly well and
we're trying to improve it and we want
to we want to create a technology that
isn't necessarily that we need to
customize one gene at a time but a
platform technology that will that will
work for any of these thirteen genes and
so we're working on all kinds of tricks
that I haven't had a chance to go over
today to further engineer these these
genes and improve their their targeting
to the mitochondria so we continue to to
work on that and we have projects on the
other genes of the mitochondrial family
and then of course the eventual goal is
to get this into people so we're an
aging Research Foundation and we're
therefore interested in the mutations
that occur randomly with with aging
however there's always crossover and
fields and so I'm studying not cells
that have age normally but cells from a
patient that had a mutation in the
mitochondria and these patients are just
really sick I mean you get a serious
mutation in your mitochondrial DNA you
can't make energy properly and if if you
get born at all oftentimes these these
children are dying you know around the
age of two or suffering for much longer
so the first gene therapies for for the
mitochondria will hopefully go into
these patients and you know they can go
one unit a time and then eventually as
we improve the technology we hope to be
able to use it to treat say sarcopenia
the weakening of the muscles with with
age so just a wrap up here and we've got
great team of people at at srf working
on this great interns all this work was
that that I just showed was recently
published in nucleic acids research and
it was I think it's been very well
received we collaborate with some
phenomenal researchers up at the buck
Institute on on aging and that's where
they had that fancy piece of equipment
that could measure the the breathing of
the cells that I used for for this
project and I want to point out one
aspect of our funders usually it's the
most boring topic on the side but I
thought you all might be interested in
that and that premiere your google
giving perspective srf is just sort of
the general all the people who donate
money to srf general fund and they give
a lot of money to to the foundation the
foster Foundation forever healthy our
small family foundations we're a wealthy
family has has donated money to us to do
this project and it's been extremely
helpful lifespan dot IO I thought is
something that be really interesting to
all of you to check out they're a
crowdfunding site focused on funding
science
and that is being done on on Aging and
particularly on aging therapies or
aspects of damage repair reversing
aspects of the diseases of Aging and I
think that they are doing some
phenomenal work there because they've
they've raised some really great money
for us and I I'm not a hundred percent
sure of this but they might be the most
successful crowdfunders in in science
today they are really doing a great job
they're very small they're only focusing
on one project at a time but they they
can raise tens of thousands of dollars
for for single projects sort of more
competitive with you know sort of the
kind of successful IT Crowd funding that
that you tend to see out there um and
then the long density foundation which
give us a small grant a few years ago to
start this ATP a project so I'll I'll
stop there and thank you all for your
attention and the invitation to come
talk and answer any questions that
anybody would have all right I have a
question yes so in the sense research
approach there's seven things that have
to be fixed to comprehensively end aging
and restore all people to health so full
health of the young young so well and
this is one of those seven things yes so
it's kind of exciting to see it it's
actually working so suppose that only
this is fixed and the other six things
are that they take longer to to achieve
what would that have an immediate effect
it's a great question and it's a
difficult question so I didn't I didn't
go in this in my introduction when I was
talking about the the damage
accumulation but we categorize the the
damage into seven different categories
of damage might
andreal mutations being one of them
accumulation of senescence cells I
mentioned that earlier it's another
those glucose cross links with another
so you know what if we just fix the the
mitochondria is that going to have an
appreciable effect on on aging and the
the it's a complicated question
you know the short answer is I don't
know the long answer is that it may have
more of an effect in certain aspects of
Aging than others it may not be expected
to have a big effect on lifespan because
you've got you know you fix this one but
you've got six other great limiting
aspects of damage that are going to kill
you if this doesn't so for example by
analogy let's say that you know you
cured heart disease completely we just
like wiped heart disease off the map
that should just have an amazing effect
on on Aging right because it's was the
number one cause of death right now
heart disease I think so you know you
would think that that might you know
jump the human lifespan up by 10 20
years in fact it wouldn't I want to say
it's something estimated like two years
or something that we would get before
something else would get you before
you'd get hit by you know cancer
Alzheimer's disease something else that
would kill you so in that regard I think
it probably wouldn't jump up the human
lifespan a lot but it might have effects
on health span that could be quite
dramatic for example in the skeletal
muscle which is all the muscle that we
used to do everything in our daily lives
those might those are thought to have a
disproportionate reliance on
mitochondria and be impacted by my
control aging there's some experiments
on mice that suggests that rejuvenated
mitochondria in old mice has really
dramatic effects on their on our
strength and endurance
so I the research that you presented is
the first step of many and and I'm
curious about what you think the
timeline would look like for for the
future slide and what might slow down or
speed up that timeline yeah so um with
the the future side that I presented was
talking about the the mitochondria
project in particular that we're trying
to turn into gene therapy so what we're
trying to do right now in the lab over
the next maybe four months is perfect
we've got it perfected in these human
patient cells but we can't go straight
into human patients the the FDA frowns
on that so we need to find a way to test
this in animals first
so we've we found a collaborator who has
a mouse model and so we want to be able
to do this in mice so we're hoping over
the next few months to perfect it in the
mouse cells and then go into the mice so
then how long is going to take to get it
working mice hopefully to is years and
then we can start thinking about safety
testing in large animals and then going
into humans so you could you you could
theoretically see you know therapies
based on this kind of thing and I'm
wildly speculating here 10 12 15 years
going into humans now one one thing that
we don't really work directly on is gene
therapy technology itself gene therapy
technology isn't really approved it's in
clinical trials it's done a lot of
different clinical trials it's not
approved for general use yet and so that
technology is still being perfected so
um we're relying on that getting
perfected and approved and us being able
to plug our technology into a gene
therapy platform you use if it was you
know maybe you know by
compassionate use form you could see it
happening in less than 10 years in
humans that's kind of a lease timeline
for you for this project so my
understanding is that throughout the
your visionary history a lot of genes
originally from mitochondria were high
but the first symbiosis bacterias are
already migrated your nucleus so why did
they stop at these 13 genes
left end is a universal I mean do mice
have exactly these 13 genes left in the
panel controller and how about like
yeast and even print yeah this is a
really this is a pretty hard question of
it so about a billion or so years ago
the primitive mitochondria fused with
our primitive ancestor and formed a
symbiotic eukaryotic cell and that you
know pre mitochondria started producing
energy for it and they they became
somatic they all each other their own
genomes like I mentioned before and as
the the question implies they have
drifted over the over the millennia into
the nuclear genome and get incorporated
and recoded like I was talking about
that we were doing manually by the
evolutionary natural selection process
so um it seems to be a continuous
process that we've dwindled down that
we've transferred something like a
thousand genes now and we're down to the
last 13 has it stopped it probably not
it's I it seems to be happening you can
look across a evolution and in different
types of organisms like you were
pointing out and see more primitive
organisms that have
or of it still in the mitochondria and
and organisms like us that are down to
these 13 we're actually using that
information to inform our our
engineering of the mitochondria we look
at the evolution of how this has
happened we look at what the different
challenges that evolution has had to
overcome and how it has accomplished
that and we've learned to mimic that by
looking at the genes that say have come
into the nucleus more recently so um yes
mice have the same 13 genes and no yeast
don't have the same ones there's there's
a lot of relation and overlap I maybe am
if I wants to chime in some detail genes
so otherwise at some point all the other
leather genes have been technically it
should be possible for us to these genes
but again those two genes but we're
working at it is there any chance that
cells that have bad mitochondria are
more likely to become cancerous or cause
all the cells to become cancerous yes
it's a complicated story that there is
there is it and it's not something I'm
an expert on but if you want to learn
about this really really complicated
field of study you can look up the
Warburg effect and that does show that
that there's a there's a strong
interplay between the mitochondria and
the nucleus in in cancer that there's
not a simple relation that I can say
you know if you get this one mutation in
mitochondria that it's going to
predispose you to cancer the same way
that that you you can see that in the
nuclear genome for certain kinds of
genes you know famous genes like you
know Braca one which is the breast
cancer gene or p53 telomerase those are
those are famous genes that are always
activated in cancer it's much more
complicated signaling interaction
between them so we don't we don't we
don't know of any simple ways that it
would do that no no maybe a relevant
part of your question would be you know
our is our therapy can help prevent
cancer and you know it'd be difficult
for me to to make too many claims about
that but it might it might if you if you
have healthy mitochondria you're
avoiding an awful lot of downstream
effects of of sick mitochondria that
that could be carcinogenic okay well
thank you for this excellent talk thanks
