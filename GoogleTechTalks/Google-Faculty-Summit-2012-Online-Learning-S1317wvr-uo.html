eventually the moderator of this next
session there's enormous interest in the
world as we discussed very early this
morning and what information technology
can do for education and there is an
awful lot of potential so we have a
panel that has three individuals that
will be talking in it a first Peter
Norvig who is director of research your
google is going to be talking about his
experience in of this massive open
online course area aware as many of you
know each Hoff nai course and has been
involved in other activities with it has
been thinking quite deeply about
opportunities in this both near-term and
one after that the professor Daphne
Koller who's truly one of the world's
experts in machine learning and now also
in education Daphne got involved in
recognizing that the professor's were
keep the same thing over and over again
kind of a waste of time always did not
record some of the stuff we use it and
started thinking about how to use
information technology part of three
years ago
well I I think we did actually fund
provide some funding to death they so
we're very very proud of that because
it's resulted in an enormous amount of
really quality thinking and the new
company and a lot of universities that
are going to depend on this company so
Daphne is going to talk about her
company and her interest and thinks
she's learned in doing this and then we
have a Brad Orwin somewhere it's
probably here there he is see him so he
is the vice president of product for
Google+ so as you know Google+ is one of
the truly interesting things going on at
least as a at least as our wonderful and
interesting competition and challenge
and thing going on in the industry brad
is co responsible for everything that
goes on and and Brad's been thinking
quite a bit about the role of community
and social experience etc and education
and we'll be here to talk a little bit
about that but then we'll have a Q&amp;amp;A
session when the panelists can all talk
about what they think can happen in
response to your questions there should
be plenty of time for
i would say about 35 minutes rattle
profit on the shortest amount because
he's not primarily focused on education
focused on google+ primarily from last i
heard when talking with it okay so
without further ado Peter take it away
okay so let me talk a little bit about
how I got here and and where I think the
field as a whole is going so really
started when I was writing this text
book some of you might have seen and so
Stuart and I were doing the third
edition and for this edition more than
the others it really struck me of what
the limitations are of stamping these
books onto dead trees so you know I
would write a page like this and you
know and some of this was difficult
getting it right and trying to explain
it well but I knew that was what was
going to happen is you know students
would take this and they would highlight
the parts that they liked and they would
highlight in a different color the parts
that were really confusing and they
didn't understand and they would star
sections that were good and they would
write little notes in the margins and I
was losing all that and it seemed like
this was great information you know I
had a false start and I wrote a
paragraph and then threw it out and
wrote another version why do I be the
one that chooses which paragraph was
better when the students are the ones
that actually know which paragraph is
better and I didn't have a way to
communicate with them that seemed like a
loss in addition I would do things like
this so you know I wrote a program it
generated some data I took that data put
it into matplotlib rotated it around a
bunch of different ways and finally
decided out of all possible 3d views
this is the best view now I learned a
lot about this data by writing that
program and manipulating it and viewing
it from different directions and the
students don't get any of that but of
course if it was online they could have
all of that back again so began to think
well maybe an online class in a textbook
are converging and wanted to be able to
to get there how very in was visiting
and I asked him how
you know what do you think of this and
it seems like if I'm going to go in this
direction I need to know something about
education theory what do I need to know
about education I expected him to answer
with a whole stack of books and I'd have
my work cut out for me and he actually
said there's only one paper you have to
read which was the best answer I've ever
gotten in my life that was Benjamin
blooms paper on the to Sigma effect so
bloom says if you do one-on-one tutoring
and you use this mastery learning
approach you keep tutoring until the the
student gets it then you get a 2
standard deviation improvement so that's
almost a Lake Wobegon effect it means
that ninety-eight percent of the
students are above average I should say
that other people besides bloom who try
to replicate this don't quite get two
standard deviations but they get very
big improvements by one-on-one tutoring
of course the problem is we already have
a crisis that education is too expensive
we can't really afford to give everybody
a one-on-one tutor can we get close to
that of course I ignored house advice
and I didn't just read one paper I
looked at other stuff a lot of very
interesting things at CMU and and herb
Simon's always been one of my heroes one
of the founders of my field and he
reminded me that learning is something
that the students do not something that
I do and I took that to heart so it was
a time again for Sebastian to teach the
AI class at Stanford and he asked me for
the second time to team teach it with
him but he thought that maybe this was a
time we could also bring it to the rest
of the world so we announced hey we're
going to do this we're going to put this
class online within a week 50,000 people
signed up and by the time the class
started 160,000 had signed up from 209
countries in the end about half of those
were seven-day actives meaning they
watched at least one video within the
last week and about 20,000 did all the
homework and finish the class and of
course since then and I could also say
concurrently with that we did our class
and
Andrew Inge did his class on machine
learning Jennifer Widom did her classes
on databases that was all at the same
time and then within a short period
after that Coursera would definitely
will tell you about and Udacity and the
MIT Harvard now Berkeley EDX are all in
the game Google got into the game just
in the last couple weeks so Dan Russell
who's here taught a short two week class
on how to be an expert google searcher
and he got a similar number about
hundred fifty thousand people signed up
about 20,000 finished and you know so
there's a familiar format now to most of
these classes where there are videos
some back and forth about whether it's
good to have a talking head or not
sometimes yes sometimes no a lot of
people seem to be following cons format
of just having the the writing without
having the head and and some going the
other way and so it's a combination of
videos interspersed with questions where
you can click or answer the questions
and move on so what did I learn from
doing this I think the most surprising
thing to me was that motivation was
really the most important thing and and
that's a surprise because you know I've
been at Google for a decade now and for
a big part of my time here my job was
search was information we have it in the
mission statement of our company to
provide access to all the world's
information so i thought my job is you
give people a box like this and they
type in a really hard query and we give
them the right answer and if we can do
it and the other guys can't then we're
doing the right thing but then i talked
with the people from Teach for America
and and I heard a story that was quite
different saying you know here was a
teacher who had a third-grade class and
they were already two years behind grade
level by the end of the year she had an
optically
and I said well wait a minute that
wasn't because of information there
wasn't any better information this year
than last year was all because of
motivation and so I realized that that's
a lot of what we have to concentrate on
and as I go back to rid literature CMU
was telling us that so we had the most
important innovation of our class was
due dates and we thought by by saying
that you had to have the homework done
by the end of the week we would get some
get students to stick around it was also
important to have peers have the
discussion forums to some extent the
prestige of saying you're doing this and
its associated with Stanford and so on
and the authenticity and reputation of
the instructors I think contributed to
that in addition to motivation I think
this idea of constructivism is important
and CMU talks about it and saying that
the students have mental models they
have to build it themselves it's not me
just explaining it to them it's them
getting it so we had the problems first
and then the explanation the student has
to make predictions sometimes get it
wrong and then grapple with why they got
things wrong and I should say the
students hated that you know they would
complain they say no Affairs easier
asking me a question and you didn't tell
me the answer first you know I'm
supposed to just fill in the formula so
I'm not supposed to think for myself you
know what if I got it wrong and so I
think there's a lot of unlearning to do
we trained students that the most
important thing is to get a hundred
percent on the on the test maybe we
should try to convince them that is more
important for them to think and learn
for themselves so this idea of
developing mastery and I talked with how
burien and he told me the story about
how he came to write his very well-known
economics textbook in that he had run
into Richard Hamming at bell labs and
having said well the thing to do is
first you start with all the problem
sets and exams you want students to be
able to pass and then you write the
textbook so that they'll be able to do
that and I realize and those of you who
are in the software development
community will see that what he was
saying is ddd test-driven development so
the idea is instead of writing the code
first you write the test cases first
when the
one of the test cases fails then you go
back and write some code so that the
test case succeeds and that's really the
way we did approach the class we were we
swapped around the approach from saying
gee I have some important information
that I want to convey to the students to
saying what's the next question I want
to ask the students and try to figure
out what the quiz is going to be what
the interaction is going to be what
they're going to play with and then say
just enough so that they can have a good
experience with that next interaction
and there is an example of the types of
quizzes we were doing another important
thing is that it should be a dialogue it
shouldn't just be one on one there was
last week there was it op-ed piece in
The New York Times the trouble with
online education saying well the problem
is that education has to be a dialogue
not a monologue and apparently the
author of this piece had seen an online
class which was a videotape of an
hour-long lecture and said therefore all
online classes are bad and I agree that
that format it is not a very good for
Matt and I agree that it has to be a
dialogue that that is important but I
think that's why we do have online
classes because we want to have a
dialogue and you can have a dialogue
better in an online class than you can
in a 200 student lecture hall where the
store the professor's just lecture so we
wanted to have mixed initiative we
wanted to lecture for only a few minutes
we were inspired by Khan who had you
know I guess on average seven to ten
minute videos we decided to go even
shorter to about two minute videos and
then we would have some kind of
interaction where we going to go from
there to to kind of build this up well
in order to do that you have to have
lots of good questions and lots of
answers and what I think we'd really
like as a field is to have a tree
branching structure right now we have a
very linear structure so we stopped a
lot to ask questions but when you give
me an answer I just say right or wrong
and
everybody gets funneled into the same
next question we really like to have a
more branching structure where it's
personalized for you how are we going to
get there could be through very smart AI
it could be through peers that help you
and answer your individualized questions
we could crowd source that we could pay
a lot of money to have instructors and
TAS develop at all I think we're just
getting started but we want to get down
bore that personalized path from Daphne
I learned about the flipped classroom
which is important both for the entirely
online classes and also for these mixed
classes that can be partially online and
then partially in the classroom from
Eric Mazur I learned about peer
instruction the idea that I'm not the
best one to tell the student how to do
this because it's been 20 years since I
have been confused about the subject and
the students was just confused last week
is the perfect person to explain it to
this student sitting next to him so we
want to give them more opportunities for
practice and again CMU kind of backs
that up and then social was very
important so we realized that the
professor's can't do it alone even with
help from TAS and that's true for a
hundred thousand student classroom I
think it's true even for a 30 student
class room again see you know talks
about that we want to have the students
interacting with each other one of the
hardest parts of doing these classes is
the dynamic range is much harder since
the admission criteria is much less
anybody can take the class not just
Stanford students the dynamic range
between the best student and the worst
student is much larger than it is in a
Stanford classroom and we have to deal
with that professor alone can't do it so
the peers have to help and so we have
various types of discussion forums and
here i show some of the ones we had in
our class we had our own forum but of
course you know everything was rushed
and it wasn't quite ready and so we
encourage students to say well just use
everything that's out there on the web
use the reddit and meet up and Facebook
and Google+ and YouTube and hangouts and
so on and we used all of those and to
some extent you know the negative that
our forum had some flaws in the first
couple weeks but to another extended was
really good because it meant that
students had their own identity in
addition to being part of the whole
class they were part of a smaller
community in one of these many groups
and they they felt more connection that
way and then here's a traditional
college transcript and in terms of
communication bandwidth doesn't give me
maybe something like 30 bits per year is
generated on this transcript now there
are other devices like this one which
gives you about 190 to two thousand bits
per second which is about a trillion
times more the band raped and about a
quadrillion times more per dollar so can
we get do a little bit better of
representing what it is we know about a
student and I think this is one of the
big opportunities for online education
is that we're interacting at more than
just one grade per semester when are
acting many many times per day many
times per minute and we can make some
sense of that we can do some data mining
on this data that we correct collect so
to be pedagogical let me wrap up say
these are the four things I learned were
important I thought going in that was
all going to be about information and I
decided it's about motivation this
constructivism dialogue and social and
the way I think of it is we're all
trying to get to this one on what this
benjamin bloom ideal of i can give you a
dedicated one-on-one tutor we can't
quite afford to do that so we can
experiment with these things that are a
hundred thousand students at a time but
in order to make that work we've got to
exploit not just the one-way
communication
but the communication between everybody
and harness this power of a hundred
thousand square to get close to the one
on one I do okay Stan definitely next</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
