skirted ah my name is is moshe looks on
the conference chair if you just got
here then welcome it's great to see you
ah so we started out last night with
intros from myself and peter norvig who
gave some thoughts on that the
challenges of AGI and then our first
keynote speaker who talked about
driverless cars and some really
excellent work coming from a background
of control theory and dynamic vision and
we're going to hear a philosophical talk
in a little bit and then a neuroscience
talked and one thing that sort of struck
me is the sort of one of the things that
that's exciting about AGI is that it's
it's pre paradigm in the sense that
there's no age I intellectual tradition
there are lots of different intellectual
traditions and it's just very very
interesting and according to that we
have people from these different
disciplines who are actually talking to
each other and hopefully referencing
each other's work and learning from each
other because that's how progress
happens and I'm going to turn it over to
dr. Ben go to who will introduce our
next speaker hello again so I Aaron
sloman told me he could give a
one-sentence introduction of himself
which i'll see if i can remember which
basically he's a mathematician who
decided that the best way to solve
philosophical problems what was to do AI
and I think that's a an intriguing
description but to go to go into a
little more detail I mean I've I've been
following our errands work for it for a
really long time almost as long as I've
been thinking about AI myself and I
think he's done he's done a huge amount
to bring together a I philosophy of mind
in mathematics cognitive psychology in
other
disciplines sort of been into a unified
on understanding of intelligence
following up on the comments Moshe just
made about the interdisciplinarity of
the field I mean that takes place not
only by bringing people with different
backgrounds together but by having
people such as as dr. slummin who can
bring these different disciplines
together inside their own mind and their
own research so after getting his PhD in
1962 aaron has been working on issues at
the intersection of AI and philosophy
ever since see his work gain something
from their actions with other early AI
pioneers like Marvin Minsky john
mccarthy and herbert simon but he
certainly charted his own direction
diverging in significant ways from from
any of these folks he held the chair in
AI in cognitive science at the School of
Computer Science at the University of
Birmingham before that for a long period
a chair with a similar title at the
University of Sussex he's now an
honorary professor of AI in cognitive
science at Birmingham and I've I've
enjoyed a number of his papers and
presentations online over the past years
1 title particularly struck me on his
website and convinced me will be good
idea to invite him to speak at an AGR
conference the title that presentation
was a new approach to philosophy of
mathematics designed a young Explorer
able to discover toddler theorems so I I
like the idea of toddler theorems of
course the Titan with a lot of my own
thinking about AGI preschool and so
forth and just looking at the young mind
still in development as doing some sort
of of mathematics and fair improving to
understand it practical things in the
sensorimotor world i think is a it's a
compellingly cross-disciplinary way to
look at some at some
for AI issues so without any more
introduction than Aaron sloman thank you
very much for inviting me this is quite
an interesting challenge because I know
this is a very high-powered and very
diverse audience and oh my i'm sure
everyone in room knows more than I do
about something because I spread myself
recently is there anyone in either
corner of the room who can hear me okay
and I'll try to remember to keep close
to this thing but that requires parallel
processing one minor correction to the
summary that been reported he left out
the word failed I'm a failed
mathematician in the sense my first year
is mathematics and I was going to go on
and do research but I got seduced by
philosophy and I think it's partly
because I wouldn't have been good at
doing research in mathematics I couldn't
find theorems I could find problems as
you'll see but finally serums is a bit
different anyway finally proofs I mean
so I want to give you a brief taste this
looks dangerous I was using a total
theorem about mugs of coffee and tables
and I i I've got a whole lot of
different things which I've been trying
to organize for today and people who
know me well know I never succeed so I
will go on until the time is up and
someone's going to wave a hand when I've
got five minutes left and then maybe one
minute then I'll stop and then we can
have a discussion for a while and as it
says on here at the bottom if you gain
to the triple AI conference which is
following on monday afternoon i'm doing
a tutorial which is four hours if she
covers them and over the copyright
instead of just 45 minutes or so now
these slides will go on my website and
they're designed to be readable
on your own so there's far too much for
presentations so you know you look at
things you need only look at things that
I point it and now I have to somehow
find two pointers at the same time I'm
not going to try but that's when I can
see Turing in his 1950 paper which
everybody quotes and very few people
actually read said at one point in all
to one of the objections instead of
trying to produce oops instead of trying
to produce a program to simulate that
out mind rather why not roll if I
produced one which simulates the child
is this with in subjection to
appropriate course of education one
could obtain the adult brain there's a
premise here about mathematics that I'm
going to come to resume guitars brainy
something like a notebook is on binding
from the stationers rather little
mechanism and lots of blank sheets well
i'm going to say exactly the opposite
nothing like a blank sheet and lots of
mechanism and all those millions of
years of evolution not just it during
human times but before that with
microbes and also to assist look all
those millions of years of evolution
yeah ok roster sorry I try not to rob
too much those years of evolution were
not wasted as John McCarthy he wrote in
1996 he wrote a paper which is worse
reading it got republished about 20
years later was quite a long time later
in the AI journal is called the
well-designed child and here is some
idea he wrote it because it was
triggered by reading work of it'll
dispel k who is one of a number of
developmental psychologists who started
looking at what seems to be innate
knowledge in babies and i think they're
lots of dubious things about the
particular methods and the particular
questions they ask in the political ER
answers they give but at least they i
think would agree with John McCarthy and
I agree John McCarthy who said who wrote
instead of building babies as Cartesian
philosophers taking nothing but their
sensations for granted evolution produce
babies with innate prejudices that
correspond effects about the world and
babies positions in
it learning starts from those prejudices
what's the word like and one of those
instincts of prejudices and somewhere
else he said yes up here evolution
solved a different problem from metal
starting a baby with no a priori
assumptions now I have no objection
people trying to build a baby robot
there's no help for assumptions to see
how far you get I'm only saying insofar
as that's not my goal my goal is to
understand well understand myself mainly
and maybe other people a little bit like
me um and I don't think that's how we
work and there is something that starts
with no air power our assumptions and
then builds humans and that's a planet
with a lot of chemistry and stuff on the
few billion years to miss around in and
maybe a lot of luck I don't know maybe
if there's something inevitable about
what starting state but although I'm
interested in that question how did that
work that's not the question I'm going
to talk about today I'm really asking
huh what a devolution do for human
babies and what would be what would be
like to do that for robots babies I use
this to illustrate some of the sort of
general theme of what I'm saying many
evolution had many different problems at
different stages in evolutionary in the
evolutionary history planet of animals
of planet microbes are various sorts and
the last one how many people don't
recognize that the last picture a few
okay I'd better show the video betty was
a New Caledonian crow at one who I was
brought to Oxford and was given a
problem New Caledonian crows are
particularly intelligent all corvids are
intelligent they do things you couldn't
do like build a nest by bringing one
trick at a time in your mouth or just
hugging these two fingers and and some
are weaving them into a rigid structure
that you can safely put your eggs in
with
bleh try it and let me know if you
manage anyway they do that they do other
things as well they also cut twigs into
a little hooks to get larvae out of
cracks and so on so we wanted to see if
they would recognize a wire piece of
wire been to the hook as a solution to a
problem was getting food out of a bucket
apologies to all of you have seen this
before it became very famous in 2002 the
videos were all over the place and in
fact if you give Google Betty crow hook
and Oxford you'll get to the Oxford
ecology lab and you'll see lots of
videos and pictures anyway Betty
surprised them by doing something
different from what they thought
initially she surprised him by
recognizing the hook and and getting the
the bucket of food out of the tube and
you'll see her doing it but then
something happened that they didn't plan
is that visible she is there with a
straight piece of wire because the male
crow had taken the hook away and she
found a straight piece of wire so she
came with his piece of wire and tried
for a while to get the food out and and
sometimes she managed this was trial 7
they had a whole lot of trials and
sometimes she could push the wire
through the handle place it gives the
opposite side and lift it out which is
not bad oh crap some colleagues in
Birmingham it are trying with children
teenagers and they are having great
difficulty with those properties are
given in a while or pipe cleaner or
something anyway you probably saw what
happens she stopped after a while and
stuck the end of the wiring to the
ducting tape at the bottom and very
expertly just moved round to make a hook
and then she came and used it it's worth
looking at several times and looking
closely at what's going on but I'm not
going to spin a little cabinet now
there's too much to get through let me
show you something rather different a
baby now I don't know what's going on in
this baby's mind and I don't know how
the baby's father put up with what was
shown in this video the baby sitting on
a carpet in the tub of yogurt in his
apology just as you've seen me shed
before and this is not an animal solving
a problem I think this is a an animal
trying to find out what it should learn
about the world by trying things are and
seeing what happens and the interesting
thing is whoops wrong a command so
someone holding a cup of yogurt the
baby's got a spoon and notice that he
trying to feed his leg with this then he
feeds himself his stomach then he does a
little experiment yeah he pushed the
spooning let go you could he doesn't
again later the same see very tries to
transfer lager to yoga to the other
nigga and fails another done experiments
better one then your green cheese rounds
now it looks to me as if he thinks that
if you put the spoon somewhere with
yogurt in it the yogurt goes to that
place and you see him trying again a
thing there he found some yogurt of the
fraud was the wrong place so put in the
right place on the street and then into
the mouth then he tries to put more
yogurt on the floor and he hasn't
understood the relationship between the
bowl the yogurt in the floor which has
to be controlled for that transfer to
succeed and he said I'm guessing what's
going on that's me trying to make sense
of this Missy horrible demonstration and
but he seems more than once to try to
put yogurt somewhere on the floor on his
leg and so on and fails this is aged 11
months I presume that not long after
that he had worked out that what you
have to do is turn the screw him but he
solves another problem which is actually
rather harder right the end of the video
when he decides to transfer the spoon to
the other hand and he manages so he's
got one hand holding the end and the
other hand goes he has to somehow
transfer it without dropping the spoon
and as you saw he managed all of these
things are available on my website and
more so what's going on there well I
believe this is an early phase in a
process i'm going to talk about a phase
which suspect will ring lots of
bells for people who talk about a GI is
involving exploratory learning and and
keeping information from your sensory
motor records or whatever and then later
on doing something with it that we may
differ in what we think is done with it
and I'll come back to that later so
let's go back to now a part of the point
of putting it up there is that I don't
think the human who's not shown in this
picture start of Meung nothing I think
there's an awful lot that is a
requirement for the learning that
happens later and at a much earlier
stage of course they're sucking and most
people think the reason why there's all
that competent sucking is because the
baby needs food but I don't believe that
it if that were true it would follow
that you're not depriving a baby if you
just give it a bottle or even stick a
tube down its throat and it the food guy
in I think that sucking is part of the
process of exploring the world but we
can't see what's going on it's learning
and if you watch a newborn baby or a
very young baby trying to actually get a
grip on a nipple it can have a lot of
trouble and there's a lot of negotiation
and it's probably learning all sorts of
things it doesn't know it's learning it
but something is going on there so
that's an even earlier stage now that
depends on a huge amount of
pre-programming by biological evolution
and you might say okay we're not into
that reading AG AI artificial general
intelligence which is artificial as
opposed to natural Jing intelligence I'm
not sure humans have general
intelligence but that's another issue I
want to say something about the problems
of the natural case and maybe it'll make
the artificial case look a bit different
or maybe not we'll see so biological
evolution had many kinds of organisms
and they had many different environments
and had many different problems to solve
and there were many transitions
were driven in evolution by things that
change in the environment and also in
the organisms themselves so maybe
initially there was just a chemical soup
there may initially or some later stage
have been detectable gradient if there
no gradients and there's no point having
sensors that can detect gradients or
motives for movingly just take potluck
and some survived some not if they're
gradients then you can go in the
direction of whatever gets you more of
whatever you need but then you have a
whole bunch of controlling from a
control problems you have to get the
information you have to have a store of
energy you have to have effectors for
putting it energy to work and so on if
in addition there's some stable
structures like rocks or plants that
don't move around they're not just
dissolved and you need different ones at
different times then there are new
problems about finding out where those
things are you might be able to survive
and maybe some organism do by just being
blown around and not making any use of
the fact that there are these stable
structures but ones that are able to
record information about the spatial
layout of things and to be able to use
that information in order to propel
themselves around according to their
needs and according to what the event
will be able to do things that the
others can't it doesn't mean yells get
wiped out because you always need the
older less intelligent things to be
around at the bottom of a food pyramid
it seems and and the microbes are
winners on every measure of biomass
number of different types number of
individuals if you want to talk about
evolutionary success look at microbes
anyway so despite all their success
other things managed to find little
niches into which they could evolve and
they started developing or both physical
structures and then information
processing mechanisms to deal with the
problems of controlling their own
physical structures and also dealing
with the physical structures in the
environment and I've given you a certain
sort of way of thinking which may be
already familiar to many of you which I
think can lead to a collaborative
project of identifying as many as
possible
the changes in information processing
that might have happened because where
they did happen a lot a separate issue
and it might happen in the evolution of
the planet and that would echo work done
by john maynard smith and marine
biologists haven't got a slide on it now
I haven't anyway they have a book called
the the major transitions and evolution
and to my surprise surprise because of
what I know about John Maynard Smith
information processing changes have very
little role in their list of changes and
when they mention it it seems to be only
changes in modes of communication and
things like get developing generative
grammars and so on and there's a lot
more information processing that goes on
before there's communication as I've
tried to indicate in making use of
available information to get available
resources to meet your needs given your
own resources for making use of
information by moving around and so on I
left out some things that perhaps are
worth pointing to there are some things
that have to be manipulated to be eaten
as opposed to just being absorbed
through the skin so something you have
to take apart or whatever there are some
things that so maybe that leads to the
evolution of manipulators but
manipulators then raise new problems
which are controlling the manipulators
and their different kinds of
manipulators claws tongues jaws feet and
so on legs trunks elephants optical and
octopus tentacles and they will have
different and interestingly different
problems of control and maybe it's some
level there are similarities also which
are not necessarily obvious I'm told
that one of the things that an octopus
does is turn it's apparently
continuously flexible thing into a
jointed thing so it solves a problem by
Brittany's got an elbow in the shoulder
and the wrist of clumsy and and one
theory is that that's how arms with bone
structures and so on actually evolved
that I don't know some of you may know
more about it than I do okay then those
things I try to eat you and things that
try to escape and at that stage it's
useful to start
taking account of or being able to take
account of the fact that in the
environment there are things that
process information as opposed to just
food and obstacles and dangers and so on
and if the things that process
information then in order to represent
their ability to process information you
might succeed just by keeping track of
how they move under what conditions or
if they're getting clever and you want
to get cleverer you may have to have
some theory about what's going on inside
them about what they can and can't see
or what they might or might not already
have learnt and so on or might what they
might want that they're not showing here
yet in their behavior and that requires
the ability to represent things that
represent meta semantic competences and
I won't go into but they're kind of
problems about how that works and even
now they're debates about things like
referential opacity who sort of
represent referential opacity not many
but if you have okay well if it comes up
in question time it has to do with the
fact that if you have information about
something then the contents and the
things represent you are in a fairly
tight relationship if you have
information about a representation of
something then that relationship is very
different and their debates about how to
deal with that and John McCarthy has if
this is you need a new logic or
something an extension to logic I think
you need a new architecture but that's a
detail okay so these are some of the
kinds of things that are related to
fairly large scale transitions and if we
look more closely I think you'll find
lots of more detailed transitions which
are interesting and worth finding out
about some of these involve
collaboration and so on so how do the
information processing requirements
change across these and other cases that
I haven't distinguished how many of the
map into problems of data mining in
sensorimotor statistics which is one
approach to try to do AI and it may have
been what Turing had in mind when you
say it all you need is a blank slate and
very powerful algorithm for finding
fault for learning I don't know what he
know what he meant but I'm surprised he
thought that actually
right so how can we study the living
things to find out what these processes
what these transitions and information
processing were and that's very hard
there's some people say whether you then
have to go and observe their measure and
their measure them the movements their
behavior their changing relationships to
environments and two other organisms and
so on or cutting them open to find out
what they're made of and where the bits
are or putting them into his brain
scammer scanners to find out what's
going on when they see et cetera I think
myself that none of these sort of
traditional scientific methods will
suffice mainly because in order to get
good answers to these questions you have
to develop new thinking tools you have
to develop concepts you have to develop
new forms of representation as has
happened in the history of AI long
before that in science for instance when
a race fatigue was represented using the
Arabic notation this is a the Roman
rotation that made a huge difference
when zero was added to Alice me to Alice
medical concepts I made a huge
difference when Newton invented calculus
burning on top of work of other people
and Newton and Leibniz such as I don't
offend anybody invented calculus there
made a huge difference a lot of
Newtonian mechanics and stuff that came
after would not have been possible and
in the last 50 60 years we've been
learning all kinds of things about
information processing and most of that
work has come not from trying to study
natural information processing systems
although that has contributed even from
the early days John for Norman and
others were trying to think about how
you build things at work like brains but
a lot of it came from people just trying
to work like engineers and say how can I
make things do sensor and the head ideas
and they tried them out and they found
and then they studied how they found
that gave clues as to what to add and
that I think is a very powerful way of
driving I the development of new ideas
for expressing new theories which make
you then go and look at the old problems
in a new way and that's one of the
reasons why with some colleagues in
biology and
and AI and so on we're trying to promote
a new sub field which instead of being
biologically inspired AI is AI inspired
biology you go and ask questions about
organisms that you would ask if you were
a robot designer trying to make
something that could do that and those
questions are not mystically the same
questions as you asked if your biologist
or neuroscientist or whatever asking how
to do it anyway so I'm suggesting we
need a rather list direct approach than
the standard scientific method and
that's because studying information
processing systems is somewhat different
from studying chemistry and physics and
geology and so on and I'm not going to
elaborate that now but I may come back
to some aspects of the difference later
well I've said all this already you
start learning to ask questions like
what ontology does that system need what
forms of representation what kind of
information processing architecture
questions like that were not needed by
Newton or Einstein or Darwin needed them
but he didn't know he needed them and as
a result he wasn't able to answer some
of the questions he was thinking about
and neither were his supporters I think
now we can go and start trying to defend
Darwin against some of the critics who
said his evidence only showed that
perhaps physical forms and physical
behaviors evolved but you couldn't have
got consciousness the mental states and
processes coming out of natural
selection you can't show transitions in
the fossil records of the sort that that
would be required and it was not a
bumbling but even one of his great
supporters change Huxley used the phrase
that is now bandage about many people
think it was invented recently I went
name village inventor the phrase the
explanatory gap some of you may have
heard about that was a hot topic in the
mid 19th century and there's a lot of
stuff that a lot of the bench that went
on in which were sort of reinvented or
rediscovered his new terminology in the
last 10 or 20 years but it's it's the
same old stuff and Darwin and most of
the current philosophers think about
these things do not have the concept
tools for coming up with deep series and
I think we're in a much better position
after having developed the conceptual
tools needed to design working systems
of the sort that Darwin claimed evolved
but he didn't have the right concept to
describe what evolved or what sorts of
mechanisms might have had to change to
make that evolution possible okay so
that's part of the reason for all this
mixing of disciplines that been
mentioned earlier that I engage in and
confuse myself and everybody else in the
process sometimes I think I now want to
go back to this thing about the tabula
rasa the there are the problems of
learning about the environment this is
part of a website where I I posed some
questions for some people who tell me
they could develop general purpose
learning systems by doing dimensionality
reduction was it okay try this and the
idea was if you've got a pixel array and
you have things like what I've shown you
there and the things move around and the
task is to be able to predict what's
going to happen next can you do it and
they're interesting questions about what
you can and can't do and in some cases
if you just have something like that and
it moves horizontally or maybe if it
rotates if it moves in a way that can be
expressed as a simple change in a few
variables then probably one of the many
approaches that people in this room know
about would work very well at the bottom
it says show the rotator so i'll show
the rotator that's rotator now if your
pixel array has got stuff like that in
and you want to be able to predict
what's going to be happening next on the
base of what's been happening recently
if you try to do it using just an
ontology that is based on the contents
and the changing contents of the image
then it's going to be difficult I think
now there may be people is Ramos
I've got another they'll do that no
trouble and then I'll learn something
but my guess is that what you really
need is to know that there's more than
two dimensions and to see that thing as
a cube that is opaque has a number of
surfaces that can be visible but not all
at the same time and it's rotating and
maybe a learner can can benefit from
being able to control it and that might
help I'm just using your mouse here this
is nice gadget on the web in Java you
could also have a neko cube which when
we look at it is rarely just seen as a
two dimensional pattern we will see it
as a three dimensional pattern but
typically we can see the same data has
two different cubes where the
differences involved geometric distances
are differences like different faces are
close or far and lines of sloping up or
smoking down and so on and and again
trying to explain what's going on there
one needs to have an ontology that goes
beyond the data any just stop well
so what I would like to propose as a
collection of experiments is that we
produce a collection of videos generated
in a variety of ways from structures of
various kinds and then see what the
problems are in having a totally
knowledge free but powerful learner
coming up with good explanations which
enable predictions to be done and
interpolations if you list but a bit of
it say over the in-between you listen is
it must have been there and so on to
review know your Henson's pictures he
took photographs granot yawns and
photographs of people with lights
attached to their joints videos in the
dark not photographed sorry and they
were doing various things like dancing
climbing up and down ladders doing
press-ups and humans looking at those
instantly see not just 3d structures but
you can actually see the effort get into
the push-ups and so on so there the
ontology goes even beyond 3d structures
this use you use your knowledge of human
beings and you use sort of biological
concepts like effort and so interpreting
them and so a question is where could
that come from if one it was to be
learned just from the data and maybe
interacting with the data and I'm saying
that probably a lot of it comes from an
evolutionary history in our case but
maybe there are other ways of doing it
in artificial system long-duration while
I'm here let me look say you're another
toddler slightly older toddler than one
this is a succession of snapshots from a
video the videos too short and goes too
fast so I actually I should float away
to enlarge it but if I do that no take
you long there's a I think about 18
months I can't remember a child holding
a broom and you can't see it but the
back end of the broom is stuck between a
couple of vertical railings he's on a
landing
he tries to move it and you don't see
that and move the thing sideways and he
can't say he looks back and quickly
realized what he has to do pull
something forward and then a whole bunch
of other things happen look around moves
the thing forward so he knows the
theorem about how to move something that
can't be moved laterally but is in a
situation where it can be moved at 90
degrees to that lateral motion which
will then enable it to move laterally if
you if you move it out he doesn't know
he knows it he can't state it but he
clearly instantly did what he had to do
then he carries on doing a few other
little things transfers it to the other
hands and pushes forward and then he
stuck can't push it further because the
broom hits the skirting board so he
pulls it back and aims it in a different
direction goes down the corridor and
there he is not only pushing the broom
he is maintaining his balance and
controlling also dynamical systems to
keep him moving and the interesting
thing happens near the end there's a
door on the right the corridor because
I'm sorry this I should practice stick
with the video of these problems we find
some technology for slowing down the
video he nurses the door approaching so
before he gets to the door he swivels
the broom handle round to the left so
that when he gets to the door the broom
is in the right plane to be pushed
straight through the doorway and he goes
through and then the video ended shortly
after um I haven't had this problem the
same routine done in the past I'm I
should get another I should use a
different viewer anyway so what I'm
suggesting is that by that age he had
clearly learned quite a lot of stuff
about how to move an object in this case
it's a long thin object that he could
hold a one in and push it on the floor
so as to produce behaviors and he wasn't
always simply doing online control of
motion
in order to modify the current sensor
values he was anticipating he noticed a
possibility and acted on it and there's
a huge amount of work on robotics which
produces very impressive robots that can
juggle that can balance a broom I think
there's a reference one last night that
can catch balls that can move through
doorways before they shut and so on but
I don't think any of them know what
they've done after they've done it no
what they didn't do know why they'd done
it nor I suspect do they like this child
know what they're going to do a few
steps ahead and why they're going to do
it which I suspect he did where's the
toddler who's transferring a spoon from
one end to the other probably didn't
know he was going to do that until
almost immediately the opportunity arose
but once he started I think in some
sense the girl was already there driving
the selection of motions of the hand to
enable the thing to be transferred that
was about 11 months so part of my story
is there's a huge amount of fascinating
data in babies and toddlers and I've
just chosen a few things which were
buried in lots of videos I was shown and
I'm trying to get colleagues and friends
and other people to do this with their
babies and trouble is it requires you to
set yourselves a discipline of of taking
30 seconds every week or so or more or
less or whatever deb roy of course has a
major project of that sort but i think
in some sense he may have more data than
anything can handle but i don't know
what the current set of that project is
thank go and jen urine in aberdeen has
been acting in this way and have I got
his he sent me some stuff last night and
here I can make this run
if his daughter and he set up some
apparatus for her and she has obviously
learned some time with her but she has
some problems she's seen something else
that's out of reach and she's trying and
getting into difficulties to try
something else get the keys but she
won't be there and somehow manages but
notice she uses the other hand to help
Khan can't bring it to her realizes that
the the tool can be yeah I can't
remember but i would say under two years
I've got an email message which has the
email me and I'll tell you there's a
huge amount of work in psychology on
trying to find out what babies can do
and when they can do it and whether if
you change the situation slightly they
can do it a month early or a week
earlier but without any attempt to find
out how they do it and what the problems
i'll have to be solved for them to do it
so i don't if that was part of the
background to that question from my
point of view at any stage that has
happens there's a question how is it
done what was going on and at the moment
i think we know very little but I'm says
time I'll say a little bit about the
theories of ended common off Smith's who
was one of the people who work with poj
and then developed her own line of
thinking which in some ways is very
different from PR Jays and I only
realized how close it was to what I was
talking about very recently okay how we
doing for time I think I'm getting quite
close to running out of time let me give
you a little exercise you may have
noticed that if you have a plastic
shampoo container then if you turn it
over and squeeze when it's new it's very
easy you just squeeze if you've had it
for some time it's better to wait a
little while before you squeeze has
anyone register question is why
now part of the point about that
exercise is that the explanation is not
anything you see you have to know
something about substances and in
particular about shampoo namely that
it's viscous it flows down and if you
squeeze too soon it won't have reached
the nozzle and all you'll be getting
when you squeeze is air until the stuff
has got to in and and I believe that the
ability to learn about and reason about
stuff different kinds of stuff clothing
skin furred teeth rubber plastic
nowadays wire and so on and why it can I
have a lot in common listening and also
be very different in the details is a
crucial and and and a substantial subset
of what toddlers learn and that's part
of our think he's going on with chewing
and sucking and eating as well not just
getting food I don't know of people
working on robots that are learning
about kinds of stuff although we have a
PhD student in Birmingham who's trying
getting rubble to understand what
happens with sponge when you press it
and so on maybe other people doing it to
an email me if you know some interesting
work in there I'll give you another
puzzle you may have noticed I have an
ink spot here and when I found that last
night I was very annoyed because I was
sure I had trained myself always to
retract the ball before I put the pen in
my pocket and when I found this I
thought this is just doesn't make any
sense I've trained myself and then I had
another idea and I'm going to leave it
to you to think about what the other
idea might have been and maybe come back
to there is it obvious thing or what the
other an idea might be oh you have to
know I flew here yesterday maybe I need
to do obvious okay so what some of these
last few points are trying to draw
attention to is the difference between
somatic ontologies and EXO somatic
ontologies a somatic ontology
is something that is either that refers
to the contents of central data and
motor signals or any mathematical racial
relations that you can compute from
those so the are so miles the body and
the somatic ontology refers to things
going on inside the body and EXO somatic
ontology refers to things going on
outside the body and maybe even out of
sites like the shampoo in the in the
squeezy bottle all the insides of stuff
that behaves differently from other
stuff that makes the stuff behave
differently all the hidden sides of a
rotating cube so there's an or even the
visible sides of a rotating cube when
you see that as the thing that's in
space outside you and rotating you're
using an excess of medical apology so
there are some people who try to start
with nothing but a somatic ontology and
powerful algorithms and do everything
and one of the interesting questions is
can you get from that in a sensible way
in a reasonable time to an excess of
medical oncology now there is a way
where you can obviously do it if you've
got a formalism for expressing all
possible theories and the formulism
gives you recursively enumerable
theories you justify the theories one by
one and all the data you've got Thanks
and until you won't find one that works
well the trouble is maybe not even a
planet is going to be and four thousand
million years will be good enough for
some of the problems but I don't know I
maybe I haven't just understood the the
the combinatorial but I don't think
that's what young humans have and I
suspect that well-designed robots will
not have that either they will have some
precursors of an excessive medical
oncology or some explicit excessive
matting ontology like the notion that
there are things that exist
independently or whether they're being
perceived or not and those things may be
of many kinds not just things like balls
and cups and so
think we often refer to as object which
are being studied quite a lot in in
development psychology but things like
surface fragments which can have
orientation curvature reflectance and
other kinds of properties or processes
of various sorts like becoming more or
less curved or stretching or moving in
various directions or rotating these are
things that can happen two things
outside you and you may see them
happening and if you have the right sort
of ontology then you can describe them
and importantly if it's a degenerative
form of representation you can combine
them in ways that you've never
encountered to make predictions to
imagine things to set up goals and I
think that that is part of the apparatus
that drives the explorations of very
young children in ways that initially is
highly I think determined by the genome
reacting to what in the environment so
if you see something happen then you can
get a motive to try to make it happen
again or to make it happen in reverse or
to make it happen with variations and if
you watch children lot you see a lot of
that going on they do things and they
try and sometimes they'll do something
totally unrelated what they're doing
before because they've just noticed the
possibility not because any reward or
anything I think they're they're built
to do that because they'll learn things
and then a lot of behavioral competent
competences develop which are shown in
various skills like walking and climbing
and feeding yourself and so on pushing
brooms round corners but something else
happens as well and this is what anat
common off Smith talks about in her book
Beyond modularity published in 1992 the
details will be on this I've actually
started to writer produce a little
website about her book and whereas PHA
had said that children go through stages
and in the first stage since you motor
sejal whatever come to me all the orders
pre-operational operational and and
other kinds of stages
with fuzzy transitions between them but
what you can do varies from one stage to
another and they're roughly age
correlated but there are individual
differences and so on what she says is
those stages are roughly applicable not
to ages of development but two stages in
learning about a new domain so if I had
time I could introduce you to a new
domain for instance the main of shapes
you can make with rubber band and a
collection of pins on a pin board and
you can play and do things and make the
letter T and capital H and so on and
then I'll ask you to make a capital
outline a and you may discover that it's
impossible and then I might ask you
questions about what's the minimum
number of pins you need to make say a
figure that's alternating convex and
concave vertices so you can play and you
make discoveries but something happens
after a while the what you've learnt
empirically gets reorganized you can do
lots of things you have behavioral
competence but common law Smith's talks
about representational read description
and and I think what she's saying is
that the information yet put into a new
form which is more like she doesn't say
this more like an axiomatic theory but I
don't think that necessarily means it's
using any branch and formal logic that
we know about maybe something else we
know one case of that that's very
familiar language learning children
learn to speak and understand things
pretty well at first and then something
happens where they start saying things
like Johnny hitted me and he runned home
and he sit it on the chair whereas
previously they'd say Johnny hit me and
he ran home and he sat in the chair that
transition suggests that what's going on
is that previously the children learned
a lot of things at work they had the
behavioral competence but then they
reorganize that it's a case of what she
calls representational ree description
and if you think about it you'll realize
that enabling a generative system based
on our syntax
to deal with exceptions is a non-trivial
software engineering task to add the
ability to handle section exceptions in
the inputs and the outputs but kids
solve that problem somehow they don't
know they're doing any of this bar there
is no claim that their self knowledge
that's a later stage and what I'm
suggesting and it turned out I
discovered common of Smith's for quite
different reasons based on her in
critical observation was also suggesting
this but we were using different
language I was talking about kids
discovering toddler theorems and
learning things empirically and then
reorganizing that knowledge how they
could then deal with novel cases she was
talking about another way which she
calls representation rii description and
so I think that work needs to be brought
together but we're both saying it's not
just language and I'm suggesting that
there's a lot to do with things like
learning topological relationships
learning geometrical structures and
pleasant learning a lot about processes
and the conditions under which they
occur and the constraints on those
processes so you can learn a lot of it
empirically and learn to do things and
learn to expect predict what's going to
happen but then you can transform that
knowledge into a deeper form as she
points out this also happens at
different stages of development and it
can also happen in a culture so for
example there was probably a lot of
knowledge of geometry before some
ancient whoever was Egyptians or
whatever organized that knowledge into
what we now think of as Euclidean
geometry and then still later that
organization was itself reorganized
saying that it could be expressed in
terms of a formal system predicate
calculus of one sort or another by
hilburn other people and I'm still
playing with ways of trying to do
thereby eliminating the parallel axiom
but still talking about rigid motion and
it may be impossible but I want to see
if I can because I suspect that would
fit some what goes on with youngsters
learning about space and time because I
don't think there has a parallel axiom
it doesn't come into the experience and
and they they don't need to know
anything about it but they do need to
know a lot about rigid motions so and
things preserving links as I move okay
so what I'm saying here is summarizing
what I've just said at greater length we
need some mechanism which is good at
generating
XO somatic ontologies and I suspect it
needs to have a glove of prejudices
built in but those prejudices would not
be this is the ontology you need but
this is a way to find out what ontology
you need given some very abstract
assumptions which I presume include
you're in a three-dimensional world
you're in a world in which there are
structures some of which changed some
which you deserve your world in which
the structures are made of all kinds of
stuff which have different kinds of
properties not that the rigid solid
elastic or whatever but different kinds
of stuff you find out what they are by
playing and maybe you can find out what
the differences are by finding ways in
which they respond to what you do to
them and develop the theory and I
suspect a lot of that going around i
suspect nobody knows what's going on of
that sort but is happening anyway and i
suspect it has the stages that common
loss mrs. been talking about which
involves having empirical learning
followed by reorganization which enables
things to be worked out in sort of being
learnt empirically there's a very good
book by diana pick and Eleanor Gibson
the wife of james gibson on child
development of quantum of the title but
they talk about the kinds of ways
children can learn something they talk
about learning by experiment learning by
observation learning by imitation
learning by being told taught and they
miss out the crucial thing that i think
is what makes us human maybe learning by
working things out for the first time
and that goes back to the bug in what I
think Turing was proposing because he
talks about teachers having to be there
to train this robot that starts with an
empty notebook where the first teachers
come from if you need a teacher to learn
mathematics then the process couldn't
get started so what I'm suggesting is
that there's something about the
biological process of giving animals
better and better abilities to deal with
the problems they faced in in coping
with complexities both in their own
structure and motion and in the
environment and their competitors and so
on which somehow enabled evolution to
produce systems that could do that
representational rii description or
axiomatization or theory construction or
whatever so the things that initially
were
learn to become theorems in a generative
system which can go beyond the sort of
thing that fits naturally within many
statistical models and your moles which
can only cope with an envelope defined
by the data but have what Chomsky called
infinite then the other kind have
intranet generative capabilities our
different sort you can have longer and
longer sentences with more and more
enlisted sub-clauses and all sorts of
Daath people inserting things which you
can't predict and you've never heard
before and you're never here again but
you understand them and I could go on
for another five minutes with this
stupid sentence just to illustrate that
point but the same thing applies with
Heath Robinson structural apparatus and
machinery and so on okay so that's the
observation that's what needs to be
explained and I really look forward to
learning how it can be done the task too
difficult for me but I think a team of
very bright people working with the
collision of disciplines might be able
to make some progress thank you have
anyone worked out the solution to my ink
spot that occurred to me after I cursed
myself yes yeah okay so have you ever
been faced with that problem before so
you're doing what I was talking about
you have some general terminology we
were able to apply to a novel situation
within a few minutes you didn't have to
sit okay thank you we have about five
minutes for questions um well do things
a little differently did if people want
to line up there and there I will give
the microphone so everyone can hear them
and things will be recorded there are
lots of interesting problems are not
test my tab thank you I would like to
give an argument to support the chewing
point if you take genome it's about it
billion bits in it and this is all
information that is transferred to in
net
and according to current knowledge about
90 or more than ninety percent of the
genome is is just to redundancy so you
have like 10 to seven two or ten to
eight bitsy transfer to in night and all
these were many information about organs
or or immunological system so you are
only the crucial information for for the
mind is about only a million bits 10 to
six bits so we are just a million bits a
way to making mind because there is no
other information transfer and so I
think that like Intel processor is about
one hundred thousand bits complicated in
terms of complexity so we are only just
this away from from making it and and
even if you take point of view of
penrose but it is quantum machinery
anyway the information transfer is only
limited to that so and if you think that
during machine is not enough I would say
that according to charge you doing tests
you can simulate any any machinery on
answering machine so it doesn't matter
whether it is a computer so yeah yes but
the point is also that you have examples
of people who are disabled since bars
and here are blind since birth and they
say we find them intelligence also so
all these arguments think what were you
think about this argument against to
support you in pulp point will you rate
a lot of points I don't believe that
everything on our planet can be
simulated on a Turing machine including
to Turing machines controlled by a
Geiger counter which determines which
one runs and reduces one or zero but
never mind that yes the bear people are
born disabled without limbs learn a huge
amount the one thing they can't do is
learn it by doing the same kind of
sensorimotor exploration that other
organisms do so that raises deep
questions about how someone like Allison
leper who's a famous limbless artist if
you look up their name in the on Google
use you learn about her as an adult
she's clearly got a deep understanding
of the problems her child has
she's got a normal child she had a
genetic defect so yes there are all
kinds of things that are learned and we
don't know how I would be quite happy to
wait and see you and others develop the
viewpoint that you're presenting I don't
have done knockdown argument saying it's
impossible I'll just add one little
thing that the genome is not there
anything that controls the develop of an
organism of course some others provides
an environment which in itself is a
product of the genome but not just a
teen genome the genome and the chemistry
of the of the world so we don't know
what's going on there but you could say
that just the boats during this point we
would have to talk more about that in
detail I don't think anything obvious
follows from those points yes my own
work and perhaps other projects other
cognitive architectures here have the
approach that it goes back to the
paragraph that you showed from turns
paper precisely where I'd like to create
a student system that's capable of being
taught and I'm like to drill down into
your criticism of that approach the
criticism one criticism I picked up was
that you you believe that the students
should be able to work things out by
themselves and I ask is is that itself a
skill that could be taught by a mentor I
think it comes in a way that I been
discussing with a biologist Jackie chapo
we wrote we presented paper each guy in
2005 and in a couple of years later a
paper in a strange journal called the
Journal of unconventional computing
we're invited to expand reach our paper
and we have this notion that the genome
can have produced behaviors in an
environment via different routes and the
simplest systems there's just genome
producers physical structures which
produces behaviors like reflexes and so
on and then in slightly more complicated
things you have a genome produces
physical structure which encodes
competences which are generic they may
have
additional form so what you do will
depend on some of your internal state
and gozman thing and at the latest stage
partly as a result of what goes on over
time feeding back into the system you
have things which are method competences
which are partly determined by the
genome and partly by what's being
learned in the earlier stages and those
meta competences can operate on previous
competences and generate new competences
and so on and they in turn may sometimes
generate new meta competency so I I feel
and certainly my experiences that I've
gone on learning to learn throughout my
life and it's clearly true that when
kids come to university there are things
they cannot learn that they princes
they're doing a degree in physics by the
time they're in the final year they can
learn things that it couldn't learn
earlier so yes they've been taught but
they're not being taught by somebody
saying this is how you do it whatever
they're there's an interaction with a
very complicated process which I don't
think we understand but that's a very
crude and unsatisfactory schematic way
of suggesting what it might be like but
the idea is that at every stage the
inferences genome is there but how much
of it is from the environment to vary
depending on which part of the system it
is and in some cases it may just come
from internal explorations which were
just lucky you just happen to get an
idea in I just want a comment a little
bit about the chicken in the egg
question right with you this principle
principle side the touring question now
yesterday I made a slight point that
language for example could not have is
implausible that it would have developed
like this out of one mutation because
the teacher is ness you know children
that grow up in the forest etc etcetera
so you need that but between the one
aspect of the you know the conversation
of anything and the agent that needs to
be taught wouldn't evolution more
plausibly have in a process of
coevolution in which parent and child
evolve together to solve difficult
problems that the environment poses
without which there wouldn't be even a
need for all this intelligence well not
just parent and child but social suicide
I would just like to take a minute to
offer a different view of language
learning you know about the deaf
children Nicaragua how many people know
about the deaf children in Nicaragua not
very many but some do okay you probably
know what I'm going to say crude a very
interesting story i'm going to give you
a crude very short version of it if
children are born therefore become
differ on it's very important for them
to learn a sign language as opposed to
being taught to lip read there's a lot
of evidence says you try to make them
just lip read which in some cultures was
sort the right way to do they're
seriously cognitively deprived whereas
if you touch let them learn the sign
language then they get great benefit
from that so in nicaragua sometime like
30 years ago or so I forget exactly when
it was decided because there's a great
shortage of teachers of sign language
they would set up a place somewhere in a
coastal town and bring the teachers and
the deaf children from all over the
country to this place and then something
happened after the children had been
taught by the teachers who themselves
had not had the benefit of that early
training but they had learned sign
language and they could teach it the
kids suddenly started doing things that
teachers couldn't understand they were
signing away and apparently having fun
and laughing and and whatever so they
had to bring in linguists and
anthropologists from other places who
worked out that what the children had
done was create a language of their own
which started it was sort of bootstrap
by what they were being taught but they
did something else and I think partly
inspired by that but also other
observations about language learning in
children that the notion that language
learning is a sort of data mining
is totally wrong that you should think
of language learning as being a process
whereby an intelligent young toddler who
has lots of things to communicate but
can't communicate tries to find ways to
do it and does so in collaboration with
the other people that is going to
communicate with and if if they are deaf
they'll do it through signing if maybe
even if they're not if they'll do it
partly to signing and they will because
of that problem solving mechanism having
certain capabilities which are genetic
they will come up with something rich
and powerful has happened there and so I
think that what's going on is that
children who appear to be trying to find
out the way adults talk are actually
trying to find out how to talk and they
are in the minority and they're trying
to create a solution to a problem that
other people really solve so they're
forced to accept most of the majority
solution but they often have their own
little quirks and among twins you find
that happening not to I don't want to I
know but the study and I would never
want to belittle the creativity and the
spirit of young deaf children in agoura
but that that is the conclusions of that
studied have been much discussed and
that the actual way to find out whether
that means spontaneous creation of
language ah it's an unethical experiment
because they do get sign language even
when they don't get sign language
teachers because that's how they
communicate well with their with a
caretaker I agree it's difficult to do
nothing kill anything is to get a good
theory which fits lots of other
phenomena as well as those and parcel
theory will be what's going on to
explain what's going on before children
learn to talk when they're doing a lot
of problem solving and communicating
they're going to turn the mother's face
to look into the direction so they have
rich and complex motive swords and then
later they learn to communicate so they
must have had the internal language all
along I'm just making my power supply
absolutely
right so we have to move right along and
the next keynote is going to be a bit of
a taste of the neuro session that's
coming up later today it's my pleasure
to introduce ed Boyden he's professor of
biological engineering and brain and
cognitive sciences at the MIT Media Lab
the MIT McGovern Institute and he's he
runs probably one of the largest maybe
the largest MIT Media Lab that's there
about five times the regular size I
think one of his former students is
actually here I'm not sure if he's here
yet but David around well anyway so ed
in co invented the technique called
optogenetics which I'm not going to talk
about otherwise I probably be giving you
a spoiler but it's it's definitely one
of a range of very fascinating new tools
for controlling and observing dynamic
networks in the brain I'm not going to
read too many of his accolades but
anyway so he's been it has been named
the one of the top 35 innovators under
the age of 35 by technology review in
2006 one of the top 20 brains under age
40 by discover magazine he received a
Paul Allen distinguished investigator
award and of course he spoke about his
optogenetics invention on a TED talk and
there's so much more I just can't can't
list it all anyway please welcome ed
Boyden all right well thanks so much um
I guess what we're going to try and
explore today is a a little taste of how
are trying to devise technologies to
help us understand more about how the
brain computes and one of our working
hypotheses is that we need to develop
the toolset that allows us to get to the
heart of some of these questions if you
want to be able to confront you know the
deep questions of you know how brain
circuits actually perform computations
where we can leave the word computation
sort of undefined for a second and part
of the issue I think with the brain is
that it's incredibly complicated the
it's made out of you know thousands if
not you know more kinds of different
kinds of circuit element that are
heterogeneous and even knowing what
level of abstraction you one has to
think of the brain at is is difficult is
the cell the right level are their
subcellular compartments the right level
and their people of course who focus
upon individual molecules and and then
they're those who focus upon imaging the
brain using non-invasive strategies
that's interesting it always happens
when you start talking about solving the
brain that your computer starts to flake
out that for the irony effect so it's
some let's try this on I see the problem
there's a mismatch in the resolution so
it's recomputing it twice or something
okay so the basic issue is that the
circuits of the brain are extremely
heterogeneous and and right now one of
the ideas that's come to dominate is how
do we start to understand that hair at
unity how do you understand the building
blocks of the brain because we don't
understand the building blocks and what
they do then it's very difficult to go
beyond that and start to see how they
work together a circuit so for example
you know there are small inhibitory
cells there are different kinds of cell
that do different things in the brain
and in order to tell they work together
ideally we'd be able to record from and
perturb these different cellular
elements of course this is a working
hypothesis it's quite possible that the
circuit elements are not cells and that
this is a an approximation for the time
being of what we are doing in order to
try and understand things and ND upfront
it's not even clear how many circuit
elements there are and so I you know if
we were doing this in the incremental
way we'd like to know the exact lists we
like to know exactly how they work
together we'd like to know what are the
properties of these elements that are
most important because obviously some of
there are attributes might be irrelevant
in terms of actually understanding their
function and some of them might be very
important but we don't know yet how to
encapsulate those properties in a
meaningful way then of course you can
get to the point of trying to understand
how they work together and data of
course has been kind of a theme of the
conference is not always enough you also
have two ways have a way to understand
that data and so really what you need I
think our tools
to help you classify and characterize
these building blocks at different
levels of abstraction you also have to
be able to observe and watch them
because without a basic data set of that
kind it's very difficult to know what
they're really doing in terms of their
temporal interaction and how they work
together and then finally it ideally you
could causally test these things by
controlling them in order to delete
things and drive intimate information in
a certain cells or other elements in
order to understand how they work so
i'll tell you the story kind of reverse
order where a lot of talk about three
and then there'll be a little bit about
two and they'll be very little about one
that's a that's probably because i think
of the fact that there been a lot of
hypotheses in neuroscience where
causality had been one of the lacking
elements and being able to delete or
drive you know information into
different elements is helping us
actually clarify which level of
abstraction we need to worry about is it
the cell is it a subcellar compartment
and so on and so forth so there's a bit
of a loop here where I think the logic
is you're circling about it's not a
linear we begin with this thing and
we're going to keep going until we get
to the end and then we're done so we'll
start with control and I think control
um I think is a useful thing to think
about because there's two really good
reasons why you can you can use it to
solve problems one is that you can
actually assess the causal role of an
element in a computation or behavior or
pathology and given so many different
cell types in the brain which have been
observed in various incarnations over
the last century or more being able to
figure out what it's actually doing by
deleting it just for a second or by
driving it can be of help but the second
reason is also one that's a great
interest and that's because we want
understand the brain not only for the
philosophical and computational reasons
but also you know brain disorders or a
big issue you know they are largely
incurable you know many of them are
untreatable even and for disorders like
Alzheimer's and stroke and various forms
of deafness and blindness there are
there's very little that can be done so
we really set out to try and start with
control both to try and figure out how
to start teasing apart which of these
circuit elements do watchin but also to
try and figure out if we can do some of
this fixing up of things so given that
the animations aren't really showing I
wonder if this will be going to work out
quite well and maybe it won't so I'll
skip to the traditional slides just in
case um but that well the other one okay
we're gonna try so this is kind of where
we tried to find ways of controlling
neural circuits this is a species of
green algae and algae like many
organisms have to sense light in order
to metabolize and photosynthesize
optimally and neurons are electrical
devices so it turns out that algae sense
light by converting light into
electrical signals in a little organelle
called an eyespot which acts a little
bit like our eye and by taking the
molecules that sit in the membrane of
this I spot which you can think of as a
little solar cell when light shines on
them they'll translocate charged
particles from one side of this membrane
to the other given that neurons are also
electrical devices if we put these
molecules into neurons then shining
light on those neurons should be able to
change their electrical potential and
therefore depending upon which way these
charged particles are going you should
be able to turn these cells on or off
and so we're fortunate because it turns
out that this molecule and many Malik
molecules like it is completely encoded
for by a small gene only about 900 DNA
bases and codes for this incredible you
know light sensor that cool translocate
charge and so we and many others now
have taken molecules that are viruses or
other methods are delivering this gene
into neurons and in order to make
specific neurons embedded within a
density neural circuit sensitive being
optically manipulated so for example
this upson here which comes to the green
algae when it expresses into the cell
membrane when light shines and those
molecules they will open up a little
poor translocate positive charge in the
cell and positive charge going to the
cell will activate it and so as you
might guess is now you know assuming an
abstraction layer that we can operate at
if we falsify the abstraction layer and
that's some degree already happening is
people start to look at how subcellular
compartments can drive activity that
manipulates other parts of us of a
subcellular compartment then we can try
to sort of bootstrap our way into
developing new tools that help us
navigate into these neural networks so i
should point out that a lot of luck was
involved in getting this to work there
was no reason this algal gene had to
even work at all in neurons over the
last couple years
this start with a collaboration with
several investigators geared nagaland
Ernst Bomberg and Germany and also
called I Sarathy Stanford and we publish
a paper a couple years ago we show that
you could pick this algal protein put
into specific neurons using a virus and
then you could then activate those cells
with with blue light since then we and
others have found a whole series of
other molecules including light driven
pumps that can pump negative charge into
cells that we can turn them off and
these tools are now on use by many
hundreds of groups around the world to
try and drive from information into or
delete it from specific cells now one of
the big issues is getting specificity in
the cells you know there many kinds of
cell in these network and one of the
things that that we've had to do and now
there are probably as many ways of doing
this as there are methods are getting
genes into cells at all is to get these
genes and acidic cells within a network
so for example you can imagine that you
can take a virus that only will bind to
or be taken up by some cells and not
others and if you can get those viruses
into a piece of tissue then just some
cells in network will become
photosensitized and the others won't and
there many other ways of doing it as
well you can use promoters DNA
regulatory elements they can place
upstream of the ups and gene if i
activated protein gene and now those
cells have become photoactivated but
their neighbors will not be so there's
different things you can do with this
I'll show tell you a couple short
stories about what you can do with this
one of the things is to try and figure
out how the brain makes decisions and to
be up front this is this kind of thing
is happening at a very early stage now
but i thought i would tell you one in
short story which is a collaboration
with the christopher fearless crew and
one of the questions is one of the
neurons in the brain that can make an NL
do more of whatever it was just doing
and we've I think all heard of stories
and scientific results such as where
rats will press a lever in order to
solve stimulate you know this is driving
an electrical current into the base of
the brain in a certain area and that's
then causing the animal to feel either
some kind of pleasure or compulsion or
other effect that caused them to do more
of whatever they were just doing in this
case pressing a lever and so when the
question is can you pinpoint the exact
circuit elements that are actually
involved the electricity will that's
used in a classical sense will drive all
the neurons in a volume but as we just
pointed out that volume contains
thousands of different kinds of salt and
so
so we decided to try and test this out
using a viral method targeting dopamine
neurons which are one of the major
candidates thought to be implicated in
this process and the very simple
experiment was to take a box and use a
mouse which is very common in
neuroscience and there are two points in
the Box where things happen or don't
happen if mouse goes here he gets a
pulse of blue light and the mouse goes
here then nothing happens and so if
indeed we are driving neurons that
reinforce whatever was just happening we
can then we should see the animal go to
the blue light driving spot over and
over again in order to earn these
rewards and so we use a strategy to
target these cells using a combination
of transgenic mice as well as viruses
that allow us to selectively label these
dopamine neurons and they're about a
hundred different such mice out there so
it's quite simple now to actually
deliver viruses into these parts of the
brain to make them photosensitive or to
make specific cells within that part of
the brain photosensitive and so this
allows us to them to try and assess what
these different cells do so these are
the dopamine neurons and deep in the
brain stem and as you can see everything
the mouse goes here he gets a pulse of
light there's an optical fiber beaming
light into the brain and the mouse will
go here over and over again working for
that little pulse of light and so that's
interesting because now we've actually
pinpointed a specific class of cell and
better within this very dense region of
the brain stem where you know so much is
you know trafficking back and forth in
terms information as being able to
reinforce whatever the animal is just
doing so a very interesting the next
question I'll talk about this towards
the end of the talk is to try and record
throughout these the circuits that are
receiving information from this cell
class what's actually happening in a
circuit to cause the decision to do
something again or two to choose to go
to one point rather than the other so
the fundamental you know Mouse
decision-making kind of task so one of
the big issues have it had to confront
is to figure how to get light into the
brain since the brain is obviously not
transparent and one of the strategies
has been quite popular is to put some
kind of implanted optical fiber into the
brain and then to have a projection
connector come out and then you can
actually buy off the internet you know
lasers that come with optical fibers
ready to go and you can then plug them
in together and then when you do that
the light to delivery can be achieved
quite simply now if you really want to
serve discover how circuits work though
then you be able to procure more than a
single point in the brain and so that's
something we've been working very hard
on in order to try and parse out how you
know the complex three-dimensional
circuits of the brain work together to
implement things and so one of the
things that we've been working on is to
try to develop massively parallel like
delivery devices that can deliver light
into complex patterns in the brain so
this is an array of optical fibers each
connected to its own miniature light
source the whole thing is about a cubic
centimeter or so and this one has 14
fibers which can tile the hippocampus in
the brain bilaterally which is one of
the circuits that's thought to be
involved with the formation of memories
and so it'd be very interesting if we
can delete information from the circuit
just momentarily to see what is it
actually storing at the beginning and or
or even after in a learning task in
order to see what those cells contribute
and then of course we can label sub
populations of cells within this sub
part of the brain so we could try to
label certain pathways or certain
interneuron types or even certain
neuromodulators that our soldiers being
characterized and so a big theme of this
is that we have to really be sort of
hyper disciplinary about this kind of
stuff the the molecules that we use to
activate neurons which come from algae
and other molecules have to be found
through genomic mining we cloud with
people all over the world actually to
collect samples of different organisms
algae and bacteria and archaea and even
funguses nowadays in order to try and
mine out these different light-sensitive
proteins so we can dial information in
with the right level precision and with
their going to address the right amount
to the brain as well and then you know
the next day we have to go back and
actually build these devices allow us to
get information into the brain so one of
the nice things of being at the Media
Lab is that you can they're not really
constrained by discipline and so if you
want to go and devise circus strategies
to have a rays of light emitters that
then can beam light into deep targets
you can you can do that so one of things
are very interested in doing is being
able to serve screen to the brain in
order to go to the brain bit by bit and
delete information and the reason that's
important is we probably all heard about
heard about classical experiments where
people would go through the brain and
try to leave
information in the brain by just
lesioning the brain itself and part of
the problem is that memories are
actually found to be distributed and so
one of the ideas that we're trying to
confront is by
oh my god entire set of circuits in the
brain and there's
will subdivide until we hone in on
exactly where that information is stored
at a given time or we might find that
there's a lot of redundancy if we delete
different parts of a circuit it could be
such that when we delete one part other
parts can take over in many cases you
know in the clinical literature the
injury to a brain can result in some
kind of plasticity that then can restore
some degree of function over time and so
we need to be able to deal with a case
where there might actually be very rapid
adaptation into our brain perturbation
we also been working on ways to try and
do this sort of high-throughput circuit
perturbations across brains as well and
so one of our former students who's just
actually spun on a company to
commercialize these things is making a
little couple gram wireless devices that
are wirelessly powered and also can
wirelessly control these light sources
such that you can put it on to in this
case a mouse but you can put on to other
critters control many mice from one
computer and then you can do sort of
high-throughput screening of brain
targets to try and really hone in on
what are the causal substrates for a
given action or behavior or decision and
so it's a very modular device which has
a little optics device here that goes to
being light into the brain this is a
very similar one I just showed you and
then there's various computational power
and communications modules there and so
this actually works pretty well so you
know here's just a quick demo we're
using a transgenic mouse which is
engineered to express the blue light
activator that it has told you about
pretty much throughout the the cortex
and from go ping pongs group also at MIT
and when you drive of these neurons with
white you can actually get all sorts of
different effects in this case what
we've done is we put this little
wireless device over the motor cortex of
the mouse and when nothing is happening
with the light that nothing is happening
with the animal when we turn the light
on using a completely wireless interface
and we'll start moving around and so
does this improve a concept that we can
actually do the the basic operations
that we need to do these kinds of
high-throughput circuit screens so
nothing we working very hard on is how
to turn off neurons and that's important
because you know the best majority of
neurons of the brain are
more than they're on and so if you can
delete information at specific points of
time that might be of great use it's
also the case that if you are driving
all the neurons with a similar pattern
that might be a very unnatural istic
pattern you actually would like to
really dial information into individual
cells or even some comparative cells and
so we've been working on finding
molecules that are light driven but can
shut down neural activity they do the
opposite of the bluid activator from
algae that I told you about before so
this genomic research really was
inspired by this paper from Wow almost
12 years ago where they were looking at
molecules called Hillard opsins which
when you shine light on them will pump
negatively charged ions like chloride
into cells so that's the opposite of the
positive charge in that we talked about
before now these come from archaea you
know a very old class of organism as it
were and physically from halo file so
live in very high chloride concentration
environments and so brains unfortunately
for this molecule have chloride
concentrations around here and so the
current which is the y axis won't won't
be very good and one of these molecules
though is different from the rest
whatever bizarre evolutionary reason its
peak currents were splat dab in the
middle of the brain chloride
concentration range and so a couple
years ago we published a proof of
concept paper showing that indeed you
could silence the neural activity using
this molecule but the effects are
somewhat weak and so we decided to try
and Kassadin more widely in this genomic
search and we set up a whole a screening
apparatus and system and recruited
people to really try and go through all
these molecules from you know funguses
and bacteria and all sorts of things to
look for good neural silencers these are
all from different species and the
molecules have different functions some
of them are no good as you can see and
then some of them are quite good so last
year we had one of our major hits and
this is a molecule that we named arch
and arch expresses really nicely in
neurons and can also mediate pretty
strong silencing currents about an order
of magnitude larger than the old one
both at low light powers and also
highlight powers so what that means is
in the awake behaving brain in this case
awake mouse brain you can actually turn
off near activity
two percent on in the cerebral cortex
and you can do it in a very template
precise way in contrast to two lesions
which might well they would delete
things forever I guess but or from
oncology which delete things on the time
scale of minutes to hours this you can
see here is shutting down a cortical
module for about five seconds and the
the latency to shut down is very short
and then when the light turns off the
neurons start to fire again each of
these dots is a little electrical
potential being fired by a neuron so now
you can do all sorts of things and I'll
let show you one short story about
something we're trying to do which is
understand how stress affects the brain
now stress of course is a very commonly
involved with all sorts of things
including psychiatric illness to
something country it's the depression
but also stress has evolutionary
important things as well you know we can
galvanize you know people to change
behavior and to act and things like that
as well and so one of the questions is
how is stress actually modulating neural
circuits to change how the information
is being processed and ideally of course
we would do all these perturbations
while we're recording from the target so
we know how the information is changing
but this is why I'm telling this the the
story in reverse order as I alluded to
in the beginning the perturbation is a
fairly simple in straightforward
experiment or still we're still working
on the readout methods so in this case
we decide to look at a class of neurons
this is a collaboration with Chi
goossens lab at MIT which is a look at
search an urgent neurons and
serotonergic neurons are neurontin you
may have heard about in the context of
topics such as antidepressants
fluoxetine and other drugs being
serotonin reuptake inhibitors boosting
serotonin presence at least so the
pharmacology goes and as you might have
also heard though it can take many weeks
for these SSRI drugs or serotonin
boosting drugs to have an effect and so
a question is how precisely do the
serotonin serotonin neurons work are
they really signalling information at a
fast time scale or are they really
acting more like a volume knob on the
circuit to turn up or down the functions
of what's going on and so we targeted
serotonin neurons again an amount using
this optical neural silence here arch
and we were able to shut down these
neurons
pretty effectively about ninety percent
eighty ninety percent of the the spiking
could be deleted and so we decided then
to try and figure out if you delete
serotonin just for a very brief amount
of time what happens so use a paradigm
that clys group has has used before and
many folks have used in psychiatry in
animal models because it's a way of
assessing the effects of stress on the
brain and the basic idea is that if you
have stressors and they're many many
kinds of stressors but we used a fairly
brief form of stress which is just an
hour long on two days and then you have
some kind of learning paradigm the
stressful modulate the learning and
that's something that has been noticed
in this case we're using a form of
learning called Pavlovian conditioning
in this case if your conditioning where
a tone ends with a mild shock which is
not painful but it's it's annoying and
the the fear conditioning results in
animals fearing the tone that that is
being delivered and so this is actually
a useful learning paradigm that's been
around a neuroscience for many many
decades but it's also a capsule ate some
of the things that people think about
when they think about stress so for
example recently there was a paper
published about how people returning
from war zones are more likely to return
with post-traumatic stress disorder if
they had prior stress before they went
into the military and so that's a sort
of a logical architecture of experiment
that we're trying to capture here okay
so when you do this you can see
something like the following so this is
a freezing sort of you know like the
deer in the headlights response in
response to the tone so animals are
fearing the tone on and what you see is
uh this is a the blue is before the
training and the red is after so after
the training of the fear conditioning
the animals fear the tone after more
than before as you might expect with
stress however the reaction is stronger
which emulates what we just talked about
in terms of you know post-traumatic
stress disorder being boosted by I prior
stress and you can prove that the stress
is actually moderating the learning
because if you put the fear conditioning
but
or the stress then there's no boost
stress is not just generally ramping up
emotional state it's actually changing
the learning itself so I decided to try
and turn off the serotonergic neurons
for just seconds in order to see how
they contribute to the expression of
stress in this learning modulation and
we decided to turn them off as opposed
to on and we decided to turn them off
for a very brief fount of time rather
than administering a drug for many weeks
because you really wanted to see in a
very brief time scale what the causal
role that these neurons could be playing
in real-time brain operation was and so
we really are just deleting them for
these brief you know a few tens of
seconds during the tone exposure and
that's all the surgeon ergic deletion
that we're doing during those two little
time courses there and interesting that
was enough to completely block all the
effects of stress which is kind of
interesting because you know drugs like
fluoxetine the serotonin reuptake
inhibitors would you know so the theory
goes boosts serotonin he refined that
blocking serotonin is what's helping and
also whereas those effects take many
weeks here I find the effects within
tens of seconds and so it really
highlights how important it might be to
really parse out how these different
neural circuit elements work by deleting
them and driving them at a time scale
comparable to how the brain is actually
computing rather than purely looking at
you know more gross effects over very
long time scales and this actually
suggest a new theories of how we might
want to actually modulate this class of
neurons in order to affect
stress-related effects now you might
argue well we're turning off the the the
neuron so maybe it's a nonspecific
effect you're just turning off the
neurons for 60 seconds and if you turn
the neurons off for any 60-second period
to 30 second periods then maybe you
would block these stress effects and so
if you look carefully how we do the the
training here we're using a very old
style paradigm where some of these tones
and shocks are paired so that they
result in the fear of learning but some
of their unpaired they should have no
information content or if anything
should train the brain that the tone is
not to be followed by a shock depending
upon how deep into the learning theory
want to go so we did a different
experiment we silenced the neurons just
during the unpaired tones now this would
discriminate whether it's really all
about the actual stimuli that are
involved with the actual learning or
whether it's just module a in general
of serotonergic neurons in the brain
more like the volume knob hypothesis
again rather than a very precise gate of
sensory input into specific circuits and
when we did that we silenced these
neurons for the same amount of time but
just shifted slightly so we're not there
during the actual stimuli thoroughly in
the learning then there are the blocking
of these Sarah torrents has no effect so
you can really pinpoint the timing and
the and the events outside are the
actual circuit in this case behavioral
events that are important for a given
neuron class the gate information flow
and so this isn't that we're very
interested in following up so we've
continued to look for better tools one
of things that we wanted to do is we
collaborate the number of groups that
are trying to silence large brain
regions such as people who worked with
rhesus macaques which are widely used in
neurosciences study cognition reception
and other things that are are more
difficult to study in rodents so one of
things we did was to do a genomic screen
for molecules that are related to arch
since it looked like a pretty good
molecule and we found molecules are a
lot like arch but we're more
light-sensitive and it's more
light-sensitive then you can actually
try to perturb more of the brain a
single optical fiber of the kind we
using here it might perturb you know
about a cubic millimeter or so a brain
maybe a little bit more with this one
which is about four three point five
times more light-sensitive then you can
perturb more of the brain and so we
collaborate with Bob DeSimone screw at
MIT and they were able to show that they
could actually delete activity in
circuits in awake behaving rhesus
macaques which are species that are used
to study attention and all sorts of
other higher order forms a condition
that could be more difficult to to study
um in other species now one thing we've
also been trying to do is to find tools
allow us to dial-in information and more
realistic ways so far we've all been
talking about you know deleting activity
or drug activity in sort of bulk tissue
and of course that's a good first step
but you really want to go the dial-in
information at a resolution of
individual cells within the brain and to
point out how difficult this is you know
a cubic millimeter brain might have a
hundred thousand different cells in it
so we're not there yet but I'll show you
in a second how we're trying to approach
this problem and we hope to be much
better than what we can do now and I
reasonably
soon time scale the second thing you can
do is you can try to get different
channels of information that you could
use so here what you can see is once
again we have sort of efficacy on the
y-axis and now we have color on the
x-axis and one molecule as you can see
pretty good activity in the blue another
molecule has activity in the red and
both of these are different silencers
from different kingdoms of life so if
you put these two different sound sirs
into two different neurons one of them
here you can see red light will quiet
down the blue light will not have any
effect or at least it'll be less of an
effect if the crosstalk still exists to
be upfront and that's what you what
happens if you put this molecule in if
you take the more blue light sensitive
sensitive molecule and put it in then
this neuron here will be palatable by
blue light but red light will not affect
it as much and so this was sort of the
first demonstration that you could
actually have two channels of deletion
where you could try to silence different
neurons in a network and try to see how
they work together or whether
information is handed off for one
population to another or other kinds of
experiment like that and so this is
something that we've now distributed to
many groups and we're excited to push it
further and there's a lot of obviously
you know molecular engineering things
that you can do serve in the synthetic
biology space so here's an example of
just one last story before we go into
kind of how to analyze what's happening
in the brain cuz that's a very clearly
becoming more and more of a addressable
question if we can build the tools that
allow us to confront those issues this
is from akihiro yamanaka screw and what
they were doing here with the label very
tiny cluster of neurons in the brain
stem to make them sound simple with
light and these are neurons that atrophy
or or disappear in patients with
narcolepsy and so you might anticipate
that if you turn off these cells then
you might be able to induce sleep and so
indeed that's what they found when you
shine light in the brain this is
probability of being awake when you
shine light into the brain these neurons
turn off and then the brain also goes
into a sleep state within about 20
seconds and it goes into a sperry a very
specific sleep state it goes into a
state called slow-wave sleep which is
has been implicated certain forms of
of memory consolidation and other kinds
of interesting neurological and
neuroscientific finding you don't go
into REM sleep which is the state that's
associated with dreaming and other kinds
of phenomena different from the the
episodic memory consolidation so suggest
that what's happening when you turn off
these drones is a very specific
transition to sleep it's not just a
nondescript collapse of brain function
but it's rather putting the network into
a very specific state and you can even
imagine how if you could put the brain
into the slow-wave sleep state that
might actually be a a useful thing to
induce in the brain if you wanted to
drive a certain kind of change in a
memory state or other kind of phenomenon
so to summarize um you know we've
distribute these Regents about 500
groups worldwide I didn't update this
slide we really try to collaborate with
a very broad network of folks to get
these Regents out into the world
nonprofit Institute's to distribute the
genes and also viruses or transgenic
animals that have the genes in them so
that it's a more or less of turnkey
technology nowadays much less of an art
form than it was about five years ago
when our first papers came out we also
have a training program and one of them
is funded by the National Science
Foundation to teach people how to do
these kinds of experiments so if anybody
wants to learn how to do it and has a
reasonable amount of prior experience on
animal work I can we can host you to
learn how to do these things and so but
all all is not a clear of course we can
perturb but what is actually happening
in the brain what is happening to the
computations and as you might have
noticed we haven't talked a lot about
actually what changes in neural coding
or what changes in information
transformation are going on and part of
it is that the tools for assessing brain
information are also just to the point
of now increasing in the scope where you
could actually try to serve a large
fractions of a neural circuit here's an
example the kind of thing that that
we've noticed and we published a couple
papers that suggests why it's really
important to survey what's happening in
a circuit even for the most simple
interpret
of these kinds of experiments all were
doing here is driving some excitatory
neurons this is just some neural
electrical potentials and this is some
time and this little blue bar here which
is the light so neurons are firing now
and what you find actually said a lot of
neurons that you record from we're
recording with a lecture in the brain
here a lot of the other neurons actually
being quieted so you might ask yourself
well why is that happening well the most
likely explanation is that we're driving
these excitatory cells they're
recruiting inhibitory cells nearby that
then in turn quiet other cells and then
these cells are undergoing that quieting
and other groups are not investigating
this by trying to return different
inhibitory cells and finding that this
is a quite a plausible theory another
interesting thing that you can do is if
you are quiet down cells which is what's
happening here and these are all again
electrical recordings of cortical
neurons then some cells will actually
increase their activity so in the
beginning we talked about wow you know
this is better than lesions because with
lesions you know the brain is time over
many days two weeks the months to rewire
here I'm finding that even within
milliseconds look at the time scale here
there are neurons of the brain that
responding oppositely to the way they
were trying to control them and so it
highlights how at an intellectual level
it's very nicely able to record and
understand what's happening to the
general codes but a pragmatic level
people really need to be doing this if
only to understand what the perturbation
is done at all and so that's really what
we've been trying to do one of these
you've been working on is to try to
develop electrode arrays in other
microfabricated technologies allow us to
serve a neural circuits in the vicinity
of one of these optical probes and what
you see here is a close-up photo
micrograph of a gold pad for recording
neural activity and then these pads are
going all the way up and down this
electrode so when you put this probe in
the brain looks like a finger you can
pick up neurons at multiple points along
the axis that probe and it actually turn
out to be harder to do this and we
thought because it turns out that the
metal and silicon that people
conventionally used to record from
neurons is light-sensitive and so we
actually have to work quite hard to look
for materials like indium tin oxide
which is a transparent conductor which
avoid this artifact but metals like
tungsten and and semiconductors like
Silicon actually respond to light with
electrical potentials
and so here we have that a little gold
pad then to pick up the spikes and then
we have this other pad which allows you
to record in the frequency bands of
activity where the artifact occurs so
now the question becomes how do you
actually a tile a brain circuit in order
to record these kinds of effects and
it's important to record locally because
a lot of the strongest connections are
but it's also important to record very
distantly right these these three clumps
ignorance I talked about so far the
dopamine neurons the serotonin runs and
these hypocretin orexin neurons are all
small localized clumps of neurons it but
vary widely throughout the brain and so
if you want to understand how a reward
impulses changing information flow or
computation in the brain to cause the
brain to repeat an action or to make a
decision in a certain way then you might
have to survey neurons very distant from
where you are and this is borne out by a
lot of science that's been done groups
have found that for example visual
cortex neurons just two synapses in from
the retina actually can encode for
subtle properties of rewarding stimuli
that have been experienced and so</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
