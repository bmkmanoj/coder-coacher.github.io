Christy Faye a member of the author's at
Google team here in Santa Monica today
I'm pleased introduced as part of our
Tech Talk series bo Kilmer our guest is
a co-director of the RAM corporations
Drug Policy Research Center which I just
learned is over 20 years established
which is great his primary field of
interest our illicit markets Community
Corrections drug treatment and the use
of advanced technologies to help monitor
drug and alcohol use among problem
populations Kilmer's current work
includes projects to estimate the
economic cost of drug use and the
evaluations of community level effects
of drug treatment dr. comer joins us
today to discuss the policy implications
of marijuana legalization in California
nationally and internationally there has
been a dramatic shift in drug policy in
recent years ballot initiatives have
been proposed at the state level and
mean it excuse me and municipalities are
today grappling with how to regulate
marijuana dispensaries and enforce
existing drug law please join me in
welcoming dr. comer in discussing this
fascinating topic and thanks to all of
you for being here chris said my name is
Bo Kilmer I'm the co-director of the
range of policy research center for more
than 20 years we've been doing work on a
variety of issues related to substance
use and drug policy we have some
researchers developing innovative
prevention programs others doing is
doing evaluations and assessments of
racial disparities in marijuana arrests
we have some folks are doing kind of
high-level statistical analyses of data
from undercover drug busts and with all
of these projects the the goal is to
provide objective research and analysis
to decision-makers and so lately been
working on a project looking at
marijuana legalization in California and
this is definitely a team project and
I've got to be a part of a great team I
got to work with John Calkins at
Carnegie Mellon University Rosalie
Pakula who's the other co-director of
the R &amp;amp; Drug Policy Research Center
that's worked with Rob McCune at UC
Berkeley and
and Peter writer at the University of
Maryland and in addition we had a number
of students from Carnegie Mellon
University actually doing a lot of the
background research and we wouldn't have
been able to do this without them so
thanks so as you know a marijuana
legalization is a hot topic in
california and most of the focus right
now is on two different proposals the
first proposal is Assembly Bill 2254
often referred to as the Ammiano bill
and what this bill would do is it would
legalize marijuana for those who are 21
and older and it would put the
California Department of Alcoholic
Beverage Control in charge of regulating
the production and distribution of
marijuana and initially they would place
a fifty dollar an ounce excise tax on
marijuana last year the California Board
of Equalization did an analysis and said
that at fifty dollars an ounce this
would bring in 1.4 billion dollars in
tax revenue to California each year the
other proposal being considered is to
regulate control and tax cannabis
proposition this is what's going to be
on the ballot in November 2010 this
initiative would also legalized
marijuana for those over those 21 and
older and would also make it legal to
cultivate your own five-by-five plot in
your home the interesting twist here is
instead of having statewide regulation
it would allow each local jurisdiction
to have the power to regulate production
and come up with their own tax rates and
button just to kind of put this in
perspective I mean what's have what
these proposals really are kind of
revolutionary and no other place in the
world have we legalized the production
and distribution of marijuana you know a
lot of people like to think well you
know and you know when you go to
Amsterdam it's legal and no well it's
legal to go to a coffee shop and another
one to buy five grams it's still illegal
to produce it so it's kind of it's legal
in the front door illegal in the back
door so until the extent that this
hasn't happened in other places I mean
it's really include about trying to
project what would happen you know
there's a lot of to be a lot of debate
and it's actually a lot of rhetoric in
this debate so the goal of our analysis
really was to just focus on two issues
one try to try to understand how little
is a shin of marijuana in California
could influence consumption and then
also look at how legalization could have
fluence public budgets
and I want to make it very clear that
done we did not we neither had the time
or the resources to do a comprehensive
cost-benefit analysis I mean our goal
wasn't to you know come out and say you
know this would be a good idea for
california or this would be a bad idea
for california similarly I'm we're not
trying to tell people how to vote on the
initiative I mean ran doesn't take
positions on valve initiatives or a
specific no specific bills being
considered I mean we really don't have a
horse in this race we just wanted to
kind of provide some objective
information to actually help guide the
discussion will be having for the next
five months here in California and I'm
sure it will continue to have this
debate and discussion after November so
today I want to briefly just talk about
how we built this model and then go into
some of the key insights so you know we
begin with this logic model where you
can see on the left hand side you've got
your choice variables you know when you
legalize you make a choice to remove the
sanctions for possession and sales and
then you also have to make decisions
about the regulatory regime the tax
rates on the right hand side you have
these octagon zor kind of the outcomes
that we cared about you know marijuana
consumption and also the net impact on
state and local budgets and as you can
imagine I mean these policy decisions
have direct and indirect effects and I'm
not going to walk you through each of
these different boxes and arrows during
the presentation but I want to make it
very code that we were systematic about
this and so for each of these
intermediary boxes we actually not only
had to come up with a point estimate but
we also had to kind of come up with a
range and so when we could you know we
looked at the peer-reviewed literature
for a lot of these boxes there wasn't a
lot there in the scientific literature I
went to the grey literature I went to
greenhouses talk to farmers talked to
people at medical marijuana dispensaries
and we did a lot of different things in
order to kind of come up with these
ranges and I mean while this is useful
in terms of kind of making projections
for the model just the idea of kind of
bringing all the literature together for
each of these boxes turned out to yield
some of our most important insights so
now let's talk about some of the key
insights and kind of the main takeaway
from the analysis is that we expect that
the pre-tax retail price of marijuana to
drop substantially post legalization
probably on the order of eighty ninety
percent right now if you want to get
Alice's sinsemilla in California
this is your high-quality marijuana it's
going to run you between three hundred
four hundred and fifty dollars and just
want to make it clear for the analyses
we actually ended up having to convert
everything into sensimilla equivalence
because we know that most of California
isn't using sinsemilla right now but in
order to get an idea about what happens
to the price post legalization you
actually have to make some assumptions
about what what would production look
like you know we just don't know so we
kind of costed out four different model
or four different approaches one being
you know we would allow everyone to do
their own private hydroponic five by
five plot another mode of production we
looked at was allowing residential grow
houses where it'll soon as a $1,500
1,500 square foot grow house where 300
square feet would be devoted to
production then you also have greenhouse
farms and then unfettered outdoor farms
you know we costed it out for each of
those but ultimately we had to make a
decision about which one we thought
would be most likely in order to do the
projections and we ended up focusing on
the grow houses for a few reasons first
of all if you're a jurisdiction you're
trying to make money off of taxing
marijuana the five by five plots that's
just inefficient you're not going to get
that much and with respect in with
respect to greenhouse farms are kind of
unfettered outdoor farms you know we
don't know what the federal government
is going to do but we thought that the
federal government would probably have a
problem with all these greenhouses and
unfettered farms up and down i-5 you
know I want to make it very clear we
don't know what the thighs are going to
do but we thought so we felt comfortable
basing our assumptions on the scroll
house model and with the grow houses are
in fact with any of these kind of modes
of production there are a number of a
number of reasons why you would expect a
the cost of production to go down first
of all you're getting rid of the risk
right now when you buy cocaine when you
buy heroin when you buy marijuana a lot
of what you're paying for is actually
compensate the dealer in everyone
everyone else in the supply chain for
their you know their risk of arrest
their risk of incarceration that will go
away with legalization you also have to
just also going to be a decreased risk
of asset forfeiture you also have to
think about automation too I mean right
now when you're trimming buds that's a
very labor-intensive process I mean they
now have machines which of which are
much more efficient at doing this and
you're going to expect those machines
only to be more available post
legalization but also cheaper and in
fact people will necessarily even have
to buy them you could actually just you
probably could just rent some of these
machines in order to help trim you know
when it's time to actually manicure and
then finally also economies of scale I
mean it's one thing if you have one or
two grow houses but if you're able to
actually have 15 16 grow houses then you
can start really buying the fertilizer
the nutrients and kind of the other
substances in bulk and so one could
imagine that there would be savings
there so there's a lot of theory about
well that we would expect the price to
be low but then we went and just try to
figure it out okay assuming they we have
a grow house and knowing how much
lighting it would require how much labor
it would require what would it actually
cost to produce a pound sinsemilla range
we came up with was with was between 200
and 400 dollars a pound so if you're
trying to figure out what the retail
price would you'd have to add on your
wholesaler of markups retailer markups
distribution when all said and done we
expect that post legalization announces
sinsemilla pre-tax would run less than
forty dollars that's a big difference
from the 300 to 450 that you see in the
market right now and just to kind of put
this in perspective some others have
tried to estimate this and our estimate
kind of falls in those ranges the Board
of Equalization in my r in they both put
it at fifty percent the head of the
gearing are here the head of the
California Department California
division of the national organization
for the reform of marijuana laws
testified last year they know hey at
three hundred you could begin with three
hundred dollars an ounce but post
legalization when it's unregulated it
would only end up being on the order of
a few dollars per ounce so ultimately
we're most comfortable saying that post
legalization we expect the price to drop
at least eighty percent leave this to
our next point that you know we expect
consumption is going to increase post
legalization but it's unclear how much
right there are two reasons for this
post legalization first of all you have
these non-price effects right for some
people it's going to change the stigma
they'll be more likely to use but then
you also have to be thinking about
advertising and promotion for those
reasons you would expect use to take up
a little bit but then obviously also
when you have such a large price drop
you would expect there to be price
effects we know that users and potential
users are sensitive to the
prices of marijuana um but in order to
do that you really have to have a good
idea about how how sensitive consumers
are to these price changes and for your
calmness out there you have to have a
good idea about the price elasticity of
demand thing is is what this price drop
that you would see in marijuana is going
to be large and something we've never
seen before and so when you're talking
about changes that large it actually
requires that you know what the demand
curve looks like if we're talking about
something small the shape the demand
curve does not matter as much but for
this it actually it makes a difference
about your assumptions and you know the
thing is is we don't know what the
demand curve for marijuana actually
looks like so for our analyses we focus
on to demand crows are just kind of
common in the literature but you learn
about an introductory econ you know
constant elasticity demand and a linear
demand curve but we want to make very
clear that we we don't know if either of
these is correct but for analysis we
just wanted to say well how would the
results change you know depending on
one's assumption about the shape of the
demand curve and the takeaway from this
chart is that it matters a lot your
assumptions about the demand curve are
really going to influence your
projections about consumption on the
y-axis here we have the percent increase
in consumption post legalization and on
the x-axis we actually have the percent
of consumption that evades sales taxes
because we actually don't know how much
tax evasion is going to happen but just
focus here at the y axis assuming that
assuming a linear demand curve a fifty
dollar an ounce tax no tax evasion a
perfectly elastic supply curve we would
expect a post legalization the price or
the consumption would increase about
seventy six percent now keep all that
constant and just switch out the linear
demand curve for the constant elasticity
demand curve and that goes to all about
one hundred fifty percent now once again
want to be very clear we don't know if
either of these is correct but this is
this assumption actually makes a big
difference and oftentimes when people
when individuals are doing these
analyses they just kind of make an
assumption and don't think about it but
we say it actually does matter minor
assumptions have major implications when
you're thinking about how to project the
effects of marijuana legalization third
point is that tax evasion couldn't be a
major concern especially if the tax
rates are set too high I'm the obvious
comparison product here is tobacco we
know that when tobacco taxes are too
high folks are more likely to buy from
the internet go to an Indian Reservation
you know there are these great stories
in Canada where a few of the provinces
added on a three dollar pack tax on
tobacco and there ended up being so much
tax evasion they actually had to repeal
the taxes we do know that we know that
tobacco tax evasion does happen in
California we don't know how much I mean
some people have putted that one to four
percent of Board of Equalization came
out about 10 years ago saying arranged
range between 12-2 27 we don't know
exactly where that is but we know that
it happens but they kind of put this in
perspective in no state is the excise
tax for an ounce of tobacco more than
five dollars what's being promote was
being an initially introduced with the
Ammiano bill is a fifty dollar an ounce
tax that's pretty eye and just forget
about ohms is for a moment let's
actually think about pounds the
financial if you assume that the tax is
fifty dollars an ounce the financial
reward for not paying that tax is going
to be between 800 850 dollars do they
also have to account for the sales tax I
mean that's more than I actually cost to
buy a pound of marijuana from Mexico
right now so you know there's a lot of
uncertainty here and we don't come up
with a specific point estimate but we do
want to make it very clear that if you
do set the tax too high you could have
this you could have a fair amount of
evasion it was interesting about that is
not only will of age and reduce the
amount of revenue going to the state but
all our state or local governments but
when you have more evasion that means
that the consumers are actually facing a
lower price so you actually expect more
of an a larger increase in use for
points all about criminal justice costs
in terms of how much money we actually
spend enforcing marijuana laws in
California the takeaway here is be thin
if you're thinking about this be
thinking about hundreds of millions of
dollars not billions you know there are
a lot of people like to say you know if
we were to legalize marijuana we would
free up all these resources and we use
that money for you know education we
could use it for you know other services
right now they're kind of before we
looked into this there were two other
estimates out there about how much
California spends enforcing marijuana
laws one part of the 200 million the
other one putted it close to two
in a year and that's an order of
magnitude difference so we thought okay
let's just figure this out I mean this
is not rocket science give me the number
of arrests the number of people
incarcerated information about
adjudication we can throw on some unit
costs I can get a pretty good ballpark
figure of what it would be and when we
did that we estimated that probably each
year less than three hundred million
dollars is spent in forcing marijuana
laws you know in terms of these are fun
spin bike out by the state and the local
governments we also have to remember is
that this doesn't necessarily mean
savings I mean it's not as if you know
former to be legalized that money is
going to go back into the general fund
that money is probably going to stay
with a local law enforcement at stay
with Department of Corrections now may
be the case that that money will be
better spent I mean that's something we
didn't look at but just when people are
talking about this i mean yeah be
thinking be thinking in the millions not
in the billions and finally the revenue
estimates that the Board of Equalization
came up with that one point one point
four billion we can think of a number of
reasons why the number could actually be
dramatically lower or dramatically
higher first of all there are four
reasons why we one could expect the tax
revenues coming in to California to be
less than 1.4 billion first of all tax
evasion we don't know what's going to be
but the tax rate is too high enough we
expect there to be evasion when the
Board of Equalization did its analysis
it assumed there would be no evasion so
to the extent there would be evasion you
expect that to lower it also we expect a
larger drop in prices so if there is if
consumers face a lower price that means
the sales tax revenue is also going to
be lower than what was projected third
one thing that we account for is the
fact that there could be the shift for a
shift to higher potency marijuana use
post a legalization right now we think
most of the marijuana consumed in
California's commercial-grade not
sensimilla but it's going to become so
cheap post legalization we expect that
most individuals who are smoking will be
smoking sinsemilla and to that extent
you don't have to spend as much to get
the same hyper an hour so you would
actually you have to make an adjustment
when you're doing these calculations and
so once you do that when to account for
the fact that the hexans the excise tax
is based on weight you would expect that
mob that amount to go down finally the
tax rate may not be fifty dollars an
ounce we Nevel that's what was initially
proposed manana bill that's the one that
seems to have a lot of currency but it's
very clear
that the with a ballot initiative it
allows each of these jurisdictions to
come up with our own estimates however
the revenues actually could be a lot
higher than 1.4 billion if California is
actually able to make money off of
sinsemilla being exported so in addition
to the report that we have online we
actually have nine additional working
papers which provide the background
calculations for a lot of what we're
doing and in one of those chapters by
Brittany bond and John Calkins they
actually estimate smuggling costs what
it costs to smuggle marijuana from
Humboldt as well as from Mexico and so
assume that we have this big price drop
assume that the tax is going to be fifty
dollars an ounce add on these smuggling
costs we still expect that sinsemilla
coming from California will still be
competitive with a lot of the sense to
me of being sold in the rest of the
country so there is a chance that
California could actually make a lot of
revenue if individuals who come to
California they buy it then they take it
back but the big question is is you know
someone from Michigan drives the
California loads up their colorful you
know several pounds are they going to
buy it and pay taxes if they can buy it
above board or are they going to try to
buy on its grey market that's what we
don't know but there actually is this
possibility that California could make a
fair amount of money if it can make
money off these exports but so much of
that's really going to depend on what
the federal response is we don't know
what the feds are going to do and on one
hand the feds could step up enforcement
or they could do what they did in the in
the 80s when they wanted to raise the
minimum legal drinking age they didn't
pass a law saying you know you know the
drinking age has to be 21 but they said
is if you want all of your federal
highway funds you're drinking age better
be 21 and so there you can imagine
something like that happening with this
I mean that and I mean right now I think
California gets at least 3 billion
dollars in federal highway funds we
assume that you know they would lose ten
percent of that even if they lost ten
percent to be 300 million I mean that
could offset or more than offset some of
the revenue coming in on the other hand
like I said if the feds are kind of
hands off about this and they don't get
involved it actually could make it
easier to make money off of exporting it
to of marijuana to other states and in
that case actually California we would
expect more money to come in like we
said we don't know what the feds are
going to do and we also don't know what
the other states but do too we don't
know what
vada would react if all of a sudden
people just kept driving across the
border and then and then heading back to
Vegas to sell so in terms of conclusions
decision makers whether they are policy
makers or voters you need to be
skeptical of estimates that claim
precision if someone comes up to you
says you know legalization we think it's
going to increase consumption by this
amount or you know it's going to bring
in this much in revenues and they feel
that that number is pretty precise be
skeptical we show that there's a lot of
uncertainty here not only with respect
to tax evasion but also with the this
shape of the demand curve this is such a
large drop that Deb I mean it requires a
lot of assumptions there's a lot of
uncertainty there second we know that
consumption is going to increase but
it's unclear by how much I mean with our
models we can't rule out increases of
fifty to a hundred percent perhaps more
but we don't really know but one thing
to kind of keep in mind is if you took
the prevalence rate that we have today
in California for the number of people
who smoke pot in the past 30 days which
i think is six point five percent if you
were to double that you know assume one
hundred percent increase and say it was
you know close to 13 we'd be back to
where we were in 1978 so I mean that as
there is a world that we've seen before
I mean granted marijuana now isn't it is
more as stronger I mean we have less
disco but I mean we actually have seen a
world where there have been many more
marijuana smokers and I want to be very
clear we don't were not necessarily
saying that we think it's going to
double but you know you're going to be
seeing more of these estimates coming
out for the next five months so we for
us this is actually a useful bright line
for thinking about how to interpret you
know what that world could possibly look
like and finally the evidence base for
this analysis is severely limited you
know so much of the economics literature
is all focused on marginal changes you
know if there's a three dollar increase
in the price of marijuana how does that
include influence consumption these are
all marginal we realize that legalizing
marijuana in California would not be a
marginal change so to that extent it
really calls into question how much we
can actually rely on the existing
literature in order to inform our
projections about marijuana legalization
in California without all clothes I look
forward to your questions and comments
and I guess I'm so stated that this
concludes our video tape portion of the
toxin thanks
