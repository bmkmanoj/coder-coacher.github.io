the first day which is marked from the
BBC talking about some achieving
automation with mixed two teams mixed
skills thank you can you hear me ok so
good evening ah my name is Mark and
basically I lead the team at the BBC
which is a QA team which is mainly
responsible for passing the BBC's need
support and weather website and the idea
for the shop came about from some work
we've been doing over the past year year
or so whereby we've been trying to go
from the point where we had latrine
notice information in place to trying to
make it an essential part all of our
process and it's entitled achieving web
test automation with a mexican-themed
mainly because the biggest challenge
that we had at the time what was that we
had a team of really good testers but
they were a man with this size okay so
they were really good people there
they're practically domain experts but
you had the problem of how do we go from
the kind of situation that we are now
having an automated testing suite in
place Oh with the with the scene so so i
think that the common perception within
the the industry is that test automation
is mainly a technical problem right so a
technical problem should be solved by
technical people and you know I'm guilty
of this myself so every time i worked at
other companies and i have the
opportunity to build up in myself from
scratch I've I've always chosen to
recruit one type of person and then
that's this guy so to me that's the
first engineer and I knew you'd like
this cause you know I'm assuming most of
your test engineers over here and you
know I really like this engineer is
because a they can test be they can code
they understand how systems work you can
use them in code reviews you know they
can do it all so on a competence level
they're you know they're so large extent
we consider them to be a superior form
of test analyst and then again on
competence level there is a solid
argument behind that so it's rather easy
to take a software engineering teach
them how to test but it's more difficult
to take an analyst we don't take a
little background on him how how to code
um so I'm going to stereotype of it here
um I'm going to be a bit unfair i'm
going to say there are two types of
tests areas the technical person on the
analyst right and the main difference
between those two people in my opinion
besides your competences is their
motivation so what makes me is this
engineer tick what makes me get up in
the morning and come to work it's very
different to the reason that the test
analyst comes to work for so I was
amazed earlier when when my kid was
giving his talk and there was sudden
everyone brace held applauding in the
middle of the talk I've never seen that
happen anywhere right and it was because
he managed to solve this seemingly
really complex problem in a very simple
way and we were all amazed by this
there's a sculpture of people the
culture of people sitting over there who
are usually tapping on their laptops and
they just you know smiled and looked at
it and clapped and the reason is that
test engineers are usually motivated by
the technical aspect of the work so
we're motivated like test harnesses bye
bye what languages were using
technologies and so on and so so a
typical example of this is a few years
ago I used to work at this company and
we're working on our flagship product at
the time and we were closer to the
release date and I turned to one of the
engineers who was on my team and it was
already talented person and there are
some listen we need to build the user
simulation so could you please build an
object which simulates user behavior
realistically and then just you know
spawn it out over a number of threads
and simulate a realistic load and let's
see how the system behaves over a number
of days no and what do you think his
reaction was it is so so he was really
happy about this he went to his desk he
was really motivated about it he he
built I believe I state transition a
safe machine off of this he has some
probabilities transitions yo and then he
built you know randomized behavior on
this safe machine and they came up with
this really realistic scenario which
ended up finding but a bit of problems
for us
and hence it was a successful assignment
for him and you know that's one
motivated engineer a few weeks later
were working on another project and this
assignment was it was a financial system
which you know cut a long story short
takes a large xml file processes it save
some values and database and then
produces some from valid would and
because because we were mainly because
people were getting paid a lot of this
expedient as a result of this the
application you know we needed to cover
our bases we need to get it right so I
said okay so this person is a really
good job last time around you don't live
depend on headless time and I I assign
him discuss I for the missing this is
the scheme under this is amol will
process could you please you know take
it take it away with you and come up
with a comprehensive list of test cases
let's make sure we cover all our cases
all our flower vases and you know I was
surprised when his turn his face turned
to this no and he didn't realize this he
did it anyway what task which I thought
should take maybe a day maybe two wasn't
ideal in the end the end of the port day
at this this person began to
procrastinate he became really a choice
60 as soon as someone had picked my
technical problem he just volunteered
I'll demote no infos incredible great
for team spirit but not for this
particular task and at the end of this
four-day I said okay I mean let's do
this together we locked ourselves in a
meeting room and the whiteboard and just
got it done and you know at the end of
this you went away he automated the test
so he was happy with that and the
problem here was not that he was not
capable of doing it so he had the
competence to do it but the problem was
that it didn't really make him take so
the analysis task wasn't something he
enjoyed doing and he also appreciated
that the fact that he did this task I
really had to help him do a really good
job of the automation work after that so
in general what you end up getting is a
situation like this so imagine you you
can you line up a list of testing tasks
from left to right from this technical
term or cyclical and this is not based
on any scientific survey this is just
from experience and talking to people
and on the y axis you plot you know
motivation so how happy am i doing this
ask and if you're a test analyst and
again I'm stereotyping a lot here
chances are that should be really
motivated to do the task on the left
side of the graph it's process already
paying test reporting manual test
execution following up on bugs and so on
but then when you get to the right side
of the graph even if you do have a
technical background but for whatever
reason is sucked on to the analysis side
of the the industry you know you're not
really motivated to do this so the
quality of your work your work might
suffer if you look at engineers which is
the red line you tend to to get the
reverse right oh so you're really
motivated with user simulations
performance tests and all this stuff but
then you know ask some ass get this
engine to write a report and I've seen
this happen and you know I had this guy
once who literally pulled off an
all-nighter to work to write the tool
which wrote the report for him and it
just signifies this sorry yeah it just
signifies that sort of you know it's
what makes the person pick at the end of
the day so this couple of the sock is
you know we got we were forced in the
situation because of the team that we
had and we said wouldn't it be great if
we could bring in some engineering
talent in this team but hold on 15 that
way up now and sort of a situation
whereby you have this so where you could
somehow merge all the merge the skills
of all the people involved and get and
achieve the you know a high level of
motivation throughout so actually the
scope of the stock is even narrower than
that so how do we bring in the people on
the left side of the graph the analysts
into the automation side of things no
and that's that's what the stuff is
about um okay so just to put you in a
bit of context so this is one of the
earlier versions of our news website
it's December twelfth 1998 President
Clinton was being impeached and
basically the site has a very 1990
screen to it it seems to be optimized to
a comic by 600 which was the predominant
resolution of the time and you know
basically there isn't much much that's
impressive about it's a static web page
and what happened over the years is that
you know the site change so as time went
by you know broadband became popular and
you want to take advantage of that new
technologies came about which gave off
new new possibilities and you know we
have a team of engineering school who's
really proactive in these things and
today we're in a situation where we have
a site which is you know basically very
different to the blue one from 12 years
ago actually there's a piece of work
going on right now we're launching the
site sometime next year which is going
to compute it from the game and the only
the only thing that's coming over here
is that politicians are still stepping
down from their jobs basically and so so
the site is now very AV centric so we
actually if you live in the UK you can
view the your television channels online
and high quality we actually syndicated
content out to external sites we also
cover sports events live so so this is
an example where reviews our I prayer
component to actually cover formula 1 in
the UK and we allow users use to switch
between calm reviews between the print
audio commentaries so the site is
becoming more dynamic and blow this
complaint component there would be more
dynamic components of the leaderboard
would be changing at the rate goes on
dynamically journalists will be updating
it to the updating their comments online
users can take send their comments and
we actually have user participation so
so the side keeps changing this is
another service which we're launching in
the next few weeks for anyone who's
interested in politics so basically this
is a project which linked up on the
parliaments in the UK as well as the
European Parliament and basically
there's a like stream going on at any
one point and you can also be recorded
sessions if you want to there's also
some innovative new features like for
example you might want to search you
know when did Gordon Brown speak about
recession and we would literally give
you what the video clips were golden
brown mentioned the word recessions and
take at this point where where he
mentioned the word recession and so on
so
so the fight has evolved from that
static site which I sold you I showed
you earlier on to do these this rich
settled set of services basically which
is great but from a testing perspective
it's it's a nightmare okay so so what's
actually been happening is and get into
the subject later when we start up when
we start a new project what we tend to
do is we tend to set up a
cross-functional project thing okay so
we have a number of Engineers on this
project theme and usually they're
specialists so let's say last year we
cover the American election and we have
an engineer who who is an expert in
feeds because we're posing election
results that someone who's an expert in
a he because we want to stream the
victory speeches live but someone who's
interested in publishing so we get these
specialists engineers and they're really
good and we will have one day sir maybe
tool to cater to this particular project
and so far they've always been manual
testers so in the case of this so in the
context of the sock obviously we need to
keep in mind that we want to automate
the system now how we also have user
experience designers who make sure we
stick to the identity of the site
product managers who who decide what
season or says out project managers make
sure we deliver this one time and who
have these this group of magic people i
call the more called information
architect and then oh I don't know
whether you've had the opportunity to
work with these people but you know if
you have the money for them go out and
hire them because they're really good
what what information architects tend to
do is so they're usually graduates of
library science and they specialize in
how information is structured basically
so if you take the example of over
website and three different people
looking at this website and say you have
an engineer a designer and the product
manager so if you're an engineer and
you're looking at this page you're
probably visualizing HTML code maybe
Java code which is generating that that
page and so on if you're if you're if
you're a designer you're probably
thinking in terms of colors fonts CSS
classes and so on as well and
if you're a product manager you think on
between terms of features so there's a
link to a live stream there's a top
story their new sticker and so on so
it's not uncommon for SS sisters to talk
to three different people about the same
system and get a completely different
set of technology because people are
looking at the system from their own
point of view and they're discussing it
with their own peers in their own
languages and those information
architects zoo is they they first of all
give everyone a common language ok and
they do things like organize your site
into a content object model they create
user journeys and and this is all work
which can map directly to test
automation again delay so we found these
people really really helpful another
thing that's happened over the years is
that because these themes are empowered
to just make their own decisions and
come up with the best solution that they
can we've had a situation where people
are are basically making technology
choices and using any technology comes
along at a time which is best for the
job so we're currently in a situation
and trust me this is a subset of
economies that we have so of publishers
written in Java right now we have
journalist who's written net web AV
content with and flash some other
dynamic aspects written in JavaScript
however their site is a PHP side and
also trying to achieve this ok with the
current thing that we have with the set
of technologies with a bit of a problem
ok so so this is this situation we found
ourselves in um ok so we started off
about a year ago with this from from the
point of having no automation I said ok
so where do we start I'm the first thing
we have to do is make a decision you
know what projects can look in your
committee place which one will give us a
most value and this might sound trivial
but what we did was we put together a
very short questionnaire basically it
was a statement and what 10 statement
and the statement said things like the
site sorry this project will keep
delivering releases regularly at least
for the next six months or on this
project I usually spend most of my time
regression testing and Phillip testing
new features and we are two people for
each project to answer these questions
and they answer them by giving a value
between 0 and 5 where 0 means no that's
completely not true and five easy on
this very relevant is very true and then
we sort of got together moderated least
scores and came up with a with a scoring
system and we're working on 13
concurrent projects at the time and
basically the top two projects where the
wsw which was our website at the time
which scored highly mainly because it
was not released yet we knew it were the
one per roughly a period of three years
after it was released and we're planning
a lot of releases plus we were spending
a lot of time regression testing so
that's called really highly the second
project was project toggle which is very
clear mechanism which decides how how
users are directed to all the site
depending on their geographical location
in the world and some other parameters
and then on the lower end of the scale
web projects like picture galleries this
wasn't context of the u.s. elections
whereby were coming up with a new
component which we know when you would
only create once and then reused over
and over again and so we didn't really
want to automate it at the end of the
day we ended up during our first
automation projects on on our mobile
browser which basically was a rewrite of
over mobile production code and we chose
our project because it was only true to
a number of releases at the time and the
trees was taking up to two weeks to test
and you know let's put the project in a
bit of trouble timelines or which always
acted in the delay I'm so once which was
a project what we do is again something
which sounds rude trivia we get together
a room and we define success for this
project so once we're done once this
project is sufficient finished what the
success looks like look so what the
success look like and this might be
anything from you know we'll have
increased viewership numbers all the way
down to you know we'll have zero cause
regression testing and we also define
failure so we we know what failure looks
like so if someone's watching the world
cup online and rosalyn during the final
penalty kick off you know everything
hangs you know that's a disaster for us
next time around people are not like to
use our site and the reason we do this
even though it sounds repeat is because
it has this amazing effect of focusing
everyone or we want to go and
and that's really important for us so
you can move towards success and you
start smelling failure because you've
already defined it you know you can take
corrective action so most of the
audience here are a test engineers call
start getting into some technical
details so one of the early things we
knew we wanted to create out what we
wanted to to utilize abstraction as much
as much as possible and we wanted to use
the rise abstraction mainly because of
the kind of skills I didn't thing and if
you build in the right level of
abstraction into your technology stack
then you're more likely to old
non-technical people into the automation
side of things and our first concept
that this our first stab at it was this
hey it's we haven't really gotten there
yet in fact this has actually changed
today but we had this vision of having a
situation whereby would have a lower
layer where by engineers would be
working in core languages like C short
Ruby Java so on and using these
libraries they using these languages
they'd build up foundation press
collaborate so it go to them and say
okay we need the data factory we need to
be able to create stories on the fly
okay how do we do that and they did love
api's for us and eventually once we had
a critical mass of these AP Rhys we hope
to harvest harvest said yourself from
this and at the point that you have a
DSL you can actually bring in
non-technical people who can actually
create their very test who came image so
that was the vision at the time and then
once you have you know this mass of
people creating test rating testing two
regression suites and at the highest
level you know you'll have a sake holder
is having a look at background trends
and so on so as I said we're not leader
yet this is actually changed and I'm
getting to it a bit later and we've been
the one a lot of work in the bottom
three layers mainly the three reduction
we wanted to take was to unify
technologies so given the situation that
we were in we wanted to take this
situation okay which is where where we
have developers and different things
working in between technologies and
somehow on the testing sir identify this
under one technology if this made it
easier
to train of people make the make it
easier to wing and people who are not
reading that comfortable coding okay so
the idea was that from a testing
perspective you'd always do something
you'd always write the sink ships in one
language and what we did was we took
this set of technologies and just added
another one into the mix just for the
fun of it and we chose Ruby okay and I
come from a Java background and this was
a painful decision for me but I accepted
it and they accepted for three reasons
so the first one was that you know from
the research that we did Ruby as a rod
doesn't have a really steep learning
curve so we actually got to send the
whole team away to a training course and
they came back and they were relatively
comfortable with doing some basic Ruby
code the second one is Ruby syntax is
very loose okay so so again this sounds
trivial but it helped and you could call
methods and passing parameters without
including brackets for example and you
know to that Marcel monton might sound
trivial but to someone who's not really
comfortable with cold saying create
space story is easier than saying create
open bracket story close bracket
semicolon now so so we thought that
would help integration with ESL and
thirdly sensual visa is an interpreted
language we knew that they were
interpreter interpreters out there which
could talk to the other languages and
this back over here okay so so right now
we're doing somewhat net testing we're
writing it in Ruby but we're using the
the iron Ruby interpreter which actually
talk to doc Nicole so we wanted to
access developer classes either be to
check state or maybe want to use their
daos to generate test data or create
data factories we can do it do it Ruby
so the effect decide at the end of the
day was that this this layer learning
model over here right now it's it's this
okay so we're using a technology called
cucumber I don't know what you're coming
here with it or not so I'll get into it
in a few minutes and basically at the
very bottom right now we're saying two
types of applications or the right there
are websites and there r dot net
applications with
return with you to actually upload story
site so we're using selenium grid to
test the vault hood and we're using an
API called white at an open source API
from from tort works and very loosely
speaking white is like selenium or or
Windows applications it's not as well
supported we've had to do a little
digging around to get to know it but not
its own a job for us doing the job so so
we're go into cucumber fur for a few
minutes and just explain why we chose
this this language so this learning
model over here if you look at the
cucumber that particular that's
equivalent to the BSL level right now
okay so so you look you're actually
looking at the at the bottom three three
levels of our abstraction stack so for
those of you who are not familiar with
cucumber basically it comes from the
camp of behavior driven development
which seems to be gaining popularity
recently and it basically allows you to
create executable tests and plain
English okay so here we have a simple
example which is all the tests which is
tagged as a smoke test and tagged as an
admissions test and so what you do is
press is define a scenario in free text
and we say okay so I'm going to test
scenario where you have an international
user is accessing the the news website
and cucumber comes with a limited number
of keywords basically is given when then
and hand and a few more and basically
you say okay given I am a user outside
the UK when i visit the news website
then i should be redirected to the
international edition and i should see
adverts on the page okay and and this
will turn out to be an executable data
being little cucumber will actually run
this test and it has this the supporting
facility which shows all these steps and
you know the place pastor this app is in
green and the muppets in red and what
this gives us is it gives us a number of
benefits so first of all it gives
amazing visibility so so outside the
engineering team we have the project
managers of other product managers and
when they come to us and ask us for
status when they come to us and ask us
to know what
what sort of testing are you crying out
no we can show them this and we we can
actually have non-technical people that
such as project managers going through
this signing them off the second
advantage it gives us is we can bring
can test analyst or not really
comfortable coding but they are
comfortable writing test scripts and all
that's actually happening is that
instead of writing the mountain in
Microsoft Word or any third party tool
they're just writing it housing cucumber
right and eventually this will turn into
one can make this the other thing which
which helps out here is that so when I
said software engineers are motivated by
technology analyst tend to be motivated
by by by organizing by planning by
strategizing and those sorts of
activities so there's a really important
activity here which which kind of scared
me initially when we're getting of this
technology if you look at the if you
take English as a language and let's
take an example there's a line which
says when i visit the news website there
are dozens of different ways you could
say that right so if you have 10 10 test
series working and they're all writing
the same thing semantically
syntactically they might say when i
visit the news website when i navigate
to the news website when i go to the BBC
news website so there are dozens of ways
you could say this and so we actually
have analysts watch we take ownership of
this and it's something they enjoy doing
and they could say okay so you know if
you want to carry out this semantic task
this is how you take and they take
ownership of it which is great so
eventually this must turn into
executable code right and the way
cucumber works is it uses a mechanism of
regular expressions and you have
something like given and then you you
Billy regular expression given I am a
user outside UK for example as soon as
cucumber encounters that looks for it in
the truth wine and say okay what should
i do know what does this mean and after
a number of examples we found that
people who without technical backgrounds
can actually create this file and what's
more they'll actually enjoy doing it and
they'll enjoy doing it because it's a
technical thing to do but because it
gives them a mechanism
which they can control the vocabulary
and gone through what things mean so so
after a number of examples the this side
of this side of the automated testing is
done handed like non-technical people
completely so so they they fill in these
regular expressions sometimes I have to
rework them because because it can get
more complex than this right so you can
have wild cards in there and you can
have some complex logic so engineers
might look at this later and changed
around a bit but they'll actually fill
this in put in those pending keywords
and those pending keywords show up in a
report at some point and an engineer
will just go in and wire things into the
actual site and that might look
something like this okay so given I am a
user else IDK now do and you talk to a
helper subject and you say set proxy to
international that just says as you know
use the selenium instance which is going
to an international proxy and so again
at this point we're starting to drift
towards towards more cold inside so it's
trying to do it starting to drift into
engineering 33 and this would be a good
point to bring in page objects so at
this point so far I'm just going to go
back a few slides we've been at the top
layer right so will be another cucumber
level and page objects or a technique
which I learned a GTECH surprisingly
enough from Simon Stewart in 2007 when
he was introducing webdriver and
basically old page objects zoo is they
they act as an interface between your
tests and your system so imagine you
have this website over here and you want
to find out what the top story having it
now there are a number of agt to that
one is you could bring up sell a new
instance you could connect and share
some expert of expression and pull out
the information that you need but if you
put an interpolation between the page
object which implements a method which
says top story heading which actually
does this for you it's great because you
can reuse code and it makes things more
maintainable at the end of the way so we
have really creative group of designers
who occasional a cup one morning and say
you know we have this really great idea
let's move things around now let's
change the layout of the site and and if
you have a library of hundreds of tests
you know they're all likely to break so
all you need to do
page objects is just an object page
object and and things will keep working
we've also extended this concept to to
win I apologize for the slide it makes
me feel like I want to throw up
sometimes but basically we've also
adapted it to two windows to.net
applications so we've built a page
object model around the tool with
journalists use to upload stories inside
and you know when you when you delve
into the detail of a page object you
know now you're really in engineering
territory so this is something which
which software engineering take over
know they could be developers they could
be people interesting theme or software
engineers of this what is something
which is purely out of the comfort zone
of analysts we have had instances
there's the simple method down here
click button save or bio test analysis
is so so we go to CSS working but the
note is that method and just copy and
paste it and J change safe to load for
example and see if it worked you know
and most of the time it will and if not
you just put someone over and get to
figs there and then so this has put us
in a situation whereby we have this
abstraction layer this abstraction
approach where people are working on the
same task so we're all working towards a
common goal of automating tests for one
project okay so it's not and then let's
try thing testing Microsoft Word or or
in Excel and then engineers reading
those up and implementing them right so
we're actually writing executable code
written by analysts and what's more
they're doing something they enjoy so
whilst are doing this 30 about test
cases they're thinking about wonder
value and manages it need reader thing
about equivalence classes so it's
something they enjoy the link and as you
as you move down into the shades of ray
you eventually end on pure engineering
theories when people are talking about
variables loops no classes inheritance
and so on and things with me which make
an SCO on at the end of the day so I've
been saying the very stereotyped a lot
so the obvious hanging over our
engineers in there
but using this approach you can always
have you can also have people who are
sometimes float in between again they're
really motivated to do everything and
those people fit in here as well so
there you can put them in at any stage
in the project and either to create some
cucumber script or wiring some some
tests okay yeah this is just a slight I
put in there just sure if you can start
get start to get a bit more complex if
you need to so this is a test from our
suite of its for the weather side and
basically to parameterize that's right
so we can this test basically looks for
a number of posts for weathering a
number of posts codes and the test
involves just put in parameters and then
give a number of examples for each
parameter and your humble actually spawn
is held into multiple tests so on on a
technical level that's where we've got
two so far we're not really looking into
integration testing right now that's a
bit more complex but it's only being
here and we're just you know dealing
with into n tests we've also found the
need to think about process okay so it's
one thing to send people off to a
training course it's another thing to
get them down and trying out of your
examples and you know it's a completely
different thing to commit them to a
project and asking them to to produce or
make the test as a team and to be honest
I'm not going to stand here and lecture
you about process you know sometimes
roses decisions are are specific to your
particular scenarios I'm just going to
go over some generic topics so this is a
figure I pulled out of a book called
Nigel testing and basically it outlines
the different types of tests acharya you
carry out here in the project and one of
the danger is a I was afraid of was that
would be so immersed in the automated
testing side of things that that's we
just follow us up so I showed this slide
regularly to my team until now okay have
you come up with the right strategies
are you covering all of these these
areas so you know so far we've been
talking about tests which are mainly for
them to
the upper left quadrant we are covering
functional tests and storytests and
that's a mixture of manual and automated
tests but we re also interesting about
exploratory testing for example which is
really important in our domain and it
means to be carried out manually and
then you know we also need to think
about performance and load testing and
iLET assessing so that refers to
non-functioning security navigability
and so on um so in the context of just
in the context of automation what's
actually going on right now is so we
take a generic project second iteration
and let's say there's a planning phase a
development phase and the post
development phase the tasks that are go
the activities are going going on in
these of each of these phases are so
first of all in the planning phase we're
doing a lot of talking right so we're
we're test is worth of them to
information architect so that user
journeys to discuss what the terminology
is going to be left test you're talking
to developers and we've been bitten by
this before so which sometimes you know
locked ourselves away in our quiet
corners and just say though ok we're
going to automate this way and we sort
of assume that developers would know
what we talk would know what we're doing
and then magically label all the
components that we need in a particular
convention and we just were everything
in know when you're actually forget I
didn't for this thing so so we actually
talked to develop resources of meetings
that play blink conventions for
component any testing culture might need
we discuss testing approaches and we
found them to be very cooperative some
of them actually contribute to this so
they'll actually come over and volunteer
right test sometimes and that's really
helpful and testers are always talking
also talking amongst themselves at this
point remember you have different people
knowing different tasks wouldn't same
project so so baby basically they're
just talking saying okay I'm gonna write
the Khumbu test and then at some point
I'm going to end up with you and you
need to get it done 21 and ideally by
the end of the planning phase we usually
try to have a number of you come by
tester them at lee said the acceptance
is level okay and this all ties into the
first section which we describe
which is the defining goat success looks
like and by having a cucumber test
define that this level it means we've
actually talked to product managers
we're in agreement as as the water
actually expecting from this product at
the end of the day and it gives us a
focus and it's also have developers to
focus in in the development stage we're
still talking okay so people are
checking what user stories are in play
which ones are nearing completion what
tasks in doing within testing cooks
having been inserted and we're doing a
lot of manual testing okay so with wise
development is going on to be honest we
always release the first iteration of a
feature doing manual testing because
that's because the system is still it's
a volatile at that point so it's not
really worth writing in automated tests
and if you do if you test manually at
this point it's actually faster okay if
we have time we do start writing some
automated tests and wearing things in
hey but most of the time we just test
manually with words release okay the
value of automated test the waters in
the regression type of things in the
post development phase we're still
talking discussing what went wrong what
the high risk areas are what's
outstanding and at this point what's
important is we need to get all the
tests automated now so let me give
Engineering's in there and they need to
wire everything in you know we try to
strive for zero cause regression test
which which is really a met at this
point what we're trying to go towards it
and if you imagine these iterations
being stacked in a sort of staircase
like fashion at this point the analysts
have moved on to the planning phase of
the next iteration so they're creating
Hugh come with us for the next iteration
so so that's basically it if I were to
give you four key messages from the
stock it would be that no contrary to my
belief before I started working here
engineers and analysts have
complementary motivations you know it's
not some case of someone being superior
over the other non-technical people who
can contribute to automation directly if
you will then the right for them and the
right motivations and basically we
believe that this approach is actually
better so we were forced into this
before because of our particular
situation
restarting to see benefits from it which
which I didn't see another company so
there were situations before where I you
know you'd have this really cool
automated test harness it up you release
the system being tested by hundreds of
tests and the first 10 year old touch
the keyboard will break it now mainly
because the the people involved in the
project were justice engineers and you
know they had that sort of training
motivational curve and they paid too
much attention to the technical side of
their work and not enough attention with
strategizing point of that work and one
thing that's become painfully obvious is
no invest time and effort in
communication so be it within your
testing name itself being talking to
developers because you need their help
in automation and there are loads of
questions we need to which need to be
asked beforehand such as know what
happens if this breaks who's going to
fix it in this scenario knowing you need
to set up all these processes so
communication is really important um so
sometimes that's basically it if you
have any questions that we have it take
them
whoo thank you when I saw that example
of Cacambo test right in a little bit
human speaking language I'm biblically
think that is another test in fact that
is the requirement yes sorry it is
requirement basically it does everything
at the the cucumber tests actually
doubles for requirement white doubles
sorry no no it's not double requirements
that programmed is when I am from
outside UK I should be somewhere exact
yes and that the thing which should be
fix it righton and agreed by the whole
team maybe before we start development
at all yes so it's a good place to store
your requirements before starting
development in before starting testing
yes and that means you can have your
caramels easily converted to tests
before in the time when you start maybe
mockingly prototyping up objects and
well development is not completely and
that you can have a lot of tests already
automate it isn't so so you can have a
lot of tests already automated that you
set up the the right right communication
advanced so if you need to click on a
button somewhere then you need to assume
that that button is going to have a
particular ID for example just take a
simple simple example and so yes in
theory that should happen we're not at
that stage yet so when many cases will
we tied up a lot with multiple projects
so we did with a number i believe about
something like 60 engineers and testing
theme varies between seven and 12 we
bring in some temporary workers
sometimes so so we're not really in that
situation yet but what he a
theoretically should be good my mind is
a combination of a question in a comment
first of all I want to say thank you so
much for presenting this because you've
basically given real life validation and
blueprint of something that I've been
trying to put in place for the last one
year so as a form i might argue and
maybe ask you a favor to fly out to
dubai come to my company and give these
one more time ago after trying to
convince them it is possible for us to
get to automate things without
necessarily having to bring whole new
team of automated and you know utilize
what we already have in place second one
is following up on tomorrow's about
using cucumber and I just thought the
same thing that he did because you can
you can do two things you can clean up
your requirements which is a big problem
with getting people to all of it and
let's talk about one thing developers
talk about something else and it's a
there's a gap in the twin this is
helping to bridge that my question is
how how did you get this whole
conversation started because I've been
banging my head against the wall for the
longest time to try and show people that
there's a common ground and we will be
able to actually use it is there any
tips you can give me another nice flying
you out to Dubai and saying okay here's
a guy who is doing you know exactly what
I'm talking about before exactly and the
fact that it's the BBC case closed in my
opinion so when many cases is just a
matter of persistence and just being the
annoying person who is constantly
bothering your line managers and saying
we should be doing this we should be
doing this no it took a year to get this
point which to be honest is not really
very far so there's only so much you can
do using cucumber because once you start
getting into the finer level of detail
let's say you want to know test
individual components and instead of
just tend to enter know how are we going
to achieve that now so it's a huge
challenge so this is just the tip of the
iceberg but we just proceed this as the
the thing that would give us most value
and the quickest way basically and how
we chose these technologies that we did
it was mainly experimentation and lots
of research on did someone just yank
your chain and said you know make a
decision and just say okay Ruby cucumber
and let's go for it no you have to lie
yeah if I can well I have a few ideas
maybe a few guesses on how things are
done um let me let me ask a question I
go to level above those tests you don't
get your requirements in cucumber you
don't get them in in that form you need
to write the cucumber script yes how do
you trace back to your requirement so
that's a tricky question because every
project has its own way of working so
they not they don't only get to choose
their technologies they get to choose
their processes well and so the tendency
is that we use tools like mingle for
example which actually organizes your
user stories and or even we use we write
stories in Word there's section on the
bottom it says you know what are your
acceptance tests and in many cases you
know cucumber doesn't really have its
own soup like that's the way users so
easily acceptances should wear them so
their focus on the value which the user
story will deliver they focus on the
preconditions and you know what should
happen and and that's it so at most the
traceability is you just a case of
syntax so so you might have an argument
there which as you know we should just
start writing requirements should come
just come from there which i think is
part of the month of behavior during was
a behavior driven development well the
basic argument is you only need you only
want to change in one place not into
because sooner or later they're gonna
they're gonna go apart and you're gonna
have inconsistencies between either your
test case for your requirement so the
only problem over there is that with a
user story don't you don't just
really get that so you might get to
design outlines wireframes and one so
there's a lot of information which goes
into every feature now so if you come
back on storyline it's impossible and
what's the cost of it all of it and
woman in my class I mean to go from your
requirement to a cucumber script to
integrate it into your continuing
education system and I using it for
regressions like thumbs number so so
there's this thing called an automation
hump I don't know whether you're afraid
of it so if you map out the effort you
need to go through when you're just
starting out of the mating no there's a
huge of effort in the beginning and just
something you build up a critical mass
of expertise and methodologies and tools
into one and we're currently in the very
steep part of that so we've done a lot
of work but but it says slow moving so
the costs right now is very high at some
point you reach the point where you have
enough enough libraries in place and
enough trained up people and they start
becoming practically free no cheap the
longer the project the more you get yeah
and remember we work on on a limited
number of sites so most of the things we
do can be reused in oil futures well so
the concept of having stories will never
change for us so so we can reuse
you
alright we've done not quite not look
quite as effectively but done similar
things with the fits you know to the
previous generation and one of the
things we found was important it's this
distinguished between fit as oh you know
in this case cucumber as describing
requirements and then proper testing
because find if you put the two together
you end up with this this boat anchor
with this these incredibly detailed
specs econ changed the slightest thing
without the whole thing falling over
okay so as only if you have any
comparable experience yet no we haven't
so we serve the point where we were
meeting acceptance tests honor on a
really high level so luckily uh the
domain in which work doesn't really lend
itself to a little no data boundary
analysis for example so we don't really
have complex inputs so it works for us
so if you have a complex form for
example I can't imagine that being
automated in cucumber that's something
where you need to bring bring an
engineer's all or find another solution
now what we don't really we haven't
really come across that yet yeah hi um
you mentioned during the talk that
you're not writing the tests along with
the Cody riding the test you're only
doing regression tests you're only doing
this automated system progression test
purposes how are you dealing with your
able you're obviously able to produce
more features more quickly than you can
write tests to cover those features and
I'm interested to know how you came to
the conclusion that testing features as
they released manually is quicker then
then then writing tests for them as you
develop the features so so so yes oh so
it's quicker from a stakeholders point
of view right because if someone is
waiting for a system to be developed and
developers say we're done and it's just
in testing and we're saying you know
we're not done we need to write to go
make tests first I'm from a stakeholders
point of view it's quicker justice it
manually and get it done so your
question is more to do with
so vine this video question correctly is
do we find that it would get to the
point where the backlog is so large that
you know we can't deal with it anymore
so I have to I'm sorry after a penis but
we really haven't been in the situation
for so long so most of this much you
achieved over the past two or three
months so we will actually try we've
actually tried up on small scale project
and only now we're just starting it up
on a really huge project which is a
project leading up to release of major a
launch of the site next it's here and we
we hopefully hopefully it'll work but
we'll have more results links here
basically this is whistling pioneer area
for our particular context do you have a
link between the requirement
requirements specified in cucumber and
the extra cold so it if later you if you
have some bug in your code can go back
to the requirement or the other way
around if you know a specific
requirement can you you know which
pieces of code is related to this or
implementing this requirement that's
very interesting so you're saying if
something goes wrong in a particular
line of code where can we just trace it
back to a requirement Terry no I'm sure
you can in some way maybe combining it
with your source control tool and
putting some process in place but so far
those two things live in different words
get three okay I have a question about
the reliability of the tests when you
and how reliable do you find these tests
like if you run them lots of times do
you spend a lot of time having to fix
them up so on the website side of things
yes a very reliable because muscle kind
which I can users here in English in
function of a deal some limited dynamic
aspect
there isn't much that can go wrong over
there and unless you know no more time
we have set exciting place with some
dynamic components so yes you'll find
them very arrival now we found that to
work on the.net side of things we were
really learning from that so the
developers in that particular team are
introduced to test automation so they
tend to change things around without
thinking about testing and things would
Rick knowing one of the problems we've
encountered is once you have an on
taking the person working on this now
and he goes for all of a sudden see the
stack trace know how does he know what
to do so so that's something we're
leaving but on the website side of
things you know that they network brick
ok yeah so kind of a follow-up question
on that so when the website layout
changes how do you deal with the changes
to the required changes to the web
object sorry page object do you have
some normal TDD practices there you have
not run a regression shoot just buddy
bedrooms are sore so what you do is you
ask an engineer to look at it and then
just fix it there and then ok so
essentially it's like the presidentÃ­s
for us yeah ok bucket until it works
yeah a good but usually we know in
advance cause our design team have
really solid process in place and web
wireframes way in advance of the change
uh how do you best flash related objects
do you have any particular tool yes it's
called the manual tester so so yeah so
so I've looked into this there is a way
which you could test objects flash
objects with selenium I am until you
manage to do this year I mean I've seen
an example online which basically
involves changing colors on a box or
something obvious ooh three use it on
another video player for example the
problem is that when it comes to our
flash objects they're usually things
like video players and you know moving
weather maps which you know aside from
checking but the play button works I
don't really know what is you can do in
order to verify that the video is very
incorrectly
no so we haven't already really gotten
to that point yet what did I take it
right that before starting the
automation project you decided about the
criteria of this for the success of
automation in general is that so so the
probe the project in general not just
automation but the SEC holder is usually
get together and say you know at the end
of this project we need people to be
able to probe Formula One online these
particular scenarios should be able to
happen and as a testing thing we try and
say okay then for more point of view
this this would result in fifty percent
you know regression tests in place in
swimming yes so in other words how do
you understand that your automation
efforts are effective are considering
the maintenance efforts things like that
so so I'm going to keep putting this
card on my heart but this is your new
for us so right now going from zero to
having one automated test is huge no so
so we really not at the point yet where
we can say we have hundreds of tests and
the charge the site has been changing or
the past few months and they said you
know would be maintaining it or
everything's falling apart no we've
picked I said we've picked a set of
tools in the process which we we think
will work for us we've yet to be proven
right or wrong so this has literally
mature than the past few weeks so we
were just starting to use it out in
practice and another question that also
already has been formulated a few times
but once again what about the changes of
the design Wow their page elements
change their location and the scenarios
changes you make it right that you
mentioned that you somehow organized
your tests so that
be prepared to such changes is that
right and what what exactly how you
design the test so that so if effect on
the contest so we do this through page
objects right and so there's a
considerable amount of time that has to
policy between a designer having an idea
and that I they are being deployed like
the website so let's say whether a
method which the the you know there's
the third methods called other top
stories which basically returns an array
of the other top stories section on the
site which is this area right over here
okay so right now that might involve
clearing creating the page for
particular export location and then
looking for particular child elements
and formulating a merry now if a
designer were tomorrow morning say we're
going to change those other stories and
we're going to have them horizontally
across the top of the page we first get
wireframes and then there's actually a
process which caused user testing where
we actually go to the public and take a
sample and say you know do you prefer
this over that so there's a whole
process here we eventually get our wire
frames and by the time developers get
around implementing it with you will
already have changed so we've not have
we actually been in the situation yet
bottom I'm not worried about still good
work
at the start you said about say it would
be a disaster if in the middle of the
formula one or the world cup the just
dropped all together all these tests are
really automated functional tests I
wonder if you had any automated non
functional tests at a load or
performance or garden plans so so right
now the things like performance testing
security this thing that's carried out
by my architect and it's also we also
hedge against at using infrastructure so
for example I've come to live streams we
actually outsource to content delivery
networks like Akamai's so at that point
we've actually pushed the responsibility
out to them and or and their minimum
level of service not all so that's a
label which we deal with it and here you
know websites are not good are usually
hosted in on multiple server farms it
was the UK so it's not something that
really worries us a lot what there are
