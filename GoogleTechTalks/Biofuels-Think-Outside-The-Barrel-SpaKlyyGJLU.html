a tremendous skeptic of this whole
concept is I notice many of you are were
on misc until maybe about eight months
ago or so when I talked to the note and
actually also to Richard Branson and
other folks who I guess richard has the
unfortunate issue of buying about a
billion dollars worth of jet fuel every
year and he feels bad about it and
burning it all of course and as far as
you can tell the best way for them to
actually make off for that that fuel
usage is to really aggressively go after
production of ethanol and I know I'm
sure no one will tell you much more than
I can't have a subject but I'm now much
more believer in this is a very
important thing to really deeply
understand and we have the world expert
on it here today
what you have a full house here I'm
going to assume and those of you who
know something about ethanol will mirror
me as I talk to some of the basics but
i'll try and not do too much time on
basics i will tell you upfront not
everything's right to that now but on
the whole that trade-offs are
overwhelmingly in favor of fat now and i
hope we can get into it when we do Q&amp;amp;A
and we'll try and leave enough time for
Q&amp;amp;A i will move through this very very
quickly the larger version of this this
is about 130 slide presentation i'm not
going to go through all those slides but
there's enough detail on my website that
anybody who's interested can go through
it so let me start with some basic
assertions I don't think of ethanol as
an alternative view I think gasoline
should be the alternative fuel that we
extend twenty percent of our needs we
definitely don't need hydrogen we can
come back and talk about it in my view
we don't need new car engines designs
distribution systems and this is the
surprising part hopefully I'll convince
you in less than five years we can at
very little cost make an irreversible
change in our trajectory that's my goal
today with little cost to consumers
little cost to automakers and no money
for the Gulf from the government that
sounds fairly impossible but hopefully
you'll be convinced soon so obviously
you know this is typical gas pump in
Brazil so why do I think this
implausible thing is actually at least
plausible Brazil in three years without
subsidies driven strictly by consumer
demand has gone from four percent of all
new cars being flex-fuel cars to eighty
percent last month that's in three years
Detroit here talks about nothing can be
done in less than 15 it's the same
companies GM and VW or the big suppliers
Ford has a big presence there they've
replaced forty percent of their
petroleum use already we talked about
doing something by 2040 or 2050 all of
us in the technology business know how
ridiculous it is to forecast past about
three to five years but here is the
fundamental reason forget taxes forget
subsidies just say what is the cost of
production the production cost of a
gallon of gasoline is about a buck 60 a
gallon the production costs per gallon
of ethanol is about 75 cents a gallon
it's actually probably under 70 cents
for the more efficient producers in
Brazil there's a lot of older plants you
add about a 25-percent added to that
because you get lower mileage on a per
mile driven basis ethanol maybe costs 90
cents for a gallon equivalent of
gasoline it's cheaper that's why
consumers are demanding it and they
won't buy cars that provide bull in fact
it's gotten to the point where in the
10th largest car market in the world VW
one the largest makers is thinking of
not making any more gasoline only cars
if that's happening I think we should be
paying attention that's caught my
attention and alike here Brazilian at
now as a dramatic reduction in
greenhouse gases in fact a dramatic
reduction in pollutants soon we can come
back to that and they've saved over 50
billion dollars in imports for an
economy their size imagine what we can
say we spend 250 billion dollars a year
importing oil hopefully you believe if
they can do it it's at least plausible
if not possible how do I think it's
possible is the surprise is 5 million of
these cars in the USA
and that number may not mean much much
but in fact is almost as many flex-fuel
cars here in California today on the
roads as there's diesel vehicles almost
as many about seventy percent of the
number of diesel vehicle and we don't
have any 85 pumps we don't have for the
first time a chicken and egg problem do
we get the cause do we get the fuel
retinols there the the cars are there we
just don't have any distribution because
the oil companies won't do it even in
the US and this is a conservative number
ethanol costs about most of the plans I
look at have numbers like 90 cents a
gallon to produce something like a buck
20 a gallon for an equivalent gallon of
gasoline and I often speak in terms of
gasoline equivalent gallons because the
mileage differences compared to any
price you can imagine for gasoline
probably down to 35 dollars a barrel for
gasoline ethanol is cheaper and this is
cost to cost no subsidies no taxes and I
think we should treat them at least
equally if not give a carbon credit or
ethanol and we have a four billion
gallon a year industry that's growing
about twenty-five percent a year already
so the pump is primed and it costs not a
maker about thirty dollars more to make
a gasoline car into a flex-fuel car
capable of taking either fuel so Wyatt
no because it's today's cars today's
liquid fuel infrastructure the same
tankers you can use the same tanks in
most cases that are in the pumps today
leverages the current trends you can
have flex-fuel cars that are already out
there you can make it a flex-fuel
hydrate and we already have the
infrastructure what else
no matter what your point of view and
this is what makes it very plausible if
you only hear about a cheaper fuel and
ethanol is the answer if you care about
national security energy security
geopolitics then ethanol is the answer
in the ex-director of the CIA Jim
Woolsey is one of the most vocal
advocates of this only from the energy
security and geopolitics point of view
if you're Tom Daschle and only care
about farm incomes then in fact this is
the right answer and they're a very
powerful political group in the US and
if you're the NRDC or the Union
concerned scientists they are in favor
of this too so it's very rarely that you
see the automakers and environmentalists
and the farm guys in the
neoconservatives all agreeing on the
same thing I've listed everybody except
the oil companies I'll get to that so
you know this is sort of my way of
getting people a little bit mad do we
want to feed Mideast terrorism or
Midwest farmers I think it's very clear
to me which I prefer do we want to
import expensive gasoline or cheaper at
now and we don't let we don't import gas
ethanol today even though it's
dramatically tiver so we have an
internationally low price product oil
competing with a domestic protected
market with a high price and it's still
cheaper imagine if you opened it up do
we want to create more farm jobs or
Mideast cycles or fossil fuels or green
fuels and Wendy came up with the vendee
spread came out with one of the best
slogans I like to use let's put the
fossil in fossil fuels that's what we
need I will get to do we need on viral
drugs or prairie grass fields that's the
choice we have
I won't spend any time on this but it's
obvious that flex fuel cards give you
choice for almost no cost and Adlai by
the way a presentation I saw from DM
about three weeks ago said a hybrid and
I love hybrid stairs don't get me wrong
for about three thousand dollars of
incremental cost may save 50 to 75
gallons of fuel a year a flex for your
car for thirty dollars will save 300
gallons of petroleum or gasoline you
know the answer is pretty obvious you
will hear a number like a hundred
dollars extra for a flex-fuel car they
include the cost of a sensor that they
need to meet EPA requirements anyway but
because they're lobbying for extra
incentives in Washington to make
flex-fuel cars they like to jack up that
number I've looked at it carefully it's
thirty dollars and if they amortize all
their one-time testing it adds another
ten dollars to the cost of a flex-fuel
car this is charter came up and again
you pick your issue on the left hand
side and say I only care about the cost
per mile or I only care about the
environmental costs and say how does oil
compared with hydrogen compared with
biofuels and I won't spend too much time
but to say at least you can disagree in
degree but no matter how you do this
yard it's pretty obvious what the answer
is especially if your goal is to line up
all the political interests to actually
make it feasible now what's right is
different than what's feasible so
how do we go if you agree with me so far
we went from impossible to plausible
maybe do possible now the question is
how do we make it probable to answer
that you say what are all the reasons it
might not happen interest groups land
use do we have enough land does it have
the right energy balance does it have
the right emission profile and then the
most important thing in my view or you
kick start this effort so where do the
interest groups stack up I've already
talked about auto makers and in fact GM
has now decided fortunately that hybrids
got associated with Toyota and they need
their branding to be flex fuel so I
suspect you will see them be very very
aggressive in fact they've shared their
2007 model your plans with me and
therefore in excess of any regulatory
requirements let me just say that much
they've been going to be very aggressive
that's why they had the live green go
yellow calm website that they advertised
in the Olympics the agricultural
interests it's obvious more income less
pressure on subsidies they have this WT
air pressure on subsidies they like this
opportunity a lot the environmental
groups are very supportive of this you
know the oil companies are not today but
the progressive bonds are actually being
aggressive about it the most advanced
research on cellulosic ethanol is being
funded by shall the CEO of BP is
completely committed to biofuels and he
realizes that not only do we have
climate crisis on our hand and for all
of you who I've stopped referring to
this as a climate change or global
warming it's a climate crisis but more
importantly the only place place like BP
and shell can find oil now is
making deals with the dictators in in in
Nigeria or the despots in Sudan in their
their business risk profile is so high
that the more advanced ones are starting
to look at this fairly seriously and for
distribution it's a new opportunity I
can't imagine a better opportunity for
Walmart than to put an ethanol pump in
every single Walmart because not because
they want to be green and they do they
have a green plan but because they want
everybody to drive their car there it's
in their interest it's traffic so what
do I recommend and I'll come back to
this in fact I'm going to skip through
this and say there is something in it
for everybody no matter who you are
there's something to win and so it's
time for this grand compromise which
I've been proposing so let me go to
remedies how can we actually get from
here to what is clearly a viable
solution what does it take and I call
them page 1 recommendations in page to
page 1 recommendations which I think get
us most of the way there and will
irreversibly make this trajectory happen
put us on this pad don't take any money
so what are these things require that
seventy percent of new cars we flex-fuel
cars and I pick seventy percent for
fairly technical reasons we can go more
into it we and this is something GM is
already doing ship a yellow gas cap to
all the people who do have flex fuel
cars so they know they have won 99
percent of the people who own such a
card if you own a Ford Taurus look in
the manual there's a reasonable chance
it's a flex-fuel car if you own a Ford
150 f150 you probably own a flex for
your car at least certain engine models
and I'm suggesting we actually provide
them incentives to cover more than their
thirty dollar cost
and DM likes this idea a lot except they
don't like to be required and i'll tell
you why required word is important
require e85 ethanol distribution at ten
percent of the gas stations that's a
pretty small number remember eat gas
station has six to eight pups now I'm
saying ten percent of the gas stations
which means two to three percent of the
pumps offer ethanol and I even go
further because politically it's not
acceptable to put pressure on the really
small operator to say if you own more
than 25 stations in the country you
convert ten percent of them to have at
least one pup and the last one is to
legislate cheap oil tax for praise price
stabilization purposes what do I mean by
that I was in Davos in january and i
gave this pitch and the vice-chairman of
a large national oil company came up to
me and said if you do this we'll drop
the price of oil and all that null
producers will go out of business you
actually had the gall to threaten me so
I came up with my next recommendation it
was easy we put a price floor if oil
drops below forty dollars a barrel we
charge attacks such that it stays at 40
we're at 35 or 40 it's somewhere in
there that we need support against price
manipulation so we don't get manipulate
and what I propose we do it every time
price goes below that level you use the
money we are collecting as a catch to
build up extraordinary so back high we
can stabilize the price so it's just
really a price I call it a contingent
tax or price stabilization only it's not
really attacks by the way none of the US
Energy Information Administration
forecasts predict or getting them to
anywhere near that level on its own so
the only reason it would
there is because of price manipulation
what does this do these three things
none of which take very much money
except this gas pump idea from the oil
companies and the number is trivial I
calculated that you could do California
with a few hours of extra profits last
year you can do all of California for a
few hours with the profits they make
about a hundred million a day every day
365 days a year in profit so if you do
these you give investors the confidence
that the cause will be there the oil
companies won't get in the way of
distribution and I'm not requiring
ninety percent of the pumps ten percent
because that's all you need reach
criticality and that you won't be
subject to price manipulation that will
give Wall Street enough confidence to do
the rest it will invest in the plants
even with the distortions like the
import tax I believe everything will
happen despite those things my page two
recommendations are things that will
help if you have a new technology for
cellulosic ethanol and I'll get into
this a little bit more today most
ethanol in this country is produced from
corn which is not very green it's about
a twenty percent reduction in greenhouse
gases a moderate reduction if you want
to get to eighty percent you want to
make it from agricultural waste or
biomass those technologies can't get
financed to build plants because these
typical plans for 100 million dollars
and you can get Wall Street funding
project funding funny you can get the
risk equity funding quite easy for these
plants but you can get the traditional
private egg project funding to prove out
any new technology with a loan guarantee
that you can charge for allow I know
I've jumped around apologize allow
imports of foreign ethanol tax rate
above the RFS standard
now I would like to allow imports tax
free period but we have mandated a
standard minimum amount of ethanol used
in this country in the last energy bill
last year all I'm saying is at least a
lot and all imports above that minimum
standard tax free because demand is
expected to be at that standard and I
think that will make a huge difference
we have subsidies for all kinds of crops
there's tremendous w to your pressure to
get rid of those subsidies if we are
going to have subsidies and never a fan
of subsidies at least let's use it for
something that helps with the transition
so switch those subsidies to energy
crops the farmer cares about his income
not which cop he gets it from the other
thing and this is the typical kind of
thing that creates a market distortion
ethanol has a subsidy but the farmer
doesn't get any of it what I heard is
well past midnight when this was being
debated in the conference committee the
oil companies inserted two words into
the language calling this ethanol
subsidy of blenders credit so the person
who is blending it with gasoline gets it
or two billion dollars of it last year
was collected by the oil refineries like
they needed more money it's unfortunate
but that's how the political system
works and I talked to one of the
Senators aides who was in the conference
room they said now it gets to one end
they're still negotiating and all guys
are willing to stay there and everybody
said okay let's agree let's go home it's
unfortunate I've also suggested if we
can't get rid of that not subsidy which
I believe be sure we do not need the
subsidy for these plants to make tons of
money for that and at any expected price
of oil in the next 25 years
given the forecast but if the former's
are going to insist on having it I'd
rather it be a subsidy that goes to the
form of produced ethanol or the plant
that produced it only to build more
ethanol capacity in this country so at
least we have expanding about capacity
if you're going to do a subsidy it's
sort of the lesser of two evils the
other thing today the automakers have
this big issue with cafe standards which
I personally happen to Michael the
environmentalists think they should be
increased automakers think they should
be good grades what everybody can
increase even the environmentalists is
let's switch them to at least call them
petroleum my legs not mileage so if you
can if you if the automaker's encourage
more ethanol or renewable fuel use
whether it's through hydrates or any
other reason and the amount of petroleum
required to drive the average model in
the United States goes down then they
get benefit of that so you line up
incentives now I'm not going to go
through all of these given that I'm this
is my personal forecast of what we can
do the yellow line is demand in the US
as it is growing today which is going
about 2% again if we do some
conservation measures demand can come
down to one percent wrote that's the
light blue ride the dark blue line is
the amount of ethanol I believe we can
produce in this country without any
imports if we just ramped up capacity at
a slower rate and capacity is ramping up
today I'm assuming in that a ten percent
increase in capacity for the next ten
year I'm sorry twenty percent a year
increase in capacity it's increasing
faster than that today and for the last
two or three years and then it moderates
down to fifteen percent and then to ten
percent a year and the purple line is
the gasoline equivalent gallons
so we can eliminate most of our
petroleum gears and definitely all of
our petroleum imports but where at least
cars and light trucks and diesel is a
slightly different issue biodiesel is
the way to talk about that in less than
25 years people find it surprising but
there's more detailed model behind this
that goes into how many acres can be put
into biomass production on the gallons
of ethanol and we get per ton I've
talked to the best plant biologists in
the country to say how many acres of
yield can they get per acre how many
tons can they get per acre so there's a
sophisticated model behind it the
spreadsheet of for this is on my website
so you can change your assumptions it's
in this long presentation after the end
so the other issue is land use the NRDC
I said we need 114 million acres with a
set of assumptions and I'll give you a
reference the Jim Woolsey George Shultz
estimated 60 million acres my estimate
is about 55 million acres because I
actually assumed technology makes a
difference and we don't stay still and
then there's other sources of het nog
from municipal waste from forests
innings from animal waste I actually
know somebody who's taking stuff hog
shed and actually trying to make ethanol
from it today and by the way sixty
percent of the agricultural land in this
country is not meant for human food it's
for animal feed sixty percent it's far
more corn in your meat aisle than your
poor not by a lot and one other word the
last line is direct synthesis there's a
number of people and I don't include
this in any of my forecast there's some
clever ways to use a new field called
synthetic biology to do address the
energy problems now these are really
really important I will only give you
one example of what that kind of
technology
you can do a professor in Berkeley chose
a malaria drug autumn ism that cost
about a hundred times more than people
in Africa could afford he used synthetic
biology techniques to design brand-new
metabolic pathways that didn't exist in
cells and you collaborating with a
company we had invested in that's a
synthetic gene synthesis company to
produce this malaria drug and they're
still in the process in fact they've
gotten this whole project has gotten 42
million dollars from the Gates
Foundation to get malaria at a price
that exact set of technologies can be
applied to the energy problem and are
not in any forecast you see as a
technology estimate I like to at least
think about them if not included so
there's multiple approaches I'm sorry I
screwed up my presentation in sequence
but there's multiple approaches to
address land you can take the approach
we can take currently managed lands and
use biomass from that you can say
there's export lands there's well over a
hundred and thirty million acres of land
that is used strictly for food exports
that they can use to reduce oil imports
and a fraction of that would be
sufficient there's crop rotation schemes
many of these biomass things are in fact
recommended as good agricultural
practice because when you grow corn you
reduce you have topsoil loss and you
don't want that so these are great
rotation crops that enrich the soil with
carbon there's 40 million acres of land
in this country that we pay farmers not
to grow any food on today every single
day for the last few decades then
there's dedicated intensive energy crops
that's the way I think it will go and
here's the best one I love this one if
you think about it
the Mid Western prairies for all about
feeding animals hundreds of years ago in
fact when you grow things like
switchgrass that's what the animals fed
on hundreds of years ago and today if
you made cellulose from switchgrass your
by-product should be all that animal
protein so we can do both p dollar
animals and for our food and produce
fuel for our college from the same land
at the same time from the same
environmentally great crops so this is
just a set of recommendations is a do a
study on this then our DC this growing
energy report I'd highly recommend to
anybody who's interested I won't go
through that this is the conclusion of
the do e report this is the last
paragraph from about 150 page report
says we have enough biomass without any
change in agricultural practices that's
a hundred and thirty billion gallons a
year that's one year of miscanthus
clothes on while doing that it does two
other things it takes all the nutrients
puts them in the soil not in the plan so
you don't have to replenish the
nutrients the essential nutrients it
also not only puts carbon into the plant
it puts it into the soil also so the
soil is richer you harvest it by cutting
it off and it grows again next year and
the today these are at between 10 to 12
tons per acre you get two tons or three
tons of corn per acre every plant
biologists are taught to who's serious
says we could probably approach 40 to 50
tons per acre at that level we need 30
or 40 million acres to feed our whole
country even with the demand growth
there is a reference here that would go
into all the details of this crap
including what yields they
have today and what would constitute a
great energy cup because you don't want
this monoculture of one plant covering
everything though the prairie grasses
did pretty well I won't go through this
but the economics of this today we need
subsidies because over a ten-year cost
basis farmers actually net lose money
that's why they have subsidies this
actually generates far more income
that's the last line and it has great
field characteristics nutrient
characteristics sweet grass is not a
crop dramatically better dramatically
more biodiversity dramatically more
richest soils and again high potential
for production of animal food with the
few i won't go through these but that's
another professor leland that Dartmouth
has done the study on producing biomass
from currently managed lands and I list
all these approaches because different
people like different philosophies and I
say pick your favorite one you can do it
any of these waves this sort of a fun
slide if we turned the state of South
Dakota I sort of think of South Dakota
is short disposable it would become the
third largest oil equivalent producer in
the world by itself at very modest you
notice I use in fact this is from a
company called saris which big does
plant genetics at 15 tons an acre if you
get to 45 it's bigger than Saudi Arabia
there's plenty of land I'm not going to
spend any time on it the economics work
for the farmer biomass generates more
income at less invested costs than
either on or we because it has to work
for the farmer if you had a hundred
million acres under the same set of
assumptions you'd be discovering it be
the equivalent of discovering one new XR
and all their proven reserves every 10
years okay so the next question see how
I'm doing for time I should speed up a
little bit energy balance and corn
ethanol at 1.22 1.8 times the energy out
compared to energy end and that's not
petroleum that's fossil energy by the
way petroleum is point eight so corn
ethanol is about twice as good as
petroleum because they always forget to
mention that petroleum doesn't produce a
unit of energy out for every unit of
energy in this transportation there's
refining there's all those costs from
norm corn ethanol sugarcane today in
Brazil as a text to energy are in this
assumes you still make fertilizers the
old fashioned way from petroleum you may
pesticide the old fashioned way you
don't change any of that and depending
upon which cellulosic ethanol technique
you use and this assumes you keep using
fossil fuels not biomass to heat your
provide the heat for your defining
processing this is an argonne national
lab study and since it's hard to read
that's electricity at point four five
energy balance petroleum at porn 81 coal
at point nine eight corn ethanol at 1.38
using one set of techniques in 1.78
another way at cellulosic ethanol at
10.3
this is a great study on the energy
balance for those of you are interested
not only that the full computer model is
on the website you can download it you
can change the assumptions and run the
model for yourself and say if I assume
something different what happens I'm not
going to spend any time on it this this
will be on my website this is the
petroleum and fossil fuel reduction
benefits this is fossil energy used in
cellulosic ethanol in porn at non this
is reduction of petroleum so again let
me skip ask this this is
self-explanatory and part of their argon
model but the important thing is the
conclusions it says it's not even a
meaningful thing to measure and that's
where we should stop there's a
researcher called pimentel who spread a
reverse different notion by the way he's
an entomologist not a energy researcher
every other study has proven that this
that reached at research is wrong this
is the NRDC data they have a wonderful
report called ethanol energy well spent
it shows all the studies in the one
study that goes above the input costs is
this pimentel stubby but they forget to
mention that gasoline is even higher
than that even above their pimentel
study this is the amount of energy in
versus out for cellulosic again multiple
researchers there's a great science
article in January this year on this
also by Professor Kaman at UC Berkeley
but here's sort of the NRDC conclusion
I'll let you read it that won't repeat
it environmental issues again the garden
model this is greenhouse gas reductions
i love this model because they actually
post the model and you can read on it
with your own assumptions and you can
characterize each process differently
because each ethanol plant is different
by the way that energy balance goes from
1.5 to 3 if you burn biomass to distil
your ethanol at the end of your process
instead of using at their natural gas
that simple process step changes it to
three times which I know some people are
actually doing so these are greenhouse
gas reductions again for cellulosic
ethanol on the right-hand side and then
corn ethanol using wet mill processes
corn at now withdraw mail processes I
won't go through all of it this is
actual emission levels of e 85 and
gasoline for a 2005 ford taurus in 2005
mercedes-benz on almost every metric and
definitely overall he 85 Jesus good now
why is this confusing ethanol has a
characteristic in I'm happy to go into
the details that as you add ethanol to
gasoline certain emissions especially
evaporative emissions go up and so when
you have five percent ethanol and
gasoline to replace MTB it's actually
pretty good you get much about ten
percent and emissions actually increase
in Brazil for regular gasoline uses
twenty percent at night and for ethanol
uses one hundred percent at now so then
the people who don't like ethanol always
point to e 20 which we've never
considered using it this country and say
it increases the missions that's the
kind of fat they create when e five is
better than gasoline and e85 is much
better than gasoline this is actual data
from the California Air Resources Board
this is the communication i got from the
NRDC I won't spending time it
fundamentally says 85 is great and more
importantly all the reasons to not like
that now many of them were probably
valid 20 years ago and some people still
like to use them that's a sword reminds
me of how long the tobacco companies
went on saying the smoking doesn't cause
cancer or at least you can't prove it I
see almost exactly the same thing
happening here again so everything I've
said is assuming no significant progress
in technology and that there's lots of
ways technology can improve things
starting my presentation sequences I've
spoken to some of it in fact this is one
of my favorite quotes from the editor of
science magazine in 1988 and I think we
are this is not only about Aetna but
fundamentally the way we manufacture
chemicals will change if all times I
gave you the example of this malaria
drug you will see that repeated over and
over again because there is not a better
way to manufacture things and that's to
copy what nature learnt a lot long time
ago oops do you know I
so today we have corn at now I think
cellulosic ethanol is coming you know
during the Second World War when Hitler
couldn't get oil he used gasification at
all but there's no reason you can't gas
by biomass in fact those technologies
are almost ready to then there's algae
you go to a website called green fuels
online.com they're actually building
algae farms out of MIT producing they
claim 22,000 gallons of fuel per acre
now it's a wonderful idea I think it's
not quite ready but every year with
bioengineering the algae improve craig
Venter who raised the new a US
government in sequencing the human
genome is doing synthetic bhasin thetic
biorefinery and I'm working with some
people on some very interesting
synthetic biology techniques that are
little further out and I have to again
say all I'm talking about for the
numbers here is the corn in the
cellulosic bet bio ethanol none of this
other stuff and I can't because people
then say you're not credible because
they look backwards not forwards lots of
companies working on this and here's
what one company is doing increasing let
me skip past that say the expanding
usable acreage by increasing doubt
tolerance heat tolerance drug recovery
all salty elements of plants this
company has the largest library of plant
genes they insert them crossing over
from one plant to another the increasing
the tons per acre the increasing the
dollars reducing the dollars per ton
like the fertilizer intensiveness of
growing these times the increasing the
gallons per ton by reducing the lignin
content of the plant in increasing the
carbohydrate content of the plant this
is all simple engineer
we've just never had to worry about it
so we haven't worried about it reducing
the cost of enzymes developing
commercial energy crops I mean and
that's just one company I can go through
a long list of companies so where did
where are we you have a choice do we
choose import oil or at not do we want
to add to the rural rural economy but
genuinely needs help it's just supplied
our food economy we can add to that some
significant portion of our energy
economy it would completely change the
face of rural America just think of the
possibilities because energy is a much
bigger part of our energy than the food
economy and this is a macroeconomic
shift that would change the whole planet
I think and you know it relies on
innovation it replies on
entrepreneurship it relies on what I
call the power of ideas fueled by
entrepreneurial energy and that's a far
powerful force than anybody in
Washington understands Brazil's already
done this I have talked about this this
is a good curve this is a curve with
cumulative volume what the production
cost of ethanol has done in Brazil
because we are at such small numbers
compared to gasoline production cause I
would conjecture that we have a long way
to go down just all the accumulated
experience this is a curve on the yield
of ethanol per ton of pml of sugarcane
in Brazil it's still going up pretty
rapidly this is just the price ratio
since 2001 what are we doing in the
United States people like this idea when
you ask people do you want a gasoline
tax eighty-seven percent now
but you say do you want a gasoline tax
to reduce our dependence on foreign oil
the number goes from eighty-seven
percent note thirty-seven percent no you
ask them you want a gasoline tax to
reduce global warming the number drops
thirty-four percent this is from a new
york time called last month people do
care washington doesn't realize it but
people do care this is our this is the
RFS standard this is mandated in the
large energy bill but this is how fast
energy at all capacities been expanding
in the u.s. already and and much of it
happened before the energy bill this is
the number of I won't spend time on that
I want the for those of you interested
there's a detailed breakdown and
production costs by item two different
models what the one is this one and the
other is this one again I won't go
through it it is one macro message the
solar energy in the case of ethanol
crude oil both processes when you look
at them cost roughly fifty cents a
gallon to produce other than the
feedstock class it's actually pretty
amazing because it's a very similar kind
of process I won't spending time on this
let me stop there and open it up to
questions there's a bunch of references
up there so feel free to use them so let
me open it up to questions and we can go
from there yes
so you're required stay in this room
it's going to jump onto this bandwagon
so we also made a comment that for a few
tens of millions of dollars back seat
comfortable going up the gas station in
California so you know some people who
can afford
do without the federal government
let me answer that question multiple
White's first it's few tens of millions
of dollars in California to equip ten
percent of the pumps if X under the pump
owner doesn't that's the cat it's a lot
more if you set up a whole new system
and that's where the bottleneck is so
i'm looking for something the oil
industry really wants in hopefully in
Washington we can trade them the fact is
the price floor on oil senator lugar who
introduced new bill based on these
recommendations just about a week and a
half ago before the senatorial rich has
tested this idea at the Brookings
Institute the speech it got a lot of
play that's how things work in
Washington you test it you talk about it
some where it gets a lot of play see who
gets on the bandwagon so I can't tell
you it will happen but I can tell you at
least one person relatively important
was bold enough to test it the flex-fuel
car meant it is in about three builds
before the Congress and Senate
representative Marquis has introduced a
bill senator Obama and Luger have bill
introduced a bill Lieberman's talking
about introducing a bill to this enough
catch I haven't yet found anybody got
Cena mandates something for the oil
companies and I'm going to try it and if
it doesn't work I have a backup strategy
everybody signs up RFS standard for
ethanol he can have an RFS standard for
e85
we can also have an outer fair standard
for sale Oh Sekot know and all those
would be alternative not as good but
good enough ways to get there so there
are backup strategies in that in fact i
have a white paper called the near term
energy solution that talks but from the
again that's on my website i know there
was a question there back there yes
human vision show pd is to simply sushi
is are very keen on this what's on there
oh you know I would say they are much
more aggressive about this in Europe
than in the US and I would also say
they're sort of waking up to this in the
last year or so in fact I know in
February that Chevron appointed somebody
to develop a business plan for them in
this area too so it's encouraging
science but is the issue if you have
billions and billions of gallons of
reserves in the price of oil brought
twenty dollars you have a lot of
disincentive in in sort of making that
happen so I suspect they will be
positioned to participate in this they
will get ready reasonably well equipped
to build these plants and factories you
know an ethanol production facility
looks like a brewery in fact you know we
learned how to make this happen all when
we made two hundred proof moonshine and
in fact you can put two hundred proof
moonshine in instead of ethanol it works
just fine that's exactly what it is only
thing the federal government does is
make sure you denature it so people
don't drink it other than that it is not
different than moonshine so I think the
companies will jump in at the right time
but I don't think they have an interest
the Exxon made 36 billion dollars of
profit last year do you think they have
any interest in this changing and the
higher the price of oil goes for free
the increase of their reserves the value
of their reserves goes up their market
cap goes up and by the way they can sell
the same oil at a higher price so they
make more money till I think all the
interests are against them from they
don't want it to happen too fast if it
happens they would jump in yes
what do you think about you talks about
potential renewable fuels standard for
cellulosic ethanol to help with that
transition aside before that what do you
think about a labeling either voluntary
or mandatory labeling to distinguish
between cellulosic
and I think that's a good idea I was at
a two-day conference to sort of find the
solution that was in fact one of the
solutions that was recommended I'm sorry
the question is what about just labeling
cellulosic ethanol and corn at no I
think the first thing we need to do and
I think it's a good idea first thing we
need to do is just offer ethanol in the
marketplace all right then we can start
labeling it it's like labeling organic
food in northern gannet food it's very
very similar and I think that will
happen it just mean if you go back to my
slide and how you go from possible to
probable the main issue i believe is
kick-starting this for that reason I'm
going to take a little interrupt here
and bring up a different presentation
since kick-starting I believe is the key
issue we have a ballot initiative I'm
here cheering and I won't spend time on
all these things except to say it'll be
run by a fairly independent board in a
number of Nobel laureates environmental
groups are supporting us I think Larry's
finally agreed to support us as has been
directed we definitely need lots of
money for this the oil companies are
gearing up to spend lots of money we
have a group of individuals the oil
companies have much bigger balance
sheets so anybody who can help raise
money or give money that's great but we
also need a large blogging force to go
blog this message for us so we will look
and the waters love this stuff so let me
stop there and go back to questions yes
does it bigger healthiest process and
I don't give investment advice something
go to stress
in the right hand side
horse
I think that's a genuine concern but I
think some of it is misplaced it always
comes up about Brazil but if you look at
the economics of it the rain forest area
is not the best area in Brazil grow
sugarcane the pasture lands are so my
bet is they will convert all the pasture
land they have and there's lots of land
in Brazil that's appropriate for this
and remember these are relatively
environmentally friendly crops in fact
the miskeen 'this is the prairie grass
version switchgrass used to be the
prairie grass in the Midwest so it's
really returning these lands to the
whole environment will we have issues if
you do a monoculture I'm sure we all
have issues but I suspect that's not how
it will turn out that we will do
different things in different regions
and sort of have more diversity we know
what to do so my optimistic scenario is
for the midterm will have enough yields
so the land area needed will even be
smaller than the 55 million acres I'm
talking about which is relatively small
we have 73 million acres of soybean just
for export okay but long term I think
we'll avoid all that use some of that
fancy synthetic biology stuff I just
think we need to start down this
trajectory yes
my fundamental assumption is you know
short term you will see those kinds of
spikes because Sweden announced that
they will use flex fuel cards and
ethanol to meet their Kuroda compliance
requirements Japan is going to Brazil
for ethanol to meet their care
compliance price of ethanol goes up
nobody wants to make sugar sugar price
goes up so there is short-term
competition but long-term I am
absolutely convinced the cheapest way to
make it will be from cellulosic and
people will make it from cellulosic not
because it's greener but because it's
cheaper so I think the green will be
free it was a question yes
ah yes there's actually out the link if
you follow on miscanthus was pretty
interesting but I have my favorite chart
which I want to bring up here I wasn't
planning on talking about it it's in my
spear charts but let me go to it I love
this chart because if you care about
more than the US and you care about the
planet the best biomass belt is where
there's the most poverty on this wall in
this world so if we do in fact go to
this economy it will be good what part
of the world epica South America you
know it's amazing to see the coincidence
between poverty and the best biomass
belt I hope that answers your question
yes there was a question yeah yeah yeah
why saw by cars what about electricity
how does it make faster you know people
tell me it's ridiculous enough to go
around you know when I first said we
think we can I can think we can replace
all our petroleum people said that was
really crazy I actually believe you we
won't stop there especially with some of
the gasification techniques and some of
the characteristics related to that we
will start going deeper there's no
reason to stop what about Mozilla video
brazil you know they actually take a lot
of the bagasse after they made the
ethanol bonnet and the mills produce for
excess and by the way burning is a
relatively inefficient process you get
about twenty percent heat utilization at
best because you're diluting it with air
and burning it there are other ways to
do it you can get to sixty seventy
percent efficiency but the Brazilian
ethanol producers sell a lot of
electricity into the grid other
questions yes the change
love
you have the oil lobby at one time
stay put
well you're working on it is hard but
yeah
could you hear your 50 60 hostiles
balance on the plants taking two
going versus the training of the game ah
so almost all carbon in fact all the
carbon in most of these cops comes from
the air and so you're really doing a
full cycle you're not really adding any
net greenhouse gases to the atmosphere
the plants I like miscanthus and
switchgrass actually not only do that
but in the process of growing take
carbon from the air and fix it in the
soil so there's net reduction other yes
well you are you part of ironies this
question comes up a lot biodiesel is a
good fuel it's not as land efficient so
when I looked at the macro issue you can
produce a few hundred gallons of
biodiesel per acre today using these
low-cost techniques and they have to be
low-cost you can produce a few hundred
gallons of ethanol today I can see how
with ethanol you get to 4000 acres per
4,000 gallons per acre but I don't know
how you get there with biodiesel so in
terms of land efficiency over the longer
term there's a dramatic difference
between the two there's not as large a
short-term difference there's a question
might have intended
certifying an aircraft to run a new fuel
is a long long process that's why Larry
mentioned and Larry and I had dinner
with Richard Branson in Davos he wants
to offset it by producing greenup no but
he can't directly use besides aviation
fuels are only about seven percent of
the fuel market there are home heating
oil is about the same percentage the
bulk fittest cars and light trucks yes
and a lot of your talk was about how
compelling is economically for everyone
and super choice favors it so I put on a
little bit about some of the techniques
to get there okay that's just really a
two part of the unconvincing the first
part is what's different rasili you
pretended such a compelling argument
what if we do nothing and you know what
I just happen anyway why did it happen
so well in Brazil and what's different
about that from here and then the second
part is that I'm a computer scientist
but I like to pretend I'm an economist
sometimes and economic circles is well
known that price controls fixed price
floors of ceilings whatever are
generally not the best ways to
accomplish favoring incentives or
whatever my advocate the price floor and
the other two things instead of sort of
things that seem more economically sound
so there you great answer put those
questions they're great questions in
Brazil it was the politics Brazil is
competing for regional influence with
Venezuela which has a lot of oil Brazil
doesn't so they made a strategic
decision and for those of you who don't
understand how important this is in
January Venezuela with its money made up
all the IMF loans of Argentina so
Argentina would listen to Venezuela
politically on the left instead of
listening to die a map which is Western
influence that kind of thing happens all
the time that happened in January
Argentina paid up a hundred percent of
its higher math laws so that was the
regional kind of thing the Brazilian
government decided that this was a good
thing for them here it worked out the
economics and frankly it didn't take off
because of that it was when oil went
about above about thirty thirty-five
dollars a barrel it took off by consumer
demand and there are no subsidies for at
knowledge that I right in front of money
when I look at production costs I sort
of eliminate all those extraneous
factors what's the flaw in the economic
argument is economics always assumes a
level playing field I can give you a
hundred examples of why this is not
level plain
gave you the example of how the oil
companies two billion dollars from that
nod produces and the refinery is
collected because they change to worked
in a law well past midnight Hurricane
Katrina happened price oil stays shut up
that's what happened oil profits the
largest profits ever recorded by any
corporation in American in world history
that was excellent last year guess what
they did not incremental seven billion
dollars of reduction in this extraction
fee that's charged in the god they got
seven billion dollars subsidies despite
making the record profits that ever made
that's the way the game is played
unfortunately because they have strong
political clout so it isn't a level
playing field I would completely argue
with you that this would make sense if
in fact it was a level playing field and
that's why he would I use is we need to
kick started not subsidizing but if I
bring you the non level playing field
why a price fix rather than a subsidy to
the industry or what are the other day
why because because what the oil
companies what this gentleman from Dow
in Davos said to me but we will
manipulate the price of oil we can drop
it for two years drive that and all
refineries out of business and then
raise it again so it only to prevent
price manipulation if it was true market
phenomena I wouldn't worry i wouldn't
recommend that in fact i only added that
third recommendation after Davos after
this guy having the gall to come up to
me and so will screw around with you so
other questions yes it would be possible
to actually produce all of this ethanol
from the Sun where
oil has been you know for millions of
years process that we're consuming in a
very fast pace is really possible in
terms of like the energy coming from
this so so the question is is it really
possible to produce this much oil and
again I would suggest you read the
growing energy to report by the NRDC or
you read the Jim Woolsey George Shultz
paper on the web or on you know I've
looked at it many different ways because
you don't know it that any one way is an
accurate set of assumption and the
answer comes out to the same yes okay
first place let's take 40 for so Larry
Larry Larry Larry we have we're giving
him some votes this hand is out of ten
out of a 10 i think is pretty good too
you got some french judges here there's
one more question which is so it's a
pretty compelling speech what do you
want people in the audience to do well
two things you can help us kick start
this in California our goal is if you
get that four billion dollars and the
waters in California passed that we will
have the money to get it extorted like
paying the small operators enough money
so they can install a pump so we need
money to run an ad campaign we estimate
we need 35 million dollars all companies
I expect we'll spend over a hundred
million because they have the plane and
it's only a group of individuals you
know there's no big interest behind us
so money is valuable and I know Wendy's
here somewhere she has lots of brochures
that anybody wants on this California
initiative it's over there that's 12 I
think we need to have much more
effective marketing and internet
marketing blogging I sort of have this
dream of 4000 bloggers with dedicated to
a mission so anybody who can help
instruct that
and all of you understand how to do this
better than I do that those two would be
very valuable thank you again veneer</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
