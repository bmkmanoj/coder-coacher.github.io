is working with Peter Norvig on building
tools to improve the teaching of
programming and computer science he's
received degrees from MIT and his PhD
from Stanford just recently so I'll turn
it over to Scott thanks Jack one for me
from back right no clapping involved
here okay all right so I'm gonna
basically this hour my goal is just
maximally useful like everybody in this
room so if it ends up with me talking
for most of our that's great if it's you
all talking or asking questions that's
also great because yeah whatever I can
do to be most useful so the only notes I
really have is this like loader sheet
here I'm just gonna like read off some
meta stuff and then I'm just gonna start
going so basically the format is I just
have this one you know piece of HTML
here and these are the 20 you know kind
of lessons I summarized and epilogue my
PhD book and this is gonna be completely
nonlinear so we know whatever people are
you know whatever the conversation
diverges towards you know just for the
sake of the recording and back there
I'll just you know I'll just highlight
that so this could be you know any one
of these two to 20 pounds so whatever
actually sends up going in no idea it's
going out so just to start with
logistics a this is not a typical Tech
Talk I was kind of surprised that
there's a Tech Talk calendar or
something because I actually gave a
tick-tock here last last year but my
research and was a very standard schema
right it's like there's my research
here's the slides and then I give a talk
and then you know you say that people
can drop with questions stuff but people
usually don't interrupt the questions
and you give a talk for half an hour 45
minutes and then some people ask you
questions later and then you respond
some can't answer so I'm sure all of you
you know mostly interns students have
heard plenty of people speak I'm gonna
show off what I did and then maybe have
some questions and then yeah they're
like did you consider doing this and
they'll you know we didn't so this will
not be like this this is I am highly
interruptible so like there should be
mics going around or something but like
seriously totally interrupting anytime
there should be other it Mike's
everywhere else anyways so um you know I
I'm here as as a peer and not as any
kind of authority figure or anything so
I was in the this audience exactly last
summer I was an intern here it was the
final almost the final year of my PhD
and I was an intern here in Mountain
View and I Jacqueline and others
organized a bunch of these great talks
from Google leaders right so there were
yeah vice president's research directors
everyone talking you know chill interns
about how gray goo goo is and about
leadership and about career building and
everything and I thought those are
really interesting talks but I always
felt that I would like to hear more from
you know people who are in my same
position so I I you know I when I first
got here one of the things I really want
to do since it was in the summer and
there's a much interns there and I had
just been an audience when you earlier I
wanted to give a certain kind of talk
like that so so this is kind of the talk
that I would have maybe wanted to hear
when I was an intern here I'm so I'm
gonna do a cheesy quick show of hands
because they're only interactive a
promise so how many people here are our
full-time oh oh and how many are interns
hey good awesome good and out of the
interns how many are currently
undergrads or master students I guess
undergrads master students okay good and
then how many are doing their PhD right
now oh wow we got quite a lot okay good
perfect and these will get slightly more
bare thing so who has just finished
their first year okay
you see where this is leading all right
first year PhD sorry
first your feet you just finished okay
good and then second year just finished
two years okay and then just finished
three phases are looking more and more
grizzled here just finished four just
finish five okay I'm not gonna ask about
the rest well so I um I just wanted to
calibrate that's not because everyone
probably depending on what lovely right
actually out of the people here who are
not currently doing PhD how many you
might be considering doing one in the
future oh wow that's quite a lot
okay great awesome cool so I'm gonna
just give a bit of background about my
patient a memoir project and we'll just
take it from there so just a little
background myself I did my PhD in
computer science it I took it's about
six years to finish and I did not know I
was you know I did not have the green
light to graduate until about three
months before I graduate so you know I
was working all the way to add and once
I got the green light everything was
good I just you know
scheduled defense and then write
dissertation and get everything checked
out
but up until you know January end of
January 2012 I did not know that I was
going to graduate and my fate was still
uncertain and very lucky that everything
worked out really well in the last six
months so towards in my PhD right when I
was around hopefully getting the green
light I thought that the you know that
that my dissertation may be at most five
people with it right because it's
basically that Isis Committee and maybe
one or two other suckers who like I
second reading it you know my the papers
I wrote maybe maybe like fifty might
read a total right that's like a
reasonable number but I wanted to you
know I wanted have something that would
be lasting beyond my PhD beyond just the
particular research I did so I thought
about the fact that I I looked at you
know throughout my case she had done a
lot of writings at my website about yeah
their experience are going to grad
school and I've been reading a lot about
it and one thing that did not exist was
a comprehensive account of one person's
PhD experience there have been say like
professors have been writing about like
oh like yeah there's like I'm sure you
all know that there was like a few
professors you've written without PhD
advice and stuff like you know top ten
tips of getting into grad school or yeah
or advice for getting your dissertation
better or whatever and there's like a
small side of that so on one end there
were people in authority who were
writing in back wistfully about their
experience and like oh you guys should
work hard and you know do well and stuff
like I did and on the other end there
were like the super whiners right so
there's the PhD comics types you know
grad students who might have dropped out
and they're like oh my life sucks and
then I'm gonna like rant about it so if
you look up like PhD life or whatever on
Google you get these two polar opposites
you get people who are offering stately
advice you got you know professors
research leaders and
for have some of the people you've been
hearing talk here and other places of
you know why doing a PhD is good
I'm very other extreme you have you know
people who are is is this working okay
right this other one going in and out
yeah okay so so on the other end you
have maybe it's my moving the my grade
is that okay I'll try to hold it super
Stu actually I just kind of pulley does
this work better
yeah after like a lien and it's weird
okay I will try not to oscillate the mic
too much so I'm the other end you have
people who are you know who are still
going through their PhD they may be
having you know issues and and such and
I thought that neither side were able to
write as kind of you know objectively
about their experiences and and also
there's a formatting but there's not
never a kind of full account of their
experience so I decided that you know I
wanted to be the one to write about this
so I started accumulating notes about
six months ago about the you know the
six years my PhD and how it progressed
and collecting old emails and notes that
I taken and old papers and drafts and
everything and after I finished my
defense on you know at the end of April
I sat down for two months and I did this
writing project it took about one month
to write and then I showed to some
people it got some iteration got some
drafts took of another month to revise
and I released it online of my website I
mean I wasn't like intending to make
money off this or anything and it's just
like it's just like a thing I was
wanting to do and I really said on a
website you know put it all up there and
I just was planning to email some
friends and just get people I know to
read it and such but it actually got on
you know on to certain social media
sites and then kind of kept on spreading
and by about by like two or three weeks
time there had been over like 50,000 or
so downloads and I've been getting I was
getting a stream of dozens of emails
every day about it from all sorts of
people from even the most unexpected
people you know one I have any sample
emails listen what one one of my friends
who was in grad school
she actually accepted full time here but
she's not here yet but she said that out
you know thanks for writing this cuz you
know I showed it to my grandma and she
loved reading it because she'd always
been bugging me about what is doing PhD
like and now I don't have to explain to
her
so I got those emails to other emails
from like professors from current
students for prospective students and so
on so I felt like it kind of really
struck a nerve with quite a few
different types of audiences and so like
that's why I'm here today talking all of
you and I you know I don't think it's a
great use of time for me to rehash the
contents of my book because it took yeah
it took me several months to distill
down six years into it's only like a
hundred pages very short like four
people read it you probably read in like
three or four hours something is
actually quite short but I don't think
it's very useful to try to distill that
down to like 20 or 30 minutes so I am
just I'm just be you know thrilled to if
there's questions or they're just things
we can just launch off talking about
otherwise I'm just yes it's a good
question
yes definitely yeah so the question was
did I take on any undergraduate minions
while I was doing my PhD another
question so early on in my PhD I was
yeah I was on this big group project
that people who've read it I've read
about and there was one or two
undergraduates who were working with us
also but the project was so disorganized
that like it was like the blind leading
the blind like I was a first-year
student and then my advisor wanted me to
like lead some undergraduates to do
stuff and it was it was not a great
experience for either party and later on
my PhD I kind of I I managed to do I
manage to pick projects that were very
self contained so I did everything
myself so I don't actually have
experience working with undergraduates
personally sure
good okay that's a good question so the
question is about the role of teaching
because the the book was all about
research so I purposely made it very
focused on because like you could talk
about all sorts of different things I
can talk about like what I do in terms
of teaching or extracurriculars or you
know other stuff but I doubt that
anybody cares about my personal life
right if people care about the process
of doing the PhD and getting research
out so the question of teaching so in
our department we had two classes that
you had you had the TA two classes
minimal because I was on fellowship I
couldn't do whether it was called full
TA ship so I can only do a half a ship
which means they pay you half but you
actually do like all the work so it's
actually the worst deal ever but so I
ended up taking three classes and for me
teaching was not a huge the the primary
teaching for classes is not a huge part
of my experience it didn't take up a ton
of time and it wasn't a huge it wasn't a
huge burden or a huge bonus because I
mean this varies by department but in
our department at least the teaching
assistants we didn't really teach like
we just kind of maintained the course
and held office hours and graded work
and stuff so there wasn't really a big
teaching Epona there are some people who
actually if they actually like teaching
more they would try to teach a summer
course in that case they would actually
get credit for teaching two courses and
they would actually leave the course in
the lecture so for people who like
teaching that was applied better way to
go that said though the teaching
experience that I had throughout grad
school which were more gratifying were
just the things I did in my own so I had
two experiences on that one is I went to
I did some Python tutoring at a local at
a local startup that they contacted me
because you know I kind of been writing
about Python on my blog a few years ago
and then they contacted me and I they
said that some other scientists and
non-technical people wanted to learn
some basic Python just so they could
just get a feel for programming is so I
went there for about 10 weeks once a
week and I just would just write on the
whiteboard and do introductory Python
stuff and the other thing which is even
more cool is that just last year this
guy contacted me he was a local
entrepreneur here and he contacted me
and he said that he was looking for
someone to teach him programming because
he wanted to learn programming and he's
been at this business person for four
decades he's a very successful business
person but since he's in the tech world
he wanted to like actually learn to code
so I thought I was really admirable and
really cool so I actually
ended up spending about six to nine
months with him we did Skype mostly just
screen share on skype pair programming
for Bostick I have an article my website
about this experience it was an awesome
experience and he basically went from
not knowing anything to being able to
build a non-trivial kind of Facebook
social type of application it was really
cool I'm seeing him build everything and
my role was basically as a tutor so yeah
he would just do everything I would just
send him documentation of like I'll look
into this live or and then he would
struggle with it and then we would debug
together and get him over home so that
one-on-one was really really spectacular
but in terms of institutional teaching
that wasn't a big part of my experience
there's a super long answer Bianca can
just feel the questions yeah you can
microphone
so there's a what time
good good oh yes yes yes thank you the
first point
yes knowing when to quit by this not
just meeting quitting the ph.d program
but quitting individual projects when in
PHP William is also valid yeah so one of
my so my first undergrad research
supervisor when I was on undergrad when
I visited when I visited MIT later on in
grad school looking for advice one of
the things he told me was that knowing
when to quit is one of the most
important things he learned in grad
school because he also had a very
similar experience as I did that he
spent his first three years working on
stuff that like totally didn't work out
and he just made a switch around and is
in the middle and then switch and in his
last three years he did something else
that was way more promising and now he's
you know a full professor MIT and and
somebody else the other people have this
story too so I don't know what there's
like a great answer to that it's I think
I think one thing is you can't quit too
early right because for two reasons one
is that you kind of you know it's kind
of there's a losing face type thing that
especially if you're junior student you
try something for a few months yeah I'm
just gonna quit then it doesn't look
very good to you know your senior
colleagues and also putting too early
might be bad because you just might have
not of accumulative skills to get over
that hump that's it that's a very hard
question I think I think maybe it maybe
maybe part of it is just if you can find
something else that's better I guess
that's like that's also you know very
precarious because I basically quit
stuff without having the next thing that
I wanted to do but I just got very lucky
yeah really does anyone else have a
better answer actually this is just out
sources to quit and I know it's very
important but I just have no idea let me
think so I think that Oh like Midway is
a good point so sorry maybe this is
somewhat good answer is that it's like
when do you know in the middle is when
you're streaming through right so I
think if you're averaging you know in
the u.s. if you're averaging a six year
program then by your third year like so
switching advisor switching groups I
think that you usually by your third
year you should really figure out
whether you want to stay with your
defaults you know you're like that
stay with your defaults or that the
defaults are bad that you want to switch
but it's very hard to switch later on I
would say so so what you argue right now
okay okay so this is exactly the time
yeah the vegetation is not making about
that yeah and yeah so I think that you
can't be quitting too late or too early
their questions thoughts yep great good
good so I'll repeat the question
so there's this thing called like the
PhD law which is that the very simple
fact that there are way too many more
PhDs being produced than academic
positions and positions as professors so
like like we were talking on offline
forever you know every professor is
training way more students than they can
be employed as professors right it's you
know one cynical way to look of this is
it's as a pyramid scheme you know a
lesson ago a look at it and especially
it we're very lucky to be in more
applied fields is that there are great
industry options such as here in other
places and I think we had another
question offline about intentions of
doing a PhD why I got into so I'll just
tell my own story which is basically the
prologue of my prologue of my book this
thing right here so I decided to start
doing my PhD because I had I did three
internships during my undergrad at not
very good companies and like it was just
a terrible experience like I just
happened that the places I worked at
work you know you're very Dilbert like
cubicle farms and I could see that so on
one hand like I was the only intern of
these places so I was being treated
basically as a junior full-time employee
which is cool because it wasn't him this
is a very different experience you guys
are very you know there's a very great
intern program and there's you know
people really take care of you know you
didn't earn everyone's well sure yeah
people take good care to feed include
interns and and they take really good
care of you here but when I interned
back with undergrad I just went to
places that were not Google or sorts of
top places and on one hand I got to
learn a lot about what you know what
real world was like I was basically
doing all the stuff
everyone else is doing on the other hand
I could see that you know people who
were right out of right out of college
working there people who are five years
out before 10 years out 15 years 20
years out like I did not really see
myself in that kind of life and they
didn't seem super happy with their lives
I didn't see gravity of their jobs and
it was just a not a very great work
environment and one of my father's when
my dad's friends worked at one of these
same companies he was in another
department and then he would come over
my cubicle sometimes and offer yeah is
stately unsolicited I mean everything I
say is on my website so this is all
public and he would it would just be
like you know you should should learn to
cover up your mana backing like these
giant CRT monitors they said you should
learn to like get these manila folders
like he didn't just cover up the sides
of the monitor so he could say that he
was like blocking out glare but that's
so you can like surf the web so that
other people like walking by can't see
what you're doing and then and you know
his whole thing was Jan just laying low
so I thought that if that was the future
of my career then I was it was probably
not great so there was a big negative
motivation because that if I was
graduating you know with a computer
science or engineering degree and those
would be the places that I got exposed
to that was working out I didn't really
want that and at the same time like the
positive experiences in school I kind of
liked the idea of doing research even
though I didn't really know what it
really meant was it as an undergrad
and I felt that you know I kind of liked
the idea of doing research and and those
kinds of things so I wanted the PhD with
that with that mindset so it's probably
not the most you know noble intention
for doing a PhD so that's what my like
top thing was but I think I'm very glad
that I did it and over the lap you know
past six years I've learned a ton for my
experiences so it's probably not a
really typical story of why I decided II
but that's just my own story and I guess
there's a PhD glad to do but I'll
address that later
there's hangers on the back
hmm yeah so I I've heard great things
about APM program I don't know about it
personally um this actually means a lot
to me because what what I mean by this
is that I I guess with the exception of
the you know the full-time people who've
been here for a while and there are more
veterans like like we are all here like
we're all like below the bottom of the
ladder
we're like beneath the bottom right like
grad students and people were just
recently gradual like yeah we're at the
bottom of the bottom but the thing is
that you guys are all in your PhD or
you're all motivated to be here because
you have you have you know a lot of
creative energy and great ideas and you
want to be pursuing what you love to do
but there's a huge disconnect between
you know as young people like as
ourselves as young people really wanting
to do something creative make
contribution and the fact that yeah we
are at the bottom of any hierarchy or
you know either an academia or an
industry or an anything we're always at
the bottom so how do you you know how do
you figure out how to push forward your
own agendas and what you want to do when
you're at the very bottom and I think
this is a yeah I could speak the whole
hour about this so I'll summarize
basically I guess this leading doesn't
really necessarily mean leadership of
projects or people and such it really
means leading your own agenda and I
think the the high level bit here is
that you need to get someone who is
powerful and influential interested
enough in your work that you also in the
movie Inception like my favorite movie
of all time
right so basically you need to get them
to think that it's their great ideas and
that you are you are doing it for them
that's one kind of way to put it that if
you can get and this also this also goes
with the selling thing that one of the
most successful things with able do my
PhD is to get people certain people who
are fairly influential to be excited
about what I wanted to work on because
they wanted to work on as well and then
they were able to publicize it for me
and give me great feedback and
everything and so I think that the
leading from below a big part of it is
finding people who are more influential
and more senior and figuring out you
know how you can be useful to them while
still pushing for sort of what you want
and it's obviously not perfect right and
you very few of us are gonna
we'll get one from the corner
okay that's a good question so the
questions about advisors being
overbooked with too many students I kind
of I kind of punch it on that route
because I actually just went off and did
my own thing which is good and bad so I
was able to be a bit more independent
because I was self funded by fellowships
and also even the first three years when
I was working in my advisors project
with other students I wasn't getting a
ton of personal attention either so I
think it I think it really depends like
some students thrive very well when you
have good advising and some students are
better off when they're left alone and
such so but I mean if that's a concern
to you then then maybe one thing is to
be proactive about seeking your advisors
time and should like setting up regular
meetings and stuff so it's like that's
the easiest thing to do I think Thanks
um yeah sure before I repeat all the
questions I'm so the question is how do
I feel about do my PhD in Stanford
particular versus other universities I
was pretty agnostic to the actual
department and such I really like I mean
I am but no I I came here because you
know I it was a great school and there's
a great program everything and I didn't
really over plan things but one of the
side effects of being here for the past
six years that I've learned so much
about what's going on in industry and
startups and just the Silicon Valley
entrepreneurial culture and even though
I'm myself I'm not interested in you
know being entrepreneur such I have
friends who are and such and I really
like that to Silicon Valley environment
so I think one of the advantages of
being at a school like Stanford or
Berkeley in the Bay Area is the kind of
you get this closer connection with with
with industry the thing that was a big
advantage
right so the question is you know in
theory versus systems so yeah I spent
most of my 10,000 hours in grad school
programming like hunched over and if my
funds in theory spent a lot of hours
scratching their heads thinking about
problems writing on the whiteboard you
know getting very frustrated about about
things so it's a different type of grind
I think I don't know how my experiences
would have been a very good I you know I
I haven't really done that but did you
have any ideas about what kind of things
might be different okay um I think yes I
mean this is my own like unfounded
opinions but I think I am a feeling that
in theory there is more of a variance
and you know it so I think it's it's not
as linear in the sense of somebody can
make a really brilliant contribution
their first year of grad school because
they you know they've been doing
theoretical math for many years and they
come in and they can publish one great
paper right in the beginning because
there's a great insight things have to
work a lot at it too and it's not like
it comes instantly but I think in a
systems around a field I think it's
practically impossible for a first-year
student to be like I built this thing
and I evaluate it I got to publish the
top conference all within one year my
first year I think the non-linearity may
be a lot bigger in theory then in
systems that in your if you're actually
having to hack on stuff for your for
your PhD there it's just much harder to
get stuff out there for early but I
don't know otherwise though it's doing
this corner
okay so questions about like you know
work being more applied and more you
know industrial and rather than being
more academic and such like were you
thinking about like commercializing
stuff like building a company out of
things or huh that's right there's no
proprietary issues it's just that like
this is just not what's valid so I mean
there's always like lower tier things
you could be publishing out that's
that's what I ended up doing but still
there's there's issues I mean just
conferences are and journals are easier
to get in than the top things all right
I mean that's one compromise you can
make is it's come submitting to live
it's ultimately up to your advisor I
mean if the advisors like you must
publish a paper at the top conference or
all knowledge
I think optimizers have to be met
somehow let's do one in the back the
green yeah
okay that's really good question so it's
now that I have my PhD what how am i
finding a leverage I guess what I
learned in my PhD without getting too
much in statistics oh I'm deer here
because I want this talk to be public we
can talk afterwards about Google
internal stuff but basically as a
high-level summary I um I think I got
very lucky that I'm here doing a certain
type of work that I really want to be
doing and it would have been very hard
for me to be then very hard for me to be
doing this without having got my PhD not
because I'm using my PhD thesis in my
work that's like not the case just
because I actually just a lot of these
lessons I learned about basically trying
to get myself in a position to do the
work I like and to be leading from below
to be getting influential people
interested in my projects to be making
pitches to people like all this very
entrepreneurial stuff I learned that I
think it would be very useful in an
industry and other things but I'd be
happy to talk offline about specifics
well right next yeah
questions about reforming the PhD
process I guess there is no need to
reform how PhD programs work I think
people have looked into this in like in
the UK for example write that in your
Europe there's you know there's
proposals from where streamline PhD
programs there's proposals for different
types of funding models and things I
haven't really thought about those
issues myself for one of the main
reasons is practical is that I'm not in
a position to do this or suffering I'm
not you know a leader in research who
goes to summits to talk to debate with
university presidents and talk to the
NSF leaders and such so I haven't given
these things thought to myself my my um
my whole thing throughout my PhD was
that there is a game there that we have
to all play and we cannot change the
game because we're again at the sub
bottom of the rung of the ladder so the
only way the game and you don't play
that altogether that's that's good
because you no one's forcing you to or
if you want to get a PhD and to start a
career doing something related that you
need to be playing the game and this is
not just for people in PJs like people
who are assistant professors have to
play the game to get tenure as well and
the hope is once you get tenure if
you're well-connected enough you can
when you're in your 40s and stuff you
can hope to try to change the game with
reform - but that's totally outside my
scope question yeah oh this corner
right right yep
yeah you can read this offline out there
yeah I would be the question even the
mic or weird yeah my mic okay I guess
I'm just an affair about that let's just
feel like awkward of it
I'm so yeah that's a hard question of so
I wrote here not pay your dues but pay
some dues and I think that I paid my
dues for a bit too long I think that
there is an optimal point that it's very
hard especially in a very applied
systems oriented field that it is
I have never I've seen very rarely have
I seen first-year students say I have a
great project idea you know I mean a lot
of people going to PA think this
including myself or say I have this
great idea for a project and it's so
cool and so innovative I'm just gonna do
it I don't care what anybody thinks I'm
just gonna do it and the you know the
thing you find out really fast is that
there is often a large disconnect
between what you find is interesting and
innovative so academic research is a
small subset of what is interesting and
cool innovative right so there's this
larger set of stuff that's cool and
innovative and there's a smaller set
that's some kind of research thing right
so Google does a lot of research that's
non academic right so there's a smaller
set that's some kind of research a
cutting-edge stuff there's smaller set
that is considered as quasi academic
research so like some people may be
publishing alpha there's a smallest set
of that that's considered you know
respectable academic research that is
being published at top venues that is
that the people will determine that are
the people who are seen there in the
field right now
and then of that there's an even smaller
set that you are capable of doing due to
your resources or due to your lab due to
your adviser due to your own skills so I
think it's very hard for someone coming
in to think that they are actually in
that subset and it's great to try to do
that yourself so I actually in my first
or I try to do some of that stuff myself
but I quickly found out that that was
probably a worse experience than having
to do having to just be on a on a lot of
grindy project that I didn't go anyway I
mean the good thing about being on a you
know basically everybody who I've talked
to who has gotten through their PhD
successfully everybody has burned that
first two years like if you're doing a
six year program your first two years
will be probably pretty useless they're
you know sort of agree with that or you
are vehemently against Katrina says yes
yeah they're people who are very
successful in their PhDs
first two years everybody's just like
yeah yeah things just didn't work and a
lot of that is the learning through
doing thing to write that it's very I
mean the most optimistic view is that
it's you can't really get good unless
you struggle at things and in my first
tours even though the project's didn't
end up contributing dissertation the I
guess the sort of immediate benefit was
that I was man I was basically hacking a
lot of low-level psycho in Christ I was
doing a lot of low-level C programming
and it was really gross hard to debug
and stuff but because I had those
thousands of hours of practice during
that later on in my in my PhD I was able
to I was able to approach projects that
other people were were not even thinking
about doing because they didn't have
these sorts of skills so it you can view
his skills building but in general it's
a very hard question I think that you
should definitely not do this for like
four or five years and hope that one
year you gotta finish something so maybe
I think two years is fine because if you
don't burn on Dow you're gonna burn on
something else yeah I think we had won
that corner yeah
good see a question so the question is
you know if I could go back in time five
years what I have just gotten an
industry right away around there doing
PhD and I personally would not have
because I wouldn't have gotten this book
out of it like I personally would not
have and also would not have gotten my
current position out of it so we're not
going to details basically I got my
current job for a particular job role
because of a side project I did during
my PhD so this the side project thing is
another thing that's not on here I
didn't talk about this in my book
because it's not germane to the PhD
experience but the PhD is a great time
for I'm just going off my record that
the PhD is a great time for this kind of
goes to your question of you what's the
purpose of doing a PhD especially in a
very applied field I was I was getting
reader responses from friends who from
some friends who were interested in PhD
and he was saying how now that he's been
in industry for many years for five or
six years and he said that he was he's
subletted an apartment from a friend in
Boston who was a PhD student and those
few months that they were subletting he
just had a ton of fun just being able to
talk to people who were very
intellectually curious and smart and
motivated and you know at and and he
said that in industry a lot of times you
know everyone has a lot of stuff to do
and they have priorities and such and
it's just very hard to get smart
motivate people together with some free
time and lack of responsibility to do
cool stuff so the great female PhD that
they're paying you like almost nothing
so you just don't feel bad about taking
two weeks off to hack on something or
taking you know well it's like because
things you know their deadlines are you
have to submit papers you've to do stuff
but you know there are cycles right
sometimes you're just not feeling it for
a few weeks so yeah you're not feeling
for a few weeks you just don't do
anything and or you just came up with
your buddies and you can hack on some
interest so like around 2007 for example
we had this is when Facebook apps to
really start and come about and quite a
few you know masters and PhD students at
Stanford like they were doing their
classes doing the research and they just
spent their time at night just hacking
in the building and some of these people
you know ended up making some money off
to their Facebook apps because or their
iPhone apps and and you know most side
projects you do probably won't turn
anything commercially valuable but it's
just a cool time for serendipity to
occur so that's one of the reasons why I
really enjoyed it and I think basically
I think the calculation everyone has to
make or the rationalization I guess
rationalization afterwards is like did
you gain more than you lost
alright so there are certain things you
gain and there are certain things you
lost and if you fell you gain more than
you lost and it's a good call
but it's personal everybody right yeah
it's really hard to make a
generalization very back it was really
easy choice because I couldn't get any
that's it I I am basically last summer
so around this time I was here around
the time I was interning here I went to
some conferences to give talks and stuff
and that was when I the switch finally
flipped like I was very away from
academia for a few years that was mostly
because my publication record like I
just wasn't publishing in top-tier
places I knew how competitive job market
was and I wasn't you know willing to try
to you know work on post hoc reviewers
and really go with that but last summer
I decided that the switch has totally
flipped and I decided I'm just not gonna
apply for a cutting with jobs and that
was such a big sense of relief and also
it was um it was such a big boost to my
own creativity in the sense of that you
know one of the advantages of academia
that people tout is that it's a place
you know with the post placing
approximate having creative freedom and
whatever but for me the decision to quit
academia last year actually opened up
way more creative endeavors for myself
and two ways one is that I was able to
look for jobs and not another
non-traditional roles and the other way
is it actually got me to do my final
project which I actually visit Harvard
to do actually open up opportunity for
me to do a really cool project because I
didn't have to worry about oh I need to
publish in top conferences or whatever
I'm actually just met a professor at a
conference last summer and we just
started chatting about research and I
was just not afraid at all cuz you know
before if I was like I'm gonna apply for
acting job I need to like kiss up to
professors and you know what did I say
and I got really nervous everything but
I was yeah I was pretty much the only
person in the conference we were just
like I'll just say whatever and do
whatever cuz everybody else especially
senior grad students postdocs everyone
was on their top game right shaking
hands pitching their research you know
talking about let's get a grant together
and stuff and I was just going around
with doing whatever and that just worked
out really well for me so I actually did
not do an academic job hunt at all
that's right
right
yeah that's a really good question so
the question was that I was on
fellowship for five of the six years my
PhD and most people in our department
were funded by their advisors grants as
an RA and they taught sometimes as a
combination that was a that that this I
thought about that a lot and even though
I was funded on fellowship if you read
in my memoir the first three years I
acted as if I wasn't funded in
fellowship I basically you know it
wasn't like I come at them on fellowship
and I can do whatever the hell I want
because in the end you still need three
professors to sign off and let you
graduate so you still need to be in good
favor of professors and you know do sort
of stuff they're interested in so my
first three is I acted as though I
wasn't on my own funding but the last
two or three years I had my own funding
I think it did make a big difference
obviously my own experience I was able
to have more freedom to diverge and do
my own thing it's also a curse as well
because if you were doing your own thing
you don't have institutional support so
I had to make a lot more proactive
efforts to get my work published I had
to face a lot more rejections I had to
just basically end and do a lot of my
own stuff or had to do my own project
definition in my own I had to write all
my own paper you know to deal with all
the rejection notices everything myself
there was no team and people to do that
so I think that again it's hard to
generalize but the students if you're
optimizing for publishing top rate
papers and getting out with a good CV
the students have seen that do the best
are the ones who partner with really
good assistant professors with grant
funding they can be on fellowship also
but basically have you partner with
someone this is but if you partner with
someone who is like dead set on
publishing because they need to publish
for their lives or because there is this
professor and they need to be publishing
top papers top notch papers if you
partner with them you get along well
with them then you just there's this
great synergy that happens and students
I've seen do very well in that that is
if you want optimized for publishing
papers and graduate a good CV and I did
not really have that myself so that's
that's a big part reason why I didn't go
for an academic job because I didn't
have like have a CV that look good for
academia back there
scare quadrazid I ever think about
quitting so I never thought seriously
about quitting their ISM I never thought
seriously about quitting but I think a
part of it was because I had funding so
I'm like you know I have these this five
years of money then you know might as
well use it and just might as well use
it and and there wasn't because again
because I was used my perception of jobs
in industry was not a great perception
because I didn't intern at great places
so I'm like if I quit and I just go get
a job industry I was tainted by that bad
perception at the beginning so I'm like
I don't look any different on paper now
so I don't really see but but the thing
is being in Silicon Valley I think you
could get very good job man I had
friends who definitely you know left
early and they were able to get very
good job so yeah it really personally
didn't
here
it's a question about the actual book
writing process so I basically decided
about six months ago to do this and I
just started collecting notes together
from old emails and just like my
research notebook right there just like
text files and notes that I kept and you
know various paper rejection notices I
could quote from and so basically I just
start compiling stuff together I did
this on the back burner right so as I
was writing my dissertation in my spare
time I would start refining my notes so
this is this is a way I often work I can
only do one thing at once but I have one
background thread that I can do
something else so while I'm doing my
dissertation writing for three months in
the back I was molding this outline and
then once my defense was done and I
passed then I could free up my time to
doing this writing full-time so it only
took a few months but and the content is
actually not any this was this book was
all original content it wasn't taken
from other writings I had which you know
because I didn't want to be redundant
with other stuff
that's right
mm-hmm right right I think it's hard to
know what I mean
to know what the game is in your
department I'm just talking to senior
students is the best way
all right they're just talking to senior
students in your group and other groups
and stuff there's usually some you know
Department nothing is explicit right
there's not like I don't think anyone's
advisors like you must publish these two
papers at this conference and they'll
let you graduate it's all kind of fuzzy
and I think that from professor's
perspective they don't really like to
talk about because they don't want to
make the PhD out to be some you know
checkbox saying where you I checked one
paper off and checked another day both
everybody has your own you know their
professors who don't want their student
publish at all because they just want
them to write one long 200 page thing
that's amazing and detailed and don't
need to worry about publishing so I
think you just have to figure out by you
know the best thing is you can talk to
your adviser about it that's the best
obviously but that's that'd be hard to
do but I think you're just talking to
people around you okay
it's a great question so the question is
about you know how do you balance
helping other people versus how do you
balance helping other people projects
versus your own I think one very rough
rule of thumb is that if you're in you
know let's assuming you're doing a six
year us program just assuming six years
if you're in your first three years I
think taking every opportunity you can't
help other people is probably the best
because that's helping senior students
and postdocs whoever that's where you're
gonna learn a lot from and that's your
most likely chance of getting a paper
published and even if that paper isn't
those papers don't go towards your
thesis it's just the the idea of being
able to practice and and hacking on
systems writing papers dealing
rejections submitting papers because
there's the whole art about it if you
can partner with someone by helping them
then they're obviously very motivated is
there a project and as you tagging along
you can get some credit you can learn a
lot I would say that in your last few
years that you should be a lot more
hesitant on because you know because you
want to really get your foot out the
door and I think it's more justified for
you to be more selfish later on to guys
you need to graduate yourself
sure right right so the questions about
the paper right and press so this again
varies a lot by field so in computer
science and typical computer science
systems fields you're trying to be
publishing and these kind of top-tier
conferences and basically that involves
writing a pretty dense ten page or so
paper and you submit it there's a
deadline for every conference you submit
it and then you get feedback within
about three months or so but the
feedback is really I mean it's you don't
get to revise it oftentimes it's you get
it and that's either yes or no and it's
a no there's another conference coming
up that you can resubmit to so usually
for one paper you can probably submit
about three times a year two to three
times a year and you know that the trick
with that is you really have to balance
so once you submit one paper you have to
be either working another project or
some extension of paper you really have
the time it's you can't just single task
and say I want to get this paper in no
matter what and not do anything else I
mean you can't have your advisors like
you will get this paper in and somewhere
and you'll graduate they just poked some
one thing but there's definitely a
strategy involved in you know in getting
feedback and such all the way back
hmm
how do I think advisor to react if you
just came and just wanting to do cool
stuff I think if you're self-funded then
they may be ok with it because you know
you it's they're not paying for you so
if you're self-funded you could do that
I mean I I wanted to sort of do it in
the first few years but I kind of had an
eye not really on not really on going to
academia as much but as on I need to you
know play the game you graduate so I
think that if you have your own money
it's good if you don't then it may be
harder to convince them if it just
depends on the person or you're very you
know charismatic and very good at
convincing people then then that's good
that's great I mean the longer term
thing you know I think about is is how
are you going to get a PhD out of it or
if you want to if you don't want to if
you just want a hack on cool stuff for
two or three years get funded and then
drop out that's that's legit as well so
it just depends I think doing cool stuff
especially when you come in the
beginning that doesn't have a very high
probability of getting you publish and
getting a PhD but if your goal is to
just do cool stuff
not necessarily your degree and just be
funded for you're doing cool stuff
that's that's that's a good route to go
right right yeah so one with one of the
UH yeah so I've never had that problem
with I didn't have that many choices but
if you have a lot of ideas that you
could be working on maybe one way to
optimizes you know what's the one that
is most likely produce something
tangible first whether it's a
publication or it's a you know some kind
of milestone and I think the this kind
of output Trump's input things is kind
of relevant is that you know one one :
look at this is that your PhD is all
about what you output right an output
for most things is about papers or your
thesis or whatever and so if you have
five ideas and one of them is most
likely to result in some things and I
wouldn t go with that one because if you
get some output then you can get some
feedback and get some you know you can
have a launching fork or something else
because it's all too easy to just kind
of work on some half-baked things I
don't pan out okay oh yes very meta
right yeah so um I think I gave about
about 25 or so talks throughout my PhD
so I gave like one talk every few months
and this is one of the piece of advice
that like professors always tell you
about but like no one really gets it
when they say oh you should talk about
your work giving talks is has been one
of the most useful things for me at all
stages so if you're just forming a
project or starting out if you can just
give a very informal talk to your group
mates like at Blatt meeting or or you
know something within your school of
students they can give you like great
early feedback it's basically just a way
of getting early feedback and what make
sense it doesn't make sense for a very
superficial level and as you develop
your project and when you're about to
submit a paper like giving a talk right
before you submit a paper is really
useful because people are gonna come up
with common criticisms like oh why
didn't you think of this or what do you
do about this and those common
criticisms are what you need to address
in like the very beginning of your paper
right because because the talks are
really about someone getting a
superficial view of your research and
paper reviewers get a very superficial
review research because they have a
stack authority papers review if they
don't like your paper within the first
two minutes they're going to dismiss
and find ways to reject it rather than
accept it you need to make an amazing
impression right you need to make an
amazing first impression on the first
page and giving a talk white right when
you're about submit paper is a great way
to ferret out that was really easy it's
just like usability testing I mean very
simple and formal usability testing
you're kind of testing usability of your
presentation and then obviously giving
the more it's funny because giving the
more formal conference talks to you know
quote-unquote important people those are
actually much less useful because you're
at a conference and everyone's on their
laptop and you know no one really cares
who you are and stuff and you're just
kind of giving it because you have a
paper accepting I believe a talk so for
me the more informal talks are actually
very useful so I gave a tech talk here
last last two years ago or whatever and
somebody amazingly people came to my
Tech Talk who I didn't invite like there
are actual people who actually
interested that weren't my friends and
there's some guy in the back who was
like huh stirring me with questions and
I thought it was kind of being annoying
but then he ended up like afterwards
he's like I'm really interested in this
work
why didn't come intern for me this
summer and well I'll just let you work
on this your own open source project all
summer because I'm just interested in
these topics and and I accepted my
internship and that's what I spent last
summer doing it was basically I spent
all my time working on my open source my
open source research project here at
Google under his you know protection
because he was just interested in having
me around so that's an unexpected
serendipity of giving talks another one
was that after a talk because after you
give a talk people have her contacts
between it so some somebody another grad
student email me saying oh did you see
this blog post by blah blah I real a
topic that I saw the blog post and then
I emailed this guy a few months later
he's at Berkeley you know this guy a few
months later saying oh you know I'm
doing something related we chatted and
that was basically the foundation of two
of the two of the five project of
different thesis came out of talking
with that guy which would never happen
if I didn't give another talk and
another student had sent me a link to
his blog so weird stuff happens when
give talks yes
that's right that's right so the
question is how how easy or hard is it
evaluate people's motivations looking
for it I think I think that you just get
better at it every iteration through so
there's nothing perfect so you know why
I'm starting my career here I think that
I'm better at evaluating the the
motivations of my superiors and I was in
my first year of grad school and that's
another PhD learning thing I mean you
can learn this in industry you learn
this out of nowhere right if you work
with enough people you just you just get
more repetition than do it but I don't
think there's an easy answer but
obviously my thing was very much respect
so yeah okay let's get one last question
people can come up me offline I mean
I'll be happy to the red shirt yeah so
if I had intern at Google during my
undergrad I would probably be at Google
without my PhD yeah if I had back then
in those years Google is obviously this
was around 2003 2004 2005 so Google was
very up-and-coming Microsoft was a big
place that Microsoft was the Google of
internships back then they're like that
was their top internship program my
friends who went to Microsoft will rule
back then mostly went full-time there so
if I had actually had an amazing
internet experience I probably would not
have done my PhD I would not be giving
this talk here well well thanks a lot
and I'll be around afterwards for
questions
