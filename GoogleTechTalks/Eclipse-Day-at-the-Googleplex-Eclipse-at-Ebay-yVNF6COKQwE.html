the Eclipse Foundation and I really
appreciate you guys everyone attending
the this is the first time we've done
this type of event at the Googleplex and
we've been very pleased with with the
turnout and the response and so so thank
you what I'm gonna do is I'm going to do
a brief introduction of kind of the day
and then we'll jump into the first
present oops sorry first position so
first of all a game rob did the
introduction but this is all spot being
sponsored by the Google open source
program office so we really appreciate
their support on doing that just for the
facilities the the refreshments and so
we wouldn't be able to do it with
without their their help so that's been
a great community support from from from
google just a my brief commercial for
for eclipse so Ganymede or release train
is coming tomorrow so this is our annual
release train if you if you want to
check out the the latest bits from
eclipse org there's the URL it's going
live tomorrow 23 projects basically
during their annual release I often get
asked about how to get an eclipse shirt
we actually have a contest going on
right now it called Ganymede around the
world encouraging people to blog about
what they like about Ganymede if you do
a blog about what you like about
Ganymede will send you a clip shirt just
like this so if you ask me that's going
to be my response it would be great to
have some blogs written about this event
and what you liked about this event too
so if you go to the clip dialogue
website there's details on on that and
so that's my brief commercial for the
agenda I think we've got a great agenda
great number of speakers we're going to
have a main tent session with with
michael from from ebay talking about
their use of eclipse ide at ebay and
then we're gonna split into two
different rooms there's another room
called ames monument just next door
unfortunately rooms aren't equal size so
we did our best to try and kind of split
the the sessions the other rooms a lot
smaller so it might get too crowded in
there but there's always going to be
good sessions hidden here too but we'll
leave it up to you guys to decide what
which rooms you want to go to the way
to run this is is we're going to have
about 10 minutes break in between each
session and then a longer break around
350 round one four o'clock so if you can
quickly move if you need to move rooms
quickly move to the next room and we'll
have some time for the speaker to set up
but because we've got a full agenda
we're going to try and keep to it as
closely as possible and certainly at six
o'clock we'll have time for for lots of
discussions we're going to set up some
demos to of different interesting
Eclipse technology to take a look at two
during the reception so without further
ado I present Michael Gilpin yep galpin
sorry and who is software engineer at
ebay and it's actually done a number of
articles about how ebay is using eclipse
so i thought would be really interesting
for him to come and talk about what
they've been doing with eclipse ide ebay
so Michael all yours okay thanks again
yeah so as Imogen I am I were to ebay I
also do a lot of freelance writing
especially for IBM and last year might
some folks IBM said you know what are
some really interesting things that
people are doing with eclipse and I told
them you know every day I see a lot of
really interesting stuff because what
we're doing at eBay we do a lot of great
stuff with the clips and uh fortunately
the the powers-that-be ebay we're very
happy to take up we're going to show off
what we're doing at ebay so that the
rest of world can maybe learn a little
bit from what what we view
okay so um sort of the agenda for the
talk I like a little bit about the the
history of ebay just because it really
needs to our current architecture kind
of how we got there and some of the
challenges that that architecture
creates and also I like about our
organization at ebay and essentially our
architecture and organization they're
pretty unique to us and they give us
they create some very unique problems
for us and we've been very successful
using Eclipse to address a lot of those
problems okay so I he make started back
in nineteen eighty five it was written
called auction web a little known fact
that started on Labor Day weekend of 90
95 and our first architecture was called
well we've in hindsight we referred to
as a v1 architecture of course at the
time it was just this is how we built
the site and it was a pearl based
architecture right it didn't even have a
database for four day because it was
just file storage as simple flat files
being used to store store things right
so um not very sophisticated as you
might might say but it you know that the
the business idea took off pretty well
and I ebay so a lot of rapid growth
right and our whole pearl and file based
architecture wasn't really holding up to
well to that so he can with another
architecture that was officially called
the v2 you know version two very clever
name so it was a C++ back end so pretty
much all the Pearl was removed and
everything was written in C++ instead of
having a flat file system there was a
single database being used actually I
guess it was really two databases in the
sense there was a master-slave type
thing I don't really count that as being
multiple databases though
for our front end of the technology we
were using xslt sprite so pretty much
every request into our system would lead
to an XML file being created in C++ and
then an xslt processor what transform
that into HTML so back in the mid late
90s we thought this was a you know
pretty sophisticated architecture right
pretty clever use of XML and xslt new is
pretty cutting-edge we fought so that
held up pretty well pretty good for a
while on ebay in the late 90s
experienced you know exponential growth
and our site really really felt it right
there was we had some notable outages
we're seen in would show up saying hey
why is eBay having problems right and so
that led to a new architecture a
java-based architecture they're pretty
much a place to all the C++ the only
thing that stayed in C++ was our search
you know people don't think an eBay is a
big search site certainly not compared
to some other well-known search sites
but we actually do a lot of searches
every day and we have a constantly
changing data set that research on so
that was written in C++ and that still
is in C++ but pretty much everything
else was written in Java and by writing
things in Java it made it a lot easier
for us to to split databases to scale
our site across thousands of databases
right some folks think that relational
databases can't scale we would beg to
differ and doing things in Java also let
us do a lot of aggressive caching
strategies we have our own messaging
layer for making a lot of things
asynchronous we've gotten in trouble
before because that asynchronous nature
right we once got sued because people
said that when they listed an item it
didn't appear on the site as fast as it
they wanted it to right because it was
it's asynchronous process takes about a
minute or so for it appear but you know
some people want instant gratification
so for the front end we didn't change
anything right instead of instead of C++
classes creating XML files we had Java
classes creating XML files right so we
just left that completely as it was
and we had some growing pains by keeping
things that way so most things are
growing pains that probably any really
large website would experience you know
it's when you have so many assets that
you're managing it's easy to lose an
image in the mix or get the path of an
image messed up and have broken images
on your slides very embarrassing thing
to see right but it happens as our site
became more interactive there's more
more JavaScript being used and so more
more JavaScript more more JavaScript
errors as we scaled to thirty three
languages that became a big challenge to
localizing XSL really localizing any
kind of template based presentation
technology is has a lot of challenges
right and as the world keep moving
forward and there was became this notion
of a web two point oh right there was a
lot more a lot more pressure on us to
make our UI more modern more interactive
to use things like Ajax and flash to
increase the user experience all right
so mixing that in with XSL sometimes
kind of scary right so Along Came
another architecture the v4 architecture
and this is about two years old started
the v4 project started about about two
years ago so where we used to have
that's SL we got rid of that and we
placed it with Java in fact we resize
any kind of templating at all whether it
be HTML or you can imagine other
template solutions like PHP or jsps we
got rid of all that and we replace lat
with Java CSS as a our site agree we
made more more use of CSS right and we
got rid of that too though and we
replace that with Java might see a
pattern here javascript where do you
think of it with that well actually we
kept that around we like JavaScript
but we wanted some Java on top of it to
make us feel better about it right so in
short we love Java and ebay I mean we
really love Java so I like to say that
the v4 really brought a lot of the a lot
of the philosophy of the java
programming language q web development
okay but Java is not a silver bullet it
doesn't solve everything and it presents
its own set of problems and introduces
so if you look at ebay com everything
you see there is in some way or another
java in our system that means everything
is code right so an image that's a java
class for us a static link like a link
to a help page right that that's a
that's a java class for us oops some of
that what else we got CSS so that's
actually several Java classes for a
given CSS file JavaScript we have
JavaScript but for every piece of
JavaScript there's also Java classes
corresponding that JavaScript for for
content we didn't you know we we didn't
go with your resource bundle approach
that a lot of Java guys would favor we
have a little more complicated system
and so content that's also Java classes
so that could be a lot of code to write
and can you imagine if every time you
wanted to introduce a new image on your
site you had to go write a Java class
all right every time you wanted to
create a new link to a help page or
whatever its new Java class right so
what do we do well we use Eclipse
instead of making developers have to
write all this Java code or abandoning
this architecture and saying well let's
go back to the days of this random
string representing everything we use
Eclipse to do all the grunt work force
to do all the hard parts that would make
only make our developers go insane so we
use a lot of code generators right so
when you have a CSS file I know if you
guys can
can you see pretty good that was a dot
CSS file right you could create one of
these guys and in the clips you can
right click on it and you get a context
menu that recognizes it's a CSS file and
well as you generate well that's a Java
code for it javascript same same thing
right take a javascript file you can
right-click on it you can generate
javascript for you can also validate
make sure that what you're going to do
is going to is going to work we we use
essentially some meta programming on top
of javascript to introduce java style
types right so we can say this
particular javascript function you know
it takes these has these three
parameters to a more strings one's an
integer and it produces this type of
object right and we do static you know
compile time checking of that right so
of course sometimes you could you could
screw up the meta programming on top of
the programming itself right so you can
do some validation content same thing
you might notice here that we have over
here this survey dot for cc that's a
Content contract for us it defines what
you have to give our system for it to
produce a localized piece of content
right so some of the ways this is more
more complex than your typical resource
bundles is sometimes for a particular
string there may be depending on the
language different types of data you
need to determine that string right so
some languages have gender in them other
languages don't right so for some lame
because you may need three input values
may be other than using for an
additional input value for gender right
so we essentially create a contract
saying hey what's everything you're
going to need to create this localized
piece of content what's all the data you
need so it creates sort of a data model
that content and then of course we just
generate lots of java stuff for that
right so we've also created a lot of a
lot of editors and I've been plucking
out content this is what our content
editor looks like right so lets you edit
a contract and then for a particular
contract you can have one or more
bundles we always by default create an
english us bundle right so that's all
our fallback in case you there is no the
earlier localization occurs we have at
least one language and from this editor
you can you can edit the fee the
contract itself and add bundles to it
alright so typically non-programmers are
going to use would use this to four
bundles right they don't care about they
don't care about what the code is where
the Java code here is behind the scenes
actually our contracts or XML files
right they don't want to edit XML either
right these are people who are
translating stuff we also have a really
nice javascript editor that we're
working on currently that's not its
hoping it might be ready for for this
presentation but it's not quite ready i
mentioned how we we capture a lot of
metadata about javascript a lot of sort
of you know static typing that you would
have in java we also do things like
dependency management like you do in
java so you can imagine like an import
statement in Java we have a needs
statement right to make sure that any
JavaScript you need is going to be
present and so combining all these
things with eclipse has led us to create
a really amazing javascript editor an
IDE that gives you if you can imagine
everything that doing Java development
has in Eclipse we have it in JavaScript
now or we have it very very soon we also
have a lot of like a visual explorers
okay so i mentioned how we take images
and links we turn those into java
classes to be literally every night we
have a build system that looks in our in
our source code trees it looks at all
the images and looks at metadata files
for all of our links and generates a
giant java jar with java classes for
everything in there but there's a lot
and it is a very big site and so finding
things can be can be tricky so we
created some more eclipse plugin some
visual explorers so we have explorist
for images where you can sort of browse
through and do searches through those
jars right it'll show you all the images
it'll show you localized versions of the
images that they exist right in many
cases particular image we want to
localize it for different countries
same thing for links right so again you
can you can find out these different
links and when you're finally these
links you can just right click and copy
it and it'll copy all the Java
information you're going to need to use
in your code we also have a very
interesting application model right that
it's kind of similar q to jsf if you
guys are if you're familiar with JSF if
you can imagine a jsf where you we're
kind of able to create your own phases
and your own life cycles however you
solve it that's kind of similar what our
application model is like and so we have
a another Eclipse plugin rewrote first
or visualizing the application model
their drugs the application what are the
different requests to the application
for each one of those requests what kind
of parameters does it take and making
everything as Java has allowed us to
create a really rich component model so
a visual component for us is it's a Java
class of course but it's able to tell
you everything it needs right so if it's
the need CSS if it needs JavaScript if
it needs localized content again it is
rough this refers to the Java classes
represent each one of those things right
so this has allowed us to have
tremendous reuse of code across our site
I'm gonna show you guys a picture later
of one of our webpages decomposed into
components right and so we have a very
rich library of components were able to
reuse and we also have an eclipse plugin
for for browsing and searching through
components and visualizing those
components will also have lots of
wizards I mentioned our application
model right so in our application model
there is different types of applications
is going to be a single page application
a multi-page application and then
depending on what on what you pick
there's different different things
you're gonna need to create for the
application different artifacts you need
which that could be a lot to deal with a
lot of things to remember okay i did a
multi-page things i need to create this
particular class to manage the state of
the mole of the multi-page flow right so
we have wizards again so that you just
kind of answer it's a typical wizard
like a questionnaire you can sir you
know is it one page to page what kind of
parameters what kind of requests and it
creates a skeleton then you just kind of
fill anything
so on when we really created v4 our
focus was on addressing a lot of sort of
holistic you know large-scale problems
right making sure we can manage things
like you know content and JavaScript and
CSS in a better way and we've seen huge
gains for that we've seen you know
tremendous dropping our bug numbers our
QA cycles of have shortened quite a bit
right but with having all these you know
creating all this Java code around
things drama being a very very verbose
language we're very worried about the
developer productivity so we could a lot
of plugins as I've shown we also did
some some more clever things one of
those consuming we called Irv 'let's the
D and dervla tis sort of for Darwin like
evolution you're very very very full of
ourselves without I think but uh so this
is a real java class right and it's
really just you know one one method with
one single line of code and in our
system you can take this and run it you
can run this as a dervla it'll start an
embedded web server for you it'll bring
up bring up a browser or whatever your
default browser is on your system with
that with that web page loaded
automatically right so there's no
there's no tom cat or jboss or anything
like that to start and stop and deal
with is no deployment to worry about you
can just take any piece of code and and
right click on it and you don't even
have to have any kind of interface here
there's no interface there's no
annotation there's nothing here saying
you know oh this is a dermal it right
you can just right click on on any class
and and run it as a Dervla all right so
this is this really helps with
productivity right you can really
especially if what you're doing is
concentrating on the presentation side
of things you can you know create things
and testings very very rapidly so
another productivity tweak ample if only
called spyglass
so on the on the left for you guys
that's the my ebay page it's the beta
version of it that you can go to you
right now and I've enabled this thing
called spyglass and spyglass it shows
basically everything that's in a red box
is a component in our system right and
each one of these guys you can click on
them and you get all kinds of options of
what you can do with that component so
in this case this member badge you know
very very common piece you see in lots
of ebay pages right it's actually a
fairly complicated little piece of a
piece of machinery there to figure out
you know what numbers to show what kind
of start a show but this gets reused
everywhere and you can simply from your
browser from firefox from the net
explorer click on it and you get lots of
choices but the third one is what's most
interesting open in Eclipse right so
back in a developer is eclipse machine
they get they have another option called
start your embedded server this is a
listener server it's going to listen for
essentially HTTP requests that's going
to allow you to to go back and forth
from a live web page right right into
eclipse so you can see something on the
page maybe maybe you had a bug filed
against you saying okay this one
components got some problem you can go
to that page right you could bring up
spyglass and you can go directly to the
real code in Eclipse right there now of
course you can't access spyglass just
anywhere I couldn't do a live demo of
this past me within an IP IP domain
owned by ebay for us to enable spyglass
we don't and we don't we don't own
google so so I couldn't couldn't use it
here but um but very useful for
developers okay so I kind of talked
about our architecture so it's like a
little bit about our organization you
know ebay like every startup we started
very very small but now we're we're not
so small we have about fifteen sixteen
thousand people in many many countries
we have two big offices here we have you
know offices in
a very large development center in China
the other one in India so in the UK
Germany so anytime your organ grows
bigger and bigger that can cause you a
lot of lot of stress right become much
harder to do development when you know
you have you know two guys here in San
Jose working with two guys in China and
one guy in Germany and we have lots of
people writing lots of code in edible
you get lots of dependencies right so
you can imagine any large code base is
gonna have lots dependency and we have a
very large code base we we even a rolls
our entire site every two weeks and we
roll couple million lines of code every
two weeks and so you can imagine there's
a tremendous number of interdependencies
that occur so between organization and
dependencies a lot of complexity right
and it can be really hard to manage
things and that can really you know
really hurt developer productivity hurt
everyone's productivity so again when it
comes to managing complexity you know we
can return to eclipse so on this screen
this is the package Explorer and eclipse
probably very familiar to you guys each
one of those are projects so this was a
this was a very small workspace for e
base buddy Bay standards i was working
on right it was actually only only
changing kernel code like very low level
infrastructure code right folks so most
of our product developers they're going
to deal with all this code and then a
whole lot more application and domain
specific code as well right and you can
see just a number of projects here right
I can only get down into do da right
mean I that's not very far right this is
a long scroll box of lots and lots and
lots of projects and there's lots of the
penalties between all these different
projects I mean can you imagine having
to set all this up yourself and eclipse
right good luck so we have a build
system as you might guess and we have
Eclipse plugins for the for the build
system so this is showing a little
toolbar we have right there's couple
different kinds of built we have but
this guy is the one that's most fun and
kind of see says this one does it all if
you click on it this is what you get
so this single build is essentially
going to not as build all the code but
it's going to create all the Eclipse
projects and create all the dependencies
between all the Eclipse projects and
then import them all into your workspace
so you're ready to work right so with
one click your development environment
is set up now it takes a while after you
click that as you might guess but still
so um I mentioned all these different
projects and all the dependencies gap
between them so again we created another
another clips plugin from managing these
dependencies right so this is just
showing one particular project and all
the projects it depends on and then for
each one of those projects what projects
do they depend on right and so we
actually save all this information into
our a very lightweight XML format right
that you can imagine the most
lightweight translation of XML is this
and that's pretty much what this what we
save things to ask but that lets us
create all these eclipses projects for
people automatically okay so I'm having
lots and lots and lots of code means
having lots lots of code in Eclipse and
I love eclipse but eclipsed use a lot of
memory this by itself and when you load
in you know millions of lines of code
and thousands and thousands of classes
and you start doing you know ctrl shift
key so you can search for things it's a
lot of stuff gets loaded into memory
right so you can see this is a new clips
ini file right where we're saying we're
going to start this guy with a gig of
memory and give it up 22 gigs of memory
and give it up a gig a perm gen space
right so this is actually you know a
very typical thing for us but believe it
or not that's that's not enough
sometimes for us sometimes even giving
Eclipse two gigs of memory will still
get out of memory errors from eclipse so
we worked on on lightening our load
right some way to make it where we could
deal with lots lots of code in Eclipse
without needing you know 10 gigabytes of
memory to do it and we came with me we
called mega jars so um
so for a given project if you're working
on my ebay or if you're working on you
know some you know one particular
application in ebay you're going to need
you know hundreds or thousands millions
of lines of code thousands and thousands
of classes but chances are what you're
actually going to be changing yourself
is a pretty small subset of that right
so when you when you're working from a
source code repository you're going to
check everything out bring everything
into your workspace but with with mega
jars we essentially have a way of saying
okay what am I asked me to change and
what can this be read-only right and
whatever is read-only will create one
big mega jar for it on the fly right I
will attach the source code without jar
file and then will reconfigure all of
your projects and Eclipse to refer to
that jar instead of individual source
code right so because the source code
still attached you still get you know
all the big Lucy javadoc and what not
inside the clips you can even you know
you know control click on one of those
classes in that jar and you'll show you
the code for you just can't change a
coat right so this this has been a well
I think it's been a great boon for us
when I first wrote the the articles for
for IBM the guy who actually wrote our
mega jar was plugin he was like mega
charge is just a band-aid right it's
still you know if you have you know we
still need to get goodbye to memory for
eclipse but it's still it's a lot better
so ok so we can have some essentials
right bathing that all of our developers
are going to use and one of the most
useful one is an auto configuration
plug-in right so um I've been showing
mostly plugins we wrote for v4 for this
presentation architecture we have we
have a lot of other stuff that a lot of
other cody bit it's not just
presentation code and we have a lot of
other Clips plugins so we have a very
interesting data access layer that is a
jpa implementation if you're familiar
with jpa but we've added a lot of things
on top of jpa to make it more
and we have all the clips plug-ins for
that and we have you know other other
systems as well that I probably don't
even know about that have Eclipse
plugins and sometimes it just figuring
out what eclipse plugin is you're going
to need that became a headache too right
and then dealing with versioning right
so as as we're changing sort of you know
for framework code we also might need to
evolve our plugins right so making sure
that you have the right version of the
plug-in to go with your framework code
that became hard to write so it came
with his auto configuration where it'll
inspect all the code in your workspace
and figure out what plugins you need and
what versions you need and then you know
change your clips to install those the
appropriate plugins we also use a lot of
plugins that we didn't write a me when
one of my favorites it's fine bugs and
find bugs was a really good job of
finding bugs and yeah so it's it's
surprising how many things that this
this guy will catch right and we
developers use it our QA uses it as well
as another line of defense to make sure
you know essentially you know bad things
it may not get caught in testing don't
make it out to production we've
customized find bucks quite a bit by
adding your own rules to it we use clear
case for our source code management
obviously there are a lot of depending
on what kind of source code management
using there's a lot of great plugins out
there I'm for integrating with the clips
clear case as a as an excellent plugin
and we use the the web tools what tools
project platform works figure the P
stands for right so we deploy to Apache
Geronimo so when you use when yous our
plugins we automatically create a
Geronimo server for you right so that
when you when you're ready to deploy to
a server and really test out your code
in a production ish environment then I
if you don't have to set up a server for
you or anything like that and that is
the end so
add a little low offer questions
volkswagen's over there pardon me um no
we do not know I do not okay we um yeah
we we do when it comes to Ajax we do do
a fair amount then we're doing a little
bit more as time goes on of Java to
JavaScript translation right however if
you in our experience if you create a
lot of your UI if you quit it completely
in JavaScript right and then on the
client render it like that it's very
slow right the job itself and quit is
not slow but just creating the you why
it's often write this you know it's much
faster if you want to create you know a
text box to create an HTML pump back to
the browser Jimmy generating to jealous
would write the it's not a job another
JavaScript part it's slow is the way the
browser interpret the JavaScript right
so if you in a straight Dom on that
that's the that's the most horribly slow
thing you can do if you just get a big
string and tell it Oh innerhtml this
here's this big string it's a little bit
faster but if you just if you know what
the if you know what the HTML is going
to look like on the server and you pump
at HTML to the browser is going to be
much faster than using javascript fork
so we we do like some of the things in
quit and we do use we have some things
that are kind of similar but we would
never we would never use it at least not
with the current the currents are
browsers out there today turbulance the
way understood
in a highlight a bunch of code and then
run it so that implies there's an
implicit container and that's an
implicit component how do you do that is
there kind of like an aspect-oriented
wrapper around that so actually any
class you can right click on the class
maybe my examples back i should have
kind of over there in the editor you can
go over on the package Explorer and
right click on the class and essentially
what our plug-in looks for is a class
has a single method that produces what
we call a d node right so this is going
to become a node in an HTML Dom right so
again we don't use in the HTML right we
don't use any jsps we don't use we use
everything in java using ebay com that
is all java class one point so we have
we have a dom style approach to it so we
take a class okay is I have one thing
that produces a node if it does then
there's a producer is it prints a whole
HTML document okay maybe it doesn't do
that so it doesn't produce that then we
can just create you know a head and the
body around things right and then
creates you know the sort of decorated
to create a full HTML document right so
that that way you can just write you
know a very minimal amount of code is
whatever is interesting to you and you
can immediately run it and look at it
yeah
you know about spyglass are you
injecting stuff into the HTML stream
within your network in order to do that
nothing was done already there and
you're making physical through CSS yeah
we that's right we inject some CSS and
some JavaScript right we don't inject it
in our network it's just that if when
our servers are going to send out the
respond to a request they know that
comes from our internal network or not
right and so they will enable or disable
this one extra step of adding this stuff
on the server itself right but based on
where the IP addresses in the very back
two very good questions yeah so the
first question was if we done any any
user studies or ask developers how they
like the tools it's all right okay and
the second question was are we planning
on open sourcing it so the first
question yes we've done exhaustive you
know surveys and study groups with
developers and developers are just like
anybody else right you put something new
in front of them and you ask them what
do you think right they're going to give
you 20 things they hate about it right
and that's fantastic right because you
can you can immediately address their
pain points figure okay you know so
we're getting a lot of cycles around
improving the framework itself and
improving the tools around the framework
to help help the developer productivity
open sourcing the answer is yes we want
very much to open source it we don't
have any definite dates yet but it is
our desire we've we make use of a lot of
open source technologies I mean
obviously eclipse when I mentioned the
whole running things as Derval it's
we're using jetty present an embedded
you know servlet container and it is our
or great desire to give back the open
source community I wish I could tell you
that yes this is all going to be
available you know the open source
tomorrow but I'm not Steve Jobs so on
well it is our intention to open source
everything I've shown every day
okay how do you deal with
organization-wide deployment it looks
like some of it is autumn with your
automatic configuration future but how
else to do a large skillet play yeah so
so our are variant of the clips we call
the e de the ebay development
environment and essentially we have a
internal website you know just I've been
ed-e and it has an installer right and
you run the run the Installer installs
the right jvm that's going to be used
it's our production JVM it installs the
clip stalls all the plugins all the all
of the fault plugins right like find
bugs and wtp and things like that and
then once you so that gives you learning
it also sets things like your your heap
size so that way you don't want our
memory so easily and we integrate with
clear case so it's going to find clear
case on your system and do all kinds of
good stuff like that and then once
you're running Eclipse and you have some
code that you from out in your workspace
then you can do the other configuration
tool to get additional plugins that are
specific to whatever kind of development
you're doing so we try to make it as
painless as possible cuz it developers
are wasting a lot of time on configuring
their tools I mean that's just a
terrible thing right and then also gives
you this you know sort of you know big
friction where you don't want to make
your tools and you better because that
means developers have to go through and
get the new tools and deal with figuring
out the new tools right and we want to
make our tools better so we try to make
it you know very very seamless for folks
it's never not always perfect but we we
try very hard any more questions right
here are your rinse
a lot of praise but just kill you um
yeah so any any negatives around using
eclipse I mean I if its memory footprint
was smaller we if you know if if we
could have you know load you know a
couple million classes and it didn't you
know that create such a resource drain
on things those would be nice but i'm
not sure if there's a whole you can do
around that i know i mean i really
really quite happy with what things we
leave we'vewe've over the years kind of
grown a bigger and bigger organization
that's just devoted to you know creating
more more you know internal tools for us
right then because we've seen such such
a great trade-off between you know we
can have you know a cold developers
write a couple tools then that just
helps thousands of developers in our
company wherever there i think yeah
your strategy has been in a way to
abandon domain-specific language
I see that people write CSS and then you
generate to Java does that mean that
some people still writing CSS and if
that's the case then you support around
trip in other words if someone makes a
change in the Java that's been generated
and that go back to CSS stay in the
datum a good question um so so for each
one of our different things I've showed
up there we we stick where one of our
big principles is having a single source
of truth right so for anything for CSS
for JavaScript for content there's
always exactly one single source of
truth they may be other things are
generated from it but those things we
don't check in for example right there's
only ever one one source of truths that
way you'll have to keep being
synchronized and that varies a little
bit depending on what you're talking
about for CSS we've abandoned CSS
completely right we you mentioned
domains with languages we actually have
what we consider our own domain specific
language that we've written on top of
Java for doing CSS right it gives you
all the all this effects of CSS where
you can any kind of selector you can
imagine writing the CSS you can write in
our in our language but it's also
object-oriented allows for inheritance
and allows for the localization things
that you are hard to do normally in CSS
so we have the code generator because
for a lot of folks you know it's easier
to write a prototype and use normal CSS
first people are still learning things
right we did want to tell people hey
forget CSS here's our java version of
things you have to learn this and go
cold turkey right so we gave people the
ability to take an existing CSS file and
generate sort of a I know sort of kick
start their development right bootstrap
it right we don't check any CSS files
into our system in fact our code name
system what you check in and CSS file
right these dot CSS file it'll give you
an air only do a check-in in our
when we generate the code for we do use
Java Docs to show you what the what the
real CSS was going to look like right so
any time you could go and scrape that
right and dumped into a CSS file and we
regenerate and do round trips if you
wanted to that way but our intention is
to let people just use it as an initial
bootstrap for the other thing is kind of
similar is JavaScript in JavaScript we
didn't try to replace JavaScript we
actually like JavaScript quite a bit you
know it's a great functional programming
language right we we created extra
metaprogramming on top of it till I'll
sort of Java proxies for JavaScript
right where I can create a button on a
page and I can you know associate a
JavaScript of the handler and everything
is strongly typed in Java right but in
that case we keep the JavaScript around
it has its extra metaprogramming inside
of it and we don't in the all the Java
code is generated by our build system
but we don't but it's it's it's
throwaway code right it's just generated
stuff so we take a little different
approach depending on what type of
technology it is but in each case
there's only one source of truth
which is whenever I've seen you know
people trying to generate HTML from Java
code you know the mill you know have you
know God table blah you know it what I'm
saying is it can be very verbose
compared to the domain specific language
whether CSS HTML which is concise and
easy to understand so how do you get
around the problem right writing Java
code right so we have a full dominant
with the implementation right and you
could go the Dom route but we recognized
early on that Don programming is
generally very very painful right not
painful it's not complicated but it says
it's very verbose a lot of stuff to
write a lot of you know document create
elements and a pinch Isles and all this
stuff right so we created extensions on
top of all that for especially for HTML
classes and again we created what we
consider another dsl on top of java for
doing HTML well if you if you use our
dsl it looks almost exactly like the
HTML line by line right so we have a lot
of a lot of cases where if you're you're
adding maybe you have a div and your add
them to the div what gets returned by
that ad is the same div right so you can
kind of do this cascading style to make
it look just like the HTML looks right
so that you know we never wanted people
they have an excuse of saying oh I like
the other way better because there's
less stuff to write right so our Java
code looks looks very very similar to
HTML code there one more quick question
my baby room like for us today since
there's a lot of gold and each day what
must be working on between pieces of the
website does these developers or what
space in eclipse or we manage we have my
packages which a developer can yeah so
the question was if do each developers
workspaces look very similar eclipse so
you know we're using you know clear case
radio source code management so usually
for a given project there'll be a view
spec right which is what parts of the
code that you need for this particular
project and that'll be shared by people
and so anybody working on that same
product that same view you look very
similar right and if they use the auto
configuration stuff even their tools
look very very similar right so I mean
if for some reason you know you and a
colleague if your computer's not working
one day you go over to his computer and
everything will set up very very very
similar me of course there could be some
minor differences but um but if you have
two people who had very different
projects they're working on then the
code in their workspace could be a lot
different and even their plugins might
be quite a bit different so so yes or no
