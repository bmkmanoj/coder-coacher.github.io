I'm one of the co-chairs for SD forum
tech women the other co-chair is Sonja
London who comes from a further distance
than I do and got caught in traffic so
we're delighted to have you all here we
had 100 over 160 people registered
you'll have I don't know if you'll be
happy to know or not but you're one of
the privileged few we actually turned
many people away today so which we're
thrilled about not that they didn't get
to you know what I mean that didn't come
out quite right did it anyway SD forum
is a nonprofit organization it's been
around for about 20 years and originally
was the software development forum they
spread their responsibilities got more
involved with everything with hardware
development and high-tech and biotech
etc so now if you'll talk to the CEO
Susan Lucas con well she will tell you
it is the SuperDuper forum we are the
tech women we're all volunteers who run
the cigs and the special programs were
one of the special programs our mission
is to support the advancement of women
in technology and to encourage girls to
pursue education to prepare them for
careers in technology we're very proud
of the fact that we have worked with
northrop grumman to host or to sponsor
teams now for our girl teams for the
tech challenge put on by the tech museum
we've done it for three years now we
have one of the women one of our girls
women who's been involved Veronica Hume
who has participated for three years and
with her partner in crime Diana Chen
they've now set up a check girls website
which I will send you information about
when I send out the survey afterwards so
that's our basic mission just curious
how many people have ever been to an SD
forum event before oh great and I also
want to give you a brief introduction
from Association of Women MBAs Sheila
Ursel Thank You Franson
so hi everyone I'm Sheila or some I am
the president of association women MBAs
I wanted to know how many of you heard
of the organization going to prepare her
fabulous I didn't expect so many people
but it's great to know that and welcome
we are partnering with St forum we've
been around for 10 years we've done a
pretty bad job of marketing ourselves so
we do trying to get better at it and we
are also a non-profit basically run by
10 women who on the board one of them
happens to be here Christina please
stand up she's done all the marketing
world for this so if you are here
probably because of Christina quick
thing we do events once a month very
similar to this career oriented events
and mostly in San Francisco we're trying
to move here to the south bay and really
honored to partner with se forum and
other organizations one way you can help
us is to find a spaces to do events we
have some great speakers lined up one of
them in Barbara she's right here and we
have other speakers lined up but we are
always short on finding space if you can
help us with that the other is we have a
flyer which is on a chair so join us on
facebook on linkedin there are so many
women just like you and our organization
although it's for women MBAs we actually
encourage people anybody with a master's
degree or anyone you anybody who wants
to just try event can also come in a
tent so hope to see you some some other
time did you by the way we do programs
pretty much every month next month may
twentieth we're partnering with what's
called the el cig the engineering
leadership sig to do a program on
engineering leadership that will be a
panel of men and women engineering
leaders managers vice presidents etc who
will be interviewed by mala Devlin of
Cisco who's written a book on
engineering management so she's going to
be doing that may twentieth and that's
going to be at SI p we by the way also
are dependent on companies to host us
and next month we actually need someone
to help sponsor refreshments so if you
know if your company is willing to
provide few hundred dollars for that
that would be great come see me or Sonja
so is Sonja I don't know if Susan
Kelleher is here and Jenny ho these
the co-chairs who handle our tech girls
patty doc is our new director of
marketing stand up and we have several
people who are helping us do blogging
and tweeting during the event so we
always need volunteers you can tell you
a bit more about that later when I send
you the after you're done you're going
to get an email tomorrow probably that's
going to ask you for feedback on the
event I will include information about
our LinkedIn group and about some of the
other groups that we have formed because
we're trying to create a community for
SD forum tech women and i'll also send
you the link to the tech girls website
i'd like to thank Google for hosting us
Susan Kwok in particular Susan is hiding
out in the corner but I'll bring her up
in a minute this has taken a lot of work
to get this all put together it's hard
to imagine what she's had to do behind
the scenes and by the way we originally
had said there would be 90 people when
168 said they were going to come Susan
did her best to get the food allotment
increased but catering needed more time
so for those of you who may not have
been properly fed there will be pizzas
coming in a few in about I don't know
half an hour or so because we don't we
don't want anyone to be hungry but quite
frankly we hadn't expected such a
fantastic turnout with that I'd like to
introduce Susan Susan is a quality
engineer here at Google and she's one of
the heads of the Google women in
engineering international we I as I
Rionda stand it network and Susan is the
one who's done all this work back here
at Google so if you could talk a little
bit about your group and about Google
that would be great
alright thank you very much everyone for
coming um wow this is such a big turnout
we didn't expect so many of you to be
here but we're really glad to have you
here so I've been a part of Google for
almost four and a half years now and I'm
a test engineer so I'm not actually an
event coordinator even though I may seem
like i'm doing about coordinating and i
just wanted to give a little bit of
intro just to what Google does for its
employees so a qui I network Google
engineers I network is actually an
employee resource group here at Google
there are multiple groups here whether
it be BGN black cougar network or
Hispanic network or Greg leurs or gag
leurs a bunch of these employee resource
groups we do have just diversity be
packing these groups and allowing us to
sponsor these types of events to have
people come on campus and have tech
talks and you know Catherine come on
board and and do tech talks like this so
I've always found Google to be a very
supportive company especially in this
area in terms of supporting diversity
anyway without further ado I would want
to bring up um Catherine and grab my
notes here Catherine started out as an
engineer and she also got her MBA she's
worked at companies such as motorola gte
Accenture scopus and siebel she
currently she has done executive search
for a dozen years now and she currently
does at works for UCLA Anderson business
school doing counseling for alumni and I
just engine right now she was publishing
her book which should come out shortly
and we will have a little raffle for
that too so you might get a nifty copy
if you did drop your business card when
you registered okay um and let me get
Catherine up here
I'm going to get started because you'll
find out that I have a lot of energy and
I've got a lot of information i want to
share with you but i'm going to start
we've all been summoned for jury duty
but how many have actually been on a
jury before yeah a few of you I actually
had an interesting experience that
that's relevant to this and and it goes
back to the days i was in strategy
consulting so i have to put you in the
context i was working 60-plus hours a
week traveling four to five days a week
so when jury duty came is like good i
get a break and i sat on a jury and they
let us out thursday at noon well anyone
that knows me knows I'm not somebody who
plays hooky but I was going to play
hooky and so I had lived in Southern
California at the time my favorite thing
to do was go bike riding down the beach
so i'm i'm driving towards the beach
toward my condo near the beach I'm gonna
go bike riding got to get my car washed
Oh what else should I do you should be a
successful businesswoman and then mentor
young women I have no idea where it came
from but it resonated with me okay and
that's how I figured out my mission in
life driving from jury duty to the car
wash okay now i start with it because
today what I'm going to do is start with
that career strategy and that vision
because you need that to be able to
drive your decisions and where you're
headed to so it starts with that career
strategy and I'll go through that the
second thing that I'm going to go
through today is career paths as an
executive recruiter I spent a lot of
time going through thousands and
thousands of resumes actually for the
book i also did groundbreaking research
looking at well what backgrounds did
people come to to get to vp marketing
product management sales CEO and and
what paths did they take so i'll take
you through that the third part of it is
i'll take you through the skills needed
at the top I've been running a career
development program now for five years
with Stanford Business School
oh land with UCLA business school and I
interview panels of executives panels of
women i love it when i have panels of
women for VPS of marketing from top
Silicon Valley companies that was a fun
panel and I summarize the information
from over a 125 of these speakers over
the five years to put it into a
leadership skills model of the skills
you need as you're advancing in your
career and then the last part is well
what's this all mean and how do I put it
in a career development plan and the key
around that is a lot of people if
they're working in a large company with
a very supportive organization you might
get career development but many of the
companies and especially if you're
unemployed or moving from startup two
startup you might not get that career
development so it's really your own
responsibility to look at how do I
advance from where I am how do i make
myself resilient for the next economy
and and how do I continue my own career
development so will help you put that
into a plan so let me start by taking
you through career strategy and this is
a I'll go back to the that's the story
that I talked to you about with my own
career development and and how that
guided the career decisions that I made
so back when I was in strategy
consulting I after I figured out what
that mission in life was I figured out
okay have to be a successful
businesswoman being a consultant wasn't
going to get me there and I needed to go
into company but if you know secret is a
consultant has no functional skills
whatsoever so I there were three
different paths that I could take since
i worked at accenture everybody in had
an engineering degree everybody thought
it was a technical consultant so I could
go into professional services consulting
implementing solutions that was one path
the second one was I had done one
project defining product development
process for one technology company
therefore I knew what product managers
did so I could go into product
management that's how consultants do it
they do one project and then the third
was a corporate strategy since I've been
doing strategy consulting I could go
into corporate strategy but I thought
about it that would put me into an ivory
tower and I was trying to go on to run a
business and so I didn't think that
would get me there so it was my third
path well I ended up landing at scopus
running the telecom vertical for product
marketing and defining the products that
that scopus was offering now we were
acquired by Siebel and one of the things
I didn't say is work-life balance was
very important to me and if anybody
knows the reputation of siebel systems
it doesn't really have work-life balance
and so I stayed and got our product out
and then decided to go on job search and
my started that by going trekking in
Nepal that's a good place to start your
job search and the other place I started
was reaching out to executive recruiters
you just let him know I'm in the job
market and one of them said have you
ever considered search I said no but I'm
willing to listen and and i found out
that executive search was consulting but
around people and back when we were in
strategy consulting we'd say it'd be
better to have a be strategy with an a
team that would execute on it so now all
of a sudden I was working on putting
that a team into companies and guess
what i have a new way of achieving that
vision of becoming a successful
businesswoman and being able to mentor
others i can look at what other
successful executives are doing and how
they're getting into companies why
they're getting into companies and then
share that with people so i'm here today
ok and but you can see how that mission
guided me and help me make that decision
otherwise they'd say why would i go into
executive search now it also guided a
couple other things I started my own
executive search business during the
last recession so I decided I needed to
be on a board so why not start a women's
group so that's how we started pan w
back during the last recession and again
the goal was to help women in their
development and networking I found
wonderful successors in Francine Gordon
when I was having my second child and
needed to step down from that role but
after my
second son was a year old i needed to do
something else so started yet another
career development program in the
getting to the top series that we
started at stanford business school so
again I kept doing things that followed
this mission and so I lead this life
where I love everything I do because
it's so connected with my core and
that's what you want with that strategy
now you look at this kind of drawing of
course I have to I'm an engineer so I
have to have some kind of process map up
there but the whole thought is what is
that direction that you want to achieve
and figuring out what that is and that
will guide you a lot of people you know
I like asking that interview question of
what do you want to do in five to ten
years you know what is that that you
want to do because that's going to guide
you and I find that if you have that
direction you're more likely to achieve
that you know think about we had one
panelist that said I want to be CEO of
IBM okay and her name is Shelly our
Shambo if any of you know her she's a
CEO here in Silicon Valley and she was a
long time IBM person and she actually
while she was at IBM she found out that
every CEO had had a stint in Japan so
she decided to do a stint in Japan well
if anybody's met her she's a six-foot
tall african-american woman going to
Japan and even her mentor said you got a
lot of challenges in front of you good
thing you're bright and so she went off
to Japan well over the course of her
career she realized well I still want to
be CEO but she was getting further away
from what she wanted to be doing she
liked working with the customer and
being closer to it and the more
bureaucratic and higher up in a large
organization she got it all became
people issues internal issues and so she
decided she didn't want to do that she
moved to the west coast as president of
blockbuster calm and then she moved on
and she's CEO of metrics dream today so
she still had that vision of I want to
be a CEO of IBM it changed and she
wanted to become CEO of something else
so it'll change a couple times over your
life in fact Lili Pratt king who's
sitting in our audience used
rear coach and extraordinary I should
say and and Lili was one of the
panelists also and she quoted one of the
professors from Stanford said you'll
probably end up repotting yourself nine
times during your career and I think I'm
up to about seven right now so um but
you will go through that so that long
term goal will change but if you have
something that's driving it you'll start
you'll keep achieving it and the example
I give is coming how many friends have
you had that say I'm going to run a
marathon and they're the people that
don't even park at the far side of the
parking lot okay and then the next thing
you know three months later they run a
marathon but because they stated that
goal they're going to achieve it so the
first thing is figuring out what is that
long term direction that you want to
achieve now then the other part is there
are my process flow map here there's
four pivot points in that transition the
first one is level and getting that
promotion from manager to director and
vp the second part sometimes you have to
take the lateral moves to move up the
side step to move up or the down to move
up and so you can take a lateral move
into a new function may be moving from
engineering to pre sales consulting to
IT to marketing to sales that'd be a
great one to go into and making that
lateral move you can also move companies
we have a lot of people in Silicon
Valley that do move by going in between
company and then the fourth one is new
industry and that's not necessarily new
company because even when I left siebel
systems they said well we're starting
all these new verticals you could run
the utility vertical so you can take on
new industry expertise like if you want
clean tech do it within your own company
and branch out into those things within
your own company now when you're making
these steps within your career anytime
you're trying to do a transition that
goes over one it's much easier than
going two or three at the same time so
if you are moving between companies it's
why the employers really want someone
who's been there done that they it's
harder if you're trying to change to get
a promotion
or changing functions while you're
changing companies so those are the
kinds of things you have to be mindful
of as you're starting to put together
that plan to get to that goal now the
next part of it I want to take you
through is some of the groundbreaking
research because I did look at what does
it take to get there now I wanted to get
a show of hands how many engineers do we
have in the room okay number of
Engineers how about I t folks IT
marketing product management product
marketing sales Wow HR biz dev alliances
what'd I miss opps that's a good one oh
good thank you manufacturing fits in
there anything else Oh accounting
finance I forgot this is a really
well-balanced audience here this is
great so anyway I pulled together a
product management and brought the data
on that what I found in interviewing
these panels it before people but I'd
still see that they came from different
backgrounds so you'd have the product
managers that were the engineers that
became product managers I'd also see
that some salespeople had gone into it
or the one that I like is the domain so
this is the person who would get was
very deep in an area you know maybe it
was telecom like my background was
telecom and then I became product
marketing and telecom well if I
continued in a career and started going
into mobile and other things you might
look at me and say oh she's got this
telecom domain expertise and you can see
it across industry but you can also see
it within a function like in marketing
maybe it's somebody who's really good at
social media marketing or somebody who's
really good at lead generation campaigns
you know maybe it's somebody I've done
searches on so many different domains so
even within software industry it's you
know I need to find someone who does not
only middleware or something like that
but service-oriented architecture and it
gets deeper and deeper and what I've
learned in search and when you're
job-searching you know right this
noun everybody wants somebody with that
deep domain and one of the big mistakes
people make because they try and be
generalists because they don't want to
miss out on an opportunity but you have
to be nice oriented for this person and
meesh oriented for that and nisha
oriented there and they're looking to
make sure you've got the right industry
functional whatever that domain is and
so there were product managers who SAT
there with deep domain experience there
were also some consultants that went
into product management so you see the
different categories you know a third of
the people came up through product
management you have this strategy
consultants and bankers fit in there and
twenty-two percent came from that
background engineers made up twenty
percent the numbers aren't as important
as looking at it and seeing the
different backgrounds people came from
so if you're an engineer going into
product management as your positioning
yourself moving up you'll want to find
the positions where people are valuing
that you have deep technical skills but
also you need to keep an eye on if I've
got deep technical skills and I'm
competing against people with really
good sales and marketing skills or
analytical skills how do I start
learning what they're doing to be able
to enhance my background so start using
that to position yourself okay the next
one I have to bring up the CEO part of
it I had a question the other day as I
presented they said oh well the CEO
function I'm guessing there's a lot of
engineer CEOs looked at is that well Oh
contraire you know less than fifteen
percent and it makes sense their sales
and marketing a third of them come from
sales and marketing backgrounds and it's
because the CEO of those tech startups
is the number one sales person in the
company and guess what if you're a
technology co-founder you're usually and
the tech person the engineer that's
developing it you may end up running
into and becoming that's CTO co-founder
you still are the co-founder but you'll
hire in people that can do the other
parts of it so I just wanted to point
that part of this out to you now I have
breakout sessions you guys get to work
tonight okay and the reason for this is
I want to have a context I want you to
have a context so that you can think
about this for your own self so that as
you walk away tonight you're going to be
able to think about what do I want to
work on so we're going to spend 10
minutes and yes I need you to come back
to me in 10 minutes so I'll try and get
you actually when I start doing it
whoever comes comes back and listens
I'll give one of these away okay so
anyway we're going to spend 10 minutes
and break out into groups of three or
four and I want you to introduce
yourself so if you're sitting around
people you work with go find new people
you don't know okay and and I want you
to want to introduce yourself with a 15
second pitch and i'm going to give you
an example because we all give 30 second
to a minute pitches it's hi i'm a
product manager and mobile applications
i develop something like this app you
might have and if you're looking for a
job you can say and i'm looking for a
job at companies like Google or
Microsoft that's your introduction short
and sweet but then the second part is
the most important why don't you just
share with this group if you've got any
thoughts on where you want to be what's
your dream your vision maybe it's even
just a pipe dream but if you've got a
thought and where you think you're going
to be headed with your career whether
it's just your next job or even better
if its longer-term so we're going to
spend 10 minutes doing this and I'll get
you back together so go ahead and find a
small group
that was just to give you some context
so that you've got a direction that
you're thinking of because with that
thought process the next part is going
into the leadership skills model and I
called it a career pyramid because the
graphics look pretty and of skills at
the top and there's five that I'm going
to talk about and i can give you
examples for the next three hours on
this okay but we're only going to spend
30 minutes so the first one is strategic
vision we learn about this in business
goals so i'll probably go through it
pretty quickly customer perspective
you've got to bring the customer
perspective into your job whether it's
external or internal customers and how
do you do that it's kind of interesting
because you wouldn't expect to see that
up there but it was very interesting how
all of the panelists talked about who
their customer is from CEOs talking
about shareholders to VPS of marketing
bringing that information into the
company so take you through examples of
that communication skills so there's a
reason why communication skills is four
times larger than any other part in here
the importance of communication skills
grows exponentially as you advance in
your career so get good at it and I'm
going to take you through some examples
of that team leadership will go through
that as well that's one that I think we
can all work on and the last one just to
surprise you is called distinguishing
skills so as you move through your
career we go from doing two leading
what's really interesting is you get
rewarded for doing and then when you get
to the point of you get rewarded for
leading well you you're not supposed to
be doing quite as much but there were
some skills since remember I took this
functional perspective looking at
marketing and product management and
sales and CEO I looked at and I saw
there were some things that you had to
continue doing really really well on the
example I use is you know if you're a VP
biz dev you're negotiating two billion
dollar deals well you don't walk in and
start negotiating at a two billion
dollar level you better start here and
get really good at it because you're
never going to be able to delegate that
so what is the distinguishing skill
for the functional area that you're
looking at and I'm going to go through
these with lots of examples strategic
vision so this is not only setting the
strategic vision for the company but
most it's also setting it for your
division your product your team and then
getting everybody in alignment with it
so it's not just the setting the vision
but it's the alignment and how do you
communicate that and making sure the
alignment of your product derp team fits
with the company direction as well now a
couple examples of that because it's not
just the company vision Marlene
Williamson is a VP of Marketing she was
at symantec and and then now she's at
ericsson redback networks of part of of
Ericsson and she was a market has been
in market here in Silicon Valley for 20
25 years she was a candidate of mine ten
years ago and she was a VP of Marketing
at acer so i'm dating myself how many
people remember PC clones and clone wars
okay there's a few of us thanks guys
anyway I'm she back then for the people
that didn't know this you know you
bought IBM you couldn't go wrong buying
IBM computers or you bought HP compaq
was separate del I think they were
around and once you got past the kind of
big guys PC clones had a really poor
reputation they were kind of they were
very cheap well Marlene put together the
marketing vision that put acer on the
map and acer became the clone to buy so
if you didn't want to go IBM you bought
a sir and she built that up and set that
marketing vision of what do we do to do
that and that takes a lot of vision to
be able to do that and then the
execution behind it now the other
example I bring up his urn arneson is a
vp of strategic alliances again from
Symantec and she's with Cisco now and
when you hear Erna talk she's been in in
strategic alliances partnerships for 25
years she has this mind that thinks
strategically about partner ecosystems
and how do we work together to create
value for one another and it's this
very strategic mindset that I don't
think strategically around partners same
way she does but it's having that kind
of strategic vision now I also want to
talk about alignment because in
alignment it's communicating and over
communicating the CEOs would say if you
think you're communicating a lot the
vision well you're probably not
communicating enough so keep over
communicating an example one of the CEOs
or one of the executives shared with us
he had been an executive at Pacific
telesis Pac Bell you know some iteration
of that and they had in an industry
luminary come in at an executive level
in the group Marty Kaplan was his name
and he came on board and he went around
and talked to all the division leaders
about what's going on in the
organization and he came up with this
list of 85 things and after about a year
with the group he's going what's
happening with the performance here why
are we not hitting her numbers you know
and he pulled one of his managers aside
you got to tell me what's going on what
am I missing he goes well we're all
working on your list of 85 and Marty had
to say my list of what and he had to get
up and publicly in front of the group
tear up that list of 85 so they could go
back to their knitting and concentrate
on profit revenue and all the basics and
so they last sight of what that vision
was because of this little list of 85
because sometimes if the leader says it
everybody thinks they need to jump
through hoops and do it so as the leader
the strong leaders and the executives
that were quoted in the book the gate
count gave countless examples of you
always knew where you stood in the
company because you know the CEO said
this is our objective one two and three
and from the top down to the bottom of
the organization they could cite that
very interesting I'm UCLA Anderson just
honored Fred Smith the CEO of fedex and
he talked about how the mission of the
company from top of the organization
down to the bottom of the organization
it was all about how we're delivering
packages to satisfy our customers and to
take care of our customers well that
evening at the dinner they surprised him
and they were going to have a FedEx
delivery man who worked the graveyard
at the LAX terminal was going to ring
the doorbell and bring in his package
okay i sat next to this this nice young
man at the dinner table and I said you
know how do you motivate people on a
graveyard shift he goes well it's all
about the customer I'm going I thought
it was sitting next to Fred Smith right
there so all the way down to probably
ten levels down in the organization they
knew what their job was in taking care
of the customer that's setting a vision
and getting alignment through the
organization okay second one customer
perspective this is a commandment know
thy customer okay it came out so many
times know a lot of the panels were
marketing and sales oriented but it was
so apparent that was know thy customer
now this is external if it's the
customers buying your product but it
could also be internal if you have to
the tech support guys who are setting us
up the security people who are
supporting the organ is that the events
that are going on you know who is your
customer within the organization a few
examples here Judy Kirkpatrick is a was
a VP at ebay and before that worked at
into it and Adobe in her in her career
and she talked to us about ebay and what
it meant to bring in customer
perspective there and AG Lafley he's the
chairman of PNG they had a saying that
that they translated to their own and AG
Lafley would say you stand for election
the customer stands for electoral ection
when the customer buys and when they use
the customer so think about that laundry
detergent you just bought from Procter &amp;amp;
Gamble you know it's when you buy it but
then you have to use it and then you
have to go out and buy it again ok so
for eBay that meant to them every time a
customer clicked and bought every time
somebody came on board and sold
something and then would come back and
sell again so the customer became
customer perspective was that whole user
experience not just buying up front but
using it going through customer service
and operations and going back and
telling everybody about it
buying again so how do you bring that
customer perspective in because you're
touching the customer you know even if
you're sitting in finance or some groups
like that what is the impact that you
have on it the second example that that
Judy Kirkpatrick shared with us she had
worked it into it and and Scott cook the
the founder of Intuit shared something
early on there everybody knows into it
and quicken and so it was quick and was
invented to be an electronic check book
so you could balance your checks and
that's how it was used so during the
first two years they did a lot of home
visits to see how people were using the
product and they went in and they found
out that a lot of people were using it
for small businesses but they ignored
the data for two years and they finally
said well maybe we should do something
about this and so they actually then
started going after small and medium
businesses well into it if you guys know
into it they now are I think it's half
their business is targeting small and
medium businesses with or QuickBooks
product and not only that but they're
known because they target small and
medium businesses and they're not aren't
that many companies that do it as well
as into it but they ignored the customer
data for two whole years now another
example I want to take you through how
people get this customer perspective
because you might say well i'm sitting
in customer service i'm sitting and you
know whatever the group is how do I
learn about sales and how do I get
closer to the customer Rita your feet OH
was a VP of Product Management at
PeopleSoft but she started out in in
customer support and and and consulting
and she wanted to learn more about sales
so she picked the best salesperson and
the company and she said could I learn
about sales and come out and on some
sales calls with you as she put it she
glommed on to sales and and that's how
she learned and then she took that
knowledge of sales and it propelled her
throughout her career because everybody
knew that she was so close to sales with
everything she did so that's how she got
some of her promotions now another
person i worked with anne klein at
siebel systems
she ran the healthcare and insurance
vertical remembered domain she had that
domain so she ran that vertical and what
she did and an was really good at
supporting sales you know we all spend
time developing our products it along
with developing her products she spent
several months developing the sales
demonstration tool and anybody that's
done that if they're on customer the
sales engineers who are going out and
giving the demos on the product well the
hardest thing is putting in demo data
and the process flows of how the
customers will use it so Anne's team
spent three months developing a really
well thought out sales tool with demo
day to lat added to it now what ended up
happening is not only did all the
insurance and healthcare sales people
use this but they started using it for
all the other verticals and they started
selling more of their product because it
had the process flows map and in
addition to that because she had helped
sales sales would give her information
so they could develop better products
for those customers so she developed
really good applications because she was
helping sales sell product okay so think
about those kind of examples when you're
thinking about how do I support sales
and how do I learn more about it I
actually think that the MBA curriculum
doesn't prepare you enough for sale so
anytime you can sit closer to sales and
bring in revenue and help people bring
in revenue I think it will help out in
your career it's a blanket statement but
I don't make those often and that's when
I really believe in communication skills
okay how many people have ever gone to
communication skills training i hope
that everybody's hand in this room goes
up I found that every time I join a new
company they send you to some sort of
conflict resolution or or or it's not
saying anything about me is it but
anyway um or what's your communications
I'm a tiger I'm blue I'm red for this
one you know and and every single
company i go to they've got one but the
important thing about it is it's
understanding how am i perceived by
someone else how are how do they listen
what's they
style and how can I make myself heard by
them better or listen better or work
better with them and that's kind of it
the fundamental of the communication
skills it starts with listening I have
to share the VP of corporate development
of amgen said this he's a former
McKinsey strategy consultant he said the
higher up I've gotten the more sunshine
i get and he said everybody's delivering
sunshine no one wants to deliver the bad
messages about what's going on so as an
executive you have to get good at
understanding what are they really
trying to tell you with all that
sunshine and that takes listening how
can you listen so you can hear what
they're saying the other parts of it is
we always think about communicating
communicating down to the team well a
lot of the communications is the cross
functional teams and how do you
communicate across the organization it's
also communicating up to your boss I got
a call yesterday from one of my
colleagues about that how do I work with
my boss and communicate this a couple of
the examples I want to bring up we had a
SD form program of getting to the top
panel i think it was several years ago
now of CIOs and we had the cio of Varian
Jessica den core said she's she's an
introverted person she'll even tell you
that and she realized she get into these
meetings with all the other executives
and she'd say everybody would steal my
ideas because I wouldn't speak up
because she was a little quiet about
speaking up so she she learned to deal
with it she goes into meeting and she
speaks first so no one can steal our
ideas so you know it's you know if you
are you know if you find out you know
this is my trait will find ways to deal
with that and come up with ways that you
can improve upon it another woman
Lorraine seagulls a incredible woman she
comes from strategic alliances and she
founded the committee of 200 there's an
organization called National Association
of women business owners for women's
business owners you know like myself
Francine others in here a committee of
200 is the women who run companies with
at least 50 million in revenue so I
to go to one month once but I'm not a
member anyway Lorraine started that and
so she's run some several large
companies well she talked about when she
got into her first larger company she
talked about the politics of running a
board and she said that fifty percent of
her time was spent communicating up to
the board and getting them in agreement
and getting things worked out before the
board meetings and so you you have to
have those skills another woman Trish
Hallam and heiresses VP of Marketing
running the mobile ran the mobile at
Walt Disney and she gave strategies on
how you communicate with your boss
because it happens at all levels and so
she talked about you know going back to
we said it's like what does your boss
want to hear from you not delivering
sunshine all the time but how can you be
delivering that message so they
understand what you're trying to tell
them and a lot of it comes back to these
communication styles one of the other
things in there is influencing you know
it's really important that you work on
this influencing and gaining credibility
with others Tracy ayler is a vp of
public relations and was with Postini I
think that was acquired here by Google
and now she's VP of Mark logic and she
talked about early on she talked about
the need to develop this trusted
relationship so that if a CEO or you
know even think of it's a colleague you
know you're in in marketing and you're
talking to engineer sales they have to
you have to have credibility with them
so that they understand it the council
you're trying to deliver to them and
Tracy talked about early in her career
she was asked to run a press release
about a Minnesota office against her
better judgment because she said why are
we doing that should we be talking about
global expansion she ran this press
release saying hey we've got a new
office in Minnesota she became the
laughingstock of the media world because
they said hey I'm up here in Minneapolis
and turned out it was a guy in his
bedroom and they did a press release on
the national news wire about this new
office so now she tells all her team no
min
so depressed releases but they can only
deliver that because they have gained
credibility and what she ends up doing
with her team is you know they gain the
credibility and instead they'll say well
instead of a press release why don't we
do this which will get those kind of
results and it becomes this trusted
relationship with the executives that
they're working with another part of
this communications that I put in there
is managing expectations we had Melissa
dear doll on the panel Melissa was a VP
of Marketing at Adobe now she was there
for eight ten twelve years I can't
remember the number but you know the
typical VP of Marketing in Silicon
Valley is there about 18 months and so
this was she was there for a long time
so I asked so what was the key to your
longevity there and she said managing
expectations communicating what you're
capable of doing and then showing people
those results so really working on
managing the expectations of what people
think you're going to be delivering so
you see how there's all of this kind of
figuring out how to deliver the messages
how to build up relationships and work
with other people on this communications
I strongly recommend that you work on it
take classes you know do 360 degree
reviews to see how you are perceived by
your team team leadership this is a fun
one it starts with hiring the best as a
recruiter I have to say that so ap
there's an adage eight players hire a
and B people hire see and that's what
ends up happening so if an a person
hires an A you've got a team of a people
you google lights here and I also had a
pleasure to work at my first consulting
project was with frito-lay which is
PepsiCo all a player's just fascinating
working there also had a chance to do a
consulting assignment I process mapped
all of Microsoft in two weeks they're
all a player's up there worked at siebel
system all a player's really fun working
within that environment what happens
when you get to the organizations that
are be they start getting marginalized
and if you've ever had a be boss they
don't want to get
challenged and they don't want somebody
to look better so they start hiring
lower than they are and it gets really
really frustrating in those kind of
environments I had one client where as I
put it the B+ players were real stars in
it because the C D and E plate people
had to go to work somewhere and and it's
you could see how marginalize the
company had become it was you know a
little lower level blue collar kind of a
company but you want to hire the best um
I have this one quote I have to read it
Jasmine Kim was a in charge of
international for Yahoo and came from
consumer packaged goods brand management
and then became coo CMO of babycenter
com for Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson she said I'd
rather carell race horses than motivate
donkeys to walk okay so I you know stick
around with those race horses and hire
the best um ninah Smith was the chief
marketing officer of Xerox and she also
said don't be too proud you need to fill
in your weaknesses so you need to know
the areas where you're not strong and
make sure you're hiring for that so many
times we're hiring and you hire people
who are just like you sometimes you have
to hire somebody that adds a new
perspective not to challenge it and make
the team dysfunctional but somebody that
allowed that perspective or round out
the skill sets you know if you're very
analytical maybe you we need somebody
who's people oriented you know those
kinds of differences in staff that
you're hiring the other part after you
bring these people in you have to
continue developing them or send them to
getting to the top or things like that
the next part is also delegating and
empowering as you move up from that
doing to leading the hardest part is the
letting go of details I actually had an
MBA approached me that he was a
corporate director of corporate
development for a billion dollar company
he said I can talk to M&amp;amp;A people all day
long do all these high-level deals they
just gave me a team and
I am sinking I'm absolutely underwater
it's the busiest I've ever been in my
life I feel like I'm failure and what it
was was he didn't he could communicate
with bankers couldn't communicate with
his team and on top of it he couldn't
let go of the details and Marlene
Williamson put it best when she says you
have to get comfortable in this gray
area that you're going to let go of the
details they're not going to do it the
same way you've done but if you hire
those racehorses and that a team of
people just trust that they're going to
get it done maybe not in the same area
but you have to let go of the details of
how they're going to do it and delegate
now then the other part that I have to
tell you over the course of five years
we've probably run 10 CEO panels eight
to ten CEO panels every single one of
the CEOs has said that the biggest
mistake they've ever made is not firing
quickly enough and it's very very
telling while I was writing this book I
hired an admin that after three weeks I
realized there was too much emotional
baggage for my home office and I needed
to let her go but I was going on
vacation over fourth of July so oh it'd
be good if she's here and it took me
three months to let her go and I should
have let her go after three weeks so
even I did the same thing while I'm
writing these chapters here there was
one example also of a COO CEO young CEO
who talked about they had a product
release coming up and the vp of
engineering came in and said and he held
a lot of the power around this and he
came in he said well we'll we'll hit the
delivery date if you pay me X tens of
thousands of dollars of the CEO well
they don't prepare you for that and he
said I've got to think about it
overnight well word got out in the
company that this decision was going on
he was talking to the board members he
said you know I knew the decision was
right the minute I made it up in my mind
he of course fired the person the entire
team rallied because they were glad the
guy was gone and
they didn't make the date but the CEO it
was more important the integrity of the
company the team can you imagine every
other person that would try holding him
hostage after that and so you know
that's one of the examples some of the
other examples that people shared were
it's you know like it's easy hiring the
poor performers the non-performers but
the very marginal people they're just
taking up seats a lot of times they
helped you on your way up to the top and
then you've got to turn around and fire
them they also talked about you know
like okay you can put them on
performance plans but they all said that
the performance plans really didn't work
so they said just be generous on the way
out and help them leave with dignity but
fire them so that was the general word
of the CEOs and it was across the board
every single program not on a down note
we'll move on to the next one which is
the distinguishing skills so in the
distinguishing skills this is the one
where you have to get really good at
something whatever it is we had examples
of how the PR folks at the low levels
are writing press releases at the high
levels they're expected to write news
worthy stories that are changing how the
market you know changing and developing
market categories or new stories in
driving sales you know we already talked
about the salesperson you know has to
drive sales but the CEO is the number
one salesperson and how can you do that
we talked about establishing culture and
you think the CEO is responsible for
that those are all people issues again
but it also establishing a culture could
be in your group when I was president of
pan w we went into one technology
company and they said you know we'd love
to see more women here we don't have a
woman friendly culture except in one
group so we got talking about that one
group what makes that one a woman
friendly culture it was a soccer dad who
led it and he led all the moms go you
know like if the kids were sick they
could go home they could take him to the
appointments needed to because they
no knew they'd work and that group was
fifty percent women so in this tech you
know in this tech company that didn't
have a friendly women's culture this one
group did we always hear culture starts
at the top but it can even start at the
top with you in your team in your group
establishing that culture so figure out
what the distinguishing skills might be
for you and we'll move on from you know
from from there and and and how do you
develop those in your career I do have
one breakout session but you're going to
do this at the end because i want to
take questions so the next part would be
to think about what are some of the
skills that you want to develop so go
back over that pyramid and think about
Arthur one or two you know everybody
should have some sort of communication
skill on that list but what are a couple
skills that you want to develop and if
you want to meet with your groups or
talk about it afterwards but I want to
get to some questions so we're going to
go on and take the last slide here which
is how do you develop these now when you
want to change behavior the first thing
they always talk about there's four
phases and the first one is unconscious
in competence you don't even know you're
bad okay and then you move up to
conscious in competence you know that
you're not doing something well and then
you can start improving your behavior
and you become consciously competent you
know you're doing well but you still
have to work at it and the goal is of
nirvana is unconsciously competent you
just do it now I have to give you the
example I use is um anybody who knows me
does doesn't know me as this person but
back in college and engineering I was
shy I was really painfully shy and it
was coming home from a sophomore year
those first really killer engineering
classes and and how I didn't have any
friends in my class my dad said to me he
said did you ever think that people
might think you're stuck up I'm going
unshy dad I'm shy and I went back after
thanksgiving and i looked around all
this class of people who i thought
weren't talking to me because they were
better than me and looked around I saw a
whole room full of shy engineers and so
I started kicking myself you know you
could see the foot going them in my head
but I started kicking myself to talk to
people it start with hi did you do the
homework how'd what you think and pretty
soon we had the two or three rows around
me we we actually became best friends
for the next three years because I just
kept kicking myself and it probably took
a year or two of kicking myself and
every now and then I did like sitting in
the back of the room and just watching
but I kicked myself so that I don't
think about it and look at my sister
never got that she never kicked herself
so she's still painfully shy and but
it's something that it was a behavior I
didn't like and so and I wanted to
change that because I felt like I was
missing something or whatever it was but
I wanted to change it so it starts with
recognizing what is that behavior what
is that skill that you want to change
and then you need to want it bad enough
because it's easier just sitting there
not talking to someone and continuing
with it but what is that behavior you
want to change and then what you do is
the the developmental people put
learning into three categories the first
one is experience you have to do it to
learn it the second categories exposure
it's your networks it's the people
around you and then the third category
is education going out and taking a
class well they actually say that
learning comes sixty seventy percent of
it comes from experience and just doing
it so what they recommend doing is you
know if you're ever asked to take on a
special assignment or even better yet
volunteer to take on a special
assignment Jasmine Kim in the
international group realized there was a
titling issue between different
companies country some were VP some were
directors it was a causing terrible
strife within the group she volunteered
to take on a leveling project that would
be a god forsaken project because you'd
have a lot of people hating you on it
but she learned a lot about HR processes
and things that she really really enjoys
and and worked on this pretty
high-profile project within the company
another example of that was Denise pack
as a VP VP at Cisco she started it son
and along the way she was in mark
but she was asked to take on investor
relations these are the people who are
communicating your stock price and
what's going on to Wall Street she
doesn't want that's a finance function
why am i doing it so she took the
principles of marketing and applied them
to investor relations you know all
legitimately but their stock price went
up and because of that she had a whole
bunch of executives who knew she was
well along the way she also took a role
in IT she knew nothing about IT and she
decided to go to IT why cuz I T was the
customers for Sun and Cisco products so
she got to have lunch and talk to these
people and learn what the customers are
thinking and how they feel about it and
what their their impressions are so she
can do a better job of marketing to them
and currently she's over in Shanghai
running operations in china for cisco
and she credits all of those rotational
moves in two different functions plus
she delivered developed a lot of
political allies within the company that
knew how good a job she does so you take
on those experiences even if they do get
you outside your comfort zone another
example of that with pan w i love this
example because you can take on
volunteer assignment you know work for
the nonprofits and you know do the
blogging and tweeting and you learn
social media right well we had one
volunteer who desperately wanted to be a
manager but she was you know face with
that catch-22 I say if we'll have you
ever managed anyone know well then you
can't be a manager so she needed to
manage someone so she volunteered to
lead a team on the biggest team the the
auction team and did a bang-up job she
went into the job interview situation
saying have you ever managed to anyone
well yes i did this great team for pan w
and she got a manager title and managed
one or two people so she got that check
mark by doing volunteer work so it's
taking on those projects volunteering to
do them reaching outside your comfort
zone and taking risks next part of it is
exposure penny her sure was another one
of our panelists whose CEO of first rain
and she came up through cadence
she was CEO of synopsis which was
acquired by cadence well penny started
out as a math major and a mentor said
well go into programming so she went
into programming along the way somebody
said you'd be good at marketing go into
marketing another mentor said you'd make
a good CEO someday so she always had
these mentors kind of helping her
prepare for those rolls along the way so
seek out mentors and if your
organization isn't large enough you'll
reach out into professional associations
where you might get exposure to other
women or other executives in your
industry and then the last part take
courses and I know there's a lot of
development courses around for people
whether in your company or outside so
what I want people to do is just think
about where their long-term direction is
what are a few skills that you think you
can work on developing and then start
thinking about what activities can I do
to start developing it and what he did
was I left you a little worksheet you
can fill out afterwards but with that I
want to take questions go ahead wait we
have a mic for questions so hi I'm hi my
name is Luciana work at Adobe system as
a business manager of the globalization
team and my question was actually
wondering if your research did you take
a look of how long those women take from
moving from one leading position to the
next so how long they take average from
a manager to a director director to VP
or something like that that's a good
question i didn't study that i have to
write another whore for you now i'm
sorry i didn't look at that i would say
that some people did it very quickly if
I'm just kind of thinking through the
executives where you could see they
moved up very quickly but I've also
interviewed people who moved up way too
quickly and and I think that you do have
this kind of natural development
curriculum that if you do get up to the
VP really really quickly you better be
learning those skills and backfilling
what you didn't learn and and I think
that
if you are moving along it's you know
seeking out people who know you that can
help you and deliver advice on you know
like what kinds of things should I be
working on to to advance to the next
level one of the things this was this is
a good one that I was taught after the
fact in pro how we all have performance
evaluations quarterly and no one ever
does them and then annually you get
surprised well someone said why don't
you talk to your boss monthly and just
say and how am i doing and it can be
really informally is there anything else
I could be working on you know here's
what I've been working on is there
anything else usually you'll say oh no
you're doing a good job do it monthly
keep track and say every single time is
there anything else I should be working
on at the end of the year when they
surprise you with that performance
evaluation you can come back and say
well every month I've been asking you
and you have and you've been saying no
there's nothing else I needed to be
working on okay but put in place that
plan that says I really like to be
director i'd like to be vp what are the
things that i could work on and and um
you have to watch out because i think a
lot of us do have an Achilles heel and
i've watched some women go from company
to company to company and they've still
got that Achilles heel and changing
environments won't change that you've
got to fix what it is so that you don't
keep running into it and so if you can
face that maybe do a 360 degree
assessment and figure out what it is
that is holding you back especially if
you've got close friends or people that
can kind of share that that may not be
your direct supervisor
hi my name is Alexei odo I work for
TeleNav that's a gps nav company so my
question is a lot of the topics that you
brought up talk about personal
development things that women can do for
themselves but I'm wondering how many of
the VP's the CEOs those that get to the
top in terms of their environmental
situations such as having two nannies
having a spouse that you know maybe
having the lesser job or you know those
things that are equally important to
enable women to get to the top did you
look into those factors as well yeah let
me address that from a few different
dimensions I'm going to start by saying
when I was in strategy consulting
complaining about how I was running
errands every weekend in between those
trips out of town he said Kathy what you
need is a housewife and it was true
there are CEOs men and women because
there's an interesting fact out there
that men actually want balance and
flexibility as much as women but there's
actually a bigger stigma on men in
getting it so the men want that and what
I have seen is they end up setting
boundaries if they're good at it now
some art and remember it's about how
they set culture so I'll compare and
contrast to these are both male CEOs but
I'll take you through some women in a
second so with the male CEOs one said
okay I have this agree he's got young
kids and he has an agreement with his
wife that these are the nights I'm
working late but these nights I'm going
to be home and then after the kids are
in bed I'd go back to work till midnight
or whatever it is but he has that
agreement that these are the nights that
I work late so he just sets those
boundaries but it family's really
important to him another CEO compare and
contrast this he's sending emails to his
team at midnight 1 a.m. in the morning
and he's kind of testing them to see who
else is working at those hours ok and
and so you have to know who you're
working for now I have run into a lot of
you know call them VP Marketing caliber
talent that have just decided I'm tired
of that revolving door of changing every
18 months and benefits flexibility I'm a
single mom whatever it is says I'm just
going to take a director of
marketing title and let that VP over me
keep changing and one woman did that
during the dot-com recession watch for
VPS of marketing go over her and she
kept her head down and just did this
because she needed the health benefits
for her husband or another one did it
because you know she was a single mom
and needed to stay at home so there's
nothing wrong there's actually um the
career theorists will call this you have
to set you know what is the success mean
for me and and what do I want to give
and what's most important and you'll go
through periods of your life where it
may be more important to take care of
family and then there's another period
where you ramp up your career or you
trade off because now it's time for your
spouse to ramp up their career and
you're doing the more flexible thing and
then you trade off and those are all the
things you have to think through so my
name is yen well one in them go ahead
yen me yet go ahead okay my name is yen
I would for LPC tools and my question is
I started the workforce about 20 years
ago and at the time women were coming up
but there was a stereotype of executive
women how they had to sell their souls
in certain ways and become more men like
do you have to have you studied and on I
know there are more women executives
these days but I really haven't run into
a lot who have not had to pretend to be
more manly do you know what I mean yep
yeah so so I have a generalization and
it's not a study but actually I think
catalysts will do does more work around
kind of perceptions around that I I
think its generational I'm the very last
year of baby boomer and I see this kind
of half generation ahead of me because
so I I didn't like wearing the little
tie so I wore the blouses that I didn't
have to wear a tie with because I really
didn't like the ties but anyway there's
this hat there's this generation above
me that there's almost two categories of
women some that really really support
women Carol Bartz is
perfect example of that that
wholeheartedly supports women and and
their advancement in corporations
there's other women and I'm not going to
mention their names that they're they're
not too supportive that they don't feel
like they have to support women because
they compete in a man's world and and I
think that you see that in what you're
talking about in I have to be more
man-like I love wearing skirts and I
will be feminine in what I do I'm okay I
have to be that a career person so I'm
wearing pinstripes tonight but it's a
feminine one right anyway but it's it's
one of those things that I think it's
your own personal style but I really do
like the women who do reach out and help
other women and and I do encourage you
to do that because I think that's how
we'll all get ahead in the back we had a
question so my question was going back
to your comments on performance
evaluations at what point do you broach
that topic with your supervisor with
your manager give me a little more so
some companies i mean i worked for
public accounting where there were
specific programs very formal programs
about having a mentor and there were
partners who would approach you wanting
to see well how far do you want to go
and i'll help you then have gone to
corporate situations where you had to
really find someone on your own to be
your mentor or help you find your path
at the company but at what point i guess
in corporate situations do you broach
those topics with the vp or the SVP
saying i would like to go further how do
i get there um you in that conversation
I think that first you have to start it
with your boss because it's only polite
to start it with your direct supervisor
however if that doesn't go anywhere like
the conversation I had yesterday she's
being stonewalled by her boss and he
closes the door and won't speak to her
and I'm going okay and that becomes how
do you move to the next level and what's
appropriate and what are different ways
you can do that now as far as the
reaching out I've been incorporated
situations also that I have informal
mentors where I just approach people and
say you know it's been real helpful the
advice you've given me would you be my
mentor and it's this kind of explicit
verbal contract but then I've also had
programs where it's been here's the
mentoring program sign up they match you
and and I found that I have more success
in the informal me just approaching
somebody about it because it's somebody
I already have a relationship with
they've already provided advice and as
long as you don't step over that line of
mentoring versus you really need a coach
you know mentors can't do that I think
it works out now the formal mentoring
programs to me sometimes it works and
sometimes it doesn't and I just happened
to be in one where it really didn't work
that well because you know I chose a
mentor that everybody wanted to have as
a mentor because she was good at
mentoring but I didn't have the
relationship with her and I was better
just approaching people I'm you know I
used to look at it when i was in
consulting i was in the LA office and we
had seven people there versus 200 in san
francisco so every time I was up here
you never knew the consultants would be
out but the partners always had to go to
lunch so I'd go to the partners offices
about quarter to twelve and say would
you like to go to lunch well they were
going to lunch with other partners so I
go to lunch with three partners you know
and and the consultants would look at me
I'm going well they have to go to lunch
too and so I got to talk to the partners
so they knew who I was and so I think
that if you reach out to people and it
start establishing those relationships
even with executives they have to eat
lunch they're going to the gym you know
they've got the same you know parental
issues you might have and it's just
starting that conversation so you can
say hey can I can I ask you a question
but it's starting to develop a
relationship so you can ask them those
questions if you don't have that formal
set up to do it let's
I will restore a small business that's a
locally based operation that has like
franchises in five counties and there is
a glass ceiling that's very very very
thick in the company I work for it's a
privately held company there really are
no top women in the in the company so i
decided i'm just going to stay where i
am and keep my head down which is what
you suggested but trying to get oh how
can I say it to have really good working
relationships with men who have been
groomed to work in that company is
extremely difficult we have something
they call a boss team that comes around
and checks all the franchise's to make
sure that everybody is operating the way
they're supposed to be and they're
actually very good they're very talented
I find it extremely difficult to talk to
these men because their attitude is like
don't talk to me you know you don't know
what you're doing I've been with the
company almost nine years so and I've
worked in three different franchise
operations so it's like where do I go
from here I know it's time to move on
and yet I'm learning as I'm sitting
there I'm helping them transition I'm
doing some great work and I'm learning a
lot so when I'm not you know 15 anymore
so where do I go from here yes you
probably have a lot of questions that we
could spend two hours talking about so
I'm but i'll give you a quick one i
always like this there was one time when
okay i wasn't paid much when i went from
consulting into product management
because i took two lowest salary so i
got an offer for fifty percent more to
go over to oracle to the arch nemesis
and so scope has decided to keep me
instead and give me a fifty percent
raise so if you ever need negotiating
around that just ask me and I'll help
you with it but anyway I got a fifty
percent raise and and but it was
interesting one of my friends said Cathy
I could tell the
day that you checked out well there's an
interesting thing when you do check out
i'm not saying check out but but it's
coming back in with a different
viewpoint because if you approach a job
and i'm going to give you an example of
a woman I talked to maybe six months ago
that she the company she wanted to go
into marketing but she had come from
finance and the company was either going
to layer off or she'd go into finance so
guess what you go into finance and but I
said well what if you go into finance
but do things that will support you so
you prepare yourself for marketing so
and and have that attitude now you won't
go in dreading finance you're going to
go in there what can I learn because she
was supporting the sales team guess what
sales team and marketing work close
together so how do you become a best
friend of sales while working in finance
so that you can move back into marketing
and be a step ahead so what I would do
is put on that perspective of I'm really
learning a lot what do I want to learn
that gets me ahead and how can I learn
it here and seek out those opportunities
to learn it'll put you in a different
frame of mind approaching that same job
you know those guys that are coming over
around and evaluating go I'm really
appreciating what you do and how tightly
a ship this is you know what can I help
you with to make sure we're performing
better and learn what they're doing and
when you start taking that kind of
attitude of this kind of learning
environment all of a sudden it puts a
different frame of mind on how you
approach your job because now you're
going what can I do to improve myself
and learn that sets me up for the future
we have a raffle a drawing alright and
just wanted to check and was there any
questions from the distributed sites if
there were a mutant speak up alright
