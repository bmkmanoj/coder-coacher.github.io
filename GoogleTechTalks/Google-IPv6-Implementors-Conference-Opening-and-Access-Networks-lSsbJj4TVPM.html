allocations went to latnok pod pained
incentive and surf an email and CC
Lorenzo and I and this was a Vince
service response SiC transit gloria
mundi so passes the glory of the world
and indeed the IANA free pools now be
the lines of crossed so and Vint has
recorded he couldn't be here today but
he has recorded an address to to play
for everyone hopefully this will and
well in theory this is streaming over v6
hi I'm Vince surf from Google's chief
internet evangelist and I wish I could
join you today at the ipv6 meetings and
unfortunately my calendar didn't permit
it but I do appreciate the opportunity
to take a moment to talk to you about
what's on my mind right now about ipv6
first of all I'm sure you know that
Google has made substantial progress in
implementing ipv6 for all of our
services and a lot of credit for this
goes to Lorenzo tulane T and Eric client
Steven Stewart and others who have
worked hard to find all the places in
our software where IP addresses were
thought to be 32 bits and we want them
to be also 128 so we've been looking at
dual stack kinds of implementations but
what I really wanted to talk to you
about today is my concern that we're now
down below the ten percent level with
ipv4 available addresses coming from I
came from Miami and that certainly
within a year's time the iono
allocations will have been exhausted the
regional internet registries may be able
to allocate ipv4 addresses up until
perhaps the middle of 2011 although if
there's a big run on ipv4 addresses or
other kinds of things happen it's
conceivable that the available space
will be considered even faster which
will undoubtedly introduce a complex and
all
a growing gray or black market on ipv4
address space the fragmentation
increases in the size of the underground
entangles in life so plainly we are at a
cusp I think in the IP address space for
Internet what I'd like to ask you to do
while you're discussing ipv6 and a
variety of issues associated with it is
give some thought to the various players
who are part of this ipv6 environment
and what they won't have to do in order
to make ipv6 work is conveniently and as
broadly as ipv4 does today plainly the
ISPs have got to implement ipv6 services
preferably using the same access lines
as they currently deliver ipv4 addresses
on and allow the two to be mixed
together they have to also i think adopt
liberal interconnexion policies and the
minimum in my view would be to allow
ipv6 and ipv4 to flow with the same
connections if you've already concluded
to do some time appearing on with ipv4
it would be very reasonable I think to
also appear with ipv6 on those same
connection circuits there are some
arguments about peering versus transit
in my view the traffic levels are in a
sense rivals that is to say if you're
using ipv6 you're consuming capacity
that would otherwise have been sent on
ipv4 I don't think the two are
independent consequently even if you're
acquiring ipv4 connectivity through
transit I would have thought that ipv6
connectivity over the same line would
not increase the capacity that you
require an or increase your costs the
next thing which is an issue of course
is the equipment out there that has to
handle both v4 and v6 most of the
commercial routing systems the ones that
are used by internet service providers
or enterprise operators are
running both v4 and v6 some may require
some upgrades certainly software but
then they offer they may also require
physical expansion in order to handle
larger routing tables but some serious
work needs to be done there the more
critical thing for the general public is
that a lot of the home routers are in
fact not capable of running ipv6 I don't
know what their reaction would be if a
v6 package showed up they might fall
over they might simply throw the packet
way but somehow we have to find
incentives not only for the makers of
these residential routing boxes or
combination router and nap boxes we need
to find incentives not only for the
matrix to create a v6 capability for
them but for the users to conclude that
they want to acquire and install that
capability some i'm not sure what the
right tactics are i think of the
American program of cash for clunkers
where hit your car consumed too much
gasoline from while on the US government
actually offered to provide you with a
subsidy to go buy a more fuel-efficient
car maybe we should have a no cash for
router hunters or something like that by
the way not my idea of rod Beckstrom and
I cam is the one that I think a half
tongue-in-cheek suggested the idea but
you know might be worth considering
something to provide incentive for the
general public to acquire dual mobile
browsers that can also make use of
either of the two protocols we also need
to worry about the domain name system
and there are several issues here
because the name servers need to be able
to handle the larger ipv6 packets
certainly when we're talking about the
hint files and the updates that um for
what the current top-level routers are
the root zone servers addresses look
like when you use v6 addresses that
takes up more room and in fact the list
of all of the 13 routes own servers
expressed in ipv6 is bigger
than a typical you know minimum size
packet so here we either need ed and s0
to be implemented or we need the ability
to switch from UDP to tcp in order to
him a larger responses that's going to
take some real work to get the name
servers and resolvers that are out there
and used in the hundreds of thousands
and millions maybe to be upgraded to
handle both before in v6 again I would
like you to think a little bit more
about specific things that the various
players in this zoo could take actions
that they could take and incentives for
them to do that so that we end up with a
fully functional y QV six internet it's
obvious that right now the way things
are going again to slowly is that we
have islands of ipv6 implementation but
we don't necessarily have connectivity
hence my concern about appearing and
transit policies but we also have a very
significant fraction of the general
public with inability to handle v6 and
domain name systems that are old and out
of date and really need to be upgraded
not only to improve their security but
also to improve their ability to serve
up both ipv4 and v6 responses as well as
accepting ipv4 and ipv6 transported
queries I'm sure that you'll be able to
think of some additional things that
ought to be done and perhaps with the
conclusion of the meeting that you're
attending someone could undertake to
summarize ideas that you might have for
creating these incentives I have even
taken the trouble of going to speak with
the president's science advisor John
Holdren and his deputy Tom Kalil about
the possibility of a White House
spotlight some kind of a convening of
players in this game to talk about
things that people could reasonably do I
don't think that we should be simply
pointing our fingers at people and
beating the drums and raising alarms
without actually suggesting some very
concrete very reasonable and if
mountable things that that could be done
that have reasonable business incentives
behind them just to finish up my honest
belief about business incentives is that
at least for the Internet service
providers is that your business is to
sell internet service and generally
speaking you need an IP address to sell
to a customer or in order for the
customer to make use of the internet
access service when you run out of ipv4
and if like me you don't believe that an
answer the solution to everything you
clearly need more addresses and the only
answer to that is ipv6 so I think it's
in every ISPs best interest to implement
both of the protocols in the near term I
also think that there are arguments that
somewhere someone says oh I have enough
ipv4 address space I'm not going to run
out I don't need ipv6 I think that's a
bogus argument because the party that
might want to use your services may only
be able to get you through ipv6 at some
point perhaps after the middle of 2011
so that's my little homily from the
internet evangelist I appreciate very
much your willingness to let me greet
you in this virtual event style and I
really do wish you a very very
successful conference and we measure
that success by the kinds of suggestions
that come back about how we can get
people moving towards implementation of
v6 before the v4 address space runs out
so have a very very you know successful
conference and in the meantime huh see
you on the net all right thank you vent
so I think there probably aren't any
questions so we're going to keep
carrying on we have yummy Niecy son from
softbank it has great honor for me to
speak as a just to keep giving a talk in
this conference also in front of two
quite so many so many people let me
introduce myself masato yamanishi and
i'm walking in southbank loop and until
this merge I was working in headquarters
so I did this this project with my
co-author but from this April I stood
work in LA office so now peeling
including I people sex is now part of my
less possibility so if you have some
interest please call me in in this
conference or in nano in next week then
I also have one co-author who is a
subtle matsushima and he's also working
in soft Bank Group and may maybe some
people already know him about his
contribution for mpls okay today I want
to talk about our case study who I
people 68 deployment softbank gloop is
providing Yahoo Yahoo broadband service
which is one row gist is P in Japan then
yeah before we were talking talking
about our project I would like to
summarize our requirement for ipv6
deployment I'll and also i briefed whole
transition then in the transition state
from ipv4 to ipv6 we should consider we
cannot assign new grow bruh I baby boy
progress for new only for new subscriber
because existing subscriber already have
a global IP wave address so we need to
consider vote for them also another
point is the network especially access
network may have only bleep and a
biblical capabilities or in some key
is on the ipv6 capabilities so we
already have many deployment solution
for each search cases but requirement
over each network provider are different
different depending on for existing
subscriber or new subscriber or existing
the infrastructure or newly developed
infrastructure then this network has IP
only has has only a biblical capability
or has only ipv6 capability so this
printed this presentation only shows our
showcase it's depend on our requirement
so since requirement of each provider
may bally so different different
different keys will be appropriate for
your network but still we have common
requirement between all is p of course
we should provide boss of ipv4 and play
sex connect connectivity then no more I
people he will grow / address then sir
point and post point is also very
important Saban is no additional or by
IP basic sex nor sharing global I people
here atlas so we should minimize capex
and opex then first point is keeping a
record of IP address assignment is very
important and it is mandatory because we
it is mandatory and also scalability of
this function is very important I will
talk about later more detail then this
fraud shows overview of Japanese s
industry and then I think next present
theater later Ichiro will talk about
more detail but important point is
mainly entity is providing last one
model access and also network network
network in Prefecture in each prefecture
so wish to depend on their access
network in many case then country we
have two types of the access network
first
this axe adsl access metro band a second
one is FTTH and in a dsl access network
we build a pure IP based access network
not it is not pppoe base then by leasing
layer 1 or layer 2 circuits from entity
and as our cal years then in this
network number subscriber is right rate
decreasing because in japan adsl user is
now moving to ftth so in ft teac FTTH
access network we build lay only layer 3
network it means we are leasing layer to
connectivity from entity so also in this
case number of subscriber is increasing
very rapidly ok let me let me skip this
slide then in as first as first case let
me introduce our our case study in a DSL
access network as as I talk pb3 in a DSL
access network we don't need to consider
how to provide a BB Oh bleep Oh
connectivity because mainly a number of
sub subscriber is declaring so existing
subscriber already have IP Bible global
address so we only need to consider how
to provide ipv6 connectivity over a DSL
over this network that it is big problem
because our adss axe and hit access
network is IP brief own network then
replacing or a plating all devices to
enable app basically is not realistic so
we will need 6 over for technology to
provide ipv6 connectivity another point
is we can control control software in
cpe but that on the other hand we want
to minimize configuration cost of a CP
because coalition of cpe is our
responsibility so we choose 6 i'll be i
think many people already familiar with
six LD so I don't want to explain the
detail of a success d but the reason why
we choose
60 D is it is very automatic solution
ipv6 prefix who subscribe ur is
delighted from global IP address and
also cpe so it means CP can
automatically configured also 6ld delay
lauter is very simple it can
automatically form encapsulation header
from destination ipv6 address and also
cpe can can figure out on the endpoint
valley easily from destination IP basics
so it remains six how this is very
scalable a cost-effective solution so
and its cost situation where we assumed
we can use same server for toenail based
solution and also 6ld solution then we
also assume traffic per customer IP
basic traffic's customer is 2.33 till
BPS it is very few compared with ipv4
one but a me in six LD experiment this
out shows single server can support 130
cells and customers so it's quite huge
number but on the other hand in if we
will use tunnel based solution this same
single server only can support fifteen
thousand customers because tunnel
solution is you you should handle front
should handle tunnel for each subscriber
so it means it has big impact will cost
so from from from our similarities
generation 6v only needs just less than
less than ten percent of the other
solution that cost of 10 the other
solution okay from this side let me talk
about our case study for FTTH access
network and auntie college in Japan
entity assigned their own ipv6 address
then it's address is not full
for the internet connectivity also
number of a customer is increasing very
rapidly so we need to provide both of
ipv4 and ipv6 service over entities
networks so we should share I people for
global address address address between
multiple customers so we have big
question actually it's not question only
for us it is common question between
Japanese is P so first plane is how to
provide an hour or ISPs ipv6 service
over entities ipv6 network and also
second question is how to share one IP
bush or address with many Christmas then
uh yeah many people laugh laugh bites by
this right anyway we have we meet women
japanese isp has currently two
candidates solution first one is called
plan to so it means there are missing
from one prong three it but anyway first
one is proud to and implant to is
basically based on PPP uh oh pppoe in
ipv4 case but difference it has the big
difference compared with a beautiful
case it is ipv6 address which is
assigned to subscriber is comes from
entities network and this plif Ock's
cannot be loud about to the internet it
can be only used service in entity
network so to to use service on the
internet we need we need n 80 in the net
ok thanks and powerful is basically
based on native loading the prefix which
is assigned to each user comes from
these is P so this address can be used
for can be used for the service on the
internet then
yeah this is a big difference between
prong two and prompt oh then yeah also
we need we need another solution to
provide a ipv4 connectivity over over
this network we already have a barrier
solution include including des lied LS
there or they slide a plus PE then we
sing critical point is scalability for
keeping a leg out of a IP address
assignment and important assignment if
we people use an apt then this trial is
talking about comparing a lesson and a
plus P and all of them use layer for
port number as a port as a part of host
on the identifier so let us major
technical difference major difference is
there's two major difference firstly is
porter assignment aspects LSN assign
port for each session whatever new
session is initiated but a plus PE and
allison is fixed port assignment assigns
Paul for each subscriber when IP address
is assigned to them it is big difference
then another point is location of a
location of a dress and a full
transition allison is Center side and n
plus P is CP side then actually are just
sharing technique techniques techniques
have a lot of common issues but like
softball source port number should be
logged to access log to access log on
server side it actually it has big
impact for server side and also max
number of concurrent sessions will each
user is limited it is also another
impactful server side and
certainly security security since London
is a potent but is restricted so it may
have some impact school security and
first one is some protocol which contain
layup robot number in its payload may be
impacted and LG may be needed but these
issues are common for all solution to to
all all all others sharing solution so
oh and we think we should all become and
we can do it will it believe so but
remaining at hardest the issue is
scalability of Elysee net itself and
this calculation is talking about the
scalability of LSN with dynamic report
assignment it has 2.4 fine session table
on LS in a box then since port port
number is assigned for each session so
we need to sorry a size of size of log
size per session is a 12 bite and this
number i'm in 19 million session it is a
peak maximum number of a concurrent
session per million users actually it
comes from our real traffic data and so
it means session table and the size of
the session table is 228 a megabyte it's
so it's not so big but session logs
sighs session storage size is very big
big problem so because 1 million user
general general 88.6 gigas session per
day it also comes from our TL traffic
data so we need 30 1 terabyte storage to
store six months long so it has very big
impact ok then it is less right so our
ipv6 deployment plan is as follows as
first step whether you 6 lv
for a DSLR subscriber and also for some
existing FTTH subscribers because they
already have a global IP address so we
can use it for a bit sick salvi then now
we are starting now we are step to
provide for existing FTTH customers then
second step is a plan fo I think it has
it has official name but i forget it so
ask to Ichiro then anyway we will use it
for ftth subscribers in future maybe we
can start this short this type of
service from next April next April and
then it's it's highly depend on schedule
of Mt decide so please Holly up then to
keep a depreciable connectivity we are
still investigating which one is better
which one is cost-effective and scalable
yeah our first candidate candidate is a
plus B but still we are investigating
okay thank you very much we have about
five minutes for questions before music
russia son gets up if you want to ask
now please yeah do so no I I'll and Iran
from Geneva it's looking at your data
about logging this is a very interesting
question and very important data have
you counted the techniques to reduce the
size of his logs as well as I mean by
bhl sighs no the actual size of a log so
you're talking about 30 terabytes 16
move but there are techniques that you
can look at but instead of logging every
single port what is allocated you can
log clusters of ports buckets of ports
and you can divide by 10 or 100 this
size so you can go from 30 terabyte in
your case 2 maybe 3 terabyte or 0.3
terabyte that may make support much much
easier to handle yeah I understand we
can lead is dis de size but since poor
is dynamically assigned
and that's I'm not sure they'll upon the
three certainly we can't we can turn
into a bright line of all to achieve
that okay there are techniques that will
help you to reduce the amount of vlog
but you need to maintain on disk okay
that's I'm Jimmy today i see i have a
question about the scalability of the
six rd sabra you mentioned it can
support 15j customizes something like
that and I just curious about Oh am I
correct about the number anyway my
question is of idea so how heavy was
that server of working I mean if the
traffic is right to age of course that
can support well one more number of
customers so sure you point out there
good point we assumed top ones we
assumed ipv6 traffic per customer is 2
points3 kbps so it's quite a small
number then in six aldi the mutation
comes from volume of traffic notnot
number of session that Tony based
solution limitation opportunity based
solution comes from number of session
mainly so that's a big difference the
underscore the six rd limitation was
430,000 not 13,000 it's the it's the the
other thing not six rd that was fourteen
thousand sure 430 yeah sure facts
Alonzo on juniper there are two
limitations here that may be different
and happening at different point one is
the total number of user that the Box
can handle because they have to keep
context for some of that and six rd is
essentially stateless for that so it's
easy the other one is a bandwidth and it
may be that if there is very little
traffic because I yet have to see a
service provider with a lot of districts
traffic and would be happy to see that
but I have yet to see it it may be that
the limitation is actually much much
higher because no but v6 traffic
aggregated is still very small and the
Box can handle much more than bad so I
think it's important to maintain its
extension in mind about the limitation
physical limitation of a park in terms
of user and physical limitation of a box
in terms of bandwidth yeah this
calculation is 444 listen listen two or
three years so maybe if I got five years
later please Oliver will be different
how much CPU load do you see on the
server because it seems that if the
server if the server is not busy you can
simply install a 10 gig Nick and get a
know like three or four X scaling
increase I can only remember number but
mmm I'm sure it can be little biting you
in interface ok thank you very much
see hi my name is Thomas go see all the
entities I / set up this point
opportunity to have this presence this
presentation today so oops oh so I shows
ya so I'm from Tokyo Japan and today
also first of all I introduce our own
company which is entity is entity stands
for Nippon telephone telegraph and
telephone East cooperation some of you
may know that once there was a huge
telkom public cooperation called entity
it's like former AT&amp;amp;T in USA Oh like ATT
and while AT&amp;amp;T was divided too long
distance and baby bears in night fly in
1997 entity was also divided into five
main subsidized as including entities
and some affected companies and the
Holding Company and the east and west
provides domestic circumstances and
weekly entities are in charge of nose
and the eastern part of the Japan oops
sorry yes so today I'm going to explain
about our internet related business we
have been providing us is running for
the Internet as ammunition instead it's
a brand is called Fred service sobbing
God's design by telecom company sounds
pretty straight what I think but it's
quite unique architectures Oh fritz
itself is a very large IP network to use
this network as access right we adapted
Wow VPN technology it's based on pppoe
customer need to prepare home gateway to
terminate pppoe or in some case pc by
itself open pppoe session to lack with
various kind of lines like a DSL ftth
etc so no and the toner is a savage
between LA
back and they're insane then a residence
and IP packet to the ISP and the
Malaysian point are here and here so in
our own businesses we don't provide
Internet access services we only
provided access right why this is a
reason this is none certain t-shirt in
1998 at Miami I'm question of some of
your and hub t-shirt like me once ice-t
were very happy and we enjoyed to carry
IP packet but Frankenberger was coming
it's a kind of joke for 20 years ago but
decision was still the same in Japan
then as a result or bias be lobbying
campaign and the composition of
japanese government way entities and
with a highly liberated in our business
domain and tied up chained by government
so in spite of the fact that we have
nationwide ipv4 and ipv6 justic network
we can't be nice p the only thing what
we allowed is to provide a shrine by
using our p network huge and cause IP
network well I said various kind of
lying in previous site this is brief
history of line up in dry and 2000 frets
ISDN launched much man speed was 64 bit
in december twenty two thousand with
adsl lunch as broadcasts bourbons access
services at fast maximum speed was one
mega but now maximum speed its 42nd 47
megabits for downstream in august twenty
two thousand ova ftth has begun maximum
speed getting faster and faster so so
our customer maximum speed is 200 mega
bits for consumers now and one gigabit
for business customers and the last one
and GM has started in march 208 so this
gap between to 128 they think we have
been crossing our almost 10 years to
think
I whispering no we're preparing among
something incoming era in january 2004
we have started spread met which is IP
based based services we have assigned IP
bliss address to ftth and the idiots
customers by degrees so customers can
connect to each other by using ipv6 and
consumer can receive much cash budget
multicast multicast is used for ipt beef
which is served by other companies but
this ipv6 network is not connected to
Grover Internet our network is isolated
just like bridge you know old british TV
programs the prisoner it is protocol
number six just six proteges venue in
junto for Fritz one lounge please phone
is video telephony and of course
planning on ipv6 in September 204 it is
expanded to traditional form play call
it candy Denver Academy is right in
other words fiber demo means their phone
yes oh isn't it IP phone services yes it
is but our guys IP native people doesn't
like that word cell phone so now anyway
it began with IP before and we are
moving forward to Z on protocol number 6
the energy and starts in March 208 what
is in jail from the perspective of
boutique Assad and GN is IT buses itu-t
telephone buzzes computer and summer
when the perspective of marketing side
in GN is fixed mobile convergence new
brand and so no but I'm an internet
engineer my understanding of engines
running on ipv6 with SIP capability and
guaranteed eqs we have been expressed in
such features since 2004 so energy and
will be packaged them with a new brand
name Fritz cuddle next I followed into
this new to are two futures FM she is
missing in the fret next due to
Liberation's
and faith next is longing only on fiber
so before going to maintain ipv6 access
on flex karnak's this is the last slide
of our of background information this is
our scale on march two to 10 these are
numbers of subscribers ftth includes
both Russia ftth and Freddie connect we
started fresh connect two years ago
number of customers are going smoothly
was a one-meter empire but we have huge
number of traditional customers and most
of traffic is IP before so now I want to
talk some numbers on IP boy photo a fix
for you for your ears only so we always
handle almost seven point seven point
six million sessions at peak time we
send the packet to isp at 320 GB PS and
leave at 480 yo BPF traffic grows is
almost hundred and fifty percent in
these two years and park customer
traffic crosses less than twenty percent
I indeed two years this is our scale
also all I have to talk about our babies
ipv6 at peak time we carry IP basic
budget at over 50 gigabit BS most of
them are IPTV so somehow i have just
I've maintained ipv6 access on entities
and GN if the technique I most simple
way is open the gate break the world
let's connect our isolate ability to the
world but for Frankie entity it is too
dark entity stick can not be now isp
evening ipv6 air so by the isp request
we are going to prepare two options one
is yeah Yama nissan says from 206 on
pppoe and the other one is from 4-close
native also now prom one is
missing two bronze brown why is
ballistics on the powerplay six networks
and france ray is that I said open the
gate I mean connect to our network to
the internet but as I said it's too
tough sona these two options play six on
pppoe and quest native is chosen yes 36
on pppoe is familiar to the japanese isp
since it looks same existing method
let's establish another toenail for
ballistics on pppoe it's easy but
there's some weak point oops sorry for
example oh can I see ya using the
toenail makes a shorter empty you
tomorrow the match next time i will make
presentation about this one yeah and the
multicast yeah we already proved
deploying servicing but Martha just
itself is hard because the duplicating
the packets at oops yeah hot here air FN
is too expensive etc and the human is
also mentions way well critically next
using using IP basic for our did it is
substance like Khalid Emma I and IPTV
and so no so we probably provide our IP
b6 address and the ice P also provide
their own others to customer so this
option will cause multiple fix problem
to avoid this problem we need a lemma d
like ignore dedicated services adapting
66 not and having duplicate a dedicated
port on home yet etc oops sorry since
this problem is quite complicated so I
have no time to talk detail in multiple
fix if you want to know more please
judge me later if you can so yes yeah
the next one the plasma tip
native an adoption yeah it has strange
name I want to say this option is native
but some ice be object to call this
method as native Native give too much
positive in imagination to tone and
sauna anyway cuz native consists to part
one customer will be assigned one prefix
only from isp IP packet dispatched by
source address prefix at gateway between
mgn and is p is p they get the prefix
trust we r get it to customer upon
customer's request we don't distinguish
prefix from in our network our customer
will get services from both sides p and
the engine by using I squeeze critics
only at oh yeah sorry only and only at
this gateway I mean default gateway
x-point packet is dispatched by sauce
prefix so customer can choose I speed
for internet connectivity and one more
signal spawn point on of these options
communications between customers who had
connected to our engine directory IP
packet why not get to the gateway even
their subs strive to a different isp as
long as customer connect to each other
in our network there will be treated
like semi speeds customers hi yes this
option also has a weak point number of
isp oh yeah oh yeah this here limit the
number of isp who can connected to MJ
and director is limited currently this
magic number is only three perfect size
must be as long as ours it's currently
23 so now I can't predict which one I
mean pppoe on 36 or as a closed negative
but man so no market will decided so
this is the last slide here to prepare
the IP before exhaustion we have made
commitment with
government we start by six on pppoe on
every toy album and causing it yeah man
is allocated to hurry up but I only said
it starts on in spring to 11 yeah
because we want to start both of them as
soon as possible but our net x is huge
and take home it too conservative so
this is our best guarantee schedules so
now yep so in talking about ipv6 so
where is the application whereas a
network yeah it's a traditional chicken
and controversy but from a potato album
would provide ipv6 internet access
environment to all overseas in Japan and
the customers so I babe it will
terminate the controversy and ipv6 again
status of us the internet incident
infrastructures in this century thank
you uncomment did you have about five
minutes if somebody wants their has any
questions for music oh she said no no
yep thank you very much my name is John
verzasca from comcast I'm here to tell
you a bit about oh that's handy our the
trials that we are conducting comcast
some of the things that we've seen and
ultimately I'm hoping to field a great
number of questions from you all a
little bit of background and I actually
will not use a great many of these
slides here because you may have already
seen them already and frankly I'd much
rather talk to some of the points back
in January we announced our trials we
announce the number of technology trials
that we are conducting
I'll talk about where we are actively in
those that have either been started
already or that are soon to be started
or that will start in the very near
future first and foremost we had our
first commercial trial subscriber turned
up on May thirteenth that was kind of a
metro II variety type of a commercial
subscriber and honestly that was
probably one of the probably easiest of
the trial technologies that we had to
turn up for for what we're planning on
doing with in comcast that went very
smoothly and there was hardly it was
actually the simplest do for
technological point of view that
subscriber still happily running along
they are native dual stack using comcast
address space and I comprise something I
can talk to some of those details absent
you know the actual who the subscriber
is and i can tell you little bit more
about what we have planned on the
commercial space as far as what's on the
next steps are because you got to
remember some of the things that we are
aiming to do is part these trials is to
understand and vet out more of what we
need to make sure that gets kicked from
entire point of view so that when we you
know when we go and open it up to a wide
scale enablement for production
subscribers we need to be able to make
sure that we support a wide variety of
combinations you know everything from
use of static routing to you know bgp
and other things and you know to be
prudent we have to make sure that we do
that in it in a trial phase in advance
of doing that for real subscribers so so
that's the commercial the native duelist
at commercial again that was fairly
uneventful but a very substantial
achievement for comcast we have more of
those planned for the next you know 32
I'm sorry 60 to 90 days so expectable
news from us on that front something
else that you've heard us talk about
from a comcast point V trial is our six
RT trials so there may be actually
people in this room who have received
packages from me or somebody from
comcast with their with their home
networking equipment provided by Comcast
46 are dating so where we stand right
now at six rd probably in the next week
or so
what we are going to do is actually
enable the board of relays 46 rd what
we've done in advance of actually we've
kind of stepped through this and our
plan was basically to take these these
versions of home gateways that are
running some some at the time
specialized code and make sure that
there is a big period where if you're
you know you're going to use it in v4
only environment that nothing goes wrong
everything everything works as expected
in a beep Wow environment and then when
we enable and turn on the board of
relays which I like I said should happen
in a week or so we want to make sure
that there was a good baseline to build
off of and then suddenly everybody will
have 6 rd oriented v6 access we've
placed a pair of border relays and it
got a couple of our national data
centers and the initial trial base is it
was kept to a fairly small number of
people to make sure that that you know
we could we could assess what was going
on that trial will expand to probably
count for several hundred people before
the end of the summer so and some of you
are on that list already and you're not
and you're a Comcast subscriber you're
interested make sure you let me know
some of the things that we've seen with
the six with six rd you know for us is
it's largely technology that that appear
that we actually you know in
conversation with people we suggest and
if you have if you have an access
network that is not natively capable v6
personally I've kind of mentioned that
people that's really something that you
should strongly consider from a comcast
point of view however the vast majority
of our access network will support
native dual stack operations so from our
point of view it's not clear honestly
you know if six RT will be a part of our
production alien moving into the future
we may use it at points in time to
augment areas where we have the lead
support for native dual stack meaning if
we have specific access network vendors
that have you no longer commitment dates
as far as supporting native v6 is
concerned we may leverage kind of a
limited six are the infrastructure to
support that but from our point of view
we kind of feel like if we're going to
touch if we're going to touch the home
gateways anyway 46 rd or whatever else
we're going to make sure they support
ife six operations and we'll talk a
little bit about that before before this
you know before I'm done up here with
the slides one of the things that we did
find is and I know that there are
probably many people in the room who can
who can talk to this they're absent the
dtp options for for the 646 rd it seems
it seems that a scalable deployment in a
heterogeneous environment is somewhat
complicated we had to actually manually
configure the home gateways before we
sent them out that's that's that's not
going to scale right to beyond you know
even a few hundred is gonna be a problem
right but it doesn't it doesn't change
my opinion about about what people help
people who have access network
challenges particularly from a native
you six point view how they should look
at six rd if anything those folks should
actually be supporting strongly the six
rd DCP options to make sure that they
get they get ratified in and honestly
there's still an implementation phase or
DSP servers and home gateways are gonna
have to implement support for all these
things so from our point of view this is
one of the things that we've seen early
on that we knew we kind of knew it was
coming that yeah the absence of these
DSP options in an environment like a
cable environment where people buy their
own home routers is going to be it's
going to be very it will it will
increase complexity of enabling six rd
in you know in certain types of
environments nonetheless we still you
know I still you know like i said
recommend that people who have access
network challenges definitely take a
look at six rd we do not have any
figures yet i heard some folks who were
here before we talk about performance
and statistics stay tuned we'll probably
throughout the summer will be able to
offer some feedback on that front and
let you know what our experience is from
a from a from a board a real a point of
view last but not least we'll talk about
native dual stack from a docsis point of
view so this is basically oh and one
thing about six rd because of the nature
six rd it's not limited to to a
geography right so we've actually
included a number of people from all
over the country and and and like i said
may those people have their how to have
their gear ready and that will continue
as we expand the trials to to the
several hundred range mark my father
down in Alabama thanks you Joan yeah
it's true and and you mentioned
something about the DHCP options if it's
not clear six rd the DCP option has been
assigned a code point by the IETF it's
212 the Manhattan area code is kind of
cool and it's just not the yards
laughing the the RFC hasn't come out to
Edison the RFC editor skew so the IHG
has approved it that opened the door for
the code point so you can start writing
code to it you don't have to use vendor
specifics or anything to all the cpe
vendors or dhcp vendors in here Thanks
thanks mark so from a native dual-stack
point of view this is this is the one
for us that we that we believe is going
to be central to our enabling strategy
over you know for the for the
foreseeable future and we thank dr. 30
largely for this opportunity you know we
have like I said we have a largely
largely docsis 30 native ip6 cable
access network and this is the part for
us that is actually geographically bound
for the trials for a so as we've
mentioned an hour and you know on our
website and other kind of you know
speaking things that we've done is
comcast we are initially targeting the
Bay Area surprise Chicago or Chicago
metro Philadelphia because I live there
and a new england so and and right now
we are targeting probably sometimes in
july time frame before those things can
get started okay so and we will again
keep you abreast and now some of the
things that we are doing on the native
dual-stack front we have worked very
closely with a number of home gateway
vendors so to kind of pull a page at
events kind of keynote message here we
agree with him right there there you
know that's an area that that that
appears to be that we identified as an
issue you know a while ago so we've been
very clever with a number of home
networking vendors that builds
routers as well as home networking
vendors that build routers that have
cable modems embedded with them and
they're actually some of those people
here on both sides so it's part of our
trials we're actually going to leverage
Apple's linksys devices and and at least
a couple of makes and models for from
netgear all of which support native dual
stack some of them are actually fairly
i'll call them entry-level devices which
is actually very very promising sign
race so folks who build home networking
equipment here and you actually hear
more about this later in the afternoon
there's a CP panel you'll find that you
know to vince point there are a lot more
people appearing that support ipv6 is
some way shape or form and they're in
their cv products which is a big deal
but i also have to admit taking it taken
another page from vince lies there are a
number of things that that came up as
part of our preparation steps for
getting ready for all these trials right
everything from those related to dns
2624 right so one of the things i will
mention briefly some of the things that
we saw kind of in the eye you know the
anaheim ITF time frame was spikes in 64
traffic so since then we've we've
essentially decided to stand up a a
limited infrastructure for of 64 relays
because of some of the traffic volumes
that we had seen and given what what's
happening you know where the traffic was
heading and the fact that it wasn't you
know there was only a single egress and
etc etc we feel that this some that we
should take care of sooner rather than
later so that it doesn't become
something that we had to deal with this
part of our production Nadelmann 436 i
voted for Eric Eric stalk on on DNS
whitelisting because i do think as a
community that's something that really
we really do need to talk about from a
comcast point of view you know we and as
well as as Google you know we've we've
kind of suffered through a lot of
challenges on that front I think it
proves us all to come to to come to some
sort of conclusion there I know from a
comcast point of view our plan is
basically to put qua days on on our main
internet at this time is to put quality
is on our main internet sites and we'll
see how that goes and we may we may
change our our planes at some point but
we're going to we're going to stick to
that and we're going to do our best to
to kind of weather the storm here and
try to get to a point where
qualities flow freely so i think i'm
almost at a time here in imparting i
would encourage you if you're not aware
of our trials you know you know stop up
and see me visit our portal www comcast
6 net there's anything that you know you
want to sign up for run list man Cameron
Cameron burn t-mobile um do you see
beyond I know the content guys are going
to talk and we may like we talked about
whitelisting do you also see the
potential for something of a loosely
organized flag day for ipv6 deployment I
don't know it's it's I don't know man
we've had the conversation it in some
way shape or form I think as a group we
gotta I think it's too soon to tell I
mean that that's been brought up I just
don't know I don't know the answer I
think I think that's gonna have to be
something that as a community we kind of
cake you know getting anyone up hi I'm
one of those customers to switch to
comcast because of this okay and i told
i gleefully told my old isp covet why
but and i have a doc says three modem
and I'd really like you to add me to the
trial we live Bob Palo Alto so here I am
I think I have your name but i'll make
sure i can I can't imagine I'd miss you
but okay so the other thing that you'll
that I'll share with you is is we
basically stood up you can ask me your
address dude where's my cable modem it's
in my hotel room at the westin st.
Francis I brought two extra personal
delivery what's that personal delivery
personal delivery so last but not least
we you know we did on the content front
we we stood up a pair of ipv6 dot sights
I've 60 comcast net I piece of comcast
com and they're basically they're
basically translated or proxy version of
the the original content from comcast
and comcast com we felt that that was an
important step for us to take as part of
our you know our trial planning to make
sure but we are working on making sure
that there's proper enablement for the
ww sites not unless which does not
necessarily mean this can be translated
or proxy hey jason matthew from internet
in Australia we have started offering
native broadband to subscribers an
opt-in basis as well I'm just curious
for us the network it was sort of in
some ways straightforward um can you
talk briefly about how you're going with
doing the non network bit like like
email for us much much harder to get
those guys in the billing systems and so
on I mean obviously not very deep dive
but what have you found the bet so the
billing systems touches on the back
office which by far was probably you
know next to the access network is
probably the most complicated thing that
we had to do so many systems so many
servers that they all touched that was
pretty complicated email something that
we're looking at now we're looking at
taking some of the email systems may be
putting some you know some some beta
versions up to to get to work on that
but there are other things that are
going to go hand in hand with that like
I blacklists right that essentially
don't exist right so it's it's a whole
new area I mean with you this next year
we probably talking about that right I
mean that's that's going to happen right
we still got in time I had a question
for you about whether or not you were
monitoring who can reach here your ipv6
accessible or your dual stack sites we
do and we have some statistics yeah
anything also a note and share your
preliminary like who like you know who
can't read who are the broken stuff yeah
will be broken if you show what a to
comment on it so we I don't have
anything to share right now but you know
we've kind of made a commitment to the
two publicly that we're going to do
we're going to generate some of that and
share it in a an autumn eyes fashion I
don't have anything right now well
that's actually the difficult thing
right because we have some some data as
well but obviously you know privacy yep
you know they prevent stay prevent us
helping you they I think they prevent
you probably helping your customers to
some extent i'm not quite sure how to on
have you dressed that way without saying
you know hey i know that you're broken
in your house and can you can you fix
your stuff that's a little creepy great
and we've had that we've had we've had a
discussion as well I you know I think
that's one of the things that we have to
work out what we're up until now what
we've been doing is getting the
mechanics down right the process by
which we detect this brokenness right
but what you do with it from there is a
wholeness n chily a whole non-technical
string of conversations that has to
happen right oh yes I'm non-technical
but also a lot of technical
stations right there's a lot of analysis
because there's you have to categorize
all these things somebody's broken those
things as well so you know one of the
things that we've said that we that
we've said as part of you know our our
v6 program and our commitment to trying
to make it happen is is you know if we
thought it was a small you know well a
you know if we took some of the
statistics that we're out there we'd be
willing to actually mail people home
gateways to help fix the problem and one
of the things that we that you will note
let's pick you know you know I said this
for the six rd stuff as well and
applause for the natives of stack part
of this is you will get a home gateway
from comcast that supports ipv6 okay so
whether it's you know for trial use as
part of the and you know this is part of
making sure that we had that gear that
we tested it make sure it works that was
a tangent so it is a big what you're
describing is a big issue with yeah but
these stuff to go out and contact all
these people won't say we're sending us
because we're okay or just maybe send it
anonymously Rafton Christmas so we
believe it we've had that conversation
internally and believe it or not you
know we've there are some things that
we've done to proactively get older
technology out of the network right so
like Doc's is 10 modem sorry they were
yoel then we've kind of proactively
interacted with subscribers to kind of
to kind of remedy that situation it
doesn't um you know it's it's not um and
that seems it's been fairly effective
right so maybe that's something that
looks and smells like what you know an
opportunity there that sounds like
there's an existing channel actually
that's good idea yeah I suppose we
should be having this conversation
tomorrow when we're going to be talking
about the state of v6 in the internet
but so if you're interested in this
problem which is one of the major
problems from a contact provider
perspective you know please you know
show up tomorrow and discuss and
hopefully we'll have some useful
discussion there just think about it 624
is apparently to blame from given our
measurements for a lot of this it might
be worth investigating if you have the
possibility of finding users that are
spin out six to four packets and saying
hey you're using 624 and would you like
this new modem or something well it'll
be new home router but let me ask you
this question I mean in some cases 624
given the nature of the protocol which
you know I'm not hugely if
and of you know if one of the things
that we see is that as benefit of
staining our own relays up is like right
now at least we have some the ability to
kind of make it you know in part pardon
my kind of my my my use of adjectives
here but suck less right i don't i don't
really aim to make it really great to be
honest with you but i mean you know i
just i'd be honestly i don't want to be
in the middle of something that's like
you know a wide-scale navel and then
find out like oh crap i have to go deal
with 64 now right doing it you know
putting it on your infrastructure is the
right thing to do but also encouraging
uses maybe you can put things on the
website saying hey you're blinking books
but yeah and just as smart just as a
side note III hear that there's actually
changes going around and some of the
some of the home networking for home
some home networking vendors code where
64 will be enabled I'm sorry disabled by
default in a lot more cases and compared
to what but what's happening today
Frederick most question ok Frederick
here some since we have google and
comcast talking to each other here
something for the history books you you
are you must know not that I think you
could talk to each other but in the very
end of January google enable the YouTube
and then within a week you did your
announcement of your trial the scenes
were in the US was this a joint strike
nope now now that was just a happy
coincidence clearly independent in fact
I think until about three hours before
we launched youtube it was not clear
when we would work but I'm a kind of a
possibility of course territory guy
because you were both in the Atlas
report as the case studies comcast and
in YouTube so and you did this so it
seems like you're really you're talking
to each other and we're not listening
great minds think alike really we just
like this is today's a good day let's
turn it on and go for lunch it was at
1pm that that was all yeah good thanks
page on I think this needs to be the end
of the recording session
