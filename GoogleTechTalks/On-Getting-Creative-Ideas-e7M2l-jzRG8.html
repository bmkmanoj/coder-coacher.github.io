it's my great pleasure to introduce one
of the great minds of our time murray
gell-mann professor gelman has a list of
accomplishments so long that I could
spend all our up here reciting them I
won't do that but I'll highlight a few
he's been recognized by the Atomic
Energy Commission the Franklin Institute
the National Academy of Sciences the
United Nations he has honorary degrees
from well more institutions than most of
us have even attended and then there's
that little pricey one in 1969 the Nobel
Prize he spent his life contributing to
our understanding of the world and the
universe today he's here to deliver at
all excuse me deliver a talk on getting
creative ideas so please join me in
welcoming professor Galen
I'm very pleased to be here and to talk
with you about this subject probably
most of you have heard most of the
things that I'll refer to but maybe for
each of you there'll be a little nugget
that's new I hope so the the notion of a
creative idea can be extended from
science to art and business and many
other activities which we engage and
whenever a comparison is made among the
different kinds of applications it seems
that there are very close parallels I
was part of a group that met in in Aspen
in 1969 to talk about the experience of
getting a creative idea the light bulb
turning on the aha moment and there was
a poet two painters a theoretical
biologist and I was the theoretical
physicist there was another visual
artist a very famous one but he didn't
stay he couldn't stand listening to
anyone else talk and he went out and got
drunk instead of staying that doesn't
stop me from collecting his prints
anyway all of us who spoke had very
similar experiences there was a
contradiction between certain
established or available ways of doing
things and something we needed to
accomplish in art the expression of a
feeling of thought and insight in
theoretical science the explanation of
some observations well first of all each
of us worked for days or weeks or months
to resolve this contradiction between
what was needed and what we had filling
the mind with the problem then second
there came a time when further conscious
thought seemed to be useless but somehow
outside of conscious awareness mental
activity went on any way or at least
that's my interpretation of what
happened
third one day while cycling or cooking
or shaving or by a slip of the tongue
while talking or even while sleeping and
dreaming according to some people the
crucial idea turned up that got us out
of the rut and resolve the contradiction
all of us at that meeting were impressed
with the congruence of our stories I
discovered later by reading that none of
this was new the great German scientist
Helmholtz in the late 19th century had
already described three steps and named
them saturation incubation and
illumination just corresponding to what
we were discussing re Poincare a the
great mathematician in 1908 added a
fourth step obvious but also crucial
verification check that the idea works
it turned out that the psychologist
Graham Wallace in his text in 1926 had
already listed these four steps but none
of us knew about it none of us had read
his book we just came across the same
ideas through personal experience these
four stages
in theoretical science a new idea may
permit us to alter or extend the body of
theory to explain observations that
previously couldn't be understood and of
course to make new predictions that can
someday be verified let me give an
example from my own experience in fact
I'll give a little later another example
from my own experience but this one is
earlier 1952 so-called strange particles
had been observed in the cosmic
radiation later on they were observed
also an accelerators when the more
energetic accelerators went online some
of us were trying to explain why these
strange particles took so long to
disintegrate into other particles when
they were made copiously if they were
made copiously they must have interacted
strongly but if they took a long time to
decay as much as one ten millionth of a
second which in particle physics is a
very long time they take a very long
time to decay they must be weakly
coupled so what was going on well I
thought I had succeeded in explaining
the strange behavior of the strange
particles let's take for example a
proton particle similar to the neutron
and proton which was strange it was
produced copiously 'but take a long time
to decay my attempted explanation
involved a quantity i isotopic spin I
can have values zero or one half one or
three halves whatever the conventional
wisdom was that particles like the
neutron and proton which have spin
angular momentum one-half jaqua one half
had to have i equal one half or three
halves or five halves but not an integer
not a whole number other particles
mesons
with spin angular momentum J equals zero
would have I equals 0 or 1 or 2 or
something there would be this similarity
between the values of I and the values
of j it's a very nice idea but there was
no reason for it and i visited the
institute for advanced study where i had
spent the previous year and people had
heard that i had an idea to explain the
strange behavior of a particular
particle and but then i realized that it
wouldn't work i thought i had by
assigning the value i equal five halves
to this particle that would prevent it
from disintegrating by means of the
strong interaction into two particles
with i equal one half and I equal 1
because with one half and one you can't
seem to make five halves however it
turned out that electromagnetism can
change this value of I by a half unit
and electromagnetism isn't all that week
so the idea failed and the people at the
princeton Institute for Advanced Study
had heard that I'd had an idea but that
it hadn't worked and they asked me to
explain the idea and why it was wrong
well I got up to do so and I said what
I've been saying here and when I got to
this idea of assigning to the new
particle i equal five halves so it
couldn't decay into one and one-half I
made a mistake the slip of the tongue i
said i equal one instead of i equal five
halves I said let's assign this particle
I equal 1 and then I stopped dead
because the electromagnetism is going to
change i buy a half unit so
if it really had i equal one that would
solve the problem but everybody thought
that this particle had to have half
integral values of I well I quickly
reviewed in my mind what could be the
reason for this prohibition but I
realized there wasn't any reason it was
just something that people told one
another and didn't take long it just
took a few half a minute or something
for me to realize that there was no
reason for this rule and I could freely
violate it so the rest of the seminar
was quite different from what was
anticipated here it is written down on a
transparency well we can go over too
much more important realm in elementary
particle physics the war in fundamental
physics i should say and that is the
work of Einstein now we all know what
kind of techniques he used for getting
his ideas they are described in numerous
cartoons this is one of them
when he proposed special relativity in
1905 he had to get rid of the
requirement of absolute space and time
ever since Newton's day everybody knew
that there was absolute space an
absolute time and here Einstein was
dealing with space and time which
transformed into each other to some
extent depending on the state of motion
of an observer if you run rapidly past
the system what was previously X becomes
X and a little bit it becomes mostly
acts a little bit of T and T become
turns into mostly tea and a little bit
of X where T is time and X is distance
so he was dealing with relative space
and time not absolute space and time but
everybody knew that there was absolute
space in time he said well everybody may
know it but we don't need it throw it
away and it was quite right another
modest example from my own experience
proposing corks as fundamental
constituents of neutrons and protons
people are always asking me why I chose
that name but it's if you think about
the sound it's an obvious name for
fundamental constituent of atomic nuclei
well that wasn't the problem the problem
was that I was violating several rules
things that everybody knew everybody
knew that you don't have objects that
are permanently stuck inside observable
objects and can never come out to be
detected singly but quarks are like that
they're permanently stuck inside
particles like the neutron and proton
which they compose and they can't get
out singly that's why there isn't a
another route 125 around Boston I mean
128 around Boston with cork onyx
industries if the quarks could escape
singly they would have all sorts of
practical uses in industry but they
can't they're stuck inside however the
idea of particles being permanently
stuck inside was not a familiar one and
most physicists thought it was
impossible just the very fact that the
neutrons and protons are composite and
made up of simply things was also not
Orthodox belief they were supposed to be
Elementary everybody knew they were
elementary third the electric charges of
particles were supposed to be integral
multiples of the proton charge so 0 1
minus 1 the quarks however have plus
two-thirds and minus the third well
that's obviously wrong because everybody
knows you don't have fractional charges
however despite all these prohibitions
despite violating all these prohibitions
it turned out that the idea of quarks
was quite correct and was verified not
very far from here at slac on Sand Hill
Road where my friends dick Taylor Henry
Kendall and Jerry Friedman took what
amounts to an electron microscope
picture of the proton
and they were able to deduce from that
that it was actually made of mostly of
three quarks now we mustn't get the idea
that any challenge the scientific
orthodoxy is likely to be right quite
the opposite is true most challenges to
scientific orthodoxy are wrong and very
many of them are cranked one has to
verify if challenging some accepted idea
that it really can be dropped I've
talked in these last few minutes about
certain ideas that could be dropped but
not everyone can be you should always
ask why not but realize that usually
there's a damn good reason why not a few
years ago I was asked by a huge company
to appear in their television ad on the
theme why not I didn't have to say
anything good about the company I just
had to say something about asking why
not I appeared for just a moment but
they paid me a reasonable fee for it and
next year they were very pleased the
following year they were very pleased
with the reception of the ad and they
ran it again which means according to
the rules of Actors Equity that I got
the fee again and a second year's
membership in the Screen Actors Guild
then they invited me to come to their
headquarters and speak to the management
and also through their intranet to all
their employees around the world at
least in suitable time zones all on the
same subject asking why not and I
emphasize that it's very productive idea
to keep asking why not but that in
science there's usually a very
the reason why not I said I don't know
much about business but I assume it's
similar in business that you should
always ask yourself why not about all
sorts of ideas all sorts of proposed
changes but realize that there are is
generally a very good reason why not you
have to watch out always for certain
things I said one of them is profit and
loss even if though I'm not a
businessman I assume that profit and
loss are important also legal and
ethical considerations well they should
have taken notes it was of course Enron
fortunately the fees were not paid in
stock now I mentioned that there were
artists at that meeting in Aspen what
about art well for the visual arts we
can pay attention to the late Kirk
varnado a splendid guy who was the
longtime head of painting and sculpture
at the Museum of Modern Art in New York
he wrote a book which i recommend called
a fine disregard what makes Modern Art
Moderne and his idea is that in modern
art and also contemporary art which is
still more recent the artist plays with
the rules instead of always playing by
the rules the title of his book a fine
disregard comes from the inscription on
a stone next to a playing field at Rugby
School in England Kirk varnado was a
former rugby player and he was very
interested in that commemorative stone
at Rugby School here's what was written
on it what's still written on it
this stone commemorates the exploit of
william webb ellis who with a fine
disregard for the rules of football as
it played in his time first took the
ball in his arms and ran with it thus
originating the distinctive feature of
the rugby game ad 1823 so what we're
talking about in this connection is
problem formulation rather than problem
solution and I believe that problem
formulation is usually much more
important than problem solving and in
many cases more difficult it doesn't
look more difficult but it turns out to
be harder in some ways in many cases you
have to ask what are the real
requirements in this situation what are
the real conditions that the solution
must satisfy if you get that right then
you can try and figure out what the
solution is there's one place however
where the problems are formulated for
you school it's almost the only place
where the problems are formulated for
you and then you just solve them in
almost any other place and almost any
other human activity the challenge is to
formulate the problem and then later
solve it there's a very familiar
exercise that all of you have seen with
that can be made to illustrate this
point here's the diagram you've all seen
it nine dots forming a square and you're
asked to connect all the dots by drawing
the smallest possible number of straight
lines without taking the pencil off the
paper and anybody can do it with five
straight
lines it's very easy to do it with four
straight lines which is possible you
have to do something like this and you
notice that the lines are outside of the
square at times that maybe for all I
know where the expression thinking
outside the box comes from this would be
the box and these lines which connect
the dots if you're going to do it with
four lines only get get outside the box
and at the Santa Fe Institute where I
work we have a resident cat and there's
a cartoon posted on the wall that has a
man talking to his cat the cat is on the
floor next to a tray of kitty litter and
the man is shaking his finger at the cat
and saying never never think outside the
box now if we're going to solve this
problem you can solve it in a trivial
way as we saw by going outside the box
but you could imagine other things
besides asking whether you are allowed
to draw lines are you allowed to draw
lines that go outside the square but you
can also ask do you have to treat the
dots as points in the actual picture
they're little round dots they're not
points they have width can you take the
width into account are you allowed to
are you allowed to use the thickness of
the lines as opposed to mathematical
lines which have no thickness are you
allowed to crumple up the paper and
drive the pencil through
you could do it in one line which of
these is allowed which of these are
allowed the this exercise and this these
questions about what's allowed were
treated in a somewhat different way from
the way I'm treating them but this same
same ID same general idea they're
treated in the book by Professor James L
Adams called conceptual blockbusting a
guide to better ideas they're also
emphasized in talks by my friend Paul
mccrady the who developed the bicycle
powered aircraft and the solar-powered
aircraft and the flying flapping
pterodactyl and lots of other things but
here's a letter that a ten-year-old girl
wrote to professor Adams I'll read it to
you but it's also here so you can look
at it dear professor james l adams my
dad and I were doing puzzles from
conceptual blockbusting we were working
mostly on the dot ones and then she has
the nine dots here my dad said a man
found a way to do it with one line I
tried and did it not with folding I used
a fat line
it doesn't say you can't use a fat line
like this actually you need a very fat
writing apparatus sincerely Becky beagle
age 10 wonder what happened to Becky
Biko another thing we can say about
creative ideas with illustrations from
physics but also illustrations from lots
of other things is that often a creative
idea involves taking an existing idea
and building on it taking it more
seriously than its original proponent
did and using it for some other purpose
we can look again at 1905 that
miraculous year for Albert Einstein when
working as a patent clerk in Bern
Switzerland Switzerland he had three
ideas that he published in the same
volume of the German physics journal on
a Lyndell physique not only the same
year but the same volume of the journal
special relativity is one and we
mentioned it but we didn't mention this
interpretation of it one way to describe
special relativity is to say that the
symmetries the transformations of
special relativity are the symmetries of
Maxwell's equations for the
electromagnetic field and what Einstein
did was to take those symmetries the
symmetries of Maxwell's equations and
apply them also to particle dynamics to
the particles moving in the electric and
magnetic fields of Maxwell so that the
whole problem obeyed this symmetries and
the symmetries are the symmetries of
special relativity they're just the
space-time transformations of special
relativity now those transformations
were known
already especially to the Dutch
physicist a che Lawrence Lawrence found
these transformations exactly the same
ones that Einstein used later for
special relativity and to this day
they're called the Lorentz
transformations why isn't special
relativity attributed to Lawrence well
two things we've seen already that
Einstein threw away absolute space and
time and left only the relative space
and time of relativity Lawrence didn't
do that he kept looking for a way to fit
absolute space and time in with the
relative space and time and of course he
never found it Einstein simply took the
step of cutting the Gordian knot
throwing away absolute space and time
but there's another reason Lawrence
didn't take the additional step of
applying these same symmetries to
particle dynamics they remain just the
symmetries of Maxwell's equations for
electromagnetism it took Einstein to add
the additional idea that these
transformations were general and they
applied to the particle dynamics as well
as to the electromagnetic fields so
Lawrence was a great man and did very
important work here but he failed to see
these two these two important points and
so Einstein was taking Lawrence's idea
more seriously than Lawrence himself had
that's even more obvious than even more
striking in the case of Einstein's work
on the photoelectric effect in the
photoelectric effect a bit of light hits
a metal surface and knocks out an
electron and Max Planck in 1900
suggested the quantum that for this
purpose electromagnetic energy was came
in packets of energy where the energy
was his Punx constant h times the
frequency of the of the light of the
electromagnetic wave
well this was it rather revolutionary
idea and but punks didn't carry it far
enough he had the idea of the quantum
all right but not in connection with the
photoelectric effect it didn't occur to
him that electromagnetism in hitting the
electron and knocking it out would come
in the form of a quantum if you don't
assume the quantum in that case you get
this simple equation of conservation of
energy H nu nu is the frequency H is
Planck's constant this is the energy of
the quantum the energy of the quantum
equals the electrons kinetic energy plus
the energy necessary to knock it out of
the metal very very simple equation but
this equation worked it explained the
data the data conformed exactly to this
equation clock didn't like it he had
invented the quantum for other reasons
he believed in the quantum for these
other purposes but taking it more
seriously than he had originally done
was not something he believed he didn't
think that Einstein understood what he
was doing in applying the quantum to the
photoelectric effect nevertheless plank
looked favorably on young Einstein he
recommended him for membership in the
prussian academy of sciences which is a
rather high honour and eventually for
the swedish metal is a Nobel Prize which
Einstein didn't win for another sixteen
years and he got it for the
photoelectric effect finally people
stopped objecting even plonk I guess
stopped objecting a vestry to his use of
the quantum in this connection plonk
said well earlier earlier on plonk said
well Einstein is really very good he's a
very good physicist we'll forgive him
this youthful indiscretion of believing
that the quantum can be used herein
photoelectric effect but finally in 1921
he won the Nobel Prize for just for this
equation
a third thing that Einstein did in 1905
was to study the Brownian motion you
know what that is is discovered by the
english botanist Brown around 1830 or so
you can see it yourself if you look at
something like ink and water under a
microscope you see the little particles
of ink moving randomly in little jerk
and Einstein and also the Polish
theorists a smaller koffsky the same
time suggested that they were being hit
by molecules and Einstein worked it all
out mathematically and figured out how
many molecules per unit volume you would
get in a gas and compared it with other
estimates of that and measurements and
all else seemed to work as motor kofsky
did something similar what they were
doing was taking seriously the notion of
a molecule everybody agreed that
molecules were useful in chemistry a
sort of chemical bookkeeping but that
the molecule was something that could
hit you that could hit an ink particle
and make it move that was not believed
by most physicists but this work made it
clear that the molecule was a real thing
that should be taken more seriously than
it had been taken by people who
suggested it earlier
now let me close by discussing very
briefly the notion of teaching creative
thinking there's nothing to tell us a
priori that it's impossible to improve
creative thinking by teaching it might
work it might not the the proof would
have to be in the pudding one man who
has ideas about that and tries to teach
creative thinking does so very widely in
many large corporations and so on is
Edward de Bono and his kind of reasoning
can be represented this way he doesn't
say exactly this but this is something
that relates to the way he looks at
things you imagine that you have a
landscape of ideas looking like this
with shallow holes and deep holes and
the deep hole is a great idea that you
should get eventually the shallow holes
are less good ideas that will not solve
your problems and the objective should
be to get somehow to the bottom of this
deep hole and stay there now if you're
just moving downhill if your only
instruction is to keep moving downhill
because you think a better idealize in a
certain direction then you're likely to
get stuck in a shallow hole because
there are lots more shallow holes than
deep ones however if you have noise or
heat or simulated annealing as it's
often called so that there's a random
motion superposed on going downhill then
if the it's the right amount of heat or
randomness you could be knocked out of
all the shallow holes but not be knocked
out of a deep one because of the tuning
the amount of heat or noise or whatever
it is you're adding to the system so
that it's enough to knock you out of
shallow holes but not
enough to knock you out of a deep one
then looking for the right idea would
involve a tendency to move downwards
modulated by some noise that knocks you
out of shallow holes but still allows
you to explore the deep one so that
suggests if there's anything to it it
suggests that you should apply that if
you're trying to solve problems you
should try to use something random in
addition to all the logical rational
reasonable inputs to your thinking you
should use something random so what
Edward suggests is looking at the last
mound on the front page of today's
newspaper and using that to solve your
problem that contributes enough noise
that maybe you'll be thrown out of the
shallow holes but perhaps you'll be able
to reach a deep one and stay there we
shouldn't think that finding creative
ideas is restricted to these
stratospheric realms of science and art
and so on it can also appear at any
moment in everyday life we're all faced
with little puzzles every day and the
more we have all this equipment in our
lives the more it's true at any moment
we can be faced with something that
requires a creative thought one writer
on this subject discusses the case of a
company picnic involving a lot of cheese
no one however is thought to bring a
knife to cut the cheese but a young lady
pulls out her credit card and cuts the
cheese that's a much more modest
achievement than many of the things
we've been talking about like special
relativity and so on but it does involve
a creative idea and it involves using
something beyond the domain for which it
was originally
well i'm very happy to answer questions
and I regard this little talk as a just
as an introduction to a question and
answer session thank
well thank you for joining us I guess a
couple things to say one of them is that
I'm not sure how familiar you are with
computer science but it isn't obvious to
me whether it's yet a science except for
when it comes to debugging and I'm sure
that when we're debugging bar doing
science and people talk about the
creative process in science is coming up
with models or you know explanations but
at least in my observation there's two
other steps that are highly creative in
the scientific method and one of them is
coming up with a specific hypothesis
test and third is coming up with a test
for it yes well I included those as well
that I said then in science you may be
accounting for some new data or you may
be proposing a new hypothesis or you may
be suggesting a way of prediction making
a prediction that would allow hypothesis
to be tested I agree with you completely
I actually said it thank you you're
completely right that's theoretical
science yeah there's also experimental
science and there's also the making of
equipment and all of those involves lots
of creative thinking it's just that I
was talking about theoretical science
yeah not complaining i just wanted to
sort of emphasize these areas that i
think it under emphasized in discussions
yes you're quite right thanks very much
for the talk I'm an avid observer of
amateur observer of particle physics and
particle physicists without being very
mathematical and I wondered if you had
any thoughts on string theory and string
theorists because things have lots of
ideas but very little experimental
evidence so far well let's see I'm asked
that question often
I am a an important patron of
superstring theory when superstring
theory was first developed 1971-72 I
thought that it would be very important
I didn't know for what and the people I
asked the people who were doing it to
come to Caltech to join my group
especially John Schwarz and Pierre
Rameau on Queen nuvvu who was who wrote
the original paper with John Schwarz
came for a while but then he returned to
France but the other two stayed and we
gradually built up quite a group at
Caltech part of my theoretical physics
theoretical particle physics group so
most of the work a great deal of the
work anyway there was done on
superstring theory between 72 and 84 was
done in my shop not by me but people who
came there and during that time we
realized that what they used was what
the possible use was of superstring
theory it was originally intended to be
a theory just of the strong interaction
the Hadron so-called strongly
interacting particles but it was
discovered that it couldn't be it
couldn't be a theory of the strongly
interacting particles because has a
particle with zero mass and spin to
which you couldn't possibly have in the
theory of the strong interaction there's
no mess on like that but there is a
particle like that the graviton
quantized gravitation so what this was
was a candidate for a theory of all the
interactions including gravitation and
it was noticed in the middle 70s that a
theory based on super strings would
predict Einstein's general relativistic
theory of gravitation and it would
predict it with in quantum mechanics and
without the crazy infinite Corrections
which appeared in other attempts to
unify general relativity and quantum
mechanics that's is what my opinion made
it very attractive
it had the graviton of course which made
it unsuitable to be a theory of the
strong interaction but very suitable to
lead perhaps to a unified theory of all
the forces in all the elementary
particles well since then it's 30 years
or so people have been trying to build a
correct unified theory or a good
candidate for a unified theory based on
super strings and they made an enormous
amount of progress in various spurts
they haven't got there yet however and
some of the efforts look discouraging
some of the result of the results of
some of the efforts look discouraging
but in other case is not so discouraging
as to predictions there will certainly
be predictions we've already seen a
retro addiction of very great importance
namely the retro addiction of Einstein's
a general relativistic theory of
gravitation this is not negligible
there's also the prediction that you
have supersymmetry presumably broken
supersymmetry since we don't observe
exact supersymmetry supersymmetry is a
symmetry between fermions and bosons
between particles that obey the
exclusion principle like the electron
and particles that obey an anti
exclusion principle like the photons
that anti exclusion principle is what
makes the laser possible of course
photons love to be in the same state at
the same time and that's how you can
have a laser beam the the super symmetry
has to be broken to be compatible with
observation and it has to supply for
every elementary particle a companion
with the opposite statistics in other
words for every elementary Fermi on it
has to be a boson and for every
elementary boson there has to be a
fermion and these have received some
peculiar names i was there when they
were named but I
name them myself thus electron for the
electron the 14 o companies the photon
and so on and so on now these things are
being sought at accelerators when the
new bigger accelerator comes online in
near Geneva next year or the year after
they'll really step up the search for
these partners superpartners of the
known particles and if some of them are
found that will certainly be encouraging
for theories based on super strings
supersymmetry broken supersymmetry is
also very good for answering a number of
other theoretical problems that we have
but you could of course technically have
super sub broken supersymmetry without
having super strange so nvm enemies of
super strings who seem to have turned up
in various places can always say that
but I think that finding super partners
will be very encouraging for a
possibility that one can construct a
suitable super strain theory based on
super strings but attacking a theory
that hasn't yet been constructed is a
little strange I think mostly it's about
money some people would like some of the
money that goes to the smart people to
work on super string theory to go to
that anxiety their right foot I don't
know
thank you again for coming um I have a
more general question which is on the
theme of creativity yuvan described um I
didn't talk about creativity talking
about creative thinking the creative
thinking well I won't argue the drive is
something else it's some sort of
probably inborn characteristic that
allows you to engage in creative
thinking and in creative projects in
science and art and so on okay so i'll
restrict myself to creative thinking
again but the on the examples you've
given up creative thinking are i'll say
directed once you have found the problem
there is a chunk of cheese that needs to
be cut or there is an unexplained a spin
that needs to be explained and so so you
already have the problem there and I'm
just wondering if you have and there is
a question of how do you how do you
think outside the box for example to
attack that existing problem but as you
pointed out there's this issue of you
know um as engineers we often have the
problem in front of us you know there's
there something that's not running or
there was something that's not running
well enough but um there's also this
this we find ourselves in this situation
of looking for looking for a problem to
solve okay everything's cleared from my
desk I'm an engineer on a scientist I'm
an artist how do i how do I decide on
the kickin can we apply creative
thinking to figuring out you know we're
not since we're not in school and the
problems aren't necessarily given to us
can we can we apply that same or some
some similar heuristics to figuring out
what problems we should be attacking
next well I that was the subject of my
talk really well I said that problem
formulation is usually much more
important and in some sense not an
obvious sense but in some sense more
difficult than problem solution right
you have to find out what's wrong you
have to wait where is it itching so I
can scratch it and and that's tricky
sometimes what roles do I have to obey
in order to get something in order for
me to be allowed to have something new
what rules do I have to violate what
rules can I violate without without
running into a contradiction or running
into a contradiction with nature and so
on and so forth so it's precisely as you
say that you have most of the the most
important time is when you are not sure
what the problem is you have a piece of
equipment that isn't working maybe you
shouldn't have that kind of equipment
but but when this is different kind of
equipment you're generating energy in
some particular way maybe you should
generate it in some other way or maybe
you shouldn't generate it at all but
save energy and so on and so forth right
but when the equipment isn't working
it's they know that's that sort of a
problem you um it may suggest a it may
suggest an open issue that's completely
unrelated to the equipment's not working
is that but essentially that that's
where something is itching I guess what
I'm finding is that necessarily not
necessarily and even debugging which was
mentioned is an interesting topic we all
know of a gigantic corporation that does
no debugging and lets the customers to
do that that was an interesting
invention imagine being able to make
money by selling a whole lot of products
that don't work and letting your
customers figure out how to improve them
great idea I wanted to ask you about
another creative idea that's about 30
years old and that can potentially
change the way we work here what is your
take on the future of quantum computing
Oh quantum computing well so far one
hasn't gotten terribly far with it
except for a lot of ideas and the ideas
are two kinds of course one is how we
might be able to make a quantum
computer that works and the second is
what kinds of problems could it solve
for us what kinds of things could be
what sorts of things would be changed by
having quantum computers well originally
people thought that it would be very
very very difficult to maintain the
coherence for long enough or over big
enough range to have a functioning
quantum computer but then once you got
it it would be able to solve all sorts
of problems in polynomial time which is
thought to require exponential or worse
time to solve well it hasn't quite
turned out that way mr. Shore of course
found that one famous algorithm
involving factoring huge numbers into
their prime factors that that could
probably be reduced to a problem soluble
in polynomial time but other than that
there haven't been any proof of event
instead and and instead people have
stopped thinking that is necessarily so
difficult to maintain the coherence
because they have all these error
correcting algorithms that might succeed
in canceling out the inherent noise in a
quantum computer and allow for the right
allow for a situation that would
resemble the situation with with a lot
of coherence so it's just turned around
as far as I can tell the ideas about
quantum computers have turned around
it's maybe not so difficult to simulate
the coherence that you need through all
these error correcting procedures but it
may be difficult to find a problem that
the quantum computer will solve better
and people have started thinking
therefore about quantum systems what
about simulating quantum systems quantum
computer might be really good for that
and it's quite different from the kind
of use that people had in mind some
years ago but so far the quantum
computers are very very limited capacity
and as my good friend Seth Lloyd says a
a two-bit computer is a two-bit computer
he we've wondered where our alumni of
the Santa Fe Institute would get jobs
and we worried whether they would get
jobs at all because they're all highly
interdisciplinary but academic jobs seem
to be available provided you don't try
to predict in what department some of
our physics trained people have ended up
in sociology one professor at Columbia
who spent a long time at the Santa Fe
Institute a very brilliant guy from
Australia said that the first sociology
class he was ever in was the one he was
teaching as a full professor so Seth
Lloyd has become a professor of
mechanical engineering and because he's
trying to develop quantum computers he
says he's a professor of quantum
mechanical engineering it satisfies
everybody but he's the one who says that
the two big computers are two big
computers that's all we have so far I
don't think I've answered your question
but there's this question make sure you
could actually get no it's okay my
question actually surprised into that
one focus of creativity would seem to be
interdisciplinary and applying things
you have learned or approaches from one
field to a very different field and
again speaking is in amateur and physics
it seems like the two things at least
get most publicity outside the field
right now our super string theory and
the whole Dark Matter dark energy issue
I never hear anything about how those
combined is there any sort of
combination of those well let's just say
what dark matter and dark energy are
they're not very good names
the dark energies are really done they
especially because people could mix it
up with dark matter with which it has
almost nothing to do dark matter refers
to the fact that galaxies and clusters
of galaxies are made up mostly of
different material from what we're
accustomed to discussing not stars and
planets and ordinary molecules and so on
and so forth made of something else
that's called dark matter and the super
partners of known particles may well be
make a major contribution to the
so-called dark matter I used to walk by
the astronomers table at the faculty
club at Caltech when I was still
teaching there and I would say to them
uh don't you guys realize you're talking
just about four percent of the universe
everything else is foti knows they
didn't like that however it was
perfectly true we don't know if it's
foti knows but it's something there may
be several kinds of dark matter now dark
energy is a really dumb name for the
discovery that the recession of galactic
clusters that's called the expansion of
the universe is accelerating the
expansion of the universe you have to
realize if you're a layperson than this
business doesn't mean that atoms recede
from one another or that rocks recede
from one another or planets and stars
recede from one another's not even
galaxies received from one another it's
clusters of galaxies gravitationally
closed that Reese undergo a recession
from one another and with the discovery
that this recession is accelerated we're
back to the old question of the
cosmological term in Einstein's general
relativistic equation for gravitation
he introduced this cosmological term
because he wanted a static universe he
didn't realize that there was
observational evidence for an expanding
universe he wanted a static universe and
since the universe would collapse under
gravitation which is purely attractive
he had to introduce something else that
would stabilize it so he introduced this
extra cosmological constant the single
constant added to the equation for
gravitation and then he realized that
through the work of Hubble in Pasadena
that the clusters of galaxies were
receding for one another and you had an
expanding universe so he then said oh
this was a terrible mistake I've
committed this terrible error of
introducing this extra term marring the
beauty of my equation and it's not
necessary because we have an expanding
universe and it will either keep on
expanding or eventually contract and we
don't have to worry about this extra
term but now it's back apparently or
something like it either that or
something very like it in order to
explain the acceleration of the
expansion of the universe the question
is why does it have the value that it
has the funny thing isn't that it's
nonzero if you look at it in the light
of particle physics there has to be such
a term it's the average energy of the
vacuum or something and so it's a fairly
obvious thing and it must be there the
question is why is it so tiny because if
you try to estimate for particle physics
what kind of a value you might have for
it the discrepancy between that and what
is seen assuming that what is seen
really is a cosmological sure the
discrepancy is by a factor of 10 to the
118 which is the largest fudge factor in
the history of the
and that's a really good question i
would like to know the answer to that
thank you thank you so much for coming
doctor yell man i'm curious uh having
spent a lot of your career in something
called theoretical physics what are the
applications of your work that have
given you the biggest thrill application
yeah I mean for instance the laser a
microwave oven I mean other things that
other pieces of technology that we have
in the in the real world that you look
at the knowing the physics behind them
you look at that and say wow that's
really neat and I helped contribute to
that why can't think of any application
but it takes a while you know I mean I'm
very very very old now we want to think
of me as a child prodigy I'm a very old
child but anyway I nevertheless not old
enough to see the applications of the
things I worked out take the laser for
example it came out of Bush Einstein
statistics as i said the fact that
photons like to be in the same state at
the same time and this was proposed
theoretically in nineteen seventeen and
nineteen twenty by einstein and by the
indian bengali physicist bush or basu
but the it wasn't until 40 years later
that we got the laser and the same kind
of time interval may apply to a lots of
other fundamental fundamental ideas and
fundamental discoveries that they don't
lead to gadgets until much much much
later so now if the cork had been able
to escape singly from its prison we
would have quark onyx for sure lots and
lots of applications including mediating
thermonuclear fusion
but sorry I'm curious I've noticed that
the experimental physics is getting
increasingly expensive for example at
the LHC where they're building something
very large which may or may not discover
like a stop particle may not discover
why the stop super top ooi fit yes okay
um I'm curious what you think about
computational approaches like lattice
gauge theory or oh it's very good of
course but it doesn't substitute
completely for experiments no no Santa
Fe Institute we do a lot of simulation
and modeling and so on with computers
and computer experiments are extremely
important but they're extremely
important usually when you have some
model or a theory of what's going on and
you want to understand its consequences
but we also need to know what's actually
happening out there uh thanks again we
waste a lot more money on a lot of other
things were you I wouldn't worry about
wasting money on particle accelerators
if there's another one it will be for
the whole world a single one for the
whole world an electron-positron
Collider like slack here at Sanford but
much much much bigger and that would be
a world machine contribute with
contributions from all the invite all
the countries involved and that's still
for number of years ahead so one
anecdotal I wish we could get the US
Patent Office time to her I'm sorry what
I wish we could get the US Patent Office
to have the hiring standards of the
Swiss Patent Office but in two thousand
Michael Crichton an author observed that
there were a number of anomalies in
physics that were in theory going to be
explained by simple changes to the
standard model and what not and he
likened it to the period of physics
between the 1890s and early 1900s where
you know quantum mechanics and all these
changes occur
in the way we thought about things I was
wondering though they didn't occur what
you're trying to say there were all
these contradictions of classical theory
but people didn't take the step of
dropping a whole lot of ideas and
substituting entirely new ones right
they did that a couple of decades later
right so I i was wondering in what
anomalies I mean I've i read in the way
i don't know i don't get my scientific
education from this very tall medical
student hi what questions do you think
will be important to be answered in this
couple of decades what what questions
like the questions in physics well i
just listed some you know do we really
have super particles so we have
approximate supersymmetry and super
yang-mills theory super super gauge
theories do we actually verify all that
do we get to understand the size of the
cosmological constant or whatever
replaces it in explaining the
acceleration of the expansion of the
universe and what about constructing a
unified theory based on superstring
ideas will that be successful will we
verify the existence of an actual Higgs
particle one or more Higgs particles
rather than finding some kind of Higgs
like mechanism that doesn't involve a
new particle in order to explain the
masses of otherwise massless particles
so on and so forth lots of very
well-known questions thank I don't know
what this guy has in mind well somebody
has to ask this question um dr. Robert
boussard was here a few months ago who
was Robert boussard oh really the twin
person I'm sorry the twin guy a twin guy
the guy with the twin studies but no
identical twins that may have done that
as well but I he was here for another
reason no no this is a different person
okay who is um I don't know it he was
talking about an extension of the
Farnsworth containment mechanism for
fusion the what for fusion
I'm sorry I just don't understand I
don't know what you're talking about
some field to which I'm not with which
I'm not electrostatic containment of
fusion pardon I like electrostatic
containment it Oh containment of plasma
yeah can any milk in the rubber bands hi
well I was going to ask you tell you it
was I'm sorry I didn't hear I was going
to ask you if you had evaluated his work
I don't know any of this i'm sorry i did
follow some developments in the attempts
to to achieve that practical
thermonuclear fusion some years ago it's
been going on for a long time it's 56
years all right yeah the US has been any
of us has been working on this and
probably a bit longer elsewhere it was
highly classified to begin with in 1951
or so too while it was very highly
classified they had a meeting at
berkeley of people working on various
approaches to thermonuclear fusion and
it was held in a movie theater and it
was the project was called Project
Sherwood people brought pads of paper
into the meeting to take notes but then
they had to turn the pads of paper over
the security guards as they left even if
they were blanked however the owner of
the theater was a wag and a wag with
access to some knowledge because the
Marquis of the theater had two movies
listed which weren't playing at all but
the titles were up there men of Sherwood
and top secret alright thanks that's all
I know I'm sorry I don't know
thank you very much dr. Gelman for your
contributions and for your talk here
there's a fine line between being a
creative innovator and being a
disruptive nuisance it can be argued
that it is equally or more important to
communicate persuasively as it is to
think creatively what are your thoughts
along these lines oh I think it's always
good to do that great people but some
people whom it's very difficult to
persuade and to waste one's energy on
perpetual debate with those people is
probably not a good idea but there are
other people who were accessible to
reasonable arguments and so on and once
you deal very gently with them and you
try to persuade them or maybe they're
right and you're wrong in case you
should let them persuade you I've read
that you have interest in a number of
languages I'm interested in
relationships among languages can you so
much fun having your five we can I have
a project of that kind involving some
brilliant Russian linguist and you're
fluent in 13 or so but know that you
know you can't trust things like that
but it's is there any interaction
between I mean I'm not recommending that
you burn all copies of this but it
doesn't contain only things that are
true is there any truth at all to that
section of the page well I don't speak
languages other than American English
correctly but I know a little bit about
languages and I'm sort of an honorary
language baby honorary amateur linguist
do you and I'm very interested in the
relationships among languages and I've
learned quite a bit as a result and I'd
naturally I know a few words of various
languages as a result but that I speak
correctly some large number of languages
is just not true uh is there any
interaction between creative thinking
and languages or learning languages that
you've come across in your study in your
amateur study thank you mmm I don't know
I'm not sure I'm not sure about that
I haven't I have i'm not i'm not sure
whether this is your connection well I
guess that's it thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
