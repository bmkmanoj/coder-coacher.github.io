brown bag / tech talk i'm pleased to
welcome serb here to talk about taking a
holistic approach to designing for
people and i'd like to introduce brian
murphy who is the founder of ZURB and
prior to founding ZURB brand taught at
the stanford product design at stanford
for 10 years and some observes clients
you may have heard of a few of them they
include facebook yahoo ebay britney
spears Reuters New York Stock Exchange
and then presenting along with brian is
Jeremy Britain who is also a partner ads
herb and serves as design lead and
strategist and prior deserve Jeremy was
an animator and designer at walmart com
so without further ado I'll never do
Brian oh cool so we'll jump right in so
the so this year is a product built for
world domination was built really
efficiently by the Empire they got a MIT
daytime boxed it the sucker was fully
operational quicker than a competition
expected I was built by the rank and
file their problem is some of them were
maybe a little bit uninspired and let's
face it with death star one the exhaust
port team really let them down this
particular version you might say it was
more of a strategic short coming Emperor
kind of underestimated maybe the buy-in
of his number two in this particular
case key thing here is that there was a
little spot that was a problem that
ended up eroding the whole thing need
the whole team on board to actually get
this to to fly for us so we want to talk
about here is we're really concerned in
how you get product off the ground in a
social setting with the team so you
don't end up throwing six or twelve
months of your life away into a black
hole you want to build stuff that people
use you don't want to build stuff that
nobody uses so how do you do that and we
want to make sure that none of us end up
getting sucked in here that's that could
be you right so uh the topic today is
turning mediocre products into awesome
products and you know the the goal here
is to help you see how you could be
taking something you're working on and
make
awesome so words herb this is a German
over here just talking with hambright
ZURB is a focused on designed for people
so we've been around for quite some time
we like to think I reading for inviting
and she actually was kind enough to
speak at our soap box and we enjoy
speaking about design so we're a
close-knit team that's been helping
people design products and services
since 1998 so that's that's about 13
years so we've been doing this for quite
some time and in that time we've helped
actually 150 startups those are those
little guys there that don't really have
a whole lot of expertise in anything and
are just trying to get along so if you
look at that that's quite a few little
startups we've actually helped in those
startups we've helped almost a billion
politics if it's phil's companies we've
worked with that's a lot of Benjamin's
so Irene mentioned we worked with that
what we call startups but we also work
with grown-up startups those are the
facebooks you might even consider Google
a grown-up startup and honey your old
companies like New York Stock Exchange
Reuters those companies that have are
trying to reinvent themselves to new
products and britney spares too but
sorry about that one you can follow us
at at serb on our twitter stream so we
published daily we share our ideas on
her blog and i think you find a lot of
those ideas useful as we already do the
introduction yeah so again we've got an
introduction for read but we didn't come
here into space ache but we are here to
help you understand what your customers
are looking for we want you to be
investigators of pulling back what
people are looking for so if we could
get one goal out of the stock you'd be
for you to create one more prototype
talk to five customers and have one
internal advocate of your ideas so again
one prototype five customers one
internal advocate and we'll circle back
around on this cool so I think one
aspect of design that we probably are
all a little bit more familiar with is
really iterative design the idea of
actually taking a product and really
moving that forward to stay ahead of
your competition to continue to actually
build a space for yourself in the
marketplace but I think what we're
really kind of interested in talking
about here is we kind of all know the
story of friends at the ipod it's
ubiquitous it's cliche we talk about it
generation because this didn't just
start on october twenty thirty two
thousand one right this started quite a
bit before that um this is an example of
as simple as a product can start so Jeff
Hawkins at palm if you remember I know
if you guys are familiar with a story to
the way started out doing doing the palm
pilot was actually carrying a little pen
tab and a block of wood not on like this
around in his pocket and he was are
notorious for taking this into spaces
where he would imagine somebody actually
using this product and feeling out how
would I actually take notes with this
how would i if I walk into the remember
he was walked in the bathroom or
something I'd drop this how durable what
I expect this to be took into all these
different kinds of concepts or contexts
and actually made sure he live with that
and what's interesting too is he did
this at a time when everybody had kind
of written off the idea that this kind
of product was Bible at all it was just
a graveyard of companies that had tried
the stuff and not made it work the Steve
Jobs myth so this is something you know
we're talking about again very evic
whattup Sui ball talked about him kind
of ad nauseam and a way we're almost
taught you know tired of talking about
Steve but one of things we keep finding
is there's sort of this myth that the
idea of Steve Jobs is the lone genius
that he somehow you know springing ideas
from his head and just eating that
company right from the top down almost
as if he doesn't have another support
network or almost as if it's like the
the evil empire something I right I mean
he's got the rank-and-file just sort of
implementing things underneath them and
what's Apple going to do when he's
actually gone this is kind of an
interesting story actually just wrote
about this in the blog the other day
that's a little picture of our plush
steve jobs but lewis our customer
service advocate actually used to work
at the stanford palo alto apple store
and he said one things you know Steve
Jobs famous for is actually visiting and
frequenting that store quite a bit he
said one things he would do too is in
order to not you know sort of disrupt
things and actually go oh my god Steve
Jobs is here and everybody sort of
gathers random she would actually
literally hide in those bushes in the
hallway outside and peer in so people
wouldn't know of course they immediately
recognized this all the employees are
really nervous and were like great he's
watching us
oh no he's evaluating what he's really
doing was observing customers and the
key insight here is that you know well
some people say they don't do focus
groups they did do observation and they
do within their culture their cultivate
a really really deep understanding for
how people what they want what the
desires are what their behaviors are and
what what product might actually you
know appeal to them and the interesting
thing is a really long quote but he had
a big team around him but he stayed
invested in this the whole way through
this is one somewhere he set up the
strategy and said guys go and maybe pops
in again couple months later maybe
that's disruptive maybe not he was
invested and when he saw this thing
picking up steam he was all in everyday
so carrying with that team if you look
at the success of some of the products
that Apple's created it's about getting
that buying early on and staying with it
well here's another example of something
that it's not about necessarily creating
the product it's about understanding
that your product is a network of people
so Thomas Edison was an amazing network
in fact he would skip meals ahead of
time or even actually skip them he would
skip the meals at events and eat ahead
of time so that he could talk to all the
people there so he had a team of a
hundred and engineers constantly working
but the neat thing about what his
approach was was he was constantly
evaluating the ideas so looking for
opportunities within his own team to
talk things out so if you know I'm just
looking at it he would he would be
constantly throwing ideas out of the
team to try and work through the big
concepts which strikes us has the whole
light bulb you know everyone you know is
reminded of the lightbulb to Edison but
you know there was a lot of better
things out there what he found was a
network of people so strangely enough
one of his successful prototypes came
while he was trying to look at the
slaughter clips with a team of
scientists in Wyoming and realized while
fishing at the bamboo filament was going
to be far superior for his prototype so
the reason why that happened wasn't
because of you know sheer luck it's
because he put himself in in in groups
of people that were actually really
smart and intelligent and we're sharing
ideas with one another which brings us
to another great invention and
in concept was the post-it note so
silver who had originally created the
concept of the stickiness didn't really
have an application for in fact he was
trying to look for internal advocates at
3m for five years it wasn't until our
fri came along and said oh I'd love to
use that it for book-marking because my
bookmarks fall out of my hem book well
it took another year internally and two
more years before the product actually
got to market and it was a flop it
didn't actually go anywhere the reality
is they stuck with it in position the
product differently by calling a post-it
notes and found an audience and then it
expanded exploded extremely fast that
took ten years but what's important here
is finding an internal advocate finding
someone that in your organization
understands that it's not just a product
it's about connecting to people in
finding an audience so again if we can
walk away with something here from our
side is if you can prototype just one
more iteration on what your work in and
talk to five customers of your products
try and figure out you know is this
serving a need can't people users didn't
find one internal advocate that can find
a something in your product and bring it
to other groups within your organization
so I'm we're going to ask you do you
want to get stuck in and be lost in
space right the black hole do we want to
go to the black hole no we want to find
the next great thing and that could be
as simple as Kleenex or in your case
Google search right you're looking for
that next great thing that's ubiquitous
that people say searches google right so
you can't stop there you got to keep
going so cool so one of things we wanted
to do is kind of you know break this
down that you kind of tangible better
bring giving you guys an example that's
kind of close to home with us so we
showed you you know a lot of the logos
or consulting firm you know we've done
this 13 years so we work with a lot of
companies but we're also a product
company to at least one of the things
we're coming so in some ways that kind
of experience that we've had there we
felt like you know really kind of maps a
little bit more with what you guys are
doing here so I think the key thing to
understand is you know illing in our
environment to an environment of this
team works it's very open the channels
of communication are very open we work
really hard to build a culture where
there's a lot of opportunities for some
of those
fruitful kind of crossovers like you
know the edison example a fly fishing
with some friends you know on a science
expedition suddenly becomes something
that actually becomes an innovation that
you know can be the spark to kind of
create something with the product how do
you do this where you take with the team
all of these different things you could
be doing that are scattered their
disparate they're all over the place how
do you start to get some of that stuff
to actually coalesce that's really kind
of the question we're sort of posing and
with this example as we want to kind of
you know who and you guys then on so
this is brian at his desk we can look at
it this sort of with an anthropologist i
may be and kind of note the spotty
hygiene and an atrocious diet of energy
drinks although he has his family photos
something against employees come on oh
wait that's a needy okay that's terrible
point but so for this what we're gonna
do is we're gonna share just kind of an
example walk you through just how we
approach this too and we're kind of
interested in some of how the overlap
here with how you guys do these things
and and share a little bit like what we
mean we're talking about you know the
one extra prototype of five extra custom
the one internal advocate because we've
experienced this ourselves and the idea
was with this it's an application we
book called verify we did this faster
than we had done you know any of the
ones we had actually done before and
it's because we basically took some of
our own lessons for own screw-ups to
heart and really work hard to apply them
right so we've worked at tons and tons
of things this is a great opportunity
for atakus in dance solutions we can
talk about all the pieces so we're going
to use this is a great example of
thinking about how you develop your
products though so one of the things in
developing this product is we went
straight to a market opportunity we saw
things happening in market we didn't
know all the pieces but we had a clear
vision of some opportunity in the
marketplace you know i'm not going to
speak to these delights because these
were actually slides internally so these
slides are going to see are more about
our process and the pieces here so we'll
talk through some of these but we had
some vision of what we were looking for
yeah its key thing there's this was put
up there this is part of a thing where
we were kind of in a setting kind of
like this although we had a smaller team
to get us excited and motivated moving
towards so right and as part of that
initial setup you know we used sketching
as part that to communicate ideas and we
saw a market opportunity between
something it was very market driven and
user driven and testing users there's
folks who this group's on the streamside
and user testing on on the other side we
found a sweet spot and we tried to
communicate with that within our team
and sketching is a great way to do that
one of the key parts in starting a
product for us is actually aligning
ourselves with the market it's thinking
about the user name but also thinking
about what the market is and in most
applications and the things we work on
we try to find three specific areas that
we can focus on an app to create that
connection with the customer in this
case we found three and and we were
already thinking about the internal
marketing effort here we found things
that would connect with people ready run
report or three key parts of this
application and then it connected to the
market so the next slide actually talks
about this is a very detailed picture
but we align those with black Africans
me yeah this is a frightened to you but
we just want to let you peer into some
of what the thinking here is that we've
aligned some of the functionality and
the benefits to those market needs and
as a documented as a strategy we kept it
to a single page basically when starting
this product again so yeah I was getting
so taking it back to this I think what's
interesting is looking at you know Brian
here working too it's kind of like you
know we think internally it's almost
again that myth of alone genius Brian
did hunker down like this and just crank
through slides just like we showed you
try to help codify those ideas to try to
help drive a vision and get all of us
like stoked on it right but the key
thing here too is you know it's going to
assume you look at this and I think my
first impression was looking at this is
almost like wow he was just pounding out
those slides and then dictating a vision
to it but really what was happening and
maybe this is why he wasn't taking so
much care of himself but he was
constantly on IM he was emailing he was
finding little ways to communicate with
individual team members around some of
those ideas he was engaging us in small
bits in small ways to see you know what
we thought of you know some of those
bits and pieces and it helped actually
build up that presentation so by the
time we kind of dinner all hands and
said hey here's the vision this is what
we want to do we're making a charge to
go forward with this everybody had their
hands in some piece of that it was a
slow build all along the side was a lot
of work to do that so wasn't just him
just you know idea out of the head guys
go and they were like what you know we
already had our hands in it so right
which is I think one of the key parts
here is understanding who your advocates
are who's going to actually make an idea
happen not because they have the skills
to do it because they have
desire to want to see something
successful happen I reached out to John
and he had the skills to do it he's
fronting coder could actually visualize
some of these ideas engine or her huge
nerd great Matt who is our engineer and
is focused on building great stuff got
him involved really early from the first
first week of having the concepts and
the ideas is slow slowly getting him
emerging there's no requirement as
doctors know like putting something on
his lap it was conversations that we
were having and we kept those
conversations small five minutes here
ten minutes here eventually i suckered
him into like 20 minutes I get a
conversation and we we got to the point
where we were ready to present based on
getting enough by in ahead of the
presentation the presentation wasn't
about getting buy-in we'd already done
that it was about getting the group
together to be able to see the vision
and then own it yes I mean this is the
key thing here is the team itself like
we were actually sort of presenting it
back to ourselves each of us had
opportunities so to step up and take a
piece of it and run with it it wasn't
just one person there he is again and
again just to kind of recap on that too
is it wasn't just him actually gonna
drive on this thing so right in thinking
about the product we actually focus
heavily on the marketing aspect before
even in actually doing any of the
development we're thinking holistically
about the problem we weren't trying to
build a product we were thinking about
how we market that product people so
people understand so the name was really
important we already brainstorming names
of what we wanted and we pick something
that we could stick with to push forward
in and part of that we are validating
why we had that name and how it
connected the product again sticking
with that blueprint of those three ideas
that were really important to the
overall concept and just add again here
you know we're small team but if you
look at it from business development
marketing to engineering to design
everybody already had you know had
conversations around this everybody
already had their you know certain
pieces they bought into it had a chance
to shape this and again when it comes
down to its all about eating your own
dog food and and we practice that is
that we had rules for establishing how
we were actually going to actually build
this product in the first was it had to
be used by us we're a small team we
realized we had a unique gift and
understanding problems that other people
don't and we're going to use that to
solve our own problems
so again we won't go through all this
but these are slides that were taking
directly from our presentation and again
we put timelines goals are very
important but the way we look at is a
time box we look at it from a backwards
Dayton I know sometimes with engineering
that scares everyone thinking putting a
date on the calendar but you can see
this was our plan this is a seven-point
plan updates that we had put and they
were loosely aligned two months and
weeks and we did this to keep some
flexibility in the schedule so we could
shift or we could if you want to use the
word pivot at any time that we needed to
but the goal was really to keep it open
ended it was extremely aggressive four
months to launch a product so and with
that you know the solar system starts
coming together and we're getting energy
around a single star are we lost in
space maybe not so one of the first
things we did actually get into this is
very very simple I think you can see
that already from the strategic
presentation was sketching and we don't
just mean literally picking up a napkin
and do only something on the back of it
although that is part of it we need a
mentality of sketching and what is the
mentality of sketching in the actual act
of sketching it's fundamentally it's
fast cheap disposable you can do in
great quantity you can explore multiples
very fast it's very opportunistic I
think of this sort of brainstorm rules
apply you should deferring judgment
you're trying to build off of each
other's ideas here you're not being
analytical with it you're trying to
generate a lot of things and a couple
the key benefits of this too or you're
not going to bruise anybody's ego of
their grand grand idea or something that
they've over-invested in we have encoded
anything yet this is something on the
back of the mac then it's meant to
engage other people in conversation
that's how we got started right away and
another key thing is this you know
sketching is fundamentally social it
invites you to converse about it when
you put a sketch in front of somebody
versus a coded semi functional prototype
those make very different statements
about what you want back from that
person a sketch doesn't mean you've
committed too much to sketch means we
can put these up on the board quite a
bit have critiques daily little 5-10
minutes sign line conversation here
they're over something that's tangible
and shared and not abstract and this is
really really fundamental to how we'd
approach this John in this case took the
leads to you know in this case deadlines
weren't reward enough so he gave himself
a donut literally he set out a don't
for himself and he's like I'm going to
get through all of these in this one
sitting and then I will eat that
doughnut so what a motivational
technique that work for him these are
actually the sketches of the sum of the
first sketches and these aren't all the
very very first sketches with some of
the early ones of the application and
I'll just walk through these really
quickly to give you a flavor for what we
did and just kind of how much stuff we
kind of move through this was an example
the pricing page and see we're already
thinking through how are we going to
convert people what are some of the
triggers and what are our price points
for this particular product when we
actually get it out there how are people
going to move from you know basic and
free or from free to you know plus or
premium this case how are they actually
going to move that we're looking at work
flow fundamental to this particular
product was just the idea that were
these modules would be several different
kinds of tests what would those be we
talked it out loud and literally this is
just a conversation and body here i
think we have nine tests and you can see
we're doodling in the middle they have
little icons for those would be visual
indicators to remember hints it what the
UI might be or maybe not we're not over
committed ones at the bottom Madlib and
card sort we never even got to maybe we
will I don't know we having to be
knocking down our door for those yet I
think we built a couple others instead
from what we learned along the way
workflows not sitemaps we're not worried
about architecture here yet we're
worried about how people move through
the application and what kinds of pages
and systems and states do we need to
actually accomplish to get there so we
sketched some of that stuff out too
there's just an example the test screen
again look how rod is there's very
limited detail sparing use of I mean in
this case no color gestural this is
probably the fifth sketch in a sequence
of several that happened on board very
very quickly this is an example of
something where we knew we needed to pay
shade thanks again you've taken a test
somebody's going to do this it's going
to come to the end what are they going
to do we might actually be able to catch
somebody here and get them to actually
fill in some demographic info that
actually was a small insight that came a
big big opportunity for us this is an
example imagining Brian's login account
here probably like what the sixth
seventh it erases a single idea what do
you do when you just log in and here's
all your tests working through what
information needs to be there on the
side what needs to you know what how do
we filter it one thing I'll just note to
as you notice like not all of this was
necessarily written in the same persons
hand selecting and creating a test you
can see remember from that sketch before
we had the lists where we had these
rough icons now those are starting to
kind of work their way into the
interface ideas are kind of you know
starting to build on each other example
of a multi-step flow we knew we needed a
guided way two people to do it so I mean
you see there's kind of this thermometer
at the top and kind of a 12 we were
thinking how do we structure this so
people understand we're making them do a
lot to get something that's very simple
and small into the system how do we just
guide them through that really really
easily here's another step I mean some
of these things looking back kind of
look a little scary to me because my vow
we ever complicated that but we didn't
sweated to that point it had enough of
the detail to kind of you know express
what we knew we needed and again just
sequence of screens and here you can see
this sketch actually came after the
other one as a recall and the idea of
collecting demographics turned out to be
you know we thought might be important
it was a hunch at this point turn now
has been validated since and you see
that thanks Paige the idea would be you
know somebody would check that box and
then they could pick what would have it
from people to take my tests what kind
of info what I'd like to know from their
twitter handle their age gender that
kind of stuff could be pretty important
to people actually looking through the
data they'd be receiving with this
particular app and again its social we
kept going through this again and again
that was just a small set of all the
sketches and we kept hammering this
stuff out on the board and it was the
goal was originally about a week I think
it's just about a week and a half
because we as we got deeper in do it
some problems opened up and you know
what you just got to adjust you got to
be willing to change you know and now
all those presentations were in small
groups as well so it wasn't the entire
team that was on it he was taking one
person here one prime there one person
here and then sometimes two people if
there had to be some over level details
that's the thing is we're not leaving
all of the details now for the end and
you can see as you kind of start to work
through it you know some of the
schedules were really really raw super
loose of squiggle and someone were
actually very concrete because we
started to realize this needs more
definition before we move on hammering
through those things again this is one
that popped up people needed I think is
just from talking to people we had folks
around in the office grab them what do
you know you get this concept what would
you need public versus private turned
out to be really important we had
thought of that initially captured it as
a sketch time limit the idea will his
tests going to go on forever and we
didn't think of that initially was they
oh wow okay we started hearing questions
from people inviting other people in
getting that feedback at the level of
the sketch we're able to turn on a dime
and actually you know a dot you know
adjust to that the report how would it
this page went through I don't know how
many different
we had no idea what this needed to quite
look like at first we did quite a bit of
research but again it was very iterative
of the sketching to kind of get the
point where we actually had something
viable and thought to refer instance the
functions and actions that were in it
all right so if you start looking at it
this perspective you know we're a week
and a half into this app and sometimes
is going to be much more complex but you
know and in the terms of getting to what
would be considered a a partial Death
Star we've been putting the pieces
together and there's a lot of rawness
there it still wasn't complete and you
can see ya the ideas are swirling around
this bright idea of a sensing a little
bit what and part of that is you know
and getting to something that's real we
go right into code we try to get as fast
as we can into code to start testing
those ideas out and the goal is to do
that in one week or so or so yeah always
an ongoing thing so again staying to
those three proof points are those ideas
around what the app was we we were still
focused on we're using those as a
guiding to to keep the team aligned with
the ideas and then move into the
front-end code ready run reports so we
use those as a guidance and you also
need an intern to help get your ideas
done so we we got an intern no stay if
he professed yeah Dave actually started
in turn and now works for us but John
drove this vision and took build
sketches into a a front-end coded
prototype based on the collaboration
back and forth so he was a equal
participant in the sketching and
evaluating those ideas before going into
the front-end component of the design
matt the whole way our developer was
through the ideas through the sketching
didn't touch any code didn't look at it
didn't start anything up was was
participating at the idea level to get a
better understanding of how this was
going to unfold before committing to
setting up his file structures and stuff
again the team still a little bit lost
into space but at this point things are
starting to come together right there
we've now formed the band and we're
creating some good music together and
this is a pivotal point in trading right
I'm sorry it was music it was music up a
sec so it you know at this point we've
got some great momentum and it's a
critical part of actually visualizing
the idea of what your product is
star boom things are happening fusion so
in this process you can see that ready
run report which is a marketing concept
actually started fueling our prototype
development so all of these were static
HTML pages that we're creating and we
started building them out in a structure
that allowed us to see what what we
needed to be building again ready run
report went through and prototyped all
these pages again no code is compared no
code has been done on the back end of
this this application yet which takes us
to those original sketches so you saw in
in those HTML prototype pages that
things were actually looking real they
were starting to actually look like a
product so if you take that this is the
first example of an HTML prototype not
everything is great but from the initial
sketch to this you can see there's a lot
of mapping of the ideas and and you
start to understand spatial
relationships because with a sketch
there's not a whole lot of room for
getting to those details once you get to
the actual code you start seeing how
things balance out again here's one
component of that which we saw earlier
setting up a test so an able to set up a
test we had a quick sketch here and then
here's the first prototype again we kept
those icons really loose they were
sketches you know even a code GREEN
underlying we weren't worried about all
the aesthetics at this point you know we
had random colors in there wasn't clear
that we had a consistent style guide but
he got his going I wouldn't say we
weren't worried we got into arguments
totally at this phase but we didn't get
stuck on them we're like okay we got to
come back to that and so there's another
one again quick quick sketch here's how
it turned out as first prototype page
again you've got a lot of those same
elements there and you start to see the
balance of page do people understand
what's going on again still a prototype
prep page turns into the same page we've
got an upgrade path we're trying to
collect money you can see how it
translates into an actual HTML prototype
and we'll address these pages later in
the talk so now we've got serious things
happening clouds are forming around
their stuff so yeah so we had the
front-end done enough it was enough to
start building so we entered into a
rapid development base so we grabbed
Matt he got his hammer and got crackin
is really focused this is a lot of time
for him now because we would removed so
many unknowns for him to hunker down and
focus and just get stuff done we didn't
get in his way he did the key thing here
too is he didn't have a ton of questions
luisi and he already had participated up
to this point it wasn't dumped in his
lap he always a part of the process the
whole way he was driving decisions we
had a team around him to support him
then this guy showed up this Dimitri is
right over here he's our lead marketer
he talks to a lot of people it turns out
and found an opportunity to speak in at
demo in palm springs in front of a lot
of people relatively soon so we go for
it we had a date now so we had before
remember loose timeline now we had
something as a team the rally around and
drive towards and you know it's always
that struggle when you're in that
product you know what you find that kind
of point where you're just like things
are moving but a moment I don't know
that we come back from the weekend it's
tuesday already and you're just like
what's going on over there like his
motivation up so this helped kind of
create a little bit of a shock wave kind
of press on through with the development
so he really got cracking then there was
some unrest from the design team but he
kept his cool and we finally had
something we had a little something that
started to stand on its own and we took
that with us to demo so we built that
that first functional build in time for
demo had it ready put in front of an
audience and you know admittedly it was
kind of skeptical what's my recognizes
but the you know people are a little in
the other dawn their blackberries and
not that impressed the kind of doodling
you know do we have their attention we
had initially there was a floor time
talk but there was also a 90-second just
power through demo here so what you can
see is Dimitri and Brian and got up
there with the countdown really quickly
and did this sort of sketch narrative
that was actually relatively easy to do
because it was sprung from all the ready
run report kind of ideas we'd already
talked about we'd already worked over as
a team why this was important to people
we already had people validating it at
the sketch level so we knew what
probably would resonate and I remembered
to make sure your head they're just like
beads of sweat off your head too because
I thought it was this great idea to do
this like Bob Dylan style hold these
sketches up and then drop one at a time
at Qs and you holding 40 sketches loose
he was just like you know doing that but
he did a good job you didn't he dropped
him all in time so and the idea was we
took something that was like that
and with a little bit of help from Matt
to before we go going you don't want to
click there and show that during demo
type stuff we sold it like this there
was it was big and we wanted to get
people really excited sales was a big
big part of it okay you know people
there were some excitement there was
some genuine excitement but you know
again this is the first touch point with
some of these folks we had you know some
resonance with the people who were there
from that we have appt a lot of signups
for private beta generated some
excitement we had a bit of a customer
base already brewing there's already
people to talk to we're out there in the
world who potentially want this stuff so
what do we do next so let's be where
that is the lollipop of mediocrity you
look at once and you suck forever so at
this point details right details details
details and none of them are small we
got to work this thing over the stuffs
not good enough so this is an iterative
prototyping phase and again there's not
like the big strategic questions the big
questions are kind of already off the
table we already know some of this stuff
works but we're getting an idea for what
doesn't work so we're gonna simulate it
and really work on the performance
aspects of it right so you can take us
back to these original sketches if you
look at this here's an example of the
test here's an example that first
prototype phase that we had and then we
learned oh let's let's try and gloss it
up and we we put this out in front of
customers and you know the icons kind of
dressed it up with them we decided well
you know it wasn't actually working we
had cleaned up some of the text and then
we realized that a list format was
actually working better for people they
could identify with it and read through
it also gave us an opportunity
opportunity to upsell link tests which
are a way to drive higher paying account
so we simplified the screens went back
to some of our initial prototype ideas
again a living page we still didn't buy
into the initial concept we kept
challenging what it was again here's
another example the mood test you sell
this page where we went to a prototype
phase and this is actually closer to
what we have today where we've actually
refined some of those ideas we got rid
of the 123 felt that it didn't actually
help encourage people get through this
process we had little green ticks to
help people understand those might be
important and we created a linear flow
that that drove people down the page if
you recall the prototype page we had
before the instructions were on the left
the left side
we've made it a linear process again
we've kept some of those initial ideas
with the sketching in there and it is
this kind of mission you think that the
argument for this the original idea was
we gotta have the buttons up before the
form cannot appear long design is it
can't appear long nobody want to do this
well they couldn't associate the
extractions with the form they're
actually just going down one column as
opposed to the others and people are
actually missing key details the label
sad so we learned this from getting this
out in front of folks this had a nice
zigzag down it one two three tasks we
need you need to say one two three to do
it and there's the report right here's a
report page or they sketch here's a more
refined view of what we had put together
again we actually started using this and
putting this out in front of customers
here's an example where you just asked
you know how do you tell time you know
we had two visuals of the watch and a
phone eighty percent use the phone we've
got some great information about the
actual reporting feature to pull back
into the prototyping phase and you get
quick input within a day and for our
standpoint here it's using the tool and
it was just asking this case an
interesting question this is an example
where we had this is actually that
dashboard you remember the original
sketch to it listed out we found a nice
way to kind of condensed it and it's
just a show again we were using this we
had it functional allowed to so we were
trying to actually ask interesting
questions to you know kick the tires on
this then see you does this thing
actually work does it have legs how do
we push ourselves here this is an
example another one of the tests you
there was a click test where we were
defined and remember some before there
was some scattered list below kind of an
image this week actually find the
technology for aggregating common terms
to tell what's the pattern apparently in
this page they remember design a lot
gerbils I don't remember with this page
early i don't know maybe those
successful the point was we hack some of
the technology components together as
fast as we could to sell the vision
piece to our customers in an active way
and then started iterating back on how
things were actually built on the back
end this is an interesting one to this
is you know we talked about those icons
before we decided this is a question
that came up do people want refined
icons do they want visuals for these
things but they actually like the sketch
and you know argument and suz let's just
put this out there we got 183 responses
relatively fast and had some pretty good
indication for you know what our
audience was actually interested in you
know again we might do that again and
tested again right so again this is
pulling this stuff back together it's
keeping the team together keeping
everyone focus and making sure that
there's collaboration happening and at
that point it's easy to say off someone
else's handling sales or someone else's
handling marketing or someone else is
doing them back in but you've got to
keep vigilant you keep focused on the
initial prototype what are you actually
trying to build again it's going to that
that dog food analogies you got to eat
it you got to keep focused on what the
initial goals were and not lose sight of
the fact that you need to use that app
and keep working on it with your team so
we launched the private beta first day
we launched it actually with the payment
system we got a customer so we actually
had validation and we could work with
that person to figure out what we need
to be building celebration so from from
that time on it would be easy again to
fall on to that oh we built a product
that people want but that's not the case
yeah it was almost a case but you know
if you're not done yet like I'm saying
so you know we learned two things
relatively quickly and this is
specifically application but we're just
sharing with you kind of how this
process kind of goes the tests weren't
that easy to take or as easy as they
should be and people weren't upgrading
we thought we had this great kind of
upgrade path of some of the demography
just wasn't happening we wanted
conversion wasn't wasn't there so why
was that and again you can see from
someone scheduled for we had we really
focused on some the mechanics of the
person setting up a test which kind of
meant we didn't spend as much time with
the people taking tests and there were
way more of those so we went back to the
team and started working those over John
took the lead again he was driving a lot
of this individually throughout and what
we came up with were some pretty Weber
interactions see if this guy there you
go this now shows the state of the test
where you click it it quickly moves out
of the way in this case there were
labeled tests people didn't know how to
fill in the labels you see those little
blinking pieces there those indicators
and the way they moved in people now
recognized and just intuitively
understand what to do you're filling in
labels to describe things based on the
question you just saw this wasn't
happening before this was a response
with several iterations at the
implementation level to solve that
specific problem people started taking
these tests for and you can see this is
the report where you know now we've
actually got data aggregated based on
that you can actually go in and now see
the the raw data of individual test
takers too and tell what they actually
did so that took form in a way that just
wasn't there
or doing the label tests there's another
one a click test and you see the
refinery I click it slides out of the
way which is a cue that the instructions
are at the top now we used to show the
instructions super-big do the cliq
performant collect demographics and
you're done and this is a key thing
right here to is how do you get people
to take more tests it's expensive to get
one visitor to come in but what can you
do while they're still there people do
like we get you know emails all the time
people do 30 or 40 these things is just
addictive you just kind of go through
and they're all so fast now that we
actually end up piling up quite a bit of
data that wasn't happening before so
this little thanks screen turned out to
be really really important people didn't
understand how to do what we had was
called the annotate test so you're going
to click and drag we did this instead we
did this little animation while people
were waiting just to stop them and kind
of give them a visual cue and a sort of
a function q4 how those going to works
when they click to take the test ah now
I get it I leave a note like that this
is stuff that just wasn't working I
wasn't performing as well so again by
kind of opening up the customers and
looking at those problems we asked more
questions what why isn't it working and
the refinement on it I mean I I was
pretty happy with this is pretty cool I
can't be that came together again and
that's still sticking with that original
goal in thinking about that original
timeline we never like lost sight of the
fact that we were trying to find boxes
everywhere trying to go and build
something it was great and we limited
ourselves based on some time yeah and
you know honest admission we didn't hit
all this these time frames as it was
like I mean first was like a week and a
half maybe a couple weeks to get through
the second one all told what Brian it
was like six to eight months I think
right 16 months to actually launch the
product but if you look at the timeline
and the things we did I think the time
was well spent it wasn't the only thing
we're working on so right pat pat so we
go back to that idea again at Brian you
know the idea this idea that he could
have just put out there as a strategy
said guys we are doing this rally call
big mission all hands just like this
let's go do it and think back and
retrace the steps of you know how that's
not the way this unfolded all those
little steps along the way from
communicating getting buy-in to
construct the strategy and the details
of it through the sketching which again
was very social through the front-end
code which set up the development to
just execute at a high level gathering
customer feedback at each point the the
key demo experience
we had a rally call to like really push
together and band together as a team all
those things created this like team wine
momentum for it so everybody was really
excited and those that motivation that
we kind of tapped into was what helped
really move this forward so it was a
very very social thing that really led
us up to you know the launch of the
product and we were pretty happy with it
so so so here's some more examples gym
you go over and some other products I
think he can identify with yes I mean
the idea here is just that excuse me
that in addition to that one that was
kind of an in-depth example kind of and
and if something we just we've been
consumed with because we're working on
that really really recently but we look
at this you know this isn't obviously
you know just us and I know a lot of
folks here to know there's a really
really rich history some of this so we
just wanted to share some of our
inspirations to kind of show you know
sort of where our thinking is with this
these are a lot of fathers modern
industrial design you've got loi Teague
Van Doren and Dreyfus I think there and
I don't know if you know this guy too
but I'm sure some of you guys do is you
know Henry Dreyfuss and you know what is
he responsible for train icon of you
know what a train is streamline era this
scary contraption which was a lot
scarier before if you think of some of
the metal implements that Dennis used to
use still looks pretty darn close to
what my dentist actually has today the
telephone which was an icon actually
became what the telephone was is the I
Love Lucy telephone Western Electric I
still want one of these things to I'm
gonna see if I can hook up google voice
too and I got this whole idea or I want
to do with only things I think it'd be
cool wasn't I kind of telephones until
you guys and some other folks kind of
knock it off with so relatively recently
and he wrote the book on this stuff
designing for people this is actually a
big part of our heritage too because
interesting point here is you know we
said designed for people this became
kind of our mantra I'm not even quite
fully realizing we went back that we
were quoting his book from the 50s this
is the birth of ergonomics looking at
when you're designing products how does
the human body actually interact with
what's there I think now we're very much
more you know thinking of how does the
human mind interact with it how do
people socially interact with these
things who sort of indeed up the problem
and this is a viet kind of blurry
looking sketch but this is the page from
that book
what's interesting about this is the
example of a process of building the
Hoover vacuum cleaner which again is a
famous icon of industrial design what's
interesting here is again how social is
and how similar this is to what we've
been doing right from the get-go you can
see I mean right in the top corner very
similar to kind of the Brian scene with
fewer energy drinks everybody around a
table all sorts of debt that's kind of a
key point from you know in this case it
might be their clients about all sorts
of different folks going immediately
into kind of a sketching your
prototyping phase you can see these
things kind of unfold and realize how
they're working over and building on top
of the ideas together I know this is
kind of a cool picture to as this is
Dreyfuss with the president of bowel how
did it get to that telephone this is
pretty cool I mean they have a wall full
of these these prototype you look at how
many different experiments they did
together and think of just that wasn't
just them gone not quite good enough
let's just try again they were
constantly getting feedback from people
having them like testing it picking up
you know wooden and clay model
prototypes and doing this kind of thing
to arrive at you know better answers
they're putting them in different
contexts just like the wood block
Hawkins at Palm right there like let's
test this thing out let's see how this
thing's going to work you know this is
enlightened trial and error this isn't
the lone genius this is a team working
together go back at the same time you
look at some of the competition so Henry
Ford autumn I mean this is the explosion
of automobiles right it was kinda like
the lasalle like up till then it was
those the model a Model T you know they
they came a little Sal explosion in
automobiles the first time design and
engineering were really applied towards
these kinds of problems get Henry Ford
saying things like you can have it any
color as long as I color is black well
you know well Sal came along to this is
a Kodak and this is Teague in this case
to you look what they were able to do
how do we how do we re energize a
product in this case do we have
something established this look familiar
to anybody to from a little move it was
back in the 30s you know that another
company is actually employed just
copying what was done before you know
borrowing on the history and their
lineage to you know innovate on
something they had and there's this last
example to the thought was pretty cool
was you know so this is the sort of
top-down measuring come the cool thing
about this is there was nobody had a
problem with a measuring cup this wasn't
a problem right I mean I
a ton of these things that keep
collecting them for some reason and they
figured out that there was an
opportunity here through directly
observing people what they noticed with
this particular example is what do you
do when you got a measuring cup and you
point it from the counter look at it
like that right like well let's wait why
do you have to do that way nobody in
those observations said we've got a I
really wish I didn't have to bend over
do that it's just accepted that that was
the way it would be done they came up
with this innovation where based on that
little slice there with measure if you
just look down from the top like you'd
naturally beasts and standing you can
actually read it this is alex lee he
actually gave a cool talk at gel the gel
conference recently were actually goes
over some of this and and the thing i
just kind of leave you with is it's
really important to look back at some of
these kinds of historical examples
because when you see those insights
whole their wealth of ideas about how
you can build better product actually
emerge and just this last letter that
was kind of interesting because I sort
of went looking for photos in true
there's actually not a lot of great
photos of this measuring cup out there
the ones with olive oil and it actually
look kind of gross on the screen right
now but there's no keyboard I need us
right it's just the product it's just
the finish form but what's interesting
is they got to that through all of that
observation in all of that iteration to
try to arrive at a solution that was
actually know that much better so cool
we good at how we on time wait yeah I
think can we answer some questions and
people yeah cool did you want to do your
do the thing cool
so people on vc we won't be able to see
you for a couple minutes because the
dual screen is booting up but so also if
anyone wants to ask questions in this
room if you'd be so kind as to come up
and speak at the mic so that we see
people can hear you I brought a t-shirt
to the person that asked toughest
question go for it ok so you guys are
out creating awesome products
huh
mm-hmm
okay so the question is repeat is with
verify appeared that we were also the
customer of our product and we're
developing this probably for ourselves
but other people and you recognize if
Google that sometimes you run into
interference with the same thing as
people are building products for
themselves and may not see the target
audience holy blank spot right right I
think the key part there and looking at
how we developed is is we are obsessed
with the customers themselves we were
actually looking at it once we got that
first prototype that we felt embodied
the idea we started talking to people
and getting into people's spaces and
demoing it I think once we had a demo we
showed up at ten customers places and
told him to pull it up and started
asking questions and getting a light
feedback just talking about the concept
and seeing them use the actual product
so we got into the customers spaces that
that would be using this particular item
and learn from now we could we could be
blindsided by that but I think as long
as you understand and identify who those
customers are and start talking and
having those conversations they're going
to give you real advice or at least
you're going to observe some things that
maybe you didn't see before
right so your question is is are we
continuing to evolve that product or are
we just building another product to
figure out what the right answer is
right so Zerbe been verified verify our
second app the first one we keep you
here for two hours talking about our
first app but it's their most successful
so far is notable we're actually in that
same process you saw we had three apps
currently being developed in the same
fashion we're supporting him iterating
them in fact notable we've gone back and
done a full another redesign as a bigger
push based on customer data over a year
so that whole process of that initial
iteration is actually happening long
after the product has been in the
marketplace and we've learned something
so verify was very early on and we're
learning from that process to start new
products so as far as what you see there
you're seeing a product platform emerged
to help people designed for people
basically to build products
well right yeah I mean so that means a
good question because it's something
we've really kind of honed and keep kind
of configuring and changing and you know
as the team kind of grows its it's
always a little bit in flux so every
like six or twelve months it almost
seems like there's almost this this need
you can tell the teams are tipping in
another way and we've got to kind of
change it up on the thing from the
consulting side what we found we've
gotten a really good group with is it's
kind of interesting it's someone know
anybody who's kind of weird enough to do
it do it like we have a lead who is
basically responsible for the client
project and one other designers
sometimes another one but basically a 12
because with any sort of consulting
project and that's really key the key
thing is for every designer they're
basically they're there with the
opportunity to be groomed to be a lead
so when it comes to for instance email
communication with the client every
designers actually putting that it's not
like upwards done design Lee you you
forgot how to present it to them they're
actually presenting it to them they're
actually at the end of each email to
Wales make sure there's a timeline
rolling five days here's what here's
what you guys should expect next don't
freak out we know where we're going in
the short term we also know you know
what the long term is we're not going to
worry about that week by week you know
so they do that and they have that
opportunity to think that through and
think through the business side think
through the user side and grow into that
role so the consulting that's really
really worked I can tell you now though
the shift has been from the consulting
size that we're kind of getting in a
little bit more sort of small kind of
sideline brainstorm specialized kind of
contributions I like literally somebody
over here something that's going on it's
like oh that's good you need some help
with that you know and we meet up at
this big table every morning it's kind
of ridiculous giant red file cabinet
thing and we passed around that the
plush Steve Jobs doll and everybody it's
a scrum you know we're just kind of a
meeting that's where those opportunity
to start but then it kind of carries out
throughout the day with the product
we're kind of in I'd say we're kind of
mimicking the same thing everybody has
had an opportunity you know that vision
of just verify was actually a bunch of
stuff like guys here's here's like that
list of tests for verify we have a list
of different apps we think could all
interplay together they're all fairly
small everybody the opportunity to
potentially step up and do it actually
everyone in the organization is working
on so their component just develop of
Australia that's right and we do a lot
of 12 page app type things as well
because we're constantly experimenting
but everyone plays some component of
those programs so the question is how do
you scale it to a hundred people and I
think the answer is you don't right so
you need to figure out how you get trust
built with smaller teams that then
influence the larger team so keep
staying staying small influencing the
larger groups and continue to expand out
so I would say it's where to use that
process for what group at what time and
how do you expand it so our talk may not
have addressed the how do you expand it
to the larger 100 group but I still
think you need a smaller team of people
that are really rallying behind an idea
before you can kind of invest a hundred
people into the concept tell me the
contrary in here I think you actually
can we haven't figured this out yet
totally i guess i'd say so we showed the
picture that all the baby straight
startups we've worked with a lot of
companies out of like I need zazzle and
I was like nine guys it was in the
garage they were cranking away doing
this stuff you know into an organization
there to kind of grow and like our
success with them kind of reaches point2
or you know they're cranking you know
they got John door they got already
backing them and they're cranking away
and a certain point like where we fit in
at 250 300 people you know kind of you
know awkward teen fit doesn't really
really line up but I think you can do
this to the level of kind of small teams
you know we were for 13 13 and a half of
them yeah I think you can scale up to
around 30 to 40 somewhere in there and
then there's something else that has to
shift to get up to probably a team about
the size of 100 150 I honestly don't
know know that I can't answer well for
good figure it out someday up to
mm-hmm
right yeah it yeah no I mean it's
interesting because I think so just the
question again is customers all have
different requirements and are looking
you as a product designer or someone
working on the product is trying to
rationalize the difference between
everyone's requirements to something
that turns into a product or they don't
even know ready all right yes sir the
don't even know part I guess that that's
where it really kind of comes down to
body language reading people I can tell
you this one we do with our team a lot
now to as we bring in more direct
observation and even remote testing some
time and I find this too is like
sometimes we're doing this when you're
not experienced doing this there's a
tendency to miss the the frustration man
they just click over here they keep
moving on whoa what is that if you can
catch that those kinds of moments and
learn to watch and see them ask and kind
of unfurl like what just went on there
you can you can find you can actually
unravel a lot this whole wellspring of
assumptions that they're bringing in I
can tell you what they need to hide
behind the bushes right you need an
observer at some point and not asking
for the answers but putting things in
front of people and observing them
interact with it in finding with those
sparks are right yeah i mean i think
that's that's definitely part of an i
think i'm trying to think the other part
of this too is yet just how you set up
the the context of what you're asking
from the customer is really really
important now you can tell you i found
myself in the middle of user test to
it's like type you just if you're doing
a lot of these things or something you
can get to the sixth straight you want
or something and then you forget to just
do the just welcomed the person in or
they doing set the context and then
you've got you know 30 minutes of just
crap it's like always screwed them up
like they did and they can't give you
much because they don't understand sort
of what you're hoping to get from them
part of it has to be kind of natural
setting up the context is really
important starts with an email starts
would I don't look at other strategies
don't bite off too much stay focused on
a few key IDs ideas and that gives you
insight into the bigger picture so don't
confuse them upfront with too many
requirements
right right so performance when do you
start thinking about performance in the
case of our products our products feel
somewhat of a niche and we have
performance issues that arise and we
address those as we're building our
audience obviously with a google type
audience where you put something out as
a linky you have instant problems of
making something function if you haven't
addressed some of the performance issues
I think if you look at the growth chart
of all the apps that we work with
there's typically a growth chart that
looks like it's building and you start
to understand where there's going to be
performance problems the part that we
were talking about in that presentation
is really identifying in building
something for that customer data at that
point you know in a large organization
it's really about trying to figure out
if you have something there do you
double down and scale it and figure out
what the technical ones it might even
mean rebuilding the back end components
of whatever you've built but we still
look at that initial engineering effort
is a prototype effort in our case we
might have more of a grace period to
build into something as opposed to
sitting a link up now a million people
hitting it like instantly and one thing
I just add to that too is if you think
about it again you go back to that early
investment just from the early ideas
meling Matt are the engineer in this
case too is opportunity to call
shenanigans on a lot of stupid ideas
they're likely that's just how you guys
are fighting off so much there we're
gonna that's going to be so costly why
would we ever get ourselves into that
will sink the ship before it ever really
gets off the ground with customers so
he's already you know early on kind of
helping steer the course a little bit on
some of those pieces and then once it's
live once things start actually kind of
growing part of its kind of reactive but
kind of because you're invested all the
way through out some really interesting
things happen little bits and pieces
that are sort of what anticipatory
actually just got baked in with that
last release you know you didn't really
intend to do that but he's thinking of
it and I'll put a little extra here and
it that helped just kind of lay some
track in front of the Train right and
then on top of that you know just like
we showed you what kind of went back to
the ready run report you have to have
the discipline as a team to kind of a
visit regularly just got check wait are
we going where we want to go so I'll
standpoint
every you know two or three months four
months something like that depending on
how things are tracking you you might
have to sit down be okay what are we
seeing here like let's get do we how
much do we need to get out in front of
this and just call it out you have to
have that open communication to do it
and recognize yet this something the
business wants to support what's mean
let's get behind it and push that
forward so the idea though is disposable
code but we're not marrying ourselves to
that good so basically your question is
how do you get consensus around a
product so I'll just step in as a
visionary and wanting to create awesome
stuff I have a lot of crazy ideas at a
certain point you have to let go of
those ideas you have to entrust your
team to take those ideas and run with
them and you guide them and you give
them feedback in here participating in
the back-and-forth dialogue but you got
to let people on it you got to let them
find opportunities to take that that
product and run with it so even you know
the best product managers going to stand
it's not about them it's about their
team and guiding something so you know I
guess the question is can you go into
product development knowing that you're
kind of create something awesome at the
end for a group of people to use and
know that it's not all about you you're
gonna have to let go of stuff and
honestly it's kind of where I mean
that's the interesting thing you know
verify just a specific example was sort
of an example letting go should you like
the smiley face things there was also
everybody deserves the it was the tag
cloud debate pick on suck no they're
actually really good you're shocked
nobody is just whatever so challenges is
like I'm testing you put it out there
key inside here that was just verified
but it's like don't get stuck with that
if it's really important you know get
some outside ppac do a gut check because
and that's a that's always a really
powerful I'm kind of going back to some
of your test how do you get good input
from customers to those are the perfect
times to do it because it kind of brings
everybody background and make sure that
everybody's thinking of them not just
their own personal interest or I love
tag clouds I
tech clouds another point to that is the
more you've worked with your team in the
more you build that trust and respect
then you naturally just assume that
people are making good decisions for the
product and and you have to be able to
fail you got to let people fail and try
things out and then recover so it's not
about trying to get it perfect it's
about trying to get it mostly right now
adapt as you see the answers and I mean
it's a tough thing to do too i can say
we had there was i saw using example as
you know is that this one kind of little
services update we did with the team and
I was dragging my feet doing this too
and Brian was kind of getting on the
case to do this and I sent it out and it
was just just long-winded email to the
team and it was like uh you know I but I
get it's got to be done at least I did
it I got it out and he shot back shed
back feed back like hey cool for things
wrong with it too and I was just like
okay dude so just let's step back from
this anything here to build on something
right it was like oh yeah actually
here's one to like here something to
actually build on with it so that
exchange and that open exchange is
feedback over it was just an email but
if something communicated to the team is
kind of thing you got to scrutinize it's
it's the lollipop of mediocrity don't
want to do that you want to make sure
that every exchange you're having is
meaningful and you guys are you know
available to actually sort of talk those
things out and establish like what's our
what's our method of communication or
what's the ground rules and and that's
that's kind of a key insight there's an
element of you know kind of praise miss
with mixed with pratik thats you know
really builds trust over time because
you know you're challenging people to do
it and you're on their side so
alright so let me get the question it
the first question is how do you get you
know by in on those sketches where
there's lots of iteration and having
other team members multiple ideas well
multiply right how do you share multiple
ideas okay so the questions are really
in the sketch you don't know the answer
you're throwing something out there to
your team and how do you deal with that
and the second is is actually when
you're getting that initial feedback
from customers or usability team that's
done some stuff how does that get baked
back into your process into the process
how do you share it with people okay so
jeremy has some ideas on this I'll
answer a few you don't just share with
people and set it up to a hundred people
on your list of people working on the
product so that's that's one key part of
this even at the sketch level sideline
conversations partial sketches bring
someone over ask a couple ideas you know
even if you think you're asking them a
question really all you're doing is
setting them up for something later on
down the road and getting some buy-in
you're getting a few ideas and it takes
a minute maybe two minutes just to say
hey what do you think of this what do
you think is good and oftentimes you'll
find that that idea that you wanted to
protect so much that person isn't
doesn't care they don't have and they
might say yeah that sounds great and you
build that consensus through one-off
conversations to off conversations when
you come together as a group now you've
sold the idea it's not about it
consensus that point you already know
you have everyone on board with those
ideas so it's picking your battles at
that point in knowing you've already
sold some of them on the usability side
that's tough because it's still very new
it's like how do you take that data and
you know make a model for it to actually
apply it back to your product I would
say that's where having a strong team
lead or a visionary starts to help with
that because someone with experience can
then translate that back into a product
but again it's one of those things where
you have to listen to team members
because they might have insights that
they've seen building the product that
might you know address some of those
issues if it's a performance issue you
know the engineer might actually see
something in the UI that could be
addressed that would make the experience
better because the page was loading two
seconds
right or it might be a UI element like
we did with verify we sell those slides
coming in in it in and out tester might
be enjoying that process more that's an
HTML thing of simplifying the process of
going through a test that's an
engagement customer happy kind of thing
not necessarily something that looks you
can look at the analytics so I think you
have to address those and figure out
team members that have insights that can
bring something the table on those
analytics and the usability stuff and
address them in ways a good product
person it kept this continue to do this
will know how to reach out to their team
to figure out who on the team knows
something about this problem yeah I mean
the thing I'd add to to those are the
from the usability standpoint just
asking good meaningful questions and I'd
say Matt here's is awesome at this again
x is like a couple questions we want to
collect some data we want to collect a
bunch of day why do you want to know
that what are we looking for like that's
that's fundamental you get that out of
the way and you got something because
you know what are we projected what do
we think the problem might be and where
we're going it's such an easy thing to
miss and on the other point like you're
saying how do you even get that going
kind of building off what Brian said I'd
say the if you break the problem down
make it smaller the antithesis I'd say
is like madmen I'm a huge fan of Mad Men
part leagues I love that agency you know
advertising kind of feel where they do
the thing that just terrifies me which
is they bring the client in and they've
got the little it's turned around it
doesn't have a low current and there's
like tada we just spent all of your
money doing this hope you like it right
terrible but that's the way we
communicate with a lot of our team
members like he's saying you gotta you
got to break it down you got to build
somebody up and and be open to that and
open to helping them you know having
somebody else on your team actually
steer the way to that so there aren't so
many surprises and you know kind of big
ideas there and I think the key thing
the key standpoint there's I think
design awareness and literacy or all of
our responsibility it's not a designer
shouldn't be like you like UX designer
it's so say it's still not it's not know
if I refute it's like it's it's a it's a
it's an organization-wide mentality
it'sit's cross-disciplinary it's
fundamentally has to be and on the flip
side from a designer's responsibility we
had to be more technically aware to we
got to know what we're asking we're
gonna be pretty savvy about that stuff
that's how you actually create crossover
right some or say advocating sketching
and things to it was looking to Steven
Spielberg the other day too I mean how
he did it he's
can't draw he said I can get some stuff
just really down on the page enough to
kind of get an idea across there's
chicken scratch right it wasn't great
but he did fabulous movies communicate
his vision doing that even though that
wasn't his expertise right so on both
sides of it there has to be more
crossover more awareness literacy and
then you know expertise from each corner
so there's more lab right now this isn't
still enough overlap out there so looks
like a reading yeah I know I like to
thank Ryan and germ phobic coming to
present thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
