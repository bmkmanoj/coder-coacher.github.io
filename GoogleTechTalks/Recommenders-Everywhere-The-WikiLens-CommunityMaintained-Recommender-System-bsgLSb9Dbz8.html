google groups and I did this work at
group lens research at the University of
Minnesota with tony lam chi lotsa and
Max Harper Scott yellick Mike Cassano
and John Riedl a cast of thousands and I
published a paper and gave a talk
similar to this at wiki sim 2007 and
it's called recommenders everywhere the
wiki lens community maintained
recommender system this talk is about
beer finally actually it's about a beer
lover confronted with many beers and we
try to answer the question how can we
help him decide which beer to drink the
answer that we propose is wiki lens this
installation it has been running on wiki
lens Oregon it has hundreds of users and
thousands of items and beer but before
jumping into the details I'd like to
tell you a little bit about what
motivated us to build this tool the
principles the high level principles we
used to organize our thinking the design
of the features of wiki lens our
experiences with it and some possible
improvements to it so there are many
popular websites that are fueled by user
contribution amazon has millions of our
customer views myspace is a social
networking site but it has hundreds of
thousands of user uploaded videos and of
course wikipedia has millions of user
edited encyclopedia articles and the
list goes on of popular websites fueled
by user contribution
but sometimes it's hard to find the
treasure in the trash a personalized
recommender system recommends items
based on your personal preferences so if
you tell Amazon what you like or you buy
some things on Amazon it'll give you a
list based on those things using facts
like eighty percent of people who bought
this item also bought this item or who
browsed this item also browse this item
this is an example of a collaborative
filtering algorithm and there's several
of them combining ratings of users like
you combining ratings of items similar
to those you rate and such algorithms
often require many users in many ratings
here's another recommender system and
I'll introduce it as I'll talk about it
later this is movie lens it's run by the
group lens research group at the
University of Minnesota and you rate
some movies and based on your ratings
and the ratings of others it recommends
other movies to you it has thousands of
active users it has 13 million ratings
which is very large for a research
system but no beer so suppose our beer
lover wants to start a community site he
could start a wiki or a forum or a blog
but what if he wants to start a
recommender and what if he wants that
recommender to be fueled by community
contribution we propose community
maintained recommenders where users
contribute all the content and the
information needed to recommend that
content and since traditional
recommender algorithms need many users
and many ratings but most online
communities are small we propose small
world recommenders these systems would
have to provide user value even with
very little preference data per item and
they do so by depending on the users of
the system to understand other users
deeply for example by seeing other
specific individuals preferences
we still think it would be important to
aggregate user preferences into
recommendations imagine going to a movie
with five of your friends it's still
hard to find a movie that all of you
will like or at least none of you will
hate so what is this small world like
well its users are passionate in 2002
there's a TV series called firefly and
when it looked like it was going to be
cancelled before the series was over
people organized themselves calling
themselves Browncoats holding parties
making websites and even gathering money
to take out an ad in The New York Times
the series didn't appeal to the
mainstream but it had peeled to a small
group of people very strongly these
people want community maintenance this
is the administrator of anime planet and
he said I currently spend about 70 hours
a week all of my free time working on
this site and I can no longer do it I
need other people to help and they want
recommendations one of the major
features of this site anime planet is a
recommendation database so we looked for
an existing system that we could use to
set up a community maintained
recommender and study it and we found
libraries we found web services and we
found research into recommenders but
none into community maintained
recommenders so we built wiki lens and
although this talk is about beer as I
promised this is wiki Len supports more
than just beer as we were developing
wiki lens we didn't advertise it very
much but people still started to ask us
if they could use it because they have a
desire to offer recommendations on their
site and there are no tools to allow you
to easily do that so we take this as
some support that there's desire in the
small world for such a tool so let me
describe a few principles that we use to
organize our thoughts why do you care
why do you care about principles that's
what I always ask in a talk why do I
care and in this case there are lots of
features that you could add to a system
and we want some way to organize our
thinking furthermore perhaps you're not
going to take wiki lens yourself but
you're a system designer and these
principles could influence you in
building your own system so suppose our
beer lover goes to find a beer he
Google's of course and finds a website
called beeradvocate com he finds on that
site the top hundred beers and then and
the one at the top is one that I can't
pronounce called trappist vest Valeron
12 how does he know if he'll like
trappist 12 well it's in the top hundred
but beer advocate also has the top
hundred american beers the top session
beers I don't even know what a session
beer is and the strongest beers clearly
these multiple lists might appeal to
multiple people indeed each person might
want their own list but no matter how
much our beer lover tells beer advocate
about their preferences this list will
never change its not personalized beer
advocate has 32,000 beers but what if
you and your friends can't drink that
many you want to find the ones that
you'll like similarly anime planet has
thousands of works of anime you want to
find the ones that you'll like so our
first principle is find members should
be able to find items that interest them
and without going into detail I'll just
say that researchers have looked at how
people find items of interest and it's
complex
so suppose we found some beers we liked
and our beer lover wishes to add his
favorite micro brew at the pub down at
the on the corner well at beer advocate
you can't add a beer until you've
reviewed at least 20 but Chris Anderson
who wrote a book called the long tail
says the market for books that are not
even sold in the average bookstore is
larger than the market for those that
are so there's a lot of interest in
these micro brews and here's an example
of our own sort of micro brew on wiki
lens dot org michelob is a large brand
but apparently golden draft light isn't
available everywhere people commenting
on this page say I wish you was sold in
Montana you can't get everything in New
York and someone who obviously disagrees
with these fanatics say are you people
insane well maybe they aren't there in
the small world moreover people work
harder for immediate satisfaction one of
the big complaints on movie lens from
its users is that it doesn't have the
movies that the user wants to rate it
doesn't have my movie says the movie
fanatic so in 2005 den costly ran an
experiment with movie lens users where
he allowed them to add movies and he
separated them into multiple
experimental groups one group got to see
the results of their addition
immediately another group got to see the
results of their audition only after
someone else reviewed it and people who
saw the results of their addition
immediately did more work so our second
principle is add members should be able
to add items immediately so our beer
lover wants a beer centric system of
course and there's information common to
each beer like its style or alcohol
content so here's beer advocates beer
detail page has alcohol availability
suppose we want to edit this detail page
no chance
and suppose we were to add a field we
want to add color dark or light you
can't do it the site is owned by
beeradvocate well so people say if you
want to offer a database of items why
not use a content management system in
general lots of these content management
systems support fields structured data
but they don't support the ad principle
being able to add or edit items
immediately and if people have found if
you give power to the people the
community can do amazing things
wikipedians change display templates
they categorize items they build BOTS
and tools to clean or enhanced data so
our third principle is deep change
members should be able to uniquely
identify items and define and redefine
their attributes and organization so
let's rate a beer our beer lover goes to
rate two-hearted ale from bells well
apparently first you have to learn how
to review a beer you have to learn more
about this style American IPA you have
to fill out at least six drop downs and
a text box which I couldn't fit in this
screenshot now I don't know about you
but I'm getting tired and now I want a
beer but movie lands users say rating is
fun and Bryant and forte when
interviewing people who were very
involved in Wikipedia found that many of
them started with small tasks correcting
punctuation and the like and that these
small tasks might be a path for a casual
contributor to become a more involved
contributor so our fourth principle
micro contribute is that members should
be able to make small contributions and
any community site will allow you to see
other users here's phage lab reviewing a
beer in fact when you think about it I
mean think about it for a second if you
look for movies
see books to read you ask your friends
what did you see what did you read in
fact Tom Erikson thinks that every
collaborate collaborative system should
allow you to see other people he calls
its social translucence so our final
principle is see others members should
be able to see each other and their
contributions well so are we just
rebuilding beeradvocate well first of
all I don't know beer advocate very well
I'm just using it as an example because
it's about beer and we're sort of
rebuilding it but we believe that lots
of small communities have these same
needs that I've just outlined and so
there should be a tool that's general
that's not just about beer it should
allow anyone to start a new community a
new recommender community it should give
more power to that community and it
should have a personalized recommender
so let me talk about the design of our
system wiki lens if you go to the
homepage wiki lens org you'll see a link
to beer and you'll also see a few beers
that are in that highly rated in that
category if you click on the beer link
you'll see all the beers in the category
with predicted values this system also
has a social network so you can propose
being a buddy and if they accept then
your buddies of each other and if they
like a beer if your buddy likes a beer
that is if they rated higher than their
own average you'll see it in the likes
column on this page a Joe Lee likes
anchor steam beep it likes bells two
hearted the predicted value is a
weighted average of buddy ratings and
the overall average rating this is very
unlike traditional collaborative
filtering and we did this for two
reasons first of all we well I believed
in buddies I thought you'd want to know
what your friends think we also thought
the traditional collaborative filtering
algorithms would be too noisy with
little data and there are a few more
details and i'll let you see the
per the classic cop-out so here's a
feature that supports our ad principle
any item is a wiki page here's bells two
hearted and it can be added or edited by
any user a page is in a category like
beer and a category can have fields like
style or alcohol content fields are
specified on another wiki page with a
simple language where you give a field a
name you specify which widget you'll use
to edit it and if it's a restricted
option widget like a drop-down it has
options that you can list again editable
by anyone users edit fields with
familiar wits so if you've said it's a
radio button when you edit a beer you'll
see radio button choices here are some
features that support micro contribution
this is young's double chocolate stout
which i like quite a bit by the way
perhaps not my favorite beer but i like
stouts and you can rate the beer with
smiley faces at the top of the page the
yellow things you can also see your
buddies ratings I've blanked out the
names to protect the innocent or the
guilty it has fields and you can edit
the fields like alcohol content in this
case you can add other information like
links to sites or descriptions and you
can comment by typing in the bottom box
and clicking add comment here are some
features that support the find principle
you can select a beer by browsing
through the system searching by visiting
the category page that orders by
predicted value once you've selected a
beer that you are more interested in you
can evaluate it by looking at its
details predicted values average ratings
buddy ratings and so on and you can see
others
you can see your buddies you can see
their ratings on item detail pages you
can see whether they like things on the
category page and you can see other
users you can see their profiles and if
they haven't turned it off you can see
their ratings you can see their comments
you can see averages and you can see
them in recent changes like any wiki
system which raises a question is this a
wiki or not well any user can edit any
page any item fields field definitions
categories data including fields is
versioned like in a wiki it has recent
changes in page history but it's unlike
a wiki in that you edit structured data
fields with special editors you rate
things and you have category pages that
have items sorted by predicted value so
let me describe a few experiences that
we've had with wiki lens almost
everything i'll be talking about is one
particular installation wiki lens org
and the data was gathered over a couple
of years it has hundreds of users and
thousands of items that is small but not
miniscule here the top five most popular
categories they have hundreds of items
and dozens of distinct contributors our
first lesson is that users will add
items forty percent of the users who
join the site added at least one item we
found that broadening the community of
contributors is useful each categories
top contributor only contributed a few
of the top-rated items so for example a
user who I'll call movie maven added
seventy percent of the movies but only
three of the top rated movies so here's
a list of the top 25 the the 25 top
rated movies and movie maven added
numbers 20 21 and 25 that means other
people in the community added all these
things that are very popular to the
community as a whole
let me talk about movie maven just for a
second this user added over 1300 movies
and if you conservatively estimate
thirty seconds to add a movie that's
over 12 hours of work moreover movie
maven is also a member of the movie lens
site and ninety-seven percent in the
movies that he entered were already
entered in movie lens and rated by movie
maven in movie lens that is the three
percent of the items that he couldn't
rate in movie lens were sufficient
motivation for him to support an
alternative site wiki lands where people
can add whatever they want another
lesson is that users understand and
change categories and fields on wiki
lens we actually avoided adding a movie
category we already had a large and
successful site that did that but users
wanted it and added it anyway movie
maven did not add the movie category
although he populated a lot of movies
this is another example that supports
the deep change principle I'm a part of
a book club this is not wiki lens org
and in our book club we choose the next
book that we want to read now since I'm
in the club this is a there's at least
one user who knows how to manipulate the
system but we're able to put together an
application that's useful for us on the
next book page we have some information
about where we're going to meet by the
way if you're ever in Minneapolis gigi's
is a nice coffee house it says the order
in which we're going to choose books
there's a category that shows all of the
proposed books but since one person
chooses the book they usually choose a
few candidates from that category and
they put them on this page we all rate
them and you can see who's rated them
what they've raided them you can see
comments our own comments on whether we
think the book is appropriate for the
club and I'll say in this application I
mostly use the ratings for sort of veto
voting if anyone really hates the book
then I'm
choose it and so if you have the ability
to build your own applications you can
tailor them to your own needs we found
the wiki lens supports a range of
contributions most users who joined
rated something forty percent of users
added something while fewer users
changed category fields or categories
themselves category pages were hubs of
browsing six of the top ten pages
browsed by logged in users were category
pages like movie or album or book we
administered a user survey in november
two thousand six and our users said they
use wiki lens to find new items to learn
more about they find items by using the
category page and they evaluate items
based on the predicted values on the
category page we found that traditional
collaborative filtering is possible even
in small data sets as I said before we
used a very non-traditional
collaborative filtering algorithm but
decided to simulate more traditional
item based collaborative filtering after
the fact we took eighty percent of our
users as a training set twenty percent
as a test set and for the test users we
used eighty percent of their ratings to
generate recommendations and saw how
often the other twenty percent came up
traditionally called recall and we found
that collaborative filtering improved
recall even for the wiki lens org
dataset which is quite small by
traditional standards we found that
buddies were used mostly by pre-existing
social groups okay by group lens
although I had hoped people would bring
in their own bodies to the system it's
very hard to start a new social network
now perhaps with Facebook opening up its
social network for experimentation or
with Google proposing the open social
framework an application where you can
get recommendations from your buddies
might be more feasible but in our system
it didn't go very far
so let's discuss a few possible
improvements to wiki lines as it stands
right now well users use wiki lens to
find new items but if they don't have
buddies they get average based
recommendations that is not personalized
so we should implement a personalized
recommender for users who don't have
buddies and we would have to make sure
that that recommender is suitable for
the small world that is it's not easily
thrown off by little preference data per
item users used wiki lens to keep track
of items I liked or disliked but
organizing those items is hard right now
wiki lens org has five restaurant
categories Boston restaurant Bay Area
restaurant New York restaurant that
doesn't scale and so we should implement
hierarchical categories wiki lens org
could use more contribution as any
community maintain site and we'd like to
make it more usable more sociable and
give more incentives for people to
contribute and there's a lot of research
into what exactly incensed people to
contribute there are more people who
want to install wiki lens than do
install it so we'd like to make it
easier to install and change its look
and easier to change its look and feel
it has templating but it's complicated
there's kind of an interesting
underlying point here we made a tool
that could be installed on the lamp
architecture Linux Apache my sequel and
the P stands for PHP but often Python or
other scripting languages that can be
plugged into Apache so any tool that's
not lamp we felt might be more difficult
for people to install might be less
viral however it's hard to keep wiki
lens org fast and it's hard to keep it
unbroken so to keep it fast often it's
the recommendations that are slowing it
down and PHP represents a big challenge
to speeding that up we'd like to
re-architect it for fast recommendations
possibly by having another component
that's not PHP
but that potentially makes it harder to
install it's also harder to keep it
unbroken and several of us think that we
should rewrite it in a type checked
language like Java well at least one of
our team members feels that that would
be an abomination so what have we
learned in this talk or at least what
have I hope we've learned we proposed
community maintained recommenders that
support the small world we want lots of
beer lenses we discussed five principles
to organize our thinking and features
based on those principles we gave our
experiences with wiki lens organ and
supported many of these proposals but
there's a lot of room for improvement
thanks for listening questions
it was wondering I was wondering if
there was any way or if you've seen any
form of transfer between categories and
surprising filtering and that I'm not
quite sure how that would manifest
itself but this notion of this person
likes I like the same movies that this
person likes therefore maybe you can
recommend me music that they like so I
find this a fascinating question whether
preferences cross domains and there's
really very little data to study that
question it turns out that on wiki lens
we're going to we do release all of the
data that's collected on the site and
less people market otherwise and so this
might allow us to study this now several
of my colleagues were very much less
interested in studying this question so
we haven't studied it yet at all there's
some evidence that preferences do not
cross domains not from our data but from
other kind of papers and experiences but
I find it hard to believe that some
preference domains which are very close
like maybe books or movies wouldn't
cross at least some I'd really like to
study that further yeah likewise thank
you yeah
well if they're no further questions oh
there's a question so has his wicked
spam become a problem yes another one of
our lessons that's in the paper but that
I didn't put in the talk because I
wanted it to be short is that our site
was open to anonymous contribution and
indeed the michelob golden draft light
page that I showed had mostly anonymous
comments people were being attracted to
the site presumably by searching on
Google for michelob golden draft light
and seeing the site and going and
begging for this beer but being open to
anonymous contribution meant it got
crushed by wiki spam when that started
to appear in 2005 we closed the site so
that you have to create a login to be
able to edit and wiki spammers even had
tools to automatically create logins
which surprised me because we have our
own login page it's not a standard login
page so they must have BOTS smart enough
to identify fields that look like they
might be user and password fields and
create logins and so forth so we put in
a simple mechanism you have to rate at
least one item before you can edit
anything since the web isn't covered
with sites that allow ratings none of
the wiki spam bots have bothered to
cover this case anymore and we now have
no wiki spam what so what about human
beings basically shilling their own
stuff I just made a movie and I think
it's the greatest ever I should enter it
and I should rate it high
or yes or there's another restaurant
that I don't whose owner I wish to
bankrupt and I I rate their restaurant
low and I create 100 accounts and rate
their restaurant low with all of those
accounts so the first thing I'll say is
that group lens has published a couple
of papers on this problem shilling and
it's an interesting problem it's
non-trivial to combat and I figured I'd
wait until it was obviously a problem on
wiki lens before combating it I mean
right now I think wiki lens is
susceptible to what to Schilling
the scale is still small the scale is
still small although in the case of
movie lens the scale is large thousands
of active users and honestly it's not
clear to me if they're spam or not some
movie lens users think movie lens is
being spammed but it's very non-trivial
to detect whether spamming is occurring
and that's actually a whole different
talk I could I could my colleague Tony
lamb has published a couple papers and I
could try to summarize a little bit of
how you might detect and an effective
algorithms actually he's I think been
more successful so far at describing how
you can chill then how you can detect
Schilling unfortunately absolutely or
you can look on group lens org as well
whether the system believe feat in any
way if the scale for some of the
features included let's say suddenly
millions of people want to read and read
about fear he might still be sparkler so
there's this wiki lens scale by the
number of users it doesn't scale not
right now in in PHP it doesn't scale and
again we wanted to build a system to
investigate how these community
maintained recommenders would work and
of course we wanted to build it to scale
but we wanted to build it first and so
again this is a very interesting problem
and I think it's important to look at
especially recommendations themselves
are probably the slowest part of the
site but we haven't had a chance to
address it
you think that most of the problems with
scaling might be just the way it's
implemented is lower because it's on now
a PHP but the recommendation algorithm
in principle should be skilled the
recommendation algorithm in principle
may be scalable there are some other
features that have challenges to
scalability for example I showed you
that the fields in categories are
specified by a wiki page that's editable
by anyone so what happens when you have
a hundred thousand books and you change
a field does it change instantly on all
those pages do you pre compute values
what happen search for a book whose
author is Dan Frankowski sadly that'll
come up empty but what happens is well
so we use the fields page to generate
that search and we search the fields
right now by grabbing the page data and
parsing the field out of it when when
you have five hundred thousand pages
that doesn't scale you would need some
way to pre-compute that so there are
definitely more scalability challenges
than just the recommendation algorithms
so that's a good question yep
well if there are no more questions
thanks very much for your attention
