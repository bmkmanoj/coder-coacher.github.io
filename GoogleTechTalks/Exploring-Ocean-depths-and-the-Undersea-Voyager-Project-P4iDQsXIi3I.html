my great pleasure to introduce Scott
Cassell who I met earlier this month at
the annual personal submersibles
convention in Castine Maine and Craig my
interested to hear what he said there
and thought why not invite him over here
to explain more about what he's doing in
the field of oceanography in research
and exploring underwater Scott can you
hear me okay can you guys hear me okay I
don't have a loud voice so you
I need mechanical help my name is Scott
Cassell and I'm a squid nerd
I pretty much have spent my life
studying giant squid and giant Humboldt
squid and I actually think I have the
best job in the world in my office I
think as much as I love this place I
kind of think my office is kind of cool
maybe even better than here most of the
time I check into my office around 50 60
feet below the water and or as a diver
or up to a thousand feet deep and
submersibles so I'm having a pretty good
time basically what I was asked to talk
about was giant squid and a program that
were working on right now called the
undersea Voyager project and we're gonna
cover kind of both of that but first I
just want to let you know that there are
alien life species here on the planet
and that's what I get to study and you
guys are going to see some footage that
has never been released before there are
some documentaries that are pending that
are going to have this information in it
but you guys are the first real audience
to actually see the inside workings of a
giant squid all that's alive so anyway
the the show that I put together for you
is called the giant squid in the mouse
and it's kind of a fun story because I
like mice we actually have some rats but
I also love squid and reasoning is also
twofold
it's my can you make me work
which ones afford button okay so well
basically the the question is it
possible for a group of kids in any
third world country or first world
country to actually watch a giant squid
in real time the answer is yes and can
that also can that class talk to their
teacher while they're inside the
submersible at a thousand feet deep and
basically have an undersea classroom the
answer is absolutely yes and that's part
of the program of the undersea Voyager
project this is my office
this is actually me earlier this year
holding 150 pound Humboldt squid which
scientists will tell you do not actually
get this big I have held animals even
bigger than that but it's funny I don't
have a lot of people in the water with
me with cameras most of the time I do
work alone most of the time but you can
actually see that what I'm wearing here
is a steel body armor it's a chainmail
suit but it's also I have panels that I
usually wear on my wrist and on my back
generally is a mixed gas rebreather
system because like you guys I like to
go to work and stay there until I get
the job done I often spend six seven
hours underwater to give in time so but
this good right here I'm taking what
they call calcium isotope tissue samples
and we're basically trying to figure out
is what makes this guy relaxed what
makes this guy stressed and we're
finding out that the more we learn about
the animals physiology the less we
actually know how the darn things live
it's an amazing animal they actually
have blue blood a sand-based blood they
have three hearts and they have
communication that takes place on the
surface of their skin they have 1.2
million chromatophores that cover the
body but amazingly every single
chromatophore which is a cell that opens
and closes with the color pigment
underneath it is wired directly to the
brain individually so the animal thinks
his color it bypasses a central nervous
system which in itself is a fascinating
structure but they also got some other
cool Anatomy structures that were going
to cover including about 50,000 T
I'm only at about 50 feet deep here well
I kind of enticed them up but basically
what I'm doing is I'm live catching
animals in the water so that they're
actually attacking me and I take a
tissue sample so that we can check the
calcium isotope level and if you wanna
the shortened version of that is we all
have calcium which is a mineral it's a
metal inside of our bodies but it's also
there's a biological version of it
synthesized and when it comes in contact
with different types of hormones it
breaks down at a different rate
therefore has a different radioactive
signature and so we're trying to
determine is what stresses these guys
out versus when are they not stressed
out in other words in a hunting mode
when they're hunting they're actually
probably enjoying themselves quite a bit
because they're very ferocious creatures
so I've spent a little over a decade
actually researching these animals and
this is a this is a picture of me
getting ready to go into work this is
actually an animal that we just released
after putting under anesthesia I kind of
babysit him and cradled him before we
lecture we release them back into the
wild but we've had a myriad of people
come out with us
oddly enough I have very few people that
come back from more than one trip but
the squid do scare a lot of people we
actually I was diving down with one crew
from a magazine and this underwater
photographer that was diving with me
that was doing this article about me and
my work was like wow this this is great
well look Scott I've just doped with
great white sharks and tiger sharks and
a pedo moray eel and these squid aren't
gonna scare me and so I put him up in my
armor and we cable on down to the to the
bottom of our cables and he's sitting
down there he's like okay this is cool
I'm all right
the first five-foot squid comes out of
the dark and just like does a flinch at
him like this and I was like wow that
was a really great behavior I look
through and he's gone and I look up and
there I see these people there he
splashes on the surf I was like oh crap
so I dog paddle on up there and I'm
saying you know I get to the surface and
he's like quite quite because his boss
is in the boat
and I'm in a little Punga and he's like
dude I'm really sorry
that's good it totally freaked me out I
said why
I'm scared of spiders and when that
thing came you look like a giant five
foot across fighter just totally
terrified me so I got him down there he
was just hanging on my arm but I
actually have more wounds from him than
the squid that died yeah yeah this is
another story so yeah but the first
we're going to talk about the anatomy of
a squid and the anatomy is its own
fascination really first of all the
animals themselves look kind of crazy
remind you this is a Mullis k-- in the
eye from this Mullis k-- is equal in
visual acuity as ours and I bought this
form from a fisherman and they got a
beak of course and they got a radula
which is a spike covered tongue and the
beak and the radula are subject to some
investigation right now through
engineering components because of its
amazing strength even though it's
flexible here is on being actually used
against the lens of my camera being
attacked but it's a polysaccharide this
chitin is ring teeth that the beak is
made out of as well as all the suction
cups and they all have teeth every
suction cup is lying between 21 and 36
teeth so if you add them all up there's
36 to 50,000 teeth and there they
actually deployed on the on the camera
her metaphors are fun because as they
see the animals change colors at one
thirtieth of a second one frame of film
they can change colors and they use it
to communicate red being the first color
to disappear is the side they use if
they want to hide so he's flashing red
on my side trying to be disappeared
while he's looking at the downrange he's
trying to be white which is a nice color
to hide against in the silhouette in the
sky so they can change its called
hemispherical shading they can change
this as you can see in the flash of an
eye and you can clearly see the
delineation between red and white nuke
all cartilage is really cool stuff this
is the spinal cord or spinal column of a
squid and this right here is the side
locks the rail and system actually locks
themselves the head will lock itself in
place and as you can see they're also
very much cannibals and this animal
grabbed on to an animal on a jig and cut
through his head in about 20 seconds
which is as big around as a human leg
these are seven footers hundred plus
pound squids that are
tearing the five foot squared apart
right in front of me the ink is kind of
cool people think that they use ink only
when they're scared that's not true they
actually use it to hide prey from each
other so there's less competition for
food and you can see this guy right here
is actually eating another squid and
he's covering him up in the ink so
nobody else can see it so if you find
yourself in the ink you're actually
gonna get hit by the other squid this
ink is called a pseudo morph and it's a
gelatinous ink that actually resembles
another squid here's a cannibal going to
go eat that other squid which is
actually a pseudomorphic ink structure
and they got good eyes and it faked him
out right up to the end where he
attacked it these animals are scary
smart this animals on a jig and he's
trying to flee a cannibal and to get
away from the cannibal he hides right
behind me and so you can actually see
the chitin ax string teeth scars on his
skin I released him I tried to release
all of our squid undamaged and he hung
out there for a long time this is what a
200 pound squid looks like this animal
is too big around to put him your hands
around and he's so big that he knows
he's in charge and so he just ripped the
back of a 5-foot squid off and he's
hanging out and he's I'm a dinner at a
show
you know he's watching me while he's
macking down on his buddy and he's so
big that he pushes me on the shoulder
like a bull like a bully and leaves a
chainmail mark on his flank right there
you can see that just by pushing me out
of the way and he continued to do it so
he's just shoving me right out of the
way here and eating his little buddy and
when you come in contact with the animal
this big you really know who's in charge
they're magnificent and beautiful
creatures and by the way the cannibalism
I don't entice that it just happens all
the time these animals got a very
similar metabolic rate as a hummingbird
these animals have an amazing growth
rate of two millimeters a day on the
average that's a 6-foot squid and that's
an 8-footer right there and they're
they're just magnificent this is what it
looks like to be attacked in a group
when you're by yourself which is a bad
place to be
I'm a very steady camera but you see I'm
getting knocked around because for every
camera that's in frame that's a
there's three or four others hitting my
back head and legs and you can see there
they actually don't stop very they just
like keep coming in and remember they're
coming they're completely safe and I
wish we had audio right now because the
sounds that you're hearing are pretty
fantastic I actually had one grab me on
the head and pulled me upside down which
is what kind of turned dark there so
these animals really are magnificent to
come in contact with but don't go diving
with them in a speedo the bad idea I
encourage people to come out and die
with me I take just about anybody who's
a diver that has some skill level to
come and see the animals I do put you in
chainmail armor
I do teach you how to dive on the end of
a cable and I do tell you it's gonna be
like getting attacked by really big pit
bulls that are pissed and as long as you
got the mindset to do that it's okay you
know oh I actually here in California
now they're all I the highest
concentration that I found in regular
bases in the Sea of Cortez and so I
actually go in something Rosalia and and
die with them out there so they're there
they're great fun and I've never seen
the same thing twice on a dive sometimes
they're just all-out attacking other
times they're extremely well mannered
and delicate and just a complete
wonderful time with them but since you
don't know you better go in prepared for
the downside of the encounter and that
we's full armor and a cable and
everything so yes sir I don't try to
hurt them back I'm a guest
so I endure the attack and try to get
them off of him before they can hurt me
I actually do have scars on my arm
that's occurred right through the
chainmail suit they can break your wrist
in a in a heartbeat if it gets in the
beat the beak of a six-foot squid is as
big as your hand and the pressure on
that has we're just now testing it we're
finding out it's pretty strong it's
strong enough to break both bones in
your wrist and one or two seconds of a
bite so the biggest danger you have is
allowing them to go to a hold of your
arm or your fingers but as long as you
keep your fist and keep your hands in
close you're relatively safe so but I
have had one pull my shoulder out of the
socket I have
one dragged me down so fast that my
right ear drum ruptured and I do have
scars on my throat from the ring teeth
so you know as long as you're armored
and ready and you got a cable on you
it's no big deal you know it's just a
lot of fun to go and see them the cable
is there to prevent me from going deeper
because that's my very first dive with
these things yeah my very first dive was
enough I was I was I dropped in the
water this was over a decade ago and I
found that about these wonderful animals
so I hired this Ponca fisherman to take
me out there and go look at him you know
because I heard this legend that they
were main eating squid and sea Cortes
I'm like okay yeah it's like okay
there's an eating squid rather about
this big right you know they like bite
you I'm scared you know I've researched
white sharks I've ridden on the back of
a ton shark you know I mean I figured I
could handle it well I but I was in love
with squid from when I was a kid you
know six years old is when I think
20,000 Leagues Under the Sea came out
and I was there and I watched I was like
oh my god that squids attacking the
Nautilus that I'm there you know that's
my whole life is about squid and subs
and sure enough what am i doing now I
know the squid and subs so but when I
heard that these squid existed I was
like okay there's a legendary the
ammonia Rojo a red demon of animals
squid in the sea Cortez they don't kill
people okay so yeah Bigfoot's alive too
so I don't know maybe he is in fact
there's the squid to exist and I talked
to my friends at Scripps and they go
well there's there's some four or five
foot squid that you could that are down
there that can give you a heck of a bite
but they're not going to hurt you so
that's what the scientists told me so I
hired upon the fishermen we get out
there and he catches a squid he's
bringing up he's like you know you're
gonna go in the water and you're gonna
die like I don't think so I'm okay so I
roll off into the water and I'm five
feet underwater and look under there
this beautiful five-foot squid on a jig
unfortunately the animals under stress
because he's hooked you know and I'm
swimming up there and I'm filming him
and I was absolutely in love and
mesmerized by the chromatophore changes
and while I was just looking at the
camera and just getting this and just
thinking that this was epic I didn't
bother looking around me and realize
that I they're all coming around like
this and I see this peripheral move
just as I look over there just what bad
down from there I got my shoulder pulled
out of the socket as I said because when
grabbed a hand on my camera and yanked
it back and pulled my shoulder out this
way and then a bunch of them grabbed me
and started pulling me down fighting the
power of a Humboldt squid
is like hanging on to a full-fledged
fire hose and expecting to be able to
carve your name in the dirt good luck
you know it's it's amazing amount of
power on these quit so they pulled me on
down and I'm trying to kick myself free
and my arm is hurt but I'm not gonna let
go of my camera and my right ear drum
imploded because of their pull me down
too rapidly and that's when I really
started fighting hard and I got free I
clawed my way up to the surface and the
pond you're fishin is like I told you so
since then chain mail cables I haven't
really been hurt too bad since so what
you're about to see right now you're the
first crew to actually see this and it's
endoscopic examination of a giant
Humboldt squid
these are the chromatophores of the
hyponym right before we're going to go
into the mantle and you can see all
these little cells right here changing
it open like little umbrellas and they
close and you can see how quickly they
do it actually you gonna see this
rippling effect all the way across this
is how fast that is so here we are we're
actually going down into the hypo dome
right into the squid and this is what
you see on the outside and then BAM
we're inside a living giant Humboldt
squid and there's the gill structures
this right here is the artery of
oxygenated blood which is blue and clear
deoxygenated blood on sy Annan is
crystal-clear like seawater so you can't
see the blood vessels and they're all
over the place this by the way is a
female kind of cool huh I didn't know
this was gonna be xxx but this is
actually her fallopian tubes and her
ovaries right there and yes we released
you're unharmed right in the center here
so this is the ligament right here
there's the aortic arch just like what
we have anchoring our heart they order
right to our spine and so these are the
magnificent Gill structures right there
and they're held together by these
filaments that we didn't even know
existed till we saw them for real and
here we are right down the center and we
see the beating heart right there and
this right here is a brachial heart they
have three hearts they have a heart a
brachial heart right at the base of
every Gill structure
and they have to Gill structures and
then they have a center heart which
pumps the oxygenated blood there's the
there's the other heart so you can see
the how fast the this heartbeat is and
this is after a little anesthesia this
is after she's relaxed and so you can
see the gill structures right there with
the blue this is the peristalsis of the
major vein pumping the blood actually
this does have a pumping effect on their
veins unlike us going right back to the
heart now this is inside the stomach of
a giant Humboldt squid and it's really
lovely to see hope you guys are okay
with it the brown radish color there is
actually it shows it was feeding on
hematocrit you know hemoglobin based
animals like fish and if it eating squid
this would be clear because the blood
would be clear right so we're actually
pulling back up through the crop we just
pincher the stomach and this crop right
here is where they pre swallow their
food and then we're going to go right
through they you can see the pyloric
sphincter right now we're coming back to
the to the sphincter above that that
closes off the stomach and you can see
how it pleats just like ours does it
goes as well stuff rather large they can
eat quite a bit of food for their size
and so as we're getting closer to the
surface the bubbles take up would come
out through the throat and here's the
anchoring structure for the radula which
is that crown of gold which is a spike
covered tongue that grabs the meat from
the bite and puts it down the gullet and
right here we have no idea what this
pumping structure is but it's not blood
and it's not stomach so we don't know
why it's there so it's exciting to know
that we're seeing new stuff even
nowadays you know now one of the other
things that we have done in the past and
we continue to do it because it's very
exciting what we get out of it is squid
camp and you know the other guys they
say that they have a critter cam so I
have a squid or Cam and we actually put
the camera together and we give the
piercing of the squid and we let her go
so here we are getting one of my little
buddies and it's jigged
and the animals under stress he doesn't
realize I'm going to release it but so
it gives me a little bit of a fight
there and so this was done a clear
beautiful day and so there's a
relatively small squid so we actually
put the piercing through it and then we
put a cotter pin on it and then you see
there's a micro tether that
holds the camera to the boat so he can
retrieve her and and we let her go
you see all the armor that I'm wearing
in case of a bite and so she just sends
on down and we usually let him go for
half a day and they go all the way down
to a thousand feet deep with the court
into the data sensor that we have and
while they're down there they take
footage for us that's fantastic here she
is flying inside of a shoal of her
buddies and the formation flying the
population density of the shoals all
these things we learn but we also have
actually filmed mating behavior while
she had a camera on her back and she may
have just become a momma so once again
you didn't realize this is gonna be that
sexy so here we are releasing her and
she's quite okay so we really it has a
very low light sensitivity CCD but it
also does have a ring of LEDs that we
don't like to use very much because it
scares the squid away you know most
species is good when you turn the lights
on they come up to the boat Humboldt
squid or like monsters you turn the
lights on the and they disappear back
into the dark yeah so they like the dark
they're very effective at what we just
did last month actually is not yet what
we did last month is we use night vision
scopes underwater no I told you not to
give me that thing mean technology no
that's what I said he's squid cuz I'm
not very good with any technology what
we did is we actually a night-vision
camera system and I went down at night
diving alone with the squid with no
lights and that that was a little bit
tricky because they were really quite
large and they would just come hurtling
out of the dark and they'd be grabbing
onto me I really didn't know which way
they were coming and then after a while
my eye started to adjust and by the way
this camera has a feed up to the surface
and I'm wearing communications and Sean
is saying okay there's a squid to the
right so I am I really I can't see and a
fascinating thing that we discovered was
the bioluminescence that beautiful blue
green algae color that glows when it's
illuminated or aggravated is a both a
defensive system as well as the
predations
but the squid used and what they do is
we I was actually filming this little
fish swimming and they're creating this
cone of light behind them and the squid
will come up underneath them and then
follow inside of that cone of light so
they'll hide bright white not a single
red pigment in their body just ghostly
white tracking this the animal from
behind inside of its own light that it
emits and saw the Sun got'em and so we
actually filmed that with the night
vision system so we didn't know that the
squid would hide inside the light during
the night so it's kind of an interesting
predation technique that we certainly
didn't expect it coming you know and
sure enough after I was like wow they're
actually hunting on these mackerel and
stuff I fallen behind him I wonder and
sure enough they're all in back of me
following me I'm like ah I got you guys
I'm figuring you out and I actually
didn't get hurt too bad because of that
so when we are doing is also yeah oh yes
the Plankton's yeah the animals
themselves weren't creating any
bioluminescence but they did it was
really beautiful I would love for all of
you guys to see that imagine dangling
inside the nighttime water without a
light anywhere on it and it's really
really dark but you can still see things
if you've ever gone hiking at night
without a light you know you can kind of
see you know and it's kind of like that
and so you're hanging on this cable into
armor and there's monsters all around
you alright that's just kind of a neat
idea anyway and you're watching all of
these school of fish going by and every
fish makes its own tube of light and so
you got this giant cloud of light going
through and then you see these massive
tubes coming up for these four to seven
foot squid and they're like dip very
quietly stalking the prey from behind
then you can watch this happening and
it's just an amazing thing it's like
watching a lion stalking a gazelle you
know it's like except of course the
gazelles not making a trail of light but
you get the idea you can see what's
going on from a distance and it's just
fantastic I was so happy to actually see
that well we're working on right now is
one of the projects is I want to put
these animals on captivity in captivity
and there I have a myriad of reasons for
that but primarily it's because I like
squid I want ever
ready to see them and can you imagine
going to the aquarium and seeing a
six-foot squid you know ten times over
and you see this wonderful shoal of
squid
patrolling around this this this tank
and they were raised since they were
little so this is the life that they
know and the reason this is important
I'll go into later I don't like to see
any animal in captivity but this animal
particularly captures the imagination
and is going to directly affect all of
us I'll explain a why here in a little
bit so we've been working with Scripps
and the Aquarium of the Pacific and
here's Shauna actually she's one of the
research assistants out on the field and
she's gearing up and she's going to do
our Vanna White she's actually swimming
right next to our anesthesia round and
our open net and that net pen is where
we actually grab the squid and we put
them inside to start doing our testing
and so here's Steve from the equipment
of the Pacific and myself I'm dragging
in a squid that's been caught on a gin
unfortunately that's still the most
effective way to grab them but I've
reduced the impact on that there's it's
barbless they're all clean there's lots
of things I do the jig to make it less
painful for him but here they are
getting used to it they don't like
they're not used to touching anything so
they touch the net and freaks him out a
little bit and so here we have him
actually starting to acclimate become
quite calm and they became so calm that
we actually started to feed them and so
here's Shauna taking this shot and the
doubles back to attacker and she bravely
gets the heck out of the pen but watch
this guy he saw a hole and he got right
out I mean tell me they're not smart and
so here's actually he's actually eating
fish in captivity after a few minutes of
them acclimating to it so that was
amazing so we're actually feeding him
fresh fish and sure enough they would
actually start to bottom feed which is a
behavior we suspected but we now have
evidence they will do which means they
also feed on benthic species so it's
quite a nice realization there so
benthic animals that live on the bottom
as well as swimming in the mid water so
this is actually a anesthesia that we're
putting inside there because we wanted
to determine how do we care they care
for these animals once they're inside
there if they wound themselves how do we
treat them
they have infections how do we get close
to them without I'm stressing and how
can we sew them together if they get
wounded you know how do we care for the
animal in captivity so we're learning
how to put him under anesthesia and sure
enough we found out that different types
of metals and sodium's will actually put
them under just like general anesthesia
on us so we would actually weigh them I
am I'm always the guy that has to lift
the darn thing up I don't know why so
we're we're weighing them and we're
measuring them and we're taking really
cool samples of blood and we also
actually got to do some dissolved oxygen
testing and here we are hand feeding a
65 pound squid and I just love that so
and once again I wish we had audio
because you can actually hear I'm
crunchy as he's going through the skull
of the of the sardine so and we do a
neurological test a good way to do it is
put them up against the lens of the
camera to make sure that the beak is
working there's a place you don't want
to go and here we are actually releasing
one of our guys that's coming out of
anesthesia successfully and you see we
put the blue tarp on the bottom it was
less annoying to them than the mesh the
net so I always swim them forward out
there because it Ram charges water into
this across the gills and kind of hang
out with them for a while because you've
we've seen that they are cannibals and
in order to have our guys you know not
die from cannibalization I want to make
sure that they're able to fight
themselves one of the ways is there's a
vasovagal nerve right there inside the
the mantle and when you pull on it
they'll flash white and you'll actually
see that I do that test here in just a
second he's really dark right now he's
trying to hide but his arms are coming
together which is a neurological there's
the sale he flashed white right there
and then he looks good so I let him go
but they're so relaxed around us now
that they'll like they'll let you handle
them so now he's not sure if I've
actually let him go so he's gonna hang
out here for a minute and I tickle his
bottom her bottom ventral not and you
know wake him up a little bit and sure
enough they go down so I follow them
down as far as I can and make sure that
they don't need to be
bring them back up and see her arms come
together and if you siphon blows and
she's off
that's kind of an insight to my office
and what I do so but the nice thing is
is that we're actually learning more
about the squid and we're realizing we
don't know anything about the squid
there's so much about them that this
doesn't make any sense when I say that
we're up in warm water right here you
can see that my wetsuit there is only
one mil thick it's very warm up here and
I only wear that wetsuit because there's
a lot of jellyfish that'll sting that
the crap out of you so here we are in
warm water that's highly oxygenated that
can heat stress an animal that lives in
water that's almost arctic cold most of
the time at a thousand plus feet so we
also find out that the water down there
is relatively low oxygen and when we did
dissolved oxygen testing we found out
that the animal needs as much oxygen
pound per pound as a hummingbird
requires a tremendous amount of oxygen
so we actually take the squid put them
inside of a container clamp it up so
there's no interface with the air so
with the oxygen inside the waters all
there is with oxygen sensor inside of it
we actually can watch the cascade of the
oxygen and it's just went through the
floor fast so these animals need a
tremendous amount of oxygen so how in
the world can an animal that lives in
the deep where there's no oxygen or very
low oxygen live like that and then come
up here in the cold warm water where it
should I mean have you ever bought a
goldfish and he's in the bag and you put
them inside the water and you let them
acclimate inside the water because if
you put them right inside there he's
gonna die because it's a degree or two
different this gay animal goes in 45
degree water all the way up to 80 degree
water in a few minutes and they make it
look easy
now let's also give the qualification of
that they're traveling a thousand feet
plus through the water column that's 500
pounds of pressure per square inch
difference and they make it look easy
and the oxygen change is amazing we just
don't know how they met how they do it
so we're wondering maybe there's a
physiological aspect there that that
could benefit us so that's why we keep
researching it we're trying to find out
what is going on with this animal yes
you gotta wonder I mean you know what we
need to do is we need a you know in Star
Trek we need to put them on that table
and totally scan the whole animal figure
out everything from the molecules on up
to the teeth you know and they are I
don't know how they work yeah yeah their
breathing was regular and their
heartbeats were good and everything was
going great and we bring him put him in
fresh water and you know fresh ocean
water and then they they recover quite
well neurological tests check out and we
rereleased them so we don't think
there's any residual effect from it but
it's just fantastic that you know here
you are holding a 100-pound squid or a
50-pound squid this just lay in a lie
you do anything to it you can scope them
do all that kind of stuff and you
doesn't care so check them for cancer so
one of the things that's fascinating
about this animal is that when we're
doing our research in the Sea of Cortez
I'm trying to find out how fisheries are
working you know what's so we
overfishing them or we under fishing if
there is such a thing what's going on
and we determined that we can't find any
evidence that the squid were in the Sea
of Cortez previous to 1920 in fact they
were named Humboldt squid from ela's and
Alexander von Humboldt found them in the
Humboldt Current off of Peru so were
they ever in the Sea of Cortez prior to
that we don't know so the evidence
indicates there were no record landings
we know people were settled there and
they were fishing the shark started to
drop around that time because they were
overfishing the sharks in the Sea of
Cortez which are almost all gone now I
mean there are some sharks there but
according to what was there they're not
so we're finding that the distribution
is kind of fun
the animal is is really quite unique
when it comes to his fecundity and
fecundity is how many babies can this
thing actually make and a shark will
have one to four pups that are viable
every other year every two years perhaps
a tuna five hundred to a hundred
thousand so quite a bit but Humboldt
squid 1 million to 5 million eggs per
female
and so now you start to realize okay
this is a rabbit and the wolves are the
are the tunas and the Sharks and guess
what we've been eating a lot of and so
now we find that now the shark
population is crashed
everybody is them and that crazy shark
cartilage we found doesn't work you know
and how many sharks died for that and
shark fin soup and all this kind of
stuff
the shark populations 400 million sharks
a year are being killed 400 million
that's a lot of sharks that don't
reproduce very quickly and tuna they're
in the you know they only live for about
five years they they breed fairly well
but a Humboldt squid is a million we
think the age lifespan of a Humboldt
squid is only two years that means an
animal that grows that from the size of
a sesame seed at birth when does a pupa
larvae coming out of the egg to growing
to what I've filmed eight feet plus in
two years they'd be the same as a human
baby growing to the same size as a blue
whale in the same amount of time so the
growth rate is just staggering
and there's a million each ok so there's
an interesting math formula for you if
you eat all the tuna you eat all the
Sharks what's going to happen to the
rabbit if we eat all the take out all
the wolves and bears and stuff like that
yeah
the population is going to explode and
that's what we're finding out and more
and more research that I do the more
scared I'm getting so yeah go ahead the
shark cam video so here we are sharks
just or a squeeze just minding your own
business with this squid cam on her back
and then all sudden what do we see
produced but a blue shark and the blue
shark successfully attacks and really
starts to tear into my squid and she was
telling me that there's there's
something attacking the squid so I jump
in the water to go and beat up the shark
right to try to get him off of my my
camera squid but by the time I got on
the water and I was going to start
wrestling the shark mortally wounded was
our squid so the footage that we have is
fantastic illustration on the food chain
that we have sharks that feed on squid
of equal size and so what's going to
happen if all the Sharks are gone
there's a good illustration that hooey
to here now we've also seen sharks being
eaten
by squid that are smaller than the squid
so it's like whoever wins is whoever is
bigger so the problem here is that when
unfortunately one of my camera squid
that didn't live through the experiment
actually gave us a piece of information
that was fantastic and that is almost
every species of shark that's pelagic
will eat the squid so if we take away
all the sharks we have a new
distribution migratory problem here here
we have where they first started we have
off the coast of Peru all the way up to
the tip of Baja Panama right here to the
northern scope of Chile and that's the
best where the Humboldt Current does a
lot of its action and if you notice
that's a pretty broad scope of any
species of animal considering that the
the silky sharks that are in the Sea of
Cortez only if you look at this map they
only occupied that much area right so
the Humboldt squid already had a pretty
significant area when Alexander von
Humboldt found them now well we found
this is right about the time where the
fisheries indicated the orange indicates
where they were starting to fish the
squid and find them basically for the
first time in the 1930s all the way up
to the 1970s now from the 1970s on up
we're finding that the distribution has
increased quite a bit and so now we find
that the distribution of the Humboldt
squid is going all the way down to
Antarctica and he's going all the way up
to Sitka Alaska
now that's a that's a concern right so
it's not just the migrants not just the
expansion of their range but the
population of these animals is the same
all throughout we're finding out there's
a lot of squid in these areas one of my
friends who surfs La Jolla California he
said that after he saw one of my
documentaries he was thinking wow this
squid are pretty neat I'd love to see
one he looks in the water and there's
three foot Humboldt squid going
underneath the surfboard
and he got out of the water because he
saw my shows he saw how I got beat up
and so here we have this new
distribution of this animal and right
here off the coast of Chile the Humboldt
squid successfully wiped out a six
million dollar a year industry of the
hake fishery wiped it out in two years
completely gone from when the squid
first showed up to a complete collapse
of that animal
and so now the Chilean government is
actually growing their own hake
re-releasing him back in the water and
they've shut down that fishery and now
they're fishing squid trying to get the
balance back to where it once was and
what I just found out this year as I
testified in front of Department of Fish
and Game is that up in Northern
California the fishery of salmon just
shut down who here likes salmon guess
what's going away very very quickly it's
an endangered species anyway but we
still fish them that part I can't figure
out and so now they're gone in Northern
California at the same timeframe the
squid just showed up two years ago I
think there's a correlation there
and so one of the concerns that I have
is one of the reasons I'm going up to
Bodega Bay and I'm doing a lot of the
research up there is we're doing stomach
content analysis and we're actually
looking at the centimeter viewing
fishermen that have seen the salmon
hanging out in front of the the rivers
acclimating to freshwater and the squid
will come rotting through there and wipe
out an entire breeding population of
salmon before they ever go upriver to
spam to spawn okay that strikes me in
the bad box right and so the first of
all the squid aren't even supposed to be
there so you see what I mean these squid
will directly affect a lot of people and
that's why I'm studying them so much not
to mention they're really cool don't
even get really big now the population
density of these animals in the Sea of
Cortez is very high but that's what
we're expecting if they're an invasive
species in the Sea of Cortez they
weren't there from pre 1920s what do we
think is going to happen off the coast
of California in five years yeah and who
did this people that eat tuna in people
that eat sharks so really serious
problem anytime you overfished species
something's going to fill it in this
case we have something that's filling
the niche that's a little bit scary
these animals have already probably shut
down the rock fishery just last month
you can see it right here in the coast
of California so now you see what I'm
excited about this animal you know
there's a lot going on with it so
systems it's all about systems yes sir
huge
that's a brilliant question very very
good question his question was is how
can an animal that was you know in the
Humboldt Current adapt to feeding on
animals that encounters in the subarctic
and sub-antarctic and all the regions in
between and that is that the Humboldt
squid is very likely the most
opportunistic predator I've ever seen
potentially the most in the world they
explore everything for food I mean you
saw that jig did that look appetizing to
anybody here I mean that it's a freaking
horrible device from doom with this
little glow stick on it and this little
like a little glow toy you know the
little the vampire teeth it's made out
of the same glow in the dark stuff you
put it up to a light glows in the dark
so they throw this thing down the water
all the squid sees is this
unidentifiable green shape and it grabs
on to it see if they can eat it so
that's how adaptable they are they
explore everything is food including
people they have been they have actually
been found to kill and eat people
so in the Sea of Cortez I've found four
people that lost their lives to the
squid so that's another thing that you
don't hear a lot about you know but it's
it's it's interesting but how many uh
how many squid or think are captured for
every person that's taken so the odds
are in our favor we're still we're still
winning so the next thing is a I've
really loved squid and as you know I put
cameras on squid let them go and what we
did last year is I've been watching who
eats Humboldt squid and one of them of
course is sperm whales but the sperm
whales only eat the very large Humboldt
squid so why in the world would sperm
whales be diving and feeding off the
coast of Loretto where the squid just
aren't that big unless there's something
underneath them that's even bigger and
so what we did is we put a very long
squid or cam on the wing of a squid
there was a relatively small girl in the
same area that I saw the the sperm
whales feeding in anticipation that we'd
find out why the sperm whales were
actually there and this is what we found
here we are at about 900 feet deep and
they're in front of my squid as an
animal whose head is four feet across
and it's not all that great imagery but
what you can see is that the animals are
are from tip to tip which is over 30
feet of visual cone invisibility and all
of her arms weren't clearly seen and so
what that equates to is a 35 to 50 foot
squid where they're not supposed to
exist and one of the things that I found
fascinating is one of the gentlemen that
I understood it under for a brief time
who was studying sperm whales decided to
do in Reverse autotrophic leveling which
is say how much food required in this
area to keep the sperm whale alive look
at down to the calorie and so what he
did is he actually looked all the way
from plankton all the way down to the
the sperm whale then right above it of
course is the squid population and when
you found out this many sperm whales
exist therefore with mortality species
reproduction as well as predation this
is how many giant squid have to exist
does anybody want to make a mad stab at
how many giant squid are probably out
there at least one for every human on
the planet
Giants these are not Humboldt squid
these are giants and so if you actually
think about that they ain't all that
cool I mean I just happened that my
squid just happened to be a snack for a
giant squid and my girl got away right
so we've actually been successful a
couple more times filming giant squid
I'm the only one in the world actually
film a giant squid living in the wild
that's not on a jig because the Japanese
caught went on a jig that's great I've
seen lots of squids on jigs I didn't
impress me I wanted to see him swimming
around in attack mode and the way you do
that is put cameras on their food right
so you put a camera on a sperm whale and
send him on down there what are the odds
of a lion landing a food every attack
one in 20 not very often you know they
make a lot of attempts and they don't
make it what you do is you find the food
that this would want to eat who are very
successful predators and then you're
gonna get your shots so we've actually
done this more than once so and you'll
see more about that in a couple of
months when the next shows come out
we've really hoped that the footage was
worth it
so now you know it well it hasn't
happened yet so we do have a contingency
plan reel up what's left send it back to
the factory put on a new camera yeah
well yeah yeah if people knew what I did
with the stuff that they sponsored me
what they probably would stop sponsoring
yeah yeah yeah I mean so far we've we've
been able to return everything sponsored
to us so I've got a pretty good record
there but it may not be that way forever
so the reason I bring up the Humboldt
squid and the reason that we're we're oh
I'm scared though I'll probably screw
this up okay the reason that we're doing
all of this is I had a very important
man in my life who's basically my
adopted father did a rather amazing
program called the the Challenger
project which was taking a submersible
and going down to the Challenger Deep 27
you know 20 I think it was twenty seven
thousand five hundred feet and so it was
an amazing feat and this man was dr.
Andy reckon sir but his most exciting
project he never got to do and with
other brilliant people around him they
were actually going to circumnavigate
the earth and Anna water glider for
science because as you know the Trieste
the Challenger D project was performed
by the United States Navy to say that we
were there first
it didn't collect a lot of scientific
information but it laid out a
magnificent gauntlet for all of us to
follow the undersea Voyager project
which is a program that I'm is now a
nonprofit corporation was done with a
promise I made to him of the project
that he never got to complete and it's a
very passionate program for me but it
based on this simple question is so what
actually happens next we saw what is
happening with the Humboldt squid well
there's some other very serious issues
that are happening right now so what as
a species as a collective what do we
need to learn to boldly go into the next
decade a decade of great changes we all
know what's going on by just watching
the news
by listening what scientists are saying
so so what are the challenges well one
of them is drug-resistant diseases are
on the rise and in 25 years most read
this twice most common fisheries will
collapse in 25 years that's in our lives
right and in 50 years
all major fisheries really have a severe
impact or be closed
how many third world countries rely on
fish what's going to happen when the
principal food source
slowly dwindles away and they've already
turned to it because the farming's
collapsed any problems there it's a real
serious problem and so what are we
actually going to do about the whole you
know the the theory that's being proved
very correct at the the planets
temperature is on the rise so we find
out that in order to answer these
questions we have to look more into the
ocean so in my opinion the ocean is the
next frontier not just the surface of
the sea where everybody's already seen
it and we can look at it from space and
say that's beautiful surface of the
ocean and not these little tiny areas
that submersibles have gone to the
bottom and they have cruised around a
little bit and seen these magnificent
ecosystems of Hyrule hydrothermal vents
or what a human impact of a shipwreck
will do what I'm talking about is where
all the life is the life barely hangs
out on the bottom and most of the life
on the surface we've seen but the
largest biomass on the planet and the
largest ecosystem in the world is also
the least explored and that's in the
thousand foot range people go down to
the bottom or they toast up behind boats
very little has actually ever actually
been seen about this so that's what this
is all about the undersea Voyager
project is the corporation that I've
started as a non-profit and it's simple
exploration knowledge and discovery it's
the legitimate thing we really are
trying to do what nobody else has ever
done before and so here we have our
squid attacking the sub and I think we
all know what that means so the ship is
going to send this information up to the
schoolhouse it's watching their teacher
and now they have something really
exciting and epic to say and this is
actually the basis of the industry
Voyager project is that I kind of see
myself as a taxi
driver and I'm going to make an
invitation to the world's scientific
community saying hey we got this great
little sub which by the way we already
own and we've got all these wonderful
sponsors putting this telemetry
gathering equipment on the outside of
this sub and so and by the way I know
how to film giant squid already right
I'm the guy who actually did it and I
have something in mind I have a plan to
make my sub look like food so we're
gonna get we're gonna get some pretty
fantastic images I guarantee you that
and then this will be wired directly up
to the surface by way of an umbilical
because our little sub depth has a crush
rating much shallower than the depth of
the oceans we can't allow that sub to go
across these great chasms untethered
that tether slows us down but what it
does is it gives us a wonderful
opportunity to send up information
real-time to the rest of the world and
so we all know as ships can tell you
know with communication systems that can
fit on a ship we can talk to anybody we
can send up masses amounts of
information to the satellite which can
beam it down to whoever can disseminate
that so it's a very exciting prospect so
this is one of our subs actually how we
do this well the goal is to travel
27,000 miles around the earth guys you
can't go 24,000 miles around the earth
because there's land in the way so we
have to zigzag here and there but we're
gonna go at a record depth of a thousand
feet deep which is that giant biomass
that giant ecosystem that I was telling
you about that's largely unexplored and
we're going to perform scientific
transects an alliance with the
international scientific community
political community and educational
institutions that every level can you
imagine seeing a senator inside of this
sub
addressing Congress saying hey guys look
what I'm looking at right here I mean
that's that's exciting or a
schoolteacher talking to her class in
Kenya I just came back from Africa
talking to people about this they love
this idea I already have South African
people interested in helping out there
as well as paving the way politically to
get around in other countries in Africa
so the people the idea is that if I put
a teacher and that's why this is a
three-man sub one pilot two so we have
two observers scientist and a
schoolteacher or a senator or a wealthy
individual or
think'll guru people that have something
to say to an audience that needs to
listen and I like the idea of the
teacher saying hey guess what we just
happen to have a thousand pound squid
hanging off the starboard side if you
look at it you can see the beak chomping
on the camera so it's kind of an
exciting prospect but you also see the
size of our little subs in fact is that
the subs are a wonderful platform in
which to put scientific collection
instruments and on my board of directors
of course I have people that are smarter
than me people that are actually
scientists that are working on the Mars
projects for from Jet Propulsion
laboratories and the senior scientist at
JPL and NASA who's looking for life on
other planets those are my two
vice-presidents and they know how to
talk to the scientific community and
we're inviting everybody that has an
idea on collecting water toxicology or
doing the world's longest plankton tow
or whatever type of instrument data
collection system they can put on the
outside of the sub are invited to let us
know what they want to do we'll help
them work out a grant we'll negotiate it
ahead of time and we'll make it happen
and if they can't find money come and
talk to me anyway because the idea may
be so awesome we've just got to find a
way to do it the idea is to make this
submersible and whatever mapping system
it can do below or whatever information
that I can gather disseminate it to the
entire world real time through the
umbilical to the sub this is a this is a
human kind project it's not Scott's
project it's it's a gift in a sense to
the rest of the world and you can see
the visibility inside of the machines
are pretty fantastic aren't they I have
800 dives in these types of subs
actually Coast Guard rated captain of
three different vessels and this by far
is my favorite and I'm probably going to
Greece in a couple of days to fly this
sub so it's it's a magnificent machine
our transects well first of all we got
to start slow and we're gonna do a lot
of things here local and the Tahoe of
course is the Lake Tahoe undersea voyage
so we get to do some work right here in
California the move is the maiden
undersea voyage where I've already I
already hold the world record for the
longest dive of an underwater glider
where we launched from San Pedro and I
flew the sub all the way to Catalina
Island and back on one dive with the
glider system with no power I don't know
if you guys heard about that but I
the guy who did it and those a long cold
dive I was actually a diver and I had to
saturate desaturate and chambers for
hours hours after that coffee never
tasted so good in my life coming out of
that and the so cub is the Sea of Cortez
undersea voyage which I'm actually going
to do a 500-mile transect and the Sea of
Cortez looking at the shark populations
looking for long left wrist nets water
quality sampling maybe a couple of giant
squid here and there you know and then
after we prove everything we're going to
the Gulf of Mexico the Gulf of Mexico
undersea voyage and as you guys may have
heard there's some massive dead zones
inside the the Gulf of Mexico that we
don't actually know exactly why they're
there we know that it's based on
nitrates that there's a new plankton
that absorbs all the oxygen and kills
everything there but we actually want to
do a giant transect and we got some
folks from Texas that are very
interested in jumping in on that and
once we're all done with that one then
we probably worked all the bugs out now
it's time to go around the world but
these are some of the wonderful animals
that I know these people that are
working on one of my particular pet
favorites is the silicon where we've
been working in Africa and the vaquita
porpoise which is almost is probably the
most endangered mammal in the world and
very people even though it exists and
it's in the Sea of Cortez and the reason
it's in bad shape is because of the the
Hoover Dam and that's be giving all the
power to the Las Vegas we found out that
not only do the animals still exist but
they're being poached so actually we've
been hunting the poachers part-time and
filming them and kind of helping out the
Mexican government do that stuff too so
so glad somebody asked that question the
Hoover Dam is innocently damming up the
water that went through the Colorado
River and emptied into the Sea of Cortez
and it just so happens that the
freshwater brackish water interface
allowed the vaquita to feed on the
animals that were feeding on the shrimp
that have now gone extinct and so now
the vaquita dolphin or purpose their
food supply has been shut down and now
the salinity levels brought up and they
have a hard time existing in very high
salinity levels and so they're only a
meter long at full length they're tiny
beautiful Oh harbour porpoise and
there's only 400
excuse me god bless you there's only 400
of them left and so I'm actually helping
the Mexican government try to track them
and there it's a needle in a haystack a
small animal and dark green water it's
really hard to find but we've had some
luck this is the oarfish as you guys
have seen that's a rather magnificent
fish that's estimated length of over 60
feet at full length so that's the only
picture of a live one under water that
actually didn't die all the other
pictures are ones that are in the
process of dying so so all of these
animals but also other ones that we
haven't even explored yet imagine we've
only seen two percent two percent of the
ocean ninety-eight percent of the ocean
has not even been seen by us and we've
already depleted a lot of fish species
and and interrupted ecosystems that we
don't even understand yet so what do you
think the odds are of taking a submarine
and a thousand feet deep and going
27,000 miles over a period of five years
and not seeing undiscovered species
pretty low so the odds of us finding new
stuff is exciting so that's why I have
signed up so Masai Makai tooth is an
ARCA two--this well we've seen him on a
jig see the big old jig right there and
you see this wonderful arca - 'this that
died and then of course we've also seen
the gaffed
this is the Masonic eye tooth as that
was count in the Rossi and is now being
a custodian by my friend Steve Steve
O'Shea and in Auckland and he's actually
doing the autopsy on this thing as we
speak and you see the gaff right there
in the head what do these things animal
what do they look like in the ocean yeah
yeah this is the giant squid and this is
the colossal squid this is bigger than
this and this was a 900 sure that's a
big grid now the neat thing is is that
you look at the size of the wings on
this guy and they're they're fanning
through so you don't actually see the
whole size of the wings now you see that
the wings on this animal are one-third
the rest of the body maybe a little more
than that right I'm both squid same size
ratio Humboldt squid a hunt drag grapple
predator and I think the Masonic eye
tooth this is as well
this guy's an ambush predator tiny
little wings muscular arms really long
tentacles right like the one I filmed in
the sea Cortez and you see how it was
opened up when my little squid came into
the area with the lights on it
the tiny lights on that camera were
enough to scare away a 1500 pound animal
who freaked him out not gonna attack
this squid that's the reason I got the
image in my camera survived the event
it's because that little light probably
scared away this animal that's how
that's how timid the giant squid is this
guy probably feeds on whales as well as
everything down the food chain so this
is the animal that I want to see face to
face so the bottom line is is that we've
seen these animals dead dying and on
jigs except for the footage that my team
and I successfully got on their little
critter cam and you see it's not that
vivid so well we're excited about now is
the future there's one of the ideas that
I have of our nice little specially
built sub that is already in design and
already in construction so this is the
undersea Voyager project here continuing
five-year mission to seek out new life
and knowledge and go where no person has
gone before I started to write that down
in my business statement my mission
statement I was like god this sounds
familiar sounds like yeah it sounds
familiar because I was like oh I've
really got to change that but it's the
truth isn't it it is the truth and
that's what's exciting about it we
really are living in an age where
pioneers and explorers can be at the
front runner of science again and it's
simply because we have the technology
and I think now we have the will to do
it because a lot of people realize that
there's so much unknown about the planet
that we have to learn it in order to our
species to move into the next peaceful
decade because if we don't learn it
what's going to happen in 50 years if
all the fish actually do dry up and it's
not me they came up with those numbers
it was an impartial group of biologists
that were studying the history of
fishers the fisheries and the projection
of the future they weren't trying to
scare anybody but what they found is
frightening and we can change all that
and the undersea Voyager project is a
part of it and
the reason I say why is because mankind
has this problem of not protecting what
he doesn't know about so the more we
know the more will protect and by the
way the more we realize that there's a
problem we are an industrious brilliant
species that comes up with solutions
every time so we can pull out of this
dive by the way this was off of Costa
Rica on its way down to a 1500 foot dive
where it filmed a sixgill shark over
2,000 pounds we didn't even know where
that bag so this was a great day so any
questions yes sir but but why you're why
you're walking up there so I get to look
at your eye to eye because you're
standing up can you guys imagine having
a sensor on the belly of the sub that
makes an accurate map rendition of the
bottom for 27,000 miles of undiscovered
ocean linked up real-time for the world
to see I don't know if that would
interest you guys or not but it sure
gets me all thrilled yes sir so the
undersea Voyager project is gonna have
two technicians and then one sort of
third party watching the watching the
action beat a schoolteacher or senator
are there plans to have like normal
people be a part of it as well
yeah I'm not asking for myself but from
a real economic perspective it's like
Joe consumer that drives the market
demand for things like salmon and has
the habits and behaviors that have an
impact on sustainability so if like
seeing a senator or like a rock star at
the bottom of the sub is something that
your average consumer is used to seeing
they don't really care about the impact
in terms of their own lifestyle choices
if they don't actually have an
experience of what the impact of their
choices are that's a brilliant question
I appreciate that and the fact is is
that I am that regular guy I'm not a
rock star and I'm not a politician
my education is in medicine I decided to
go to the ocean because I see the value
in the need I think that anybody can sit
inside that left seat and I'm going to
open that up as to as many peaceful
people
possible but just let me qualify what
that means is that we're going to be out
on a ship away from everybody so that
means you can have to stay on the ship
until we get to port or we have a
high-speed boat courier back and forth
so for the average person to spend a
month at sea to get that one dive may be
difficult but absolutely not impossible
this program the undersea Voyager
project is open to everybody every
scientist around the world every
educational institution around the world
and every regular person around the
world that wants to be a part of it can
and I think that's part of the beauty of
it yes sir cool yes speaking as a
carnivore how do those taste you know I
mentioned they're fishing them now as
well yeah I mean yeah they are very
popular and the fact is a lot of folks
do eat them the biggest population and
group that that get them exported from
Mexico is Korea and Japan they really
love them how they taste I have a I have
a pact with them I won't eat them if
they don't eat me so but having said
that the last documentary that we just
did that's going to air in the Socktober
he did eat him and he gave me a nice
thorough description he said that
they're very tasty and they they
actually they themselves don't have a
taste but they absorb all the wonderful
spices and stuff so it's kind of like
living tofu so carries the flavor of how
you cook it so that's all I know that's
all I know
but they do make a calamari ring the
size of a chuck tire so small truck so
any other questions
so I'm an engineers can you talk a
little bit about the sub and and why a
glider and oh yeah that's gonna work oh
I love it well this isn't going to be a
glider I I did a I did a test I
originally invented an underwater glider
which was ballast driven so that I could
film whales diving and over long
distances so I wanted a sub that you
could ballast all the air out of it drop
it into a dive and as long as you're
able to clear yours you can drop and
film sideways as the whales are diving
and I wanted to actually film sperm
whales preying on giant Humboldt squid I
wanted to get as much of it as I
physically could because I couldn't
think of an automated system to do that
so I thought well I'll do it and while I
was doing that I decided to test it and
so I just went ahead and flew it all the
way to Catalina and back and basically
did I think it was fifty seven miles and
made a world record and raised a lot of
money for kids with heart disease while
I was at it but this particular machine
is built here in Claremont California
and it's called triumph and it's it's
the second generation of what the
undersea Voyager project has the current
sub that we have that we own is is a
two-man sub it's quite a bit smaller
than that in fact the two people inside
of there really gotta like each other
because you're basically sitting on that
person's back not literally but that's
how close it is they're right between
your legs with the port there and you're
sitting in a port here and the dives
aren't going to be any longer than the
person's can tolerate these this sub
right here we're making dives five six
hours ten hours at a time and it's
really quite comfortable the thing is is
that if you have mixed company the whole
bladder control thing comes in and so
you do have to actually surface the sub
everyday which means the sub is going to
have differential GPS linked up to a
real-time and the sonar acquisition is
going to spot the sub precisely at the
end of the dive if we recover arrest the
sub get everybody out refresh the sub
let the crew rest change out people
change out instruments put the sub back
in the water after the Refresh is done
and GPS aligned where it let off so that
we can pick it right back up as close as
physically as humanly possible so
now you're getting power down the
umbilical rites all yeah she has 20
hours of power on her for thruster
control in 72 hours of life-support and
that's a Coast Guard requirement which
Coast Guard captain of that ship of that
boat but yes we will have power coming
down the umbilical as well because if we
can charge this up and get all the
information from the sub and power to
the sub
let's leave the batteries for if we need
them and need to detach away from the
cable for any reason like entanglement
which is being designed in engineering
wise this thing is gonna be a lot of fun
and by the way did you guys notice
anything you got the two pontoons right
here all right and you got this big
living quarters right here if you take
it and flip it upside down does it look
like the old enterprise so by the way
our uniforms Seawolves is a company that
I actually originally designed up it's a
filming crew and counterterrorism
operation Harvard that's one of my old
jobs but undersea Voyager project you
see this little red dot right there
that stands for engineering right and
the gold dot is command and control and
a blue dot is medicine and science
anybody so whoever is wearing the red
dot might die
so but undersea Voyager project and of
course my favorite logo of all so we
actually have serious designs in place
to make that a reality and I just can't
wait to be flying this up that day so
I'll imagine this when the sub actually
is attacked by a squid your giant squid
it's gonna drag away something with it
its own little critter cam and data
collection pod it's gonna self inject
pulled oil got that on them
got that being designed up to its Lai
this love what I'm doing this is awesome
stuff thing is it's open to everybody
any other questions yes sir
oh god put a really cool transducer
system underneath it so that we can map
the bottom and then support everything
with it
let us put the name inside the sub
there's going to be a whole series of
documentaries on this it's going to
literally be a series for the New Age
and we are working very hard at
developing and protecting the whole
iconic image of the undersea Voyager
project so it is a mankind exploration
to go where no man has gone before and
the documentaries that are given made
off of that are literally going to be
quite epic I mean we really are
legitimate honest to God never before
been there explorers and yeah we've been
to a thousand feet hundreds of times in
submarines I probably know all the
pilots that have been there this the
submersible pilot community is really
quite small I know the Russian guys I
know the Canadian guys I know the Alvin
pilot I mean I know these guys and they
all say the same thing I do if we could
just stayed a thousand feet and go
instead of dropping down to the bottom
like a helicopter and looking over the
small area and then coming straight back
up through where all the life is we
could learn so much that's exactly what
this whole program is about
so how Google can help any way you guys
can think of is open to invitation this
is a taxicab put anything on the outside
of it you want that's going to benefit
mankind and I'll listen very carefully
hey that's a good question any others
come on another squid question oh it was
five hours in desaturation and a chamber
which was on the boat yeah yeah I had a
vote over me the whole time from coastal
diving and which were some friends of
mine that supported the whole record and
here you are now you're in the water for
10 hours freezing to death there's the
first thing think about that so and what
I my friend who was a nurse says we'll
look for for getting your energy and
keeping it you need to have Pedialyte so
I had a Camelback system plumbed into my
helmet so I was actually sipping on
Pedialyte 20 minutes into the dive I had
a reaction to that stuff and I was sick
Pedialyte I mean what kind of an idiot
would tell you to drink Pedialyte that's
for kids or injured people and I'm
so I had this horrible Gerke icky
feeling the whole dive so when I got out
I was trembling I was tired I could
barely move and I only had three minutes
to get into the chamber or my blood was
gonna physico Cocola and I was gonna die
a horrible grisly death yeah so
basically from 40 feet to the surface 30
feet per minute get out of the get out
of the sub get out of two dry suits get
out of a helmet cam system take all this
other life-support system off that I had
and crawl inside there in three minutes
it was awesome it looked like it looked
like an Indy car pit stop yeah
4050 feet but I went all the way a
hundred feet and all the way up to 20
feet so I was I was constantly fizzing
my blood so I felt things that I
shouldn't ever feel I felt a cheese and
stuff the things that I do you think I'm
gonna write that down you're crazy
I'll get in trouble nobody'd ever insure
me if they knew what I really did
anything
yeah they they can they can swim forward
as fast as they can
backwards and I actually have some
wonderful footage I wish I had more time
I'd love to give you guys a whole squid
school you know but there hyponym there
funnel which is right underneath the
chin I don't really have a chin but
comes out here they exhale by forcefully
expiring and increasing the pressure
inside the mantle and they have this
seal around the head that opens up and
flaps against it so that the water has
to go out through this funnel and the
massively strong muscles 11 times
stronger than mammal muscles are very
strong muscles and as they're doing this
they're forcing out this water like a
fire hose out through the hyponym and
the it's muscular so it can take this
hyponym and totally duct it down so it
goes along their belly out their tail
and just shoot them forward as fast as
they can backwards the only thing is
they can only do that for a short period
time because as they're swimming forward
if you anybody ever been waterskiing and
then hit the water really fast you know
if they're swimming forward very fast
the water was going
fill up the mantle and then they won't
be able to get more water inside see
what I mean
so because it's just flooded with the
pressure change so they won't be able to
breathe very long and they need a lot of
oxygen so they can swim fast very
rapidly they just can't sustain it but
I've seen them just just come
lackadaisical around me and then WHAM
just like just fly out of here you just
you never underestimate adults could
ever be a bad day so anything else
good questions yes ma'am I don't think
so but that's one of the things that I
actually want to start looking at I want
to have a hydrophone that can collect
data on a myriad of frequencies that I
can find out if they make sound or if
they hear sound that's been very
interesting to me but no they the chitin
is ring teeth and the beak are are hard
and so when they're actually grabbing on
to something they dig their their hooks
into it and as they pull away they tear
it apart and it actually sounds like
velcro being ripped apart underwater
it's really quite graphic they tear
things apart I've seen a six-foot squid
grab onto a 4-foot squid and just
totally take its back off like that and
then the sound isn't really graphic I
mean its own animals being killed so it
is but also when they grab onto my
camera all these green teeth it's like
dog toenails on a tile floor you know
pretty impressive sound actually I'm
like oh I'm glad that wasn't me yeah
take the camera you know I have
scratches all over my old cameras now I
got anodized aluminum is a scratch is
easy but the old car paint on the on the
old resin housings see all these little
grooves all over from all this quit
attacks it's pretty fun stuff any others
yes sir yeah
that's that's an amazing question and
they have a rather fantastic system to
give you a good answer when they bite on
they their mouth starts at the arms when
they grab on that actually becomes an
extension of the the degradation system
so they grab on to you with these these
massive arms and then they can take that
beak and move it all over the place it's
completely I wouldn't I mean I don't
know what you'd call it but it's it's
completely mobile it can change all the
different directions so it takes a bite
and it can incise the bite just like a
two pair of trauma shears intersecting
and it cuts very effectively can cut
through a bone
remind you it's polysaccharide it's not
more certain not much different than the
nail right here not the same material
but very similar flexibility but because
of that it condenses and moves around
it's flexible and shaves out the least
path the resistance Leath resistance
path and can shave off go right through
to no skull anybody ever seen a tuna
skull it's just like this so he just
chomp right through it and then the
radula that gold crown tongue grabs onto
it and peristalsis only moves it right
into the crop where it holds on and then
it takes another bite so it can take a
bite every three seconds and six foot
squid takes a bite the size of a man's
fist
about an orange so an orange sized bite
every three seconds and so the radula
deposits into the crop and as soon as
there's enough like three bite sizes
right there that the pyloric sphincter
opens up gastric sphincter clamps up and
it perished all so he moves it right
into the gut which is extremely acidic
and breaks it down fast it starts to
break down food right away to
independent of stress because I'll tell
you why I say that I'm filming a whole
bunch of squid all around me and they
explode out of you and I see a pilot
whale coming up through there and it
sees me and in Corral's away and all the
squid are going by me fleeing their
predator right because pilot squid eat
Humboldt squid well while this one squid
was fleeing up here getting away from
the pilot whale he sees this lone
sardine turns grabs it and continues to
run
now how many gazelle would try to eat
grass
when the Lions trying to chase them down
I mean that's an amazing ability eat
while under stress so I think that there
everything works no matter what their
stress level they're always looking
evade predators eat or sometimes the
same parallel but their their ability to
eat is staggering they're always hungry
they're always hungry so yeah I've seen
him do some amazing things I've actually
filmed them eating krill clouds of krill
that were so thick that you couldn't I
couldn't see my fingertips at all the
camera is literally a blanket of life of
little krill bodies against the lens and
I would swim way and as I was swimming
way to let the krill get away so I could
find an open cloud you can see this big
Humboldt squid just ghostly white shapes
going through the cloud and grabbing the
krill like a Balian feeding whale and
just like eat him like Raisinets they're
like chomp chomp chomp and then they go
around they'd swim and grab some more
it's very ballet very beautiful and I've
also seen them eat animals bigger than
themselves so we had a thresher shark on
a hook and a jump on the water to film
the thresher shark because they're rare
animals and yeah it's on a hook but I
want to get some footage of it and we
released it anyway and as I'm filming it
this thresher shark are this Humboldt
squid five foot humbles this is a
14-foot shark and this five-foot squid
comes out of nowhere out of the bottom
grabs onto the animal right in front of
the gills takes a orange sized bite out
of it and takes off and first of all
this was a female thresher shark anybody
know about female head skin thickness
it's three times thicker than a male
because the males bite onto the females
to grab them and lock them in place
while they may and this squid bit
through it like it was no problem
that was that was skin that thick so
yeah the only animals bigger than
themselves like I said they're very
opportunistic predators so and so what
are we have in California bunch of squid
hanging out underneath surfers
something's cool is gonna happen soon hi
I I was actually interviewed a guy for
the last show I did with the Discovery
Channel I found a guy in Long Beach
California who was attacked by Humboldt
squid spearfishing around those oil rigs
he just had to fight him off and crawl
back to the boat and give him this food
you know as fish they shot
thereÃ­re sounds like some horror movie
isn't it so anything else yes ma'am
there's one airing right now I was
filming I was trying to find giant
octopus which have some ideas on where
they're hanging out but they sent me to
the places they could afford the wrong
places so it's on monster quest is
called giant octopus and it's airing
right now and I haven't seen it yet but
I hear it's kind of fun because me my
buddy had a good time knowing we're
gonna find giant octopus we just got
giant octopus not colossal octopus so
that was great fun so it's airing right
now in the History Channel I have 11
other documentaries that are out if you
oh my god I've always said this before
it I've never had it with such gravity
but if you google my name you'll
actually see all the stuff that I've
done I've never said it that's so cool
I'm saying it to Google that is fun
anything else well if you guys are going
to have another giant squid lecture or
more sub stuff you know where I'm at and
we weren't happy to come out and talk to
you guys about it
the subs going in the water on October
30th and that's our that's our
christening ceremony and we're doing a
whole bunch of stuff in November see
trialing the sub and including the lake
tahoe transect we'll probably be done
shortly after that so if you guys are
interested you know I'll be happy to
give you guys report back under sea
voyage or.org is our website under sea
voyage Oregon because I'm nonprofit so I
can claim work right huh oh so anything
else guys thank you very much for having
me I appreciate</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
