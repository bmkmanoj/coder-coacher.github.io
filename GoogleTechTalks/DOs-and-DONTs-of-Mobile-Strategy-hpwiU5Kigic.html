Google on web performance stuff and last
year i started this speaker series
called web exponents and it's been a
while since we had a speaker but Jason
was coming to town and I got wind of
that and I saw him speak at web 20 Expo
I don't know what maybe four months ago
and there were so many takeaways from
his talk a week doesn't go by that I
don't share two or three of those
anecdotes and so it was really memorable
to me and I and of course mobile is huge
so since he was in town I wanted to make
sure he had a chance to come by and and
share his expertise with Googlers and
then we'll get this on youtube and share
it with the rest of the world to solo
background on Jason he's co-founder of
cloud for a development consulting firm
out of portland mostly doing mobile
stuff he's worked on some big mobile
projects like Obama's iPhone app and I
first met Jason when he came and spoke
at the inaugural velocity conference
velocity 2008 I don't know if you
remember that up at the san francisco
airport marriott up there so it was
great having you there and it's great
having you here today oh and i have the
obligatory google Tech Talk goody bag
that I'll present to you and then I'll
take that back so you don't have to deal
with it I'll hold it for you during your
talk so please help me welcome Jason
Griggs be
thank you Steve what's in the bag is
there something really good is that why
you want it you should let your like
taking it away you've got another one
he's got a dummy bag so it can switch
stuff so thank you all can can everybody
hear me okay I can't tell foam in the
mic okay excellent so it's a little it's
a little daunting actually coming to the
place that develops Android to talk
about mobile I mean what in the hell am
I going to talk to you guys about right
so I I was thinking about that and and I
really i think that the perspective that
i have is a little different than
probably this perspective of even the
people who are working on android every
day and it's it's a perspective of
talking to businesses that are trying to
figure out how they're going to use
mobile technology and and not just not
just larger companies that are perhaps
making major plays in this area but also
small companies and medium-sized
businesses and the the reason that i
started thinking about this topic and
sort of framing this discussion actually
came from a post by john battelle and
john patel wrote this article he talked
about how he said you know give me a
mobile strategy or you're fired and the
fact that there are so many companies
that are trying to figure out how and
what their mobile strategy should be and
and i realize that this is a really
pressing question and for those who
aren't thinking about it they people
sort of jump to really erroneous
conclusions come up with strategies that
aren't aren't the best and the best
evidence i have of it is that i keep
getting email from from this guy and i'm
not i'm not talking specifically about
the Geico caveman but i'm talking about
this sort of mentality i mean i'm
assuming that these people are
incredibly intelligent people but the
emails that I get are are worded very
poorly they're very excited they're in
all caps and and they really exhibit
sort of a lack of perhaps grammar
education so I but I can understand
where it comes from and where it comes
from is this is the fact that people get
really excited about the fact that
mobile is disruptive technology and I
use the word disruptive technology
specifically because that's the way that
Morgan Stanley described it in december
of last year morgan stanley published
twelve hundred different 1,200 pages of
information related to mobile market
what's happening in that space
everything from you know the fact that
the things people really do know
although probably not to the degree that
they think that they know it so
everybody knows that Mobile is growing
quickly but what a lot of people don't
realize is that it's growing more
quickly than the early days of the
internet that iphone adoption actually
outpaces the growth of the early days
iphone adoption alone outpaces the early
days of the internet and it's not just
the iphone it's actually other browsers
as well so Opera Mini which is
particularly targeted just for a lot of
feature phones has seen two hundred
percent growth year over year and I had
a slide like this last year that I was
talking about and when I went to pull
this slide and replace it I realized
that the previous year had been two
hundred percent year-over-year growth as
well so they've just seen this you know
the hockey stick as well why this
matters and i think this matters
particularly for google is what Morgan
Stanley points out is that with each one
of these technology cycles each one of
these these revolutions and technology
that the winners of each revolution is
different and I think for Google you
know it should it should be worrisome
that they're listed as one of the
winners in the previous round right like
I think that Google is well-positioned
when it comes to mobile but it's
something to be aware of and something
to keep in mind as as we move forward
and and start thinking about what it
means from a mobile perspective it also
is true that that in each one of these
technology cycles that there's a massive
amount of creation of wealth and
destruction of wealth as we saw because
the winners change from generation to
generation also the market
capitalization is much higher the
companies that don't adapt to the next
round don't do nearly as well and each
round is something like ten times bigger
than the previous round so we're looking
at something like 10 billion mobile
devices when we get to the end of the
mobile revolution which isn't really
that hard to to think of when we talk
about the fact that there's five billion
devices on the planet right now so of
course what people do what businesses do
what I see all the time is they see this
information they decide to put together
a plan
so they're going to get an iphone app
and maybe an ipad app and then they're
going to like integrate some social
networking of some sort they're going to
put it on the app store and then of
course people are going to come and
they're going to make lots of money and
maybe you know if they're they're young
they might decide that they're going to
attract you know beautiful women and
that prompts them to get really really
excited and then they send me an email
that's me need iphone app right and this
is the email these are the emails that I
get all the time and and there's not
there's I just give you an example of
this so I got an email from an agency
I'm from Portland Oregon it was a local
portland agency they said I've got a
client that wants to have an iphone app
and an Android app they need to have it
in the app store in them and in the
android marketplace by mid-september
this was mid-august they don't really
care what it is do you have anything do
you have anything already that they
could just put their their name on and
put it in the app store and and I'm
looking like like how does this make
sense like this doesn't make sense at
all and but across the industry i see a
lot of examples of businesses just just
flailing about when it comes to mobile
trying to figure out what makes sense
and the thing is is that we've actually
we've been here before so in the early
days of the internet we didn't really
know what was going to work there either
and we had sites like this and it took
us a long time it wasn't pretty but at
some point we actually got to the point
where we had examples of what it meant
to do a particular type of site well
whether in this case its e-commerce
right and what amazon has shown we're
looking for those examples when it comes
to mobile and i think that there they
are far and few between there are very
few companies that are across the board
really integrating mobile into their
strategy and figuring out how to do it
well so I've I've collected a series of
things five don'ts and five dues related
to what I've been talking to companies
about as they're putting together the
mobile strategies so the first one is
really a simple one which is to not
assume that people have downloaded their
app so in the best example for of this
for me is that Chanel calm had an app
that was out in august of two thousand
eight which is like less than two months
after the app store was launched and
it's actually it's a really nice app
fashion industry for some reason really
gets into creating apps i don't i don't
quite understand why but they do and
they've got a really great app
unfortunately if you were in say New
York and you wanted to to do some
shopping for some Chanel products and
you didn't know that this app existed if
you did a google search and tried to
find information about Chanel locations
you would end up at chanel's website
which looked like this one big flash
image there's not a single thing on it
that you can access on a mobile device
so if you didn't happen to catch the
news in august of 2008 saying that there
was an app that they had released or you
happen to think to go search for this
app there's no way to find out
information about this app now i put
together these i put together these
screenshots like a year ago or so and i
found out recently that Chanel had
redesigned their website and so I was
really afraid that I'd have to take
these slides out because they they've
revamped it but fortunately it still
sucks and so we can look at it and we
can see that we've got text that you
can't read on a mobile device if you
actually go down in the bottom left and
managed to figure out what you need to
do in in order to find store locations
you get to the store locator thing and
then in the right hand screen you can
see there's actually a web form that you
can barely make out and that it's really
hard and finally you might actually find
a location which brings us to this idea
it's in this first one as well but not
to rely on flash because I know that you
know we've got some mobile devices now
coming out from Android that are
supporting flash but it's it's a
minority of the market even within
smartphones as a minority and if you go
past smartphones it's it's a vast
minority of the market and this seems
like an obvious thing but even companies
like that create iphone or ipad only
games so plant plants vs zombie is a
very popular game particularly when the
ipad came out i was at a conference
people were talking about how wonderful
this app was so i decided that i wanted
to find out more about it I happened on
my phone with me so I searched for it
and the first thing I get was something
that didn't even look like I was on the
right page but then I noticed the title
said you know plants vs zombies only all
right this is the right page closed it
scroll down on the page to find the
video and then I ended up
here which is not at all something that
I can do so you know for even a company
that's making the majority of its
profits off of people using iOS devices
is making the mistake of having flash
based video on their homepage right so
it seems really simple but something
that needs to be needs or that needs to
be repeated the third don't is done like
finding your store hours and locations
hard to find don't make it difficult and
so in order to look at this we're going
to look at probably the worst site on
mobile devices and that's that's apple
site so you know here's this great
mobile company but their own site is
really horrible on a mobile device so if
you try to find their store hours and
which I was trying to do one time you
have to get way down on the bottom
there's a little tiny link and you might
find that link and then you go to this
page and then you have to zoom in in the
upper right and then you get to this
place where it's like find your store
then it takes you to a map okay great i
got a map now i'm going to zoom in okay
great pioneer place that's where i want
to go so i sort of tap on that area and
then it it opens google maps it's like
okay that's that's a little strange but
maybe Google Maps has a store hours so
all right let's just route that location
so comes I can tells me I'm 112 miles
from the apple store now our office is
in downtown Portland right across the
river from pioneer place I mean
essentially I could walk to this
location and it's it's come back with
112 miles from where it is so I'm like
okay what's gone wrong well I look in
here I find out that somehow the address
got translated into Madras Oregon
between the interactions on that webpage
and Google Maps and i'm not sure where
it broke down but i'm assuming that a
lot of you don't know mattress oregon
it's a small town about 6,000 people
central oregon most famous for being the
home of a river phoenix and Jacoby
Ellsbury who is a professional baseball
player not though the location of an
apple store so so i go back to the app
to the maps and i try to find it again
I'm like okay look like there's this
little thing over there that I'm
supposed to click on that's got a
description of the hours and I can sort
of see this so I try to zoom in and
I end up in the ocean I don't really
know I'm apparently really bad at pinch
and zoom I go back again I see it i zoom
in and I'm so close you see that right
like on the right hand screen hours and
information it's right there I just I
tap on it tap on a tap on it and I can't
get it so finally I give up I go back to
Google Maps I do a search for apple
store I find the information and there's
this thing that I didn't know my phone
could do which is that it's got voice
actually and I can make phone calls so I
made a phone call and found the hours so
the lesson here for me is like apples
get a great deal of good information
particularly in their guidelines but do
as I say not as they do because they're
not a very good example of compelling
mobile experiences and I know now that
they've got their own app where you can
you can find out store hours and make
reservations at the Genius Bar and stuff
like that but again you have to know
that that app exists and you have to
download that app okay simple to you
does not mean dumb so by this I mean
don't skip core functionality assume
that assume that a certain set of your
of your users are actually going to be
on mobile devices as their primary
device interacting with your service so
why is it that none of the RSS readers
allow you to actually add an RSS feed
while you're on a mobile device I can
consume all the RSS I want but I can't
actually add an RSS feed just drives me
crazy and you might think that it's
because a screen size but then you get
actually and you move to the ipad apps
and they've got the same issue right and
i think that this is this is indicative
of sort of following this this idea of
simplicity that Apple puts forward to a
little bit of an extreme so you can't
subscribe to podcasts in itunes on a
mobile device and I and and you know my
friend Aaron actually he said I'm
plugging in my mobile device to sync
with a cable either because it's the
1990s or it's an Apple device right like
and and this is absolutely true for
anyone who's on who's got an ipad you
you know that you're out of the box
experience looks something like that it
will come back to that in a second
oh that was weird strange noise okay so
um this is because apples been working
off of a digital hub strategy that it's
had since 2001 right this is steve jobs
keynote 2001 january he was talking
about this digital hub strategy and
actually you don't have to all you have
to do is replace the the devices and
you've got the same strategy same sort
of thing i love these these images i
didn't actually create these images
somebody else did but i love that not
only have the devices changed but the
person who made the image actually made
steve skinnier you can see there which
is a great easter egg like i did this
presentation three times before i notice
that that was the case so we've got this
digital habs hub strategy and it just
sucks right if you've got for anyone
who's bought an ipad and spent the first
40 minutes waiting for that device to
sync looking at this screen before they
could do anything they know what that's
like there was a there was a group that
decided to live video blog their their
reception of an ipad and opening the
unboxing and so they you know they
videotape it and they unbox it and then
they hook up the cables and like okay so
yeah oh man it's beautiful as beautiful
and then they hook up the cables oh
great so okay we gotta sync it alright
so here we go alright it's sinking man
it looks good doesn't it sinking
and what's it doing it tom oh it's still
syncing right i mean like it's just it's
sort of ridiculous this is actually one
thing that I think do Google is doing
much better is this idea of being able
to you know move with these devices and
actually understand that the context
that a person's primary context is often
going to be on a mobile device and being
able to have access to that information
and as long as we're talking about
things that are sort of stupid just
because you can do something doesn't
mean that you should so there's um
there's this JC Penney's app where you
can shake the app to get a random gift
and and I keep telling people I'm like I
you know I can pretty much speak for the
male population on this one we don't
need any help finding bad gifts for
other people like it's just unnecessary
right so I'm so this this just doesn't
do any good right I can I I do a
terribly terribly good job of purchasing
bad gifts for other people without
assistance the fifth one is don't forget
that the UN you know in url means
universal and since I'm in front of a
bunch of geeks i'm pretty sure that you
all know that it actually means uniform
but that's okay so URL should go to the
content not to the mobile home page but
how many of you have had this experience
where somebody send you an article or
you see something on on twitter and you
try to follow through the link and you
end up on like it's a salon com does
this so the link is supposed to go to
the specific article that you want to
read but you get rerouted to the mobile
home page because you're on the mobile
device and then good luck trying to find
that content again or you know the
actual organization has a fantastic
mobile web site but the URLs always take
you to the desktop web which is what
happens with the New York Times so if
you really want to get to the mobile
content you have to take that URL and
edit yourself edit it yourself in order
to get to that content and the final
thing is is that URLs don't don't open
apps right they're not going to open
them consistently across platform so if
you want to share information if you
want to be able to take advantage of
social networking you need to be able to
do this and and I've this is something
that's really started resonating with
our customers in the last year and it
didn't in the past in the past it was
very much just iphone iphone iphone and
i think we've got a android to to thank
for that to get
people thinking okay we need to support
multiple devices but I'm able to say
okay so if somebody emails you a piece
of content you should be able to open it
no matter what device you're on no
matter where you are in the world and a
lot of a lot of a lot of businesses
aren't actually building for that
behavior right now another thing and
this is I think a way in which we've
learned about this or this behavior is
that you know like you can't actually
find out about ipad apps on your iphone
if you try to look up something in the
apple store for quite some time it would
just say your request can't be completed
which I knew that that meant that that
was an iPad app that I couldn't find the
description of but you know somebody
else my parents wouldn't know what that
meant they've actually updated this sort
of like the Chanel example but it's
still really bad so you know it's like
oh this is an iPad app and it's like
learn more about this app so I a pond
learn more about this app and it takes
me to nike's football mobile home page
where I can't find anything about the
app shortly after the iPad came out
there were a lot of people who are
getting mobile sites instead of full
desktop versions and that didn't make a
lot of sense either which sort of brings
me to this to this point which is that
that I think that device detection has
to be a core part of people's mobile
strategy and it's going to be more
critical going forward and I do it this
is a contrary view to another set of
people who are who are sort of promoting
this idea that we should be providing
one set of content to people and then
using things like CSS media queries to
provide different versions of this
there's a really great example of this
if you haven't looked at this a list
apart had an article by Ethan Marquette
not too long ago talking about
responsive web design which I actually
really like i like the idea that you
have a desktop version that has a really
wide view and then if you have a smaller
browser it's a better view you know in
that and it sort of stretches and
there's actually something really nice
about having having a web page that that
inner that you can interact with in that
way there's something nice about
watching a page respond to your touch I
think that that's part of the reason why
touch devices have so much
why people become so affectionate
towards them because they they are able
to interact at that sort of intimate way
and the the responsive web design does
this and you get all the way down to you
know a mobile size screen but the
problem is is that that when you go from
that perspective you're actually hiding
problems so when you use CSS media
queries to hide images or just use the
browser to resize the images you're
delivering content that's far larger
than it needs to be for a mobile device
and on devices that have slower CPUs
network latency issues smaller bandwidth
issues this doesn't make a lot of sense
the other perspective since i post i
published an article calling this this
technique fool's gold sort of touching
off a little bit of a firestorm what's
come out since then as people have said
okay instead of doing it that way what
we really need to do is we need to start
by delivering mobile versions of
websites and then progressively
enhancing them to desktop versions which
actually seems like a possibly a viable
way of delivering it I just don't see
anyone actually doing it in a production
environment and if you care about if you
care about devices that are that are
feature phones you're going to have to
move from XHTML mobile profile as your
doc type all the way up to html5 and
somehow do that via progressive
enhancement and I just don't see that as
I don't see that as being likely I also
think that the context the information
that you want to provide at a particular
URL based on whether the person sitting
on a mobile device or you know in their
living room on Google TV or you know at
their desk is a very different one while
we were having this debate Jeff Croft
about this this tweet which I actually
thought was really smart he didn't say
what he was talking about but I kind of
got the gist of it which is that when
you only work on on when you don't work
on the whole stack you try to solve the
problems that the at your level instead
of level they should be solved that and
so I look at this and I actually think
that we've got a huge amount of
infrastructure that we need to build
when it comes to mobile technology we're
at the point of mobile where we were
when Apache still stood for a sea
use of patches against an against the
ncsa server we've got a bunch of stuff
to build out in order to take and and
these existing content management
systems that we built up over the last
decade are actually their anchors
holding us back from 0 technology they
don't they don't they're not able to
understand what devices are our come to
the site they're oftentimes designed for
only one style or one size of screen we
spent the last decade like incrementally
moving from 640 x 480 to 800 x 600 to
1024 x 768 and then all of a sudden
we've got to move down to the small
screen and before too long we're going
to turn around we're going to be
building stuff for a large screen and
you know one of the things that Scott
was talking about actually it design for
mobile recently was the idea that you
know we're moving to devices throughout
our world right in our cars I mean all
of these different all these different
spaces where we're going to be
interacting and the screen size is
different the context is different
you're walking down the street with
something in your phone your you're
leaning back on your couch reading
something on a tablet device you're
watching something or you're interacting
with something across the room that's on
a television versus sitting there at
your desk with the screen like all of
these different things not only do we
have different screen resolutions as an
option as something we need to build for
but we have to be able to change
contexts and change information based on
that context which is why I actually
believe that device detection is going
to be part of these new platforms but
even if you disagree even if you think
that we can do it with providing you
know mobile HTML and then progressively
enhancing it we still need better
systems because a lot of the content
management systems that people are using
and this may not be true for Google
right but these new systems they really
need to be able to have integrated image
resizing they need to have video
conversion and resizing of those videos
so they need to be able to put those
videos in a format that can be used on
mobile devices we need to separate
content from markup right because if
we're embedding a bunch of HTML if we've
provided somebody like like blogger does
the ability to create content and
they're using what you see is what you
get editor and they're inserting markup
within that and then you want to take
that and you want to you want to
actually provide that information that
content
now and bloggers may not be a good
example like you can pick any news site
where reporters are working and
providing content and they're able to
bold things or underline things or make
decisions about it we need to be able to
strip out that markup to go to devices
that aren't going to render HTML but are
actually rendering things in native code
right or we need to provide ways to
translate which pieces of that market or
markup are actually things that make
sense in that context prioritization of
content so what makes sense into mobile
context may not make sense of those
other contents and I think full-featured
api's and on that point like I've become
really enamored with what NPR is done
which they call their crate once
published everywhere model where they're
even their desktop website does not
actually have they've completely
separated just a backup they've
completely separated their content
management system from their web
publishing tools so even their desktop
site consumes their AP is so their
desktop site consumes the AP is and the
same API is that they give away freely
for anyone else who wants to build apps
but that's not as important to me is the
fact that those api's are then the thing
that allowed them really quickly to
build a mobile website and to really
quickly enable an android version of
their content and an iphone version of
their content and when they move to
television it's going to be easy for
them to do that as well because they
haven't brought and they even do things
with in there within the content that
they write where they they mark where
the HTML tags are in the content and
separate out the raw content from the
HTML markup and then put it back
together on the fly for those for the
contexts in which the HTML makes sense
now I'm not saying that everybody needs
to go to this extreme but you can see
how that's a much more powerful platform
for moving forward into an area where
we've got a multitude of devices
accessing information then the scenarios
where you know somebody's building
something on top of Drupal or Joomla or
these other systems where all that
everything's intermingled and and I just
I just think that it's really nice when
you give people these options so ESPN I
think does a great job of this right no
matter what device you're on you get a
really great experience they know that
there are numerous numerous peoples and
they're seeing tremendous growth and
their their mobile usage
even during sporting events so you know
like first time the ipad came out it's
like asking me which version of the site
do I want and you know no matter what
version i'm on its consistent and i also
see that they do little things to make
it easier so even on this version if you
go from the desktop version which the
previous screen was to this you can see
how they've added a check box just to
close the pull down menu it's a little
touches but it makes a big difference
and you're only doing that if you're
actually doing some work to actually
segment your audience based on the
devices that are there okay so here are
some of the things that I think people
need to do so the first one is know your
customers and what devices they'll use
so we all know that Apple's just killing
it when it comes to mobile they're the
leaders in the mobile space they they
pretty much dominate and so I read this
article recently that that talked about
how BlackBerry needed to do something to
defend its crop crumbling market share
and that's why I did release these two
new BlackBerry devices and which I was
like what crumbling market share right
this is this is BlackBerry's market
share since the iphone has been released
in 2007 they're there they're doing
pretty good like it looks like they're
actually growing market share to me and
you know in q2 they actually beat the
the industry the analysts expectations
for what they were going to do now
blackberry is having trouble and I'm not
going to ignore the fact that they're
having trouble they're having trouble in
the United States in particular in the
United States they've been losing market
share but they're doing well in other
parts of the world which is why their
market share is still continuing to grow
and I think they've got some they've
obviously got some issues with their
legacy operating system that they need
to address but I think that that what
happens is that we in the United States
and in particularly the tech media has
iphone blinders on when it comes to
looking at a bunch of things in relation
to the mobile world you know iphone
isn't necessarily the leader when it
comes to market share which shouldn't be
any surprise to the people here you know
nokia is still dominates on that regard
and in the united states android is now
taken top spot wait is that true no rim
still got top spot
I think it depends we don't actually
have sales numbers for q3 yet but the I
think it was Nielsen had some
information out recently that in the
last six months people have been buying
more androids than have been in the
United States and have been buying
blackberrys so I think we've got
information I think end of q3 we're
probably going to see Android bypass
blackberry and we've got other phones
right so we've got palm being bought by
HP we've got windows phone we've got all
these different things that when I'm
talking to businesses they're not taking
into consideration as they're making
decisions so I've been looking at this
and I've been looking at some of the
other ways in which we we have blinders
on when it comes to mobile based on what
we've learned from iphone the first one
is just this question of whether apps
actually create lock in like you know
now that I've got a hundred apps on my
phone is that going to prevent me from
switching to another platform and I was
at I was at this conference last week
and I ask people you know this was a
two-week service design conference
designed for mobile all these people
were mobile advocates I asked them you
know how many of you use you know one
third party application on your phone on
a daily basis everybody raised their
hand like to you know some people took
down their hands we went up the way but
time I got 26 there was nobody else
nobody in the room with their hand up
right so if we look at this if i look at
my own usage i find that i use six apps
on a daily basis or that's five apps
sorry and the total cost for those apps
is seventeen dollars the cost for me to
switch to a different platform down the
road if i decide to do so is pretty
inexpensive now I've got the time to
learn the new system I've got all of
those sorts of things but it's not as
compelling it's a plug-in lock-in isn't
as compelling as it was for desktop and
I think we sort of miss we've missed
think of that we think that it's going
to be a bigger thing I also think that
you know a lot of people look at the
mobile Lance yeah
sure yeah go ahead
right so the question is are apps just
content and so you know I've got a bunch
of DVDs I don't watch them all the time
but my cost to switch to blu-ray is you
know or something that was incompatible
with DVDs is still pretty high because
I've got all this existing content that
we can't use um I tend to think that
it's not the same primarily because I
think that a lot of the stuff that
people care about our are things that
you can get cross platforms and then the
things that you can't that you don't
care about I mean pinch media did this
study where they were they were looking
at the usage of applications right and
they coined this phrase throw away apps
because people would use them for one
day two days and then they just they
wouldn't use them again so i think that
there's a there's a high number of apps
that are getting downloaded right now
that people are just you know it's like
it's like they're paying less for that
then they pay for a pack of gum and so
does that app really prevent the person
for making a decision to switch
platforms I don't think so it's only the
apps that people are using on a regular
basis or apps i think within an itch
that prevent people from switching
platforms but we'll see I mean yeah
okay right right so right so it's
question about drm based music video
that sort of stuff yeah that that very
well could be a lock-in based issue but
it doesn't that's not the stuff that you
read the the press talking about when
they're talking about the mobile market
so yeah I would that's part of the
reason why I end up buying mp3s from
amazon instead of from Apple but that's
me sort of continuing on this theme I
you know we've got this idea that app
stores are essential to a platform
success and so the media will likes to
to take this break down and look at the
number of apps that each platform has
and use this as a benchmark to see you
know who's doing well and who isn't
doing well and I think that it is
actually something to look at it is
something that that matters in some way
in relation to platforms but the thing
is is that we and apologies to the
people in the room but we I think we can
all agree that androids marketplace kind
of sucks in comparison to two other
platforms in particular the iphone
experience iOS experience and and yet
this the sucky app store experience
isn't preventing Android from completely
taking off and bypassing the iphone
right so you know we've had this
assumption we've been working under this
assumption that that's really what
matters and making decisions and that's
what people in the press keep pounding
on and i just don't see it being bared
out by the market of course we've got a
bunch of you know 115 android phones
announced or shipping and 50 more non
phone devices and this is several months
old so I'm sure it's it's more than that
we also tend to compare mobile to the
historical pc market which i think is a
fallacy because in the pc market we
never started out in a place where we
had multiple vendors competing you know
with a significant portion of the market
nokia you know Apple Google all these
sorts of positions I also think that
it's much more likely to be like the the
video game market where the the there's
like five companies that have a large
percentage of the market
and which ones in the lead switches from
generation of hardware degeneration of
hardware I think that that's possibly a
model that we should be looking at and
thinking about when we look at mobile as
opposed to looking at the pc market and
wondering you know is android going to
win and everything else going to lose
because we do assume that there's going
to be a winner and the final thing I'll
say to sort of like to sort of
punctuated this idea that we're that
we've we've miscast what it means in the
marketplace by really sort of focusing
on those historical precedents and
having an iphone based perspective on
stuff is that mobile is the most Borg
like technology there has ever been so
by Borg like I mean that it consumes
other markets over and over again so
their digital cameras come out I think
late 90s early 2000s and phone
manufacturers decide to integrate
digital cameras into their phones I
think they did it in 2003 was when the
first camera phones came out it was just
a dribble by 2005 the number of camera
phones sold exceeded the total number of
digital cameras that had ever been made
and sold right they completely whoa
theres the mic they completely
obliterated that market now people are
still buying digital cameras but you can
see how the total like the number one
manufacturer of digital cameras in the
world is nokia it's not canon it's not
it's not you know minolta it's not any
of these camera companies is actually
nokia same thing with mp3 players apple
continues to do well selling mp3 players
but if you just limit it to stand alone
mp3 players Apple's got a dominant
position if you look at phones that also
have mp3 players in it Apple's got a
minority position you can see this
happening right now as garment struggles
to try to figure out what to do now that
their market has been consumed by mobile
phones with integration and GPS and I
think you're going to see I was talking
to somebody from Kodak who works in
there
in their division that created the
competitor to the flip I don't remember
the name of the product and she was
asking what to do and I was like well
you're you're pretty much going to have
that market go away you guys are chasing
a market that's going to dissolve you
know and I'm not sure how quickly but I
think flip and those other other
cameraman or other sort of like video
camera standalone video camera
manufacturers are going to go away
because the phones the cameras and our
phones for video recording are getting
so much better so all of this is to say
that that we could see transformations
in this market happen very quickly
because hardware sensors could get
integrated we don't have the lock in
that we necessarily had with other
devices and the churn is higher people
replace their phones every 18 months so
getting outside of the valley sort of
like getting out and seeing what's
happening outside in other parts of the
world really informs awesome makes helps
us make better decisions so when I talk
to businesses I'm talking about like
understanding what their demographics
are so if they're trying to do stuff
into enterprise they need to make sure
that they're focusing on blackberry
because blackberry has forty percent of
the worldwide enterprise market they
want to do something in emerging markets
they need to work on mms based
capabilities because eighty percent of
the mms traffic around the world comes
from emerging markets if they're going
to do something in Latin America or the
Middle East they need to focus on
blackberry because blackberry is
actually the cool hip phone in those
countries because of blackberry
messenger they can get around SMS
charges in the Middle East it's actually
popular to use to put blackberry pin
numbers on license plates so that people
can when they're driving down the road
if they think you're cute they can get
your pin number and flirt with you and
this is an example of actually social
mores in those countries promoting one
technology solution over another right
because in those countries you can't
openly flirt so here's a way to get
around that problem so understanding
these things makes a difference and so
we talked to a lot of customers we
talked about you know making sure that
they're asking their customers what
they're using understanding how their
demographics map to which platforms
people are using and you know using
mobile analytics which is specific and
different than just using desktop web
analytics to understand what people are
using on their sites
also understanding that if they've got a
site that's really horrible from a
analytics perspective or a usage
perspective on mobile that they're not
going to get good information out of it
in the same way in which web usage prior
to the iphone when the browser's really
sucked was really low if your site has a
really poor mobile experience you can't
really tell much about how many people
are going to use that site down the road
I also talked to people about looking
beyond native apps to look to the mobile
web SMS and MMS there's a company in the
u.s. that does SMS games that made 170
million dollars in revenue last year BMW
to this really interesting campaign
where they took 70 k in mms based
advertising they basically took kept
track of every person who purchased a
BMW in germany and didn't buy snow tires
or snow chains and then when the first
dusting of snow hit they sent them an
mms message with the photograph of the
vehicle they bought in the color they
bought it with information on the
correct tires and the correct or chains
whatever it was primarily tires I think
that they should purchase where they
should go get it and how much they cost
completely actionable information
Universal no matter what device the
person had and you know they translated
that that 70 k and advertising in 245
million dollars in revenue we all know
that people aren't really using the
mobile web right I mean we've got people
telling us to screw the web and that no
one uses the mobile web that it's all
about native apps now and of course
we've got the magazine of record in our
industry declaring that the web is dead
which of course prompted a lot of
conversations on the web about that
article and so here's the thing so I
have a simple challenge for those people
and and I won't even ask them to prove
that people aren't using the mobile web
anymore I'll just want them to find a
single report that doesn't show
exponential growth for the mobile web
not not the mobile web usage is down or
even that it's down relative to native
apps just like just show that people
aren't using it exponentially because
what we do have is we have bango
reporting bango does a lot of mobile
analytics purporting six hundred percent
growth last year in mobile
usage we have Gartner talking about the
fact that the mobile web is going to
outpace the desktop web by 2013 we have
oh there was a slide that was supposed
to be in here that's missing so just
this week orange reported that they were
doing a study and found that like it was
like seventy percent of UK respondents
said that they would prefer to use a
mobile web versus an app which really
surprised me i'm planning on digging a
little bit further into that study but
yeah it's actually within just the last
week that orange which is very large
carrier in europe publish that
information one of the other things that
we know about the mobile web is that
it's actually converging versus what's
going on in the operating system so in
2006 to mobile operating systems symbian
and Windows Phone or Windows Mobile had
eighty-one percent of the market
smartphone market now Gartner and the
other animal estar talk are tracking ten
different mobile operating systems and
no two vendors have more than I think
it's like fifty percent of the
smartphone market worldwide instead
we've got this real fractured system
back in 2006 we also had an insane
number of browsers all of which were our
many of which were proprietary so we had
you know net front and oh I can't
remember them they're just a bunch of a
bunch of different proprietary browsers
all of which rendered content
differently with blackberry now shipping
webkit-based phones and that's where
they're headed with blackberry 6 we now
have eighty-five percent of the
smartphone market shipping with black
with webkit-based browsers so we've got
convergence happening and divergence
happening on the other side and
companies are actually making a lot of
money using mobile web so flirtomatic is
a uk-based dating service and they had
15 million in revenue last year
whitepages com recently said that
they've had a top ten iphone app
reference out for two years with almost
six million downloads but with all even
with all that great stuff just as many
iphone consumers use their mobile
website as their app but i'm not saying
that people shouldn't do apps right like
in the last year year and a half we've
been consumed with this idea of like
mobile web versus
apps and and this battle between them
and I'm I'm really tired of that I think
that it's sort of a futile fight like
really we need to be thinking about what
makes sense in what context does it make
sense to do native applications what
does what context doesn't make sense to
do mobile web we know for example that
mobile web needs to be I would say that
there's a business to be built just
providing mobile websites for all of the
native app developers because I believe
that they need mobile websites and i
think that the number of companies that
need mobile websites are much bigger
than the number of companies that just
need apps but i would also say that that
I think that Apple ended this debate and
they didn't in the debate in the way in
which people think they ended it they
ended the debate by releasing their
guidelines for what apps get through the
App Store and finally they came out and
they said look if you want to criticize
religion go do it somewhere else right
so I don't care whether you're making
your entire business off of building
native apps or not right if you care
about freedom of speech if you care
about people having having the ability
to criticize governments to have the
ability to to publish freely to talk
about things that aren't you know the
sorts of things that we can find out
Walmart's then we have to have mobile
web as a viable alternative to native
apps and so I feel like the debates over
we just need to figure out when it makes
sense to do which and one of the ways in
which one of the places where I think it
makes sense to do this is in cases where
you're building something for your most
loyal customers so ebay did this you
know they actually have a mobile website
it's not the greatest mobile website but
it's sufficient for somebody like me who
doesn't spend a lot of time on ebay and
cajun alee gets asked questions by
people from people about you know is
this a good buys it's not a good buy I
can actually go to the site and look at
this and and get information from them
but if somebody actually uses ebay all
the time they can they can use this app
in this app generated I think this
number is actually low I forget what it
is but it's insane amount of money for
ebay based on people buying stuff and
they bought things like boats and really
fancy cars and stuff using their iPhones
and so they've created additional apps
like for their most avid deal hunters
they have an app that's specialized
stuff and I think that if you're going
to build these apps you you should
reward somebody for taking the time to
load it by providing taking advantage of
those device capabilities that you might
not have access to in the browser so you
know providing access to the camera like
Amazon does to take experience take
photos no matter what you do you need to
make sure that you've got a consistent
experience across all these devices and
in your offline I think that there's
great examples of this from Amazon where
no matter which context you're in you
get the same basic information about
your account about your relationship to
Amazon and we see examples of how this
can be done with with syncing to the
cloud via instant paper where it keeps
track of what I've read and where I've
read it and these sorts of things and so
I always have access to it even when I'm
offline Barnes &amp;amp; Noble actually does a
pretty good job of this as well in terms
of being able to find things know that
they're in the local store and reserve
them so if you have a physical location
being able to tie those systems together
so the final thing and I'm gonna have to
rush through this is understanding the
mobile context so Brian fleeing wrote
this book I really like this this quote
from it about the fact that you should
create a product for mobile don't just
reimagine 14 small screens that great
mobile products are created never ported
and this is another reason why I think
that that the idea of just providing the
same information and reformatting it for
different screens is sort of a false
notion it doesn't make sense tomi ahonen
who is a great European mobile analyst
has been writing about mobile for quite
some time talks about these eight mobile
eights mobile Mobile's eight unique
abilities the first one is that it's
personal that sixty-three percent don't
share their phones even with their
spouses the second thing is that it's
permanently carried fifty percent of the
United States admits to sleeping with
their phone something like ninety
percent of people admit to keeping their
phone within arm's reach 24 hours a day
which begs the question between those
people who keep it at arm's length and
those that admit to sleeping with it
what do they think they're doing when
they keep it at arm's length I would
define that of sleeping with their phone
but they apparently have a different
definition so we know that it's it's
permanently carried that it's always on
that this is a device that actually is
design for being on all the time like
you can leave your TV on all the time
but it's not designed for that usage and
that it's got a built-in payment channel
and in the United States we tend to
think of this primarily iTunes based
payment channels but in other parts of
the world you know it's very common to
be able to go into a store and buy
something using your mobile phone
vending machines parking meters in
Estonia have been converted entirely so
that there's no there's no longer the
ability to accept change like you can
only use a parking meter in Estonia
using a mobile phone and there's a
similar thing going on and I think it's
Switzerland so you know like this it's
got a built-in payment channel and we're
just starting to get used to this this
is my favorite one it's it's available
at the moment of creative impulse so the
best best explanation I have of this is
actually from an iphone app developer
who created this application called best
camera and the what he said was he's a
professional photographer and he said
you know what I realized is that even
though I've got a better camera at home
with all these lenses and everything
else on it that the best camera i have
is the 1i have with me when I want to
take a photograph it doesn't matter what
the capabilities are of this other
camera and I think that's true like
that's true for a whole host of
applications what's the best notating
taking application right it's the one
you've got with you what's the best
email application it's the one you have
you have with you when you want to write
an email what's the best camera it's the
one that you have with you when you see
a guy in boerne man riding across the
desert on a bicycle that looks like a
camera half naked right that's the best
camera you have at that moment and it's
available at that moment of creative
impulse it's got accurate measurements
so we have because phones aren't shared
we are commonly aren't shared we have
the ability to know that a phone is
attached to an individual and be able to
do more stuff with it in that way it's
got social context it's got the address
book in it and we know that access to
social networks is tremendous on mobile
devices on both Facebook and Twitter
seeing triple digit growth and the first
half of 25 there's actually more recent
statistics on this that are pretty
daunting in terms of the amount of
traffic growth that they've seen from
mobile just this year Facebook the last
this may be old now saying that a
hundred million people are actively use
facebook from their mobile devices I'm
sure it's actually higher at this point
and the final unique ability is this
idea of augmented reality so being able
to and and we really don't know what
we're going to do with the ship but i
love this example from a student in the
UK who talked about how ikea could
actually superimpose a couch from their
catalog over a blank spot in the wall so
that you could tell what that couch was
going to look like in your living room
and how that might actually make your
purchasing experience better so a while
back and I'm not sure if you guys are
still looking at this stuff but a while
back there was an article this was
actually from 2007 talking about these
three mobile behavior groups so who
knows whether you guys are still using
it but I really like it so this idea of
repetitive now bored now and urgent now
and repetitive now you're looking up
stocks all the time sports scores bored
now you're in the the Haut you're in the
doctors lobby and urgent now you're
trying to find the restaurant the reason
that I like this is because we tend to
think of when we talk about mobile
context of the person walking down the
street very quickly trying to find
something and that's not the most that's
not you know the only use case that's
not even necessarily the most common use
case in Japan they did the carrier in
Japan did a study and found that over
sixty percent of its data usage was
coming from people inside buildings so
understanding how your apps going to be
used in which one of these sort of
behavior groups I think makes a lot of
sense and the final thing actually is
another thing that came from google
actually from Eric Schmidt talking about
this idea of mobile first and the idea
that they're putting people on mobile
applications first Luke w has this great
set of slides that I i really recommend
people look at his main point is that
that mobile has tremendous growth right
we've got all these great we've got
these constraints because of the CPU the
network the screen size everything else
but because of the cave we've got
tremendous capabilities that we didn't
have access to before we've got access
to the camera all of these location this
sort of stuff and that growth equals
opportunity constraints equals focus and
capabilities equal innovation his slides
are really really good sort of talking
on this point
it and he shows this example of how how
cluttered is it going to turn okay there
we go how cluttered South by Southwest
coms website is in comparison to what it
its iPhone app is and how much better
would be actually if the website
actually had the same sort of focus that
the the iphone app does another company
that I think does a really good job of
this is best buy and I've got just a
short video sort of talking about how
best buy uses mobile see here so
personal it's like with you all the time
an intimate experience it's always I
it's changed the way that I share my
feelings and my memories think I'm kind
of addicted to it I honestly I hate to
admit this I sleep with my phone it goes
under the pillow with me and first thing
I do when I wake up I look for that
phone and when I can't find it i freak
out oh my god I don't have my phone with
me what if I don't have my phone I'm out
of sorts I'm going to drive back 15
miles i can grab my cell phone trust me
I've done that couple times it's the
most important device I've got you've
got a computer in your hand and that
unlocks all kinds of opportunities as
the young people come through they
aren't connected anymore to the
technology that their parents use
because they want to be connected all
the time 24 7 on our phones typing away
my email my calendar contactless it's
basically my life line between my
friends my family and most importantly
in my business I see it as the lifeblood
of their existence looking at products
and researching them just go right to
your mobile device and you get those
answers that's to me where the value is
right now people want to have that
information hand and there's so much
capability we've got to make it serve
their lives better and we need to think
about how can we solve that through the
phone and I think for us it does put a
higher expectation from our customers
you guys are a technology company or
you're at least in the technology
business we're putting the devices in
people's hands it's kind of imperative
to show them what it can do the logical
thing to do is to say how much revenue
will we
through this new channel although the
bigger value is helping customers shop
learn and by while they are mobile I
think one of the ways that you add value
is you create interfaces for people to
access information in a way that's not
like drinking out of a fire hose if you
type in bestbuy com you won't get the
big site itself kind of jammed into your
screen you're actually going to get a
purpose-built mobile version it's been
simplified the way that they've broken
out all the different product categories
is easy to navigate it's easy for them
to get to us with the iphone what people
start doing building special
applications to really get at specific
needs you may have the iphone app is
very experiential a link to reward so an
idea exchange we're opening up the
Gateway for a single brand experience
customers want to be able to stay in
touch with their friends and their
family customers want us to be able to
help them out when it comes to social
networking as twitter as facebook as
myspace continues to grow we need to
play in those spaces with 12 force we
have over 2,500 employees answering
questions via twitter so you've got the
helpful force of our best buy blue
shirts with instant access to our
customers and our customers have instant
access to that questions they want
answered and that's really been a nice
marriage customers want their
information now I might be at one store
i want to see if another store has the
same product if they have the same price
our job as a retailer's is to create
tremendous buying experience for our
customers in the future this could be
the retailers that connect physical and
virtual experiences and the phone or a
mobile platform is to me the way to do
that anyone on their own device can walk
into our physical stores stand in front
of a product and actually understand
everything that we've amassed on the web
about that product how does the mobile
phone become a payment device very
exciting to look at what we can do in
that space the days of plastic are
numbered you'll be pick up the phone
make the
action from wherever you are wherever
you are in the world in a physical or
online presence customers want us to
educate though it's our job in our duty
to answer those specific questions that
you have they come to us thing that we
know everything people want to sleep
with their phones that's an important
device to be to be part of and we have
to be there in a way that it works for
the customer and this gives us an
opportunity to design solutions that
make their life easier I can't think of
a better place to catalog everything we
know and just make available be three to
six months something new is coming out a
web browser is going to be in your TV
soon they already are in your kids
handheld PSP or their ps3 these
endpoints these user experiences are
going to change every six months we need
to build for having all we know kind of
in the middle of best buy so we can
parse it off to these different places
the more possibilities around the world
the more pressure that puts on designing
really great interfaces that let people
get the benefit of that if you ignore
that your experience is going to be as
good as somebody else's I can see it and
we've got to be there and I think we can
lead in this area so the things that I
like about that video in particular I
like the fact that they they seem to
actually grok what it means to be in the
mobile context so talking about people
sleeping with their phones they talk
about and provide people with the
ability to to scan barcodes and
understand that they're going to be
looking for more information when their
physical in the physical locations more
importantly I think it was really it's
really great to see a company that's
talking right now about the fact that
they understand that what devices people
are going to be interacting with their
e-commerce systems in six months from
now are very different than what they
are now and that they have to plan for
that and have systems in place that
allow them to take their content and
parse it out to all these different
devices and just the final thing is it's
such a breath of fresh air from from
this guy from these conversations from
getting these emails from these cavemen
sort of saying me need iphone app it's a
completely different conversation people
who are looking at at how mobile
technology affects every aspect of their
business so I go back to this question
that John Battelle asked sort of asking
what what should be your mobile strategy
and and my answer that question is that
that there shouldn't be a mobile
strategy like we don't talk about
internet strategy anymore right like
that's not a core pidove piece of what
people do when they're sitting down and
writing business plans and the same way
people shouldn't be talking about mobile
strategy it really should just be D
strategy it should be part of the way in
which businesses are getting things done
so with that in mind for me when I look
at mobile first and it's this idea that
mobile is this disruptive technology
that it is by its nature going to touch
aspects of all aspects of every business
and that therefore we need to plan
accordingly we need to build businesses
with that in mind and our infrastructure
and our business processes need to
change to accommodate that that's it
thank you all very much that was great
Jason all right why don't we we've got
the room for a while longer so won't you
take as many questions as you want
people can come up to the mic or if you
just repeat the questions that'd be
great alright cool questions
for this team this is Steve's personal
session yeah all right so the question
is how close are we in the u.s. to being
able to buy stuff with our phones and I
think the answer is not close I the
thing that gives me some hope is that
there keeps things keep dripping out
from Apple's patent group with and
near-field communications based
solutions and I think that what we've
what we've seen by device manufacturers
over the last few years is that their
ability to copy whatever Apple does is
getting increasingly faster so you know
if apple's next iphone comes out with
near field communications as a
capability built into it i think that
we're we will see a massive surge of
investment in that area and near field
communications holds the best probably
the best promise for making that happen
but we're a ways off I there are a
couple companies that are working on
some innovative ways to like add
stickers to your phones and then use
your regular credit cards in in
conjunction with either near field or
actually dummy cards it just like swype
but then connect to your phone in some
way so I think that we could get
something like that as sort of a hybrid
solution in place sooner but we've got a
lot of installed merchants and just
infrastructure that would need to change
in order for that to happen and Asia and
Europe have at least a two year if not a
four-year lead on us when it comes to
mobile infrastructure other question
yeah
alright so the question is I'm sorry it
was the last piece about the tablet
market versus the phone market and what
happens there so I I guess I don't
really know I mean one of the things
that I find okay so backing up just a
moment when you look at the phone market
one of the things that that we know is
that the number of like the usage model
or the number of phones that are being
purchased are really expanding quite a
bit at the lower ends of the smartphone
market and that in the United States for
example african-american populations and
Latino populations actually use their
mobile phones for internet browsing at a
higher percentage than Caucasians so
which is not something that we we
generally think of okay so if you
combine those two things and you look at
the average price for phones for
smartphones you see that Apple's
reported average prices over six hundred
dollars per phone you see that
BlackBerry's is around three hundred
nokia is that I don't remember it's like
220 or something like that and then
you've got the the android-based devices
sort of like all over the place at that
lower end but nobody's really at that
six hundred dollar price point so when
it comes to the smartphone market apples
sort of continuing the pattern that
they've done on other platforms right
they're selling stuff at a premium at
the higher end of that that spectrum and
there they've got a minority share but a
majority of the profits okay that's
that's been the pattern that's what
they're doing on the laptop side of
things that's what they're doing on the
desktop side now they're doing it at
smartphones the thing with tablets that
I don't know yet is that it seems like
everybody who's developing a tablet is
coming out with price points that are
higher than what the iPads price point
is and my assumption is is that in the
long run that apple will continue to
have really high margins and therefore
will have will have the higher based
product and we'll have a bunch of
tablets that are cheaper but so far I'm
not seeing that
um it's really early yet so who knows
exactly I also think from a just a
context in terms of developing stuff for
those devices it's just too new like
nobody I mean we're still grappling with
what it means to design something for a
screen that's this size now we've got
this size that you know what are the
contexts in which it's being used so I
just I don't know I guess it's the
ultimate answer that is that is the
rumor like I haven't seen I've also seen
rumors of price points that are higher
so his comment was that there's a lot of
7-inch tablets that are coming in I'll
admit that I've been traveling a lot in
the last two weeks and that means that
I'm backed up on my RSS feeds and that
mobile moves so quickly that that means
that I'm like a thousand items in my RSS
feeds down so there may be prices that
have come out I saw the samsung galaxy
tablet at our tab is that what it's
called tab tab yeah adam at design for
mobile somebody had an example of it it
was it was pretty cool i liked it but
again like the rumor price points on
that are higher than the ipad and have
subsidies attached to them in terms of
being connected to a carrier and so i I
really don't know how that's going to
how that's going to work out I'm kind of
assuming in the long run that apple will
continue to maintain its high margins
and that other companies will exhibit
their usual behavior which is to cut
their margins and compete in order to
gain market share in which case we
should see something fall out like the
rest but if for some reason Apple's
actually got production costs on the
iPad really low and other companies are
having trouble competing on a price
point with Apple that would be I think a
real game-changer like if you're looking
at anything like Apple's got a lead in
that space but it's how to lead in other
spaces before I don't know that that
necessarily means that they'll maintain
that lead but if you're looking at
something that would actually cause them
to maintain that lead if they're
actually at lower price points and the
other tablets I think that that really
would I think that that's that would be
a very very different dynamic than
anything we've seen so far
it's kind of expected for every possible
combination like blackberry
yeah so so okay so the question is
talking about designing for different
device classes and you know like it's
very expensive to do so you know how
many how many device classes do you
design for what do you do so first I
would say that that I think that it's
expensive right now partially because
we've got the infrastructure issues
because we we haven't in the same way in
which going back to the early days of
the internet just getting uh just
getting a web server up and running and
running Apache was expensive right like
the previous company that i was at i was
part of the management team at that
company you know when the company was
started you basically had to build out
your own server infrastructure you had
to do all this sort of stuff and now you
just like you throw it on Google's cloud
or you throw it on Amazon's Cloud so
every technology wave I just I just want
to make this point real quick that every
technology wave there's usually two
cycles to it and the first cycle is the
cycle where the roads get built an
automobile sell but then there's a bust
and then the second technology boom is a
longer sustain technology boom where
more and more people get the technology
right and we saw this actually with the
internet as well where the first cycle
was where all the infrastructure was
built the second cycle is where
sustainable businesses were usually
built I think we're going to see the
same thing unfortunately with mobile
where we've got to do a bunch of
infrastructure build-out before we get
to the point where developing things for
multiple devices on a variety of
different platforms is easy to do and I
don't know what the answer to that is
like I have some I just know that what
we've got right now is not going to be
satisfactory for being able to design
things for multiple devices and there
are a lot of different ways that it
could be accomplished steve has some
ideas I have some ideas ppk has some
ideas like we've got a bunch of
different people who have ideas I you
know like I just I'd love to just be
like to step ahead five years and be
able to be building in that space but
that's not where we're at as far as what
we do it depends on a client by client
basis right so we've got one client
whose goal was to reach as many people
as possible because they're trying to
promote social change and so in that
case we did a 128 to 176 pixel
design class device class which sucked
128 is an incredibly incredibly small
screen like you can't do jack with that
and then a 240 and then a 320 non like
non webkit-based smartphone class and
then a 320 webkit-based smartphone class
for another client they went out and
they bought 500 3g ipads because they
were going to go do some sort of
canvassing related sort of thing and so
with that in mind we were just designing
for that one specific use case so it
really just depends the more common
thing that we're seeing is is that is
that we're designing stuff sort of in to
device classes maybe three where the two
device classes are there's two
smartphone device classes where one is
sort of a a modern smartphone so you've
got the the iPhones Androids palm you've
got these devices that can handle
webkit-based interactions pretty well
then you've got the blackberries and
Nokia's and things like that but have
the same screen resolution and then as a
secondary thing they'll they'll sort of
do a lightweight mobile which goes all
the way from the very small device
classes to like the older black berries
that are 240 pixels and you know like
ship with JavaScript turned off and
stupid things like that another question
then okay
yeah so the question is about Windows
Phone 7 and its browser so windows phone
7 has internet explorer it has it is the
only smartphone platform right now
that's not a knock shipping webkit-based
it's it actually will be interesting to
see what the WebKit numbers are you know
in six months from now a year from now
and once we see how Windows Phone 7 does
in the market it's actually possible
that WebKit could gain some ground
because part of what keeps it down right
now is that you've got a lot of windows
windows mobile users and windows mobile
companies that purchase windows mobile
because that's where they've built their
their sort of internal intranet systems
on but they're not going to be able to
take those applications directly to
Windows Phone 7 it's actually completely
different platforms so it's not really
clear what they're going to do as far as
supporting those those enterprise users
windows phone seven runs Internet
Explorer something between seven and
eight so essentially about you know like
between the after 7 was released but
before eight was released they grabbed a
bit of the code they forked it and they
started working on the mobile browser I
had my hands on a test device recently
and Iran s attest to an asset s3 and it
didn't pass either of them the smiley
face was not very smiley so yeah so I
think that that is going to be an issue
but this is the one context in which you
know like if you're going to build stuff
and you're going to sort of like do that
segmentation I thought I was talking
about where you've got like a modern
smartphone class which are the web based
sort of ones and then you've got a
smartphone class that's for devices that
aren't quite that capable you know
internet explorer is a minority market
share when it comes to mobile like um if
we want to do stuff with html5 I don't
think that Internet Explorer on mobile
holds us back and I think that that that
Microsoft has shown that it understands
it's an underdog now in a lot of ways
even though it still has its issues but
it I think it's legitimately an underdog
and so consequently it's acting like
every underdog does which is that when
you're an underdog you gravitate towards
standards as a way to compete and so
they're gravitating towards html5 and
internet explorer 9 and hopefully they
will rev the mobile browser to support
html5 more quickly than they got rid of
ie6 I know that's not saying much since
ie6 came out before nine eleven but we
you know like I think that there I don't
think that it's going to be a decade
before we get a better browser on from
them in that regard I think that it's
you know going to be a year maybe two
but that's just I have no inside info on
that the device itself is actually
really cool like it's the first it's a
first mobile phone that's come out post
iphone that I think has an opinion I
don't know if I agree with the opinion
but it's got its got a frickin opinion
which I really love like I mean it's not
like the this the bottle which is you
know like Samsung's really great at
copying apples designs but but the
windows phone is like wow like somebody
somebody really they design something
different and it's really cool in person
I don't know how it'll solve it it's I
mean it's pretty slick so we probably
should wrap it up I think um thank you
all for your time and um yeah talk to
you soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
