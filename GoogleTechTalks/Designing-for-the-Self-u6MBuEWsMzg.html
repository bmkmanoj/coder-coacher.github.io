coming I know ten o'clock so early for
Googlers but i'm here to introduce John
Zimmerman he's a design and HCI an ACI
professor at Carnegie Mellon and he's
taught probably about a quarter of the
designers in the design department here
so today he will be talking about
designing for the self so for those of
you work on blogger or any I'm sure
there's plenty of products here that
will find some benefit from this so he
was John hi I'm very loud i'm john
zimmerman and i'm a interaction designer
and also happened to be a professor at
carnegie mellon like chad said i've
taught a number of the people here it's
nice to see some friendly faces in the
crowd and i'm very excited to be here
today to talk about some new work that
i'm doing i think usually when people
present they like to present fairly
mature work that actually have
confidence is good but i've decided to
come out and share something that's very
new i'm not actually sure if this is a
great idea and i'm looking for some
feedback to see if you believe that
there's something in this new direction
so just to give a quick overview i'm
going to give just a little bit on my
background because i think it informs
the direction that I'm going the little
gist on what is I'm talking about when I
say designing for the self my motivation
which is actually very tangential to the
work itself sort of the core is this
fundamental disconnect between the work
of consumer behavior researchers and how
they talk about product attachment and
the practice of HCI and this work is
really trying to bridge that some
opportunities I see for creating new
value and products and finally how I've
tried to operationalize these theories
in my own design practice so my
background is actually as a filmmaker I
think if you talk to a lot of
interaction designers they come from
something radically different minus film
so fundamentally I always view myself as
a story tell
and that's a very big part of how I
practice design also i moved from
filmmaking to interactive multimedia
back in the days of CD ROMs when that
was sort of the latest and greatest
thing did a bunch of early websites back
before there were tables in HTML and
before photoshop had layers so the
really early days it's been a number of
years at philips electronics doing
interactive televisions it was really
trying to take what I knew about
storytelling and see if we can apply it
to research product projects and for me
that was a big introduct introduction to
research from a design perspective and
then more recently I've been at Carnegie
Mellon working on interaction with
intelligent systems and this works
actually very tangential to my work on
intelligent systems but I'm trying to
see to find a connection to bring these
two themes together so I just want to
take a moment to set the stage to give
an idea of what i'm talking about when
I'm talking about designing for the self
and the example I like to use is the
grocery checker so not the the new self
check app but the sort of more
traditional scanned checkout experience
and to me this is an excellent example
of HCI practice where researchers went
in they sort of scope the problem they
said you know we can design a system
that will make the checker more
efficient and more effective and we will
get the groceries out of the store
faster so what what do you get by adding
an identity lens to this problem in
taking an identity perspective you have
to start to consider the worker and how
does interacting with the technology
make them feel like they're better at
their job so they have this identity
construction goal in their work of sort
of feeling like they're a good checker
does the scanner that's been developed
for them make them feel like they're
better at their job and I would say no I
actually think it cast them in a very
servant role where their job is to orie
and the barcode or so traditional if you
think of the the nine key or ten key
entry system the the workers really in
charge of the system they're entering
information they're relying on it as a
tool but this is a big social change
where now they serve the Machine Yetta
conveyor belt brings the food down and
they're there to orient the barcode
machines doing the work and the worker
works for the machine this is sort of a
very negative construction and it's done
in a social environment where it's
happening right in front of the customer
so now the customer gets to watch the
worker serving the machine and so I
think bringing an identity construction
perspective allows us to start to ask
ourselves can we design systems that
improve efficiency and effectiveness but
also make people feel better about the
work they're doing this is hardly a
radically new sod if you think of the
quality circles from the automotive
industry it was about getting workers
engaged in what they were doing to
reduce defects how do you make them care
about the work that they're performing
and create an environment where the work
gets done and everyone actually feels
quite good about it so motivation what
sort of sent me in this direction and
what HCI talk wouldn't be complete
without a picture of the oj simpson car
chase for a long time I have been
tremendously fascinated with celebrities
and with the effect of celebrities and
in this particular example what I find
just so fascinating is that the sales of
white Ford Broncos increased after this
car chase like that's a real behavioral
effect completely unintended but it's a
real effect there's a real influence on
people's behavior how can we as
designers begin to operationalize this
to bring it into the products that we
make I became very interested in that
and I spent a number of years
researching how people use products as a
method of creating relationships with
celebrity so how do products become
mediators
the real goal of for myself of can I
make synthetic celebrities and in the
end I found this almost impossible to
operationalize in a lab I couldn't
create the social effect of a celebrity
in a laboratory and you did like a
hundred thousand people and the lawyers
really prevented me from taking actual
identities of real celebrities and doing
things to them that would sort of
degrade potentially degrade the status
of their trademark but this really
brought me to this idea of identity
because what's happening when people
have this affiliation with the
celebrities they're really participating
in identity construction and so it drove
me to this whole set of research by
consumer behavior lists so I just want
to talk for a second about this
disconnect so for the last 20 years
consumer behavior researchers have
really been exploring how people form
attachments to products through this
process of identity construction so what
are the products that they care about
what are the products that we love and
they've started using a framework of
identity construction for understanding
this and as a designer sort of
discovering this I'd say now may be the
midpoint of my career was very
frustrating because we what we talked
about sort of making things that are
aesthetically pleasing that people will
enjoy we were never talking about this
underlying theory and I think this is a
huge opportunity that has been missed I
think particularly in HCI design process
people focus on making functional
interactive products and services which
is particularly important we actually
talked very little about how we make
people care about the products that they
use and that we look at the very surface
level of user needs but we're not
looking underneath at these lower level
needs that actually drive people's
behavior and their choices so why why
should you care about this and I think
the question is really framed with where
do you see the edge of HCI practice what
what is it so when I talk about HCI
practice generally I have no trouble
getting people to agree that its
usability engineering
and I started my own career in
interaction design in the 80s where the
idea of ease of use and making things
user-friendly was was what it was all
about so it comes from usability but do
do HCI practitioners design work
certainly design tools for work but do
we actually design the work itself and I
don't think that's an idea that's
embraced too heavily in the community do
HCI designers design products I would
say yes but i think that there's not
quite a lot of agreement in the
community on that do we design services
potentially but are they more than just
sort of electronic single point of
contact surfaces are we talking about
multiple touch points in a value chain
and do we design the resources for
people to have experiences and is
experience design something that HCI
practitioners should embrace and I think
this is the biggest question because
when you you know when you move back to
usability engineering and ease and and
even designing of work in that space
practitioners have tremendous amounts of
control I can build something I can
force someone to use it and I can
measure its outcome when you start to
design for experience you move much more
into this horse riddle space of the
wicked problem where there's just way
too many variables for you to control
you can touch a few key elements but can
you actually have impact on people's
lives and is that something people
should be concerned with in their
practice my my answer is clearly yes a
number of HCI sort of leaders have
stepped into this area you may be
familiar with Norman's work on product
emotions he was also talking about
product attachment but in a very
different way and while I like this work
it also frustrates me tremendously
because it deals with product emotion at
a very surface structure level it's like
well if we just make things pretty
people will like them more if we talked
about the visceral aspect sort of this
immediacy of liking and the behavioral
aspect sort of it's this pleasure of
actual use but there's nothing under
not like what are the real motivations
that are driving people's desire in this
space and I think he completely punts on
reflective saying well you can't really
design this into a product people either
develop it or they down and I think the
work of the consumer behavior
researchers actually address this in a
more appropriate way so while I I like
Norman's work I think it's it's great
for the deconstruction of an artifact I
think it's actually a terrible model to
use to try to make something another
model you might be familiar with his
work by Pat Jordan do you guys know him
at all he does the he runs the
contemporary trends institute he's a
usability engineer worked for a number
of years at Philips he had the sort of
for pleasure models physiological
pleasure social pleasure psychological
pleasure and ideological pleasure and he
frames this with sort of a Maslow vian
triangle of you know hierarchy of needs
we're at the base level designers need
to consider the functionality what's the
basic functionality people need to
complete their task then a usability
level well they have to be able to
actually use the product to get that
functionality done and then finally this
pleasure level at talk like can we make
this an enjoyable experience and again I
think this is a great model for
deconstructing but if you think of
identity construction as a functional
aspect of what people are trying to
accomplish in their interaction with
products you can't separate
functionality and pleasure they actually
have to be together and so again while
this is a great way to deconstruct
something I think it's a terrible model
for trying to operationalize and make
new things one model I do particularly
like is work by Jody for Lizzie who's a
colleague of mine and Shannon Ford and
in this experience model they talk about
the interaction or the interface as a
mediator that allows people to connect
to people people to connect to places
and people to connect to products and
this all takes place in a social culture
and economic forces to sort of within
that context I mean I think this is a
great a great model and what I'm really
suggesting by my
work is to augment this by adding an
additional perspective to consider the
identity construction that people are
going through in their interactions with
products so let's get into a little bit
of theory here what can consumer
behavior researchers tell us as HCI
practitioners that's important and so
there's this this more than 100 year old
idea that people are what they possess
and the image i chose here is of a
mother and a child and that the
possession of a child is what makes a
mother a mother fundamentally without
that i'll call it an artifact a kid but
but without a child is a mother a mother
like what's what gives you that sense of
being that enactment of a role and that
people really construct themselves
through their possessions that we decide
who it is we are and who we want to be
and who we were through the things that
we collect around us it finally it's the
idea that people form very strong
attachments to products that represent
who they are right now and who they were
and what is meaningful to us is this
connection both to our past into our
present so Russell Belk in 1988 wrote a
seminal work dealing in the space of
identity construction of products called
possessions and the extended self and
those of you that have sort of had maybe
a lot of sociological training they have
encountered this but it's the idea that
people extend themselves through their
possessions and so you can think of
starting at your body is your body
yourself you know if you cut off your
arm is that yourself now that's removed
or sort of where are you and really
talking about itself in a Margaret Mead
sort of way where the South becomes this
other you can have a conversation with
yourself get outside yourself and what
is it you know where are you and where
is the self in this construction and and
his evidence for this and it's sort of
looking at people's possessions for
things like looking at people that had
lost all of their possessions in a fire
and who are you after that
do you have this actual loss of self
through a loss of physical possessions
who are you after lots of a spouse after
a loss of a child after the loss of a
parent even when you move away from your
home with the loss of a place how does
that affect who you are and that
fundamentally were more than just sort
of this bag of meat but that were this
cluster of all the things around us that
we extend ourselves to and he builds his
model on Sarge's three states of
existence of having doing and being I
mean I think this is a particularly good
model as we think about HCI practice so
people have products so I have my my
laptop here to engage in doing so I have
it it allows me to do things and in both
having and doing I understand who I am
in relationship to the product so people
have imagined conversations with
themselves what would it be like to use
this product who would people think I am
if they saw me using it and then they
have the real social construction of
going out into the world and using the
product and having people react to them
differently based on that and through
that they create a sense of who they are
again in connection with the product and
that's where these attachments come from
and again as a designer this is not what
we discussed in design school about how
to design products that that was all
about helping people understand who they
are some early work by ericsson and some
more recent work by klein klein and alan
frame this in terms of life narratives
and in sort of how products situate in
there and this is there's sort of a lot
of work in this space that's looking at
people's prized possessions or most
loved objects and that's a great
perspective for understanding the theory
but the life narratives approach is
really the idea that people have a
current understanding of who they are of
who they were that they want to hold on
to and who they were that they would
like to discard and that in sort of
getting rid of products from our past
we're actually discarding the parts of
ourselves that we no longer want to
associate with ourselves and by holding
on to
certain artifacts sort of in that form
of attachment we're defining who we are
in a passo we're not just constructing
our future but we construct our past as
well and so how do you design a product
that allows itself through its used to
to reframe who you were I think it's a
great opportunity it really brings this
idea of products as symbols of people
into view and the client sort of
extended this work really digging into
this idea of loved possessions and they
looked at the scales of affiliation and
autonomy and could begin to plot product
attachments in a three-dimensional space
looking at does it does it bind you to a
group I'm so is this product like we or
not does it actually make you feel not
affiliated with certain groups and does
it give you a sense of autonomy and when
they looked at the possessions people
loved the most they often had both a
high quality of affiliation and the high
quality of autonomy so if somebody could
find a perfect gift for you it would be
an affiliate a gift that reminded you of
your affiliation to a group that you
care about but also had a personal
aspect of who you are within that group
and these are all linked to the past
that the attachments are to who we are
now and who we were but we don't collect
products and we don't have strong
attachments to who we might become the
clines working with current also applied
social identity theory and looking at
product attachments and this really
takes a role centric view so thinking
that people enact a whole bunch of
different roles in their lives how does
this how does this play a part in the
products that we choose and the core
elements are the social roles that we
enact the social identity and the ideal
identity I just want to break this down
for a second so a social role for
example like a college student you're
going to become a college student people
have this imagined idea of what does it
mean to be a college student made up of
all of the examples both positive and
negative they have encountered up to the
point that they enact this role and that
for them becomes what does it mean to be
a college student in addition they have
a social identity which is who they
think they are as a college student and
that's both sort of all their positive
and negative qualities you know I'm a
procrastinator I'm a hard worker sort of
all of the things that they feel about
themselves and generally that's very
close to the social role because they
want to be recognized in the role in
addition they have an ideal identity
which is who they really desire to be in
that role sort of without all of their
neuroses but this is really what I'd
like to be like and often that's very
unclear and often it can have very
contradictory aspect so as a college
student you may want to be the person
that's always partying and the person
that's getting straight A's and they can
be mutually exclusive and that's
perfectly fine because it's the ideal
and it's not necessarily achievable and
maybe not even desirable once they
really begin to think about it and so in
looking at product attachments the
client and Curran ran a number of
studies and what they were showing is
that attachments people develop to
products and then it's a case I'm really
talking about people in their lives that
their own physical possessions and the
places they inhabit aren't to the core
self but they're actually to the the
social identity and ideal identity
matched to the specific roles that
people in act so as you enact different
roles and a specific role becomes
important to you that's when somebody
creates a social identity and an ideal
identity and if you want to get new
products into people's lives if you want
to influence what is selected you know
as they're moving through walmart what
are they pulling up the shelf or is
there going on the internet what
services are they choosing this is the
place what's the connection that you're
making to somebody's social identity and
ideal identity that's what brings the
product into their life as they develop
a relationship if it becomes meaningful
to them that's where the attachment
comes from so just trying to put it all
together sort of looking at at the
models of this social construction
process of identity construction the
products play a tremendously
passive role they're picked and used by
people but they're not sort of active
participants in the process and that
people really possess them in order to
use them and to become who it is they
might be and that attachment really
forms through the construction of the
life narrative so it's actually through
the use but it's also in the reflection
that we create the stories as we reflect
back on what's happened in our lives and
that the meaning often comes from
looking backwards um attachment comes
through the channels of affiliation so
does it bind you to a group and from
autonomy both very important and they
can be combined together in general this
doesn't go into the future this is very
much grounded in the present in the past
but this sense of who we are and who we
desire to be within a specific role is
what brings new products and services
into our lives and so as a sort of new
product developer that becomes the
Gateway to get in but can you also
design things that pick up the back end
that allow for this form of strong
attachment and I just love this this
quote from Fight Club you were not your
car you are not your bank account you
were not the contents of your wallet you
are not your grande latte you are not
your khakis because I think they're sort
of this movement of sort of trying to
get people to reject these marketing
messages you are at these things and yet
the research is really revealing you are
but that you're actually a very active
participant in constructing them and you
aren't you are more than your khakis you
are the constellation of all of the
products that you have selected and
brought into your lives and that you
know in a sense people are very much
creating individually who they are and
who they want to be so going back to the
model of experience of thinking of
interaction interactive products as
connecting people to people people to
places and people to products taking an
identity view ads this additional idea
that what we're trying to do is make
products that allow people to connect
back to themselves how does this product
help people understand who they are and
who it is that they want to be
so where do we go from here some
questions for me sort of coming out of
my exploration of the theory is canned
products play an active role in helping
people define who it is they want to be
and move towards their ideal identity of
themselves in a role can products
provide a scaffolding for the identity
construction process instead of just
playing a passive role that where
they're allowing themselves to be picked
you know chosen and discard it can they
actually play a much more active role in
helping people define goals and can we
design products that help people feel
better about themselves and in doing so
do we have a great opportunity to make
products that people have a much
stronger attachment to and become much
more meaningful to them in their lives
so some opportunities in synthesizing
through this information I identified
four main opportunity areas the last two
were the ones that I care about most but
I think actually all for a fairly rich
so roll expression role switching role
enhancement and roll transition I want
to touch on them briefly I just give an
idea of what they really are so roll
expression I think it's it's fairly
obvious and we see it in a lot of
products it's this ability to customize
or personalized or imprint our identity
onto a product and i think the the nike
shoes is a great example and I know it's
a designer on a lot of products that
I've been asked to design people would
say you know the product managers come
to me and say if people just love to
customize products so we should make
this customizable without any
understanding of why are people
customizing what is it they're actually
trying to accomplish and so I think
identity taking an identity construction
perspective gives us a sense of what's
the goal that they're trying to
accomplish and opens up new ideas of how
we might allow for customization and
personalization to allow for better self
presentation role switching sort of a
strange idea but that people enact
multiple roles so this is a very po
modern view that were made up of
multiple fragmented cells and can we
make products that remind us of who we
are and the one of the examples I really
like is the ego phone done by Yun Chao
Chung which sort of works like status
messages in IM where you can have
expressions of your availability across
multiple communication channel so your
email your mobile phone your instant
messaging but you can target it at
different groups so for this group I
have this set of availabilities for this
group and it's this idea that you
actually do have multiple sets of
relationships and that your product can
help you manage that cosmos is sort of
the almost the exact opposite idea it's
kind of trying to create role confusion
or a reminder of pastoral 'he's and this
is the idea of a mobile phone you know
you're sort of out in the world i'm in
san francisco i see the Golden Gate
Bridge I'm like wow this reminds me of
my good friend Tom I take a picture I
record a message and it's left there and
if my friend in the future ever should
sort of happen to wander through this
space maybe next week maybe 10 years
from now they get that message sort of
hanging in space and a reminded of this
past role in this past connection that
they have but it's the vision of the
world sort of full filled with all of
these messages of who you were and past
connection sort of little virtual gifts
role enhancement very much gets back to
the checker idea how can we make
products that make people feel better
about themselves and the roles that they
enact most of you that have had my class
at carnegie mellon had to design a music
player I just kind of torment my
students with that because I think it's
a great example of where there's a clear
set of functional needs but there's this
great sense of exploring the emotional
relationship people have two products so
as I've moved into this sense of
identity construction it's a new
requirement for this this process and
one of my student teams had to design a
product for moms so they went out and
found a bunch of sort of funk
tional needs people need to entertain
their kids the moms needed music for
their work apps sort of shield them from
the monotony and the pain but they also
explored a lot of the identity needs and
then sort of synthesized them down to
sort of which ones could we meet with in
this product and the ones they were they
chose we're really this connection to
children through the artifacts that
their children make that was
particularly important to the moms both
the receiving of them an expression back
to their children that they care about
the artifacts their children's make and
the value in sharing the artifacts their
children create with others particularly
other moms not necessarily in a
competitive way but certainly in a
connective way and so this is the fruit
music player each of these little wedges
holds a few songs maybe three songs
maybe five songs and if you hit the play
button on the back it plays a two second
sample from somewhere in that set of
song and by pushing the side ridges you
can move where that sample is and as the
wedges get assembled into a round music
player you can hit the play button you
hear this composition of two second
samples so the children can create these
music you know these very short musical
compositions that are creations that
they give to their moms are also
creating the playlist for the moms
exercise and it also becomes as artifact
that as a mom sort of encountering
people in the world she has this
artifact this creation or kids have made
that she can share well this is
certainly never intended to be a
commercial product it's a nice early
exploration that shows we can definitely
begin to identify these identity needs
and think about how they become
incorporated in a and a product role
transition is another area i think is
huge it's a huge opportunity for product
creation and examples of rural
transition so high school students have
to shed their high school identity and
discover who it is they they want to be
as a college student a couple that has a
baby and suddenly has to understand who
they are as a family smokers giving up
smoking and trying to decide who they
are as a nonsmoker and how does that
impact their sense of self
adult children who have to take on the
role of caregiver and their elder
parents have to take on the role of care
receiver after a lifetime of playing the
opposite roles this is a particularly
difficult transition and it full of a
lot of anxiety and in general that the
three main triggers are times of life
sort of you grow into them life events
particularly like an elder going into
decline birth of a baby death in the
family diagnosis of cancer and then
personal choice change of career change
of a personal habit a new affiliation
and in sort of looking for products in
this space there really aren't a lot I
think it's completely untapped so for
people that are particularly struggling
or just just having a lot of difficulty
with the transition there are things
like therapists life coaches and support
groups to help you deal with the
transitions but that sort of deals with
the extreme edge there's all kinds of
people that sort of flounder through but
successfully make the transition there's
professional groups and social
organizations that particularly deal
with creation of new affiliations and
more recently and maybe more relevant to
the work you guys do there's a lot of
people using personal web pages web
blogs even social networking software to
create potential digital cells of who
they might be in putting them out as
trial balloons to see how people react
to them so it's sort of looking at all
of this theory looking at all of these
opportunities in my own design practice
I've been trying to figure out how do we
operationalize this how do we actually
design with this idea of the identity
perspective or designing for the cell
and I just want to share a few insights
from the work I've done and I'd be
curious about how you think this might
influence the kind of work that you're
doing so the first project I want to
talk about is called the digital self
and we're tracking first-year college
students as they come in and they have
to shed their high school identity and
discover who they might want to be as a
college student and I chose this for a
number of wheat reasons one it's a
fabulous transition and that people are
super excited about it they're just
ready to embrace this transition they're
so happy to shed who they were as a high
school student and they have these great
expectations of who they might become it
also helps that i'm at a university
where every year i have a whole new
group of first-year students coming so
ease of my research definitely
influences this so i'm tracking 20
students right now through their first
year for their for their first semester
at least looking at how they create
these experimental digital cells test
them and move towards who it is they
might be as a college student and the
focus really here is can we design
products that help scaffold this
transition process and so just as a
focus setting going into this we came up
with a bunch of product opportunity
ideas so a mobile content acquisition
device i sort of where are people when
they have ideas of what they want to put
in one of their digital cells what are
the resources they have around them to
capture it how do they want to handle
the the media the construction of a
digital bin or pasteboard where they can
put their collection of artifacts that
they might want to share I'm give them a
space to work particularly for social
networking sites and personal web pages
a history that helps them reflect how
they've changed these products generally
just capture who you are in the moment
and in addition sort of by understanding
the process can we give the students
content acquisition exercises that help
them more fully explore who it is they
might be and actually improve the
quality of experience of making that
transition so we're doing very
traditional user centered design
connecting interviews and where we every
week capturing images of their digital
salves looking at how they change and
the interviews have been sort of very
interesting in that what we see in the
digital selves and what we see at the
interview are not always the same and
Pope but the tool that sort of proven
the most interesting is we're having
them take a lot of pictures of trying to
get them to express who they are in a
very quick and easy way so we ask them
every week to take three
pictures of things they think people
associate with college students and that
helps us understand what do they think
the social role of a college student is
and does that change over time they also
take three pictures of products people
associate with college students that
they would never want associated with
them and that gives us a view sort of
both on the social identity and the
ideal identity from the negative what
what don't they want connected to them
we have them take pictures of stuff they
use as a college student that's
particularly important to them so that's
an insight into their social identity
and products that they desire and that's
our insight into the ideal identity and
we've seen some really interesting
results don't just share some some early
findings so one this idea that the
digital sells really are often not a
good match to the actual participant
from the two in a good example we have
two participants who I my research team
describes as angry women sort of I think
of them as like Alanis Morissette
angst-filled apps change the world down
with corporations and when the so I have
like junior seniors and grad students
working as my research assistants going
out and conducting the interviews
they'll come back and say they're so
nice they're such nice girls and there's
this huge disconnect between what
they're expressing and who they are you
can really begin to see that they're
saying is this who I want to become is
this what I should be as a college
student and exploring this issue of
digital content acquisition like do they
want to go out and capture artifacts in
the world that they can use to create
and construct themselves what we
actually found is they have this much
bigger desire to browse what other
people's profiles look like and
interestingly enough they particularly
want to do this while in class
interesting and you know it's one of
those questions of why why is it in
class that they're actually thinking of
their social connections is it because
they're surrounded by their community we
had them take so we had them all take
pictures of things they don't want to
sociated with
them as a college student and of our 20
participants all of them took pictures
of beer which was just as amazing
consistency that we haven't seen
anywhere else and I think for the the
research team and myself were so
embedded in the culture of Carnegie
Mellon like to ask that's college even
though it's sort of very idiosyncratic
that the idea of beer in college was not
an association we make and so the fact
that they were bringing this in was
partly that they're not indoctrinated
into the culture of Carnegie Mellon yet
but that also there's this idea of what
colleges that you bring from high school
maybe actually quite homogeneous and and
finally you know in looking at the
products that they desire there was this
real move from fantasy to practicality
so in the first weeks we were seeing
things like I want a surround sound
system I want a sports car I want to you
know new high-end laptop I want this
really cool stuff and bye about a month
in we were seeing things like I want an
umbrella I want a jacket I want a bag
you know I got a backpack and in sort of
looking at the the tools they use they
went from like I use my phone I use my
laptop I'm hip and cool to things like I
use tied like mom's not around anymore
and this was a part of college they
didn't anticipate and yet that reality
is smack smacking into them and actually
changing them so I don't know where the
product opportunity is here but I feel
there is one and as we move forward I
think it's actually this really rich
space and in sort of trying to
operationalize this as a tool we're
using a persona technique but instead of
like the traditional set of personas
where you say well here's a typical user
or you know here's a kind of an extreme
example of a user we're actually doing
it over time so here's a college student
in their first week here's a college
student a month in here's a college
student two months and so we can
actually understand the change that's
taking place and can we design a product
that scaffolds that the other project
where we're really focusing on identity
is a smart home project on family
control in the smart
and we're looking at what should a smart
home do for dual income families and
we're really interested in dual income
families for a number of reasons one is
that they're aggressive adopters and
really experimental users of technology
particularly communication technology
and we see them as very ripe early
adopters for ubiquitous computing in
addition they feel like really crappy
parents most of the time partly they're
very sensitive to this because I've
chosen to be dual income and so they
feel like socially they're making this
choice that other people perceive that
they're bad parents and they carry that
with them so from a design perspective
trying to make people that feel really
crappy feel a little bit better seems
much easier than trying to find people
that are already happy with themselves
and making them feel better are our
third reason is my main collaborator and
end a and myself we are dual income
families with little kids so we're
trying to make things that make our
personal lives better and the nice thing
about university research is you can be
tremendously self-indulgent and still
get funding so the like one of the main
findings that drives us in this space we
like this this idea from Valerie
friesian at tno is this idea that dual
income families particularly with young
children feel like they live in the rush
hour like every moment of their life is
the rush hour they've got a million
things to do in their trapped in traffic
and cannot get anywhere this is just
constant anxiety that drags on them from
a ubiquitous computing sense and even an
HCI sense we're trying to recast this
idea of control so in general and
ubicomp when they talk about control of
a smart home it's what can I make the
devices in my home do and we're really
cast recasting that looking at these
families they really don't care what
devices they control they want to feel
more in control of their lives so
instead of saying what can I do with my
home it really becomes what can my home
do for me that makes me feel better and
that's a really radical change in
perspective that we got a lot of great
feedback from that at ubicomp
and sort of trying to model what all
this means we look at this identity
space at the bottom there's this real
desire for these dual income parents to
feel like good parents and they're very
sensitive to this but they actually
really desire it and part of that is
like how can I empower my children to
succeed and this may be a particularly
American phenomena with high levels of
layoffs but there's this desire to give
their children survival skills that
drives them to enroll them in enrichment
activities so they'll enroll them in
soccer not just to fill their time or
because the kids like soccer but they
want them to get teamwork skills they
want them to get leadership skills
they're actually all of these sort of
larger identity goals that drive all of
these activities they're killed kids
become involved in and this is what
chuck dar just defines as sort of the
busyness of the dual income family that
there's sort of all of this stuff you
need to manage all the little details
and that parents actually desire to
effortlessly manage the busyness and
demonstrate that effortless management
of it to their children because that's a
life skill they want their children to
have but the parents really don't
effortlessly manage the busyness that's
one of the main drivers of why they feel
so crappy the deviations in the life are
the biggest causes of breakdown so if
you look at an example like soccer the
one we see repeatedly parents have to
remember practice uniforms home uniforms
away uniforms different kinds of shoes
for different kinds of surfaces that
practices take place in one area at one
time games take place in a whole bunch
of different places they have to arrange
the transportation and you know it's a
struggle but they seem to be able to
maintain all that but then once every
six weeks you also have to take orange
slices for halftime and this sort of
this high deviation activity is where
the breakdown almost always occurs and
that there's this tremendous social cost
for your child to be the child that
didn't deliver the orange slices at
halftime that your failure becomes your
child's failure and then you see these
parents like dropping the kids off
running
maniacs trying to find oranges getting a
little plastic knife trying to cut them
up to deliver for their kids they don't
feel good about themselves they don't
feel good about the situation and there
aren't a lot of tools that can support
them in this and so when things are
working they feel completely controlled
by their schedule they have no
flexibility to do anything and when
things aren't working they feel
completely out of control so how can you
design a home that sort of finds the
balance between the two that makes them
feel in control of their lives and
that's really what we're doing and that
loss of control really impacts their
identity and again drives this feeling
that they're not a good parent so we
feel this is a huge product opportunity
space in taking an identity perspective
in sort of doing this work we don't have
a lot of great techniques but one of the
things we're doing is just sort of
keeping our eyes open for what we see so
we've spent a lot of time looking at
calendars just trying to understand how
people are organized the activities and
this is an example of a calendar we
found in a home and if you'll notice on
the twenty-second the word misfits is
written these huge blue letters on the
calendar and this is a play that their
child is in this is not written on the
calendar because the parents are afraid
they're going to forget that this is
taking place but this is a way that the
parents expressed to both themselves and
their child sort of constructing this
family identity that this kind of
activity is very important to them and
they're making a very sort of public
presentation of the importance of this
event and so that the calendar then goes
from just sort of a marker of deviations
of the things I need to remember to do
to also a place of expressing what is
important to a family and generally that
kind of idea is almost never considered
by people making digital calendaring
artifacts so the design questions that
come out and I just love this picture
because this this is what it always
feels like when I try to work at home
kids start riding their bikes inside can
the home make parents feel like better
parents is there a real opportunity
there I think there's this huge question
of control if you think the home is sort
of the largest identity possession
somebody has it's a fabulous possession
for
because it allows you to imprint on it I
put my furniture in it I get to choose
what the house is I get to paint the
walls any color I want I can come and
you know if I have enough money move
walls around redo things I can make it
my own what happens when a house becomes
sort of proactive and starts doing
things there's this loss of control and
do we fundamentally change what a home
means and how can designers become very
sensitive to that there's also the sense
of wind do devices become the home
itself so in general things like a
microwave or a KitchenAid mixer very
much just feel like a device and a house
that you take in and out but things like
your hot water heater your furnace your
electricity feel like they're the home
and at what point are we designing
devices and at what point are we
actually designing the home itself and I
think designers need to be very
sensitive to that particularly in this
case of identity construction and
finally how actively should the home
participate in identity construction
should it say things like gosh you're
being a good mom today like should it
give that kind of feedback and actually
and we tested one of those ideas in an
experience prototype we did where the
home said you've done a great job today
let me pour a bath and you know we
thought that we're way across the
boundary people are going to react
really negatively to this and the
parents were like oh thank you and it's
like there's you know you just reminded
us children never say thank you for all
the things you do for them and the
parents are actually so starved for
recognition of what they do they would
take it from the home he's like why we
were just goofing around we didn't we
didn't mean to find that but for us it's
just sort of every space we look here
we're seeing great opportunity so we're
making a construction we're constructing
an activity manager which is you know
the real focus functionally is to assist
with planning coordination and
improvisation around sort of getting all
of these activities down of managing the
busyness and we're really looking at
reducing the breakdowns by finding the
high deviations and sort of rising them
to the surface so they're easy to see
and that deals functionally with all of
this up to
causing the negative effect but in sort
of just testing those ideas we found we
really weren't making people feel like
better parents and potentially we were
creating a situation where they were
just going to do more stuff which isn't
necessarily what we want that they're
just doing more and feeling just as
crappy so we started to tease out these
other ideas one being this idea of gifts
of time how can we open the home create
opportunities for people within the
family to make investments of their time
and attention on the other people in the
family so if you look at an activity
like cooking a lot of the parents that
we talk to feel like when they cook for
their family they're making an
investment and it makes them feel like a
better parent but when they make a
shopping list they don't get that
feeling so what's just sort of the
maintenance work what is really a
valuable activity and where can you
begin to offer assistance that gives
real value so we're trying to sort of
look where the opportunities for
automation and then what are the sort of
family identity weights of those
activity to get a better sense of how
automation comes in we're also really
playing with this idea of raising
resources this this comes out of another
one of our experience prototypes where
we had people walking by a washing a
dryer and it would say oh your kids are
closing here since you're here maybe you
should take them up and put them away
the parents pretty much across the board
set don't tell me that oh my kids to put
their own clothes away and it's this
idea of Ken can the home play an active
role particularly an automated home in
providing opportunities for parents to
give responsibilities to their children
to actively participate in raising with
this idea that the goal of the home is
to help parents raise children who can
go out in the world and be successful
and again traditionally you become does
not frame the evaluation of their
products in those terms so finally I
just want to bring this all together the
final slide I believe actually by taking
an identity construction approach taking
this idea of designing for the self of
how a product connects somebody back to
themselves provides a rich perspective
HCI practitioners to engage in
experience design it sort of not meant
to replace other methods people are
using but to supplement it and I think
there are there's a great potential to
design products and services that allow
for a much stronger attachment I'm
interested in and can we make the
process more explicit can we make it
clear that people are engaged in
identity construction can we scaffold
life changes can we design products that
help people through these transitions
and therefore bind themselves to people
much more strongly and can we help
people feel better about themselves in
the roles they enact both at work where
I think there are huge opportunities and
generally in their life and all of the
roles they interact and I think those
are actually great opportunities and
that is it for me
I think we may have time for a question
or two does anyone Michelle Michelle
I was really interested in your mention
of the home as one artifact of an
identity because I'm curious about
situations where people might have
different identities they're trying to
present either present to the world or
construct as ideal ones and what happens
when there's a situation where you might
want to hide pieces or more strongly
present other pieces of an identity for
example in a as a home if you have a
home office and you have clients coming
to visit you you're proud to be a good
parent but you might want to sort of
suppress some of the artifacts that you
okay so we've seen a lot of that
behavior and it's it's actually also
very complex because particularly
children as they get older more towards
their teen years have this desire to
express their own identity particularly
in their bedrooms in a way that the
parents don't appreciate and there's
questions of ownership of whose identity
is the house who owns it and what's a
family identity what's an individual
identity and so we see a lot where
people sort of construct very private
spaces and almost going into that space
push puts you in a specific role in the
home office is definitely one of those
we're sort of you're not the mom when
you're in there you're sort of engaged
in this work or role and I don't know if
it's possible to sort of make the home
recognize the roles you are and
transform the services it's providing
you based on its recognition of who are
you in this moment there's also this
interesting tension between parents and
kids where the kids desire security but
they also desire independence and the
parents desire to take care of their
kids and desire to make their kids
responsible and sort of their these two
paradoxical forces constantly competing
but that's sort of what family is and
I'm not sure it's the homes role to get
involved in in that big quagmire yeah um
you said that people's wish lists the
first year students wish lists changed
over time do you think that's process of
the fact that they're in university and
restaurants move themselves or partly
the exercise of of making these lists so
how much
how much is is the exercise influencing
the student well I think the exercise
definitely has an influence although we
tried you know we try to make it open
like take a picture of anything you want
there's also a desire people not to take
a picture of the same thing they feel
this need to not keep re representing
the thing but I you know in looking at
the transition and sort of looking at
the the research on the transitions
there's this real change that they're
undertaking and their actual desires do
changes they're really understanding who
it is they want to be so I think we're
getting some of both but what's really
interesting is the consistency we're
seeing across the participants which
makes me feel that we're actually seeing
a real effect and not just sort of some
artificial effect yeah I mean ideally if
I can keep getting funding I'd love to
track the students through and like try
to see when do they slow down what we
have seen is the like at first we were
seeing a lot of students using social
networking services and I am like six
hours a day it was definitely impacting
their ability to get their schoolwork
done but maybe it was actually really
important and that as they develop a
circle of friends the amount of time
they spend doing this goes way down and
I don't know when it sort of hits a
steady state and that to us would be
sort of the time to let go but can you
make a product that sort of take
somebody through and then you actually
have this great new transition process
of I've graduated from college what the
hell do I do now which maybe is often a
less happy time full of a whole bunch of
different anxieties alright we're going
to be going to lunch probably round 1130
and then 12 watts of time actually I
