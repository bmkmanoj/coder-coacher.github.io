wells fargo as well in production
management say that's pretty accurate
yes working closely with you Ed mobile
development yes and that's our crew so
thank you guys for coming we'll start
out you know I just wanted to do a brief
overview how many people here are
working currently in mobile or uh they
are working in a company that has mobile
available and you'd like to work in it
ok cool and who here knows nothing about
mobile in here you don't you came to
figure it out great great ok good it's
good to know excellent just kind of a
brief overview for the panel will start
out the first question basically this is
about context why did you guys get
involved in mobile what attracted all of
you ladies to the mobile side of either
youtube ebay doing it yourself working
in within google you know within the
larger organizations you worked for or
as an entrepreneur when we start with
Christina sorry I'm kind of picking on
you cuz you're the farthest away I think
for me I was always sort of interested
in mobile I had done my grad school
project on instructional design for
handheld devices and the first two years
I was at YouTube I work on the desktop
site and I kind of wanted to do
something that was fun and different and
innovative and at that time you know
myself and then my friend people decide
is actually currently my co-founder at
pig feet and youtube in general we we
saw that you know 3g was coming out more
3g hand devices were becoming more
popular and that you know YouTube
content its small snack size content
right and it fit very well on the mobile
device and we're like hey let's just
give us a shot and see what happens
right like now is the time to do this
and it it turned out pretty well right
so I started being interested in mobile
probably back in 2001 I was working for
a company called quidnunc it was a
british-based digital consultancy in the
states and way back then the company
allowed basically all employees to
explore kind of their interests in new
technologies and back then broadband was
used as a word that was considered it
newer technology pretty funny so of
course I was very interested in mobile
back then but only dreaming of the
possibilities because the technology and
the the networking carriers just didn't
have the possibilities that we were
talking about with you know the old
Starbucks
marketing when you walk by etc so um
basically when I came to ebay i had an
opportunity to work on the iphone
application this is before the app store
launch so we were one of the 10 featured
WWDC and when the opportunity came up
definitely jumped on it was a basically
me in a product manager and and we
launched the app and it was a great
success so that's kind of how I got
involved purely by accident so some ten
years ago I joined ericsson back in
North Carolina Research Triangle Park
and after i joined the research team i
understood wow the potential of the
technology and the wireless and ever
since I'm in love with mobile I cannot
even think of a carrier outside wireless
are Turks and I was at Sun and now i'm
at Google all doing wireless mobile
platforms I think the dwarf for me for
mobile was I like I like to look at a
platform as a think about what's unique
about it if it's new like mobile as it
was emerging the fact that it was
emerging and this sounds a little silly
but the fact that it was mobile
something you could take with you and
that presents a whole bunch of unique
opportunities I think and so that was
exciting to me and and and then also um
Android kind of lured me in once I
started just investigating mobile
because it was it was open and and there
was a way for independent developers to
get in the gates which there wasn't
really so much elsewhere at the time so
that's what kind of Lord me and the
Android developer challenge that's a
good incentive to so I've actually been
historically uninterested in mobile
I always felt that people were really
only interested in it because of the
gadgets and that the lock that the
carriers had stifled creativity but in
the last few years mobile phones are
more powerful than computers were when I
started programming and I think that
even though they're more constrained
than today's computers it's really
exciting because of the capabilities of
the mobile devices let them do things
that computers can't really do kind of
like what you're saying and so I got
really excited about mobile and have
gotten into mobile development in the
last year actively and I'm just really
interested in doing in the new different
types of apps that you can't do on
desktops that you can do a mobile I
basically started becoming interested in
mobile as it came to sought to seek me
through wells fargo i had an opportunity
to go to the mobile banking development
group there and and the reason one of
the reasons i I thought it was very
appealing was because that was the this
was probably around three years ago
we're still a lot of people were
carrying around razors and maybe
blackberries but it was way before
iphone and and you can kind of see the
emerging you know the the PDA out there
that it was going to become the the next
wave of you know the the technology was
going to be focusing on mobile devices
and coming from a pc kind of web app
development world i was sort of
plateauing on that and i was curious as
to how mobile development was different
from just your typical web application
so that's how I started getting into and
then once iphone came it really was a
validation that mold the mobile industry
was really where it was going to be and
and so with Wells Fargo and also with
with Sheik topia now we have our own
iPhone app here to that you know that's
that's where its leading and now even
further with Android phones further
validation that
we're in the right space and I got into
it for the devices I was blissfully
unaware of the carrier kind of
oppression of anything interesting you
really wanted to do working and trying
to get on deck with a carrier was a big
wake-up call it a former startup that I
worked at and but I could see the
potential it was like 1994-95 all over
again it was just amazing plus you could
carry this around it's like I have cheat
sheets and they're sitting right here
you know so that to me was just powerful
and impressive and so that brings me to
the next point of like you guys you
create things for mobile what your users
want can you talk a little bit about how
you discover what kind of what you're
going to put out there for people not so
much the technical side per se but kind
of a bigger like you know what's what's
what's the user feedback and what kind
of things are they looking for what do
people want on their phone and personal
what do you want on your phone um let's
start with current I mean having an
application that's mobile means that you
know you have to think about what does
the customer want to do on the go and
with the Wells Fargo application in
particular there's they're actually
three different kind of platforms that
that that they have one is text banking
and that's essentially SMS where you can
view your account balances etc just read
only information but then you can also
use the the browser on your mobile
device and then view your balances and
do bill pay and transfers and and then
there's also the applications
downloadable applications such as the
iphone app where you know it's it's very
similar to the the browser expiry
with added features for for the app and
one of the things you think about is you
want to do something immediately on your
whip but you're not at home so what
would that be one is you need money with
well so you know ATMs how can I find one
easily based on where I am and now with
how many phones have GPS that is one of
the big things that you can leverage and
and I think with a lot of apps that's
one of the primary assets for the phone
that is very unique to it that the PC
doesn't have the other is just what kind
of things you have to do kind of you
don't really have the time to go home to
do it so in this case stuff like paying
your bills or if you're like your
daughter calls up and says I need two
hundred dollars right away because I
want these pairs of shoes you know like
can you transfer that money over a stop
then you know you have your phone there
and you can do that for them stuff like
that or or the other one with with our
appt with chictopia we think about well
you're not a home but you just want to
pass the time because you're standing in
line and you know you want to just do
something and so one of the things we
have is you can browse photos and just
kind of you know if you like to do that
and and you know that's that's something
you can do when I think that's where
games kind of come into play for apps so
I I totally agree with you in terms of
thinking about what you can do with a
mobile phone that you can't do anywhere
else and what do you need to do when
you're stuck somewhere and what we're
doing at mighty verse is we're really
interested in how people communicate
across languages and across cultures and
we have the iphone app lets you but you
can download right now just look for
mighty verse we just released it three
weeks ago the app lets you access native
language
recordings that are video recordings but
we don't really know exactly how people
will use this app we have all sorts of
ideas we could spend the next year
developing our ideal app before we
released it instead we thought of the
smallest possible feature set that we
could possibly bear to release and we
released that and you might look at the
app and think Oh what are they thinking
but what we're doing is we are working
with people who are interested in using
language that they don't that they're
not native in and working with them to
figure out to test the use cases and to
see what features they need and what the
app really resonates with and this is
you know sort of a practice of agile
development and I think it's a really
neat opportunity because you have this
mobile app that people can use in their
real life and you can witness how people
use it in the context of their real-life
interactions I think people really want
something they can use in their everyday
and that's why in our case with cooking
capsules it's something that makes life
easier and that's what I want from a nap
I want something that there's too much
going on already too much complication
so something that simplifies your life
so the simpler the better so um um you
know you said the the very least feature
set in the beginning that's what we're
doing to its it's just watch shop and
make I mean it's watch a little cooking
show like two-minute cooking show find
out how to make something shop with your
built-in ingredients list on your way
home go home make it with your checklist
and you know and there's such a
temptation to keep adding all these
bells and whistles and of course you
know everybody's saying oh you could do
this and you could do that oh yeah I
could do that you know but you got to
really stop and very and be very
deliberate about what you add because I
think really what people want is
simplicity and that's that's what I want
to something of interest to me is like
to see how people are using their mobile
phones outside us especially in emerging
countries
while I hear stories about mobile phone
being the only communication mechanism
in that city or village and they share
this phone amongst the community to talk
sometimes that's also the only way they
are accessing the Internet that's pretty
powerful that's really powerful I heard
stories about farmers in Brazil using
the mobile phone there's one mobile
phone they use it on an hourly basis to
check the prices of coffee beans in
international markets so they can time
they're setting of coffee that's pretty
pretty amazing I think ultimately
technology should make people's lives
better help them make better decisions
like you said help simplify their lives
and so when fortunately when I was
creating my app our community is very
vocal so um you were talking about how
do you how do you create things that
customers want and how do you um how do
you know that you're doing that so um we
we also tried to keep things very simple
and and you know thought about people
what do they need when they're out and
about you know like I said making better
decisions should i buy this thing now
should I buy it later you know do I want
to be more socially responsible and buy
a used one I'm a business owner and if I
don't get that return that communication
I might not get that sail and so I need
to maintain my business and keep things
going while a mountain about so those
were some key things that we looked at
just hours and hours of listening to our
customers to help create a better
product in the end I think I definitely
grew that everybody hear that start with
like a bass future set right and then
iterate upon that and keep it as simple
as possible and one thing that you know
I definitely learned as people don't
have a lot of time when they're on their
mobile device right it's usually a short
period of time there at the doctor's
office or you know on the train or
something like that and so you know at
YouTube we definitely took that in
consideration we were designing the UI
for instance when we added
related videos to be closer to the the
video thumbnail on the watch page are
views went up right just an easy way to
expose more content so people can you
know find it very easily in a short
period of time but then I'm also
constantly surprised by mobile two
things that you know I don't understand
how people you know why they're using it
this way and it's very surprising which
is why I like mobile for instance we
thought that browse would be more
popular on mobile than search right
because it's kind of difficult if you
don't have a qwerty keyboard to type in
you know the name of a video but
actually what we found was like people
search more instead of browse on a
mobile device yeah yeah there's a lot of
unexpected so that you get depending on
who your audience and who your your
users are yeah yeah I noticed that the
same way we were setting up a social
network online on mobile and doing a
bare-bones framework same kind of thing
of like we kind of had an idea of what
people how they used it and we kind of
understood what some of the things were
that they need but you set up with that
bare bones and you put it out there and
you really listen hard you work closely
with your community manager or the
person who's doing the taking care of
feedback and you know you just rapidly
put stuff out though that people demand
if they're screaming for it it's good
idea to try to work it into if you can
align it with your business strategy
work it into the into the what you're
releasing how many of you guys have
worked with um whap are is anybody
working on an agnostic platform it's it
mostly are you mostly working with abs
mmm Oh doing a website mmm okay Sarah
Ellen I expected you to be more agnostic
with phonegap and well um specific I'm
not doing any web stuff but I do do a
bunch of cross-platform work in it while
and I have a consulting company which is
helping me fund my little startup my
partners and I still have separate jobs
and I have a business where we do mobile
apps
for people and what we've used a couple
of technologies rhomobile is a
technology that lets you build a single
source and and Ruby code and HTML and
CSS and build the same app across
multiple platforms and phonegap is
another one that lets you do multiple
cross-platform targets and those
platforms will let you target a number
of different platforms which is really
helpful if you have pretty broad if you
need pretty broad adoption and if your
app has has a UI that works well with
with fairly standard UI elements for
something that is very integrated with
video it doesn't make a lot of sense if
you have game like interaction it
doesn't make a lot of sense but for the
majority of mobile apps if you want to
just extend your presence to mobile
using one of these cross-platform
frameworks can make a lot of sense and
that's some of you may have known
symbian opened up that I think the last
week Android is considered much more
open than Apple's iPhone platform do you
guys have any you know comments about
some best practices working in either or
and kind of what you like or why you
either if you made the decision or if
you helped make the decision which
direction you went deciding which
platform you wanted to go on to if we
can talk about that a little bit that'd
be great so I can speak a little bit
about how I guess Wells makes their
decisions it basically was a time to
market thing and also a demand based on
how many users are on that particular
phone so at the time we were responding
to iPhone because there was we we could
tell that there was a huge spike
users are using the iphone and and it
only made sense for us to jump into that
whole industry of creating an iphone app
so that's how we kind of got started
with that and there definitely is a ramp
up in learning objective c if you don't
already and a whole process around
getting that application into the store
which with wells i wasn't really that a
part of that but with my my own app with
she Toby I definitely did feel some of
the pains with with putting that in the
store which you know I it's it's it's
interesting for if you're coming from a
technical background to learn a new
language so for me I'm you know I was
happy to do it but you know just to
expect that there is a little bit of
transition with that I think one of the
appeals with with that palm is trying to
do with the palm OS is that it they're
trying to make it lower barrier to entry
and make it just you're using HTML and
CSS and you're able to you know put up
an appt easily as well as you know with
I believe Android with it being
java-based that a lot of people are
already using job and there's a lot more
people that know java versus objective-c
that it makes it a lot easier for people
to create apps on there and i personally
think that's going to take off a lot
faster than the palm but yeah so yeah i
wanted to add something about WebKit um
serves developer to speak to the
developers an audience but i think it's
important to even realize you know as a
business owner or making any decisions
with technology decisions about mobile
that it's really exciting that we're
seeing a lot seeing a number of
different platforms adopt WebKit so it's
on android and iphone and now palm
blackberry has announced that our has a
acquired a company that has a
webkit-based browser
unfortunately I hear that blackberry is
still planning on doing its proxy server
so you'll get dumbed down HTML pages for
web applications which is very
unfortunate blackberry please change
that if you're watching but in terms of
application development you can what a
number of the cross-platform plant
frameworks do or you can do in your
application is you can put a little mini
web browser embedded into your app so
that you can develop your application in
HTML and CSS and with WebKit because
it's got such sophisticated graphics
capabilities then you can end up having
something that looks just like a native
UI and have it run across most um most
phones cuz actually developing in five
different languages I'm maintaining that
it may be fun for the first release but
then it stops being fun makes developers
very popular in mobile job security for
developers ladies get into development
please exactly so I think the question
was sort of what what right yeah I've
only ever been on Android so far and the
reason that um yeah I don't even know
how to address best practices exactly
but the reason that we chose the Android
is because it was before it was before
either of the app stores I am it was
before Apple's App Store and before the
android market even existed but there
was the promise of the android market I
mean it wasn't explicitly stated but it
was like we're opening this up for
developers and and there is sort of a do
you remember the kind of PR thing there
was like it would tell us what it was it
was like it was like we wouldn't we
wouldn't be doing our job if we didn't
provide some conduit for which
developers could distribute their apps
or something like and that was sort of
the refrain yeah and that was right and
so I knew that there was gonna be
something approximating a store of some
sort of some way to distribute the app
eventually so
and then and then I you know though I
came from a web design background and
and so just got into mobile just just
when this Android buzz started happening
and just when the Android developer
challenge had been announced found out
about that and I'm not a I'm not a
programmer I consider myself kind of a
developer but I'm not a programmer I'm a
designer and experience designer and and
um you know I look and feel whatever so
so I approached programmers and on the
Android message boards found all these
programmers who wanted to develop
something but didn't have an idea or
didn't have you know whatever and so we
we ended up you know entering the
Android challenge and winning in the top
20 of the Android developer challenge
and so you know i'm all for android big
fan of andhra after the 125 thousand
dollars from the from the challenges but
no I just think I I've always believed
in the promise of it and I'll never just
you know say oh well this is you know
iphone killer this is better than iphone
it's just it's just the whole concept of
it the whole openness of it and the fact
that there's all of these devices and
not only just handhelds but all these
other devices possible and that's kind
of why we've started with Android and I
think it is nice to do cross platform
but like you said you know it's great to
have it on all the platforms but then
you have to maintain it you know and
that's no small task to keep doing
updates for all these different
platforms so I think you kind of have to
pick and choose well of course I'm
biased so i would say um i would love to
see great apps on Android and that's the
plug for the evening
so we obviously evaluate each platform
based on the reach we want to obviously
reach the largest amount of customers
that we can we obviously support the
majors because that's going to give us
the largest reach I'd say we probably
got our biggest bang for the buck with
iphone app because we basically came out
with the announcement of the app store
so that was a huge both PR opportunity
for us as well as just a lot of our
customers we were going to we have an
annual conference called eBay live and a
lot of our customers we're watching
they're already managing their business
like you know checking their their
business on the actual Safari browser so
we also use a lot of a WebKit
implementation because we um we
basically create one version of the site
and internationalize so there's a lot of
just cost saved in that that way so are
using web kit in your mobile app we are
item description and paypal over the
native app and new features to come um I
know YouTube we definitely had a very
multifaceted approach right we had a
downloadable application and then we
also had the iphone app and then we had
the mobile website and personally I'm a
very big fan of you know the mobile web
just because you know globally there's a
larger reach and it's more scalable in
my opinion but um yeah so definitely
like cross-platform and I know one of
you told me a story about how Steve Jobs
said he loved your application does
anybody else want to tell their tales of
triumph and how much Google loves their
application it gave you lots of money or
you know just let's talk about some of
the like really great things that
happened and came out of your mobile
development and you know an anecdote
would be great if you could talk about
some of the good things because I know
we just talked about oh yeah it's hard
and you're gonna plant pick one platform
but yeah talk about some of the good
stuff Carlin you want to start cuz
you're blushing are you referring to me
know so job soon cause he loved art he
called it this is the meat and potatoes
app of the top test so which worked it
for we weren't doing it right but yeah
we were meeting potatoes so honestly
that whole process was quite interesting
I mean there was a like a lot of people
being considered for the announcement
and so it was I felt like I was on
American Idol seriously and every day we
go back and make our pitch and you know
there was some major companies that
didn't practice their keynote every day
and they got on stage and choked choked
and so they didn't make the final cut
but it was very interesting process very
fun I can tell story yeah so um one of
my partner's Glen just went on a trip to
Japan with one of our advisors ty
Roberts who is CTO of grace note and he
took my tea verse along with a few dozen
Jeff phrases in Japanese um so you can
go look on my diverse for I am hi Robert
CTO of grace note and other exciting
phrases um but he actually they did a
will have a little movie cover this
coming out soon but he went to he
recorded like where can you find great
coffee and they went to a stopped in the
subway in Tokyo and played this phrase
for this Japanese woman the shop and she
spoke rapidly in Japanese um in ways
that they didn't understand ah but they
had we had done several use cases before
and prepared for this um and so there
they had the phrase uh can you show me
on a map so um she went and um got a pen
and showed showed him how to get there
and they took the next subway stop to
this great coffee spot and had great
coffee in Tokyo because of our great
mobile app
well I guess I kind of I kind of told
you a bit about the Android developer
challenge but that was when you said
winning American Idol that's what that
felt like to you know and the aftermath
as well like the past year has been like
it everybody's waiting for your next
album and it's like you know how do we
out do that you know it's a lot to live
up to huh yeah yes but um but yeah that
when I really thought I was dreaming was
um Wired magazine chose us as their top
pick for indie Android apps and that was
just I couldn't sleep that night I was
just you know a geek heaven mate and and
then and then time um calm choses is
their um their favorite or the woman who
wrote it shows us as her personal
favorite Android app and then she wrote
an article for Time magazine about
cooking apps which you know there really
weren't cooking apps until until we
started this I mean there there was
maybe a few but none none of this you
know none really to speak of until you
know time and past so now there's this
article about cooking apps and then she
chose us in our little 6 recipes she
said the six recipes were thorough and
it turned out to be my favorite this
little android app so and so that was
that was exciting exciting time so lot
to live up to so stay tuned we'll try
anyone else want to comment anecdote
know about abject failure horror misery
come on Perry and I know you have oh
tell you about our first tooth kiss yes
talk about the first using a series of
user tests it's actually they're not
user tests cuz we're not testing the
users all my usability design friends
can correct me um so we we put together
a bunch of italian phrases for another
advisor who is going to italy
who didn't speak a word of Italian and
so he's got the mighty verse app and he
goes into this store and he's found you
know a delightful flattered that he
wants to buy and he finds some suitable
my diverse phrase to connect to the
shopkeeper and he plays the phrase and
then the shopkeeper starts talking
excitedly in Italian for 10 minutes and
he feels completely alienated and he
decides that mighty versus maybe not for
him so um so yeah from this we really
learned that certainly at this point in
our development my diverse really works
well if you have some fluency in the
language some you know you can you can
sort of have some hooks and you're going
to actually be excited if somebody
babbles to you in their language rather
than being you know freaked out because
you don't speak a word of it and that
kind of learning is really invaluable
but it was a little sad right afterwards
user feedback sometimes in the market
can be humbling I mean most of the time
ours has been really it's almost always
the same it's um we love it more recipes
please and sometimes a dock us cuz we
don't have a lot of recipes and
sometimes they give us four stars
because they love it and they want more
recipes it's kind of funny the
perspective but every once in a while
you get one like I hate it or you suck
why don't you fix this yeah I'm never
coming back again until the next day
it's not really the most useful feedback
you know I hate it okay anyway it's true
entertainment you're Cena anything over
you want to share or about your new are
you bringing your new site to mobile or
we plan to bring it to mobile right now
I mean we just yesterday launched in
beta right so um we're starting small
right uh hopefully we'll bring ya add
some stuff add some things um I just
want to I guess shares it's partly best
practices I guess
which I forgot to touch upon on the last
question but you know when when you're
designing anything with mobile and when
you work for a bigger company because I
there's a lot of talk about you know
when you create your own one you know
little app that's you and maybe another
person you can control kind of how do
you want to do it and it's great to do
keep it simple but then when you get
into a big company you have your
different lines of you have your
business you have your development folks
and you have testers and and just to
have them all kind of come together and
figure out what do you want to do on the
app it can get kind of challenging
because you from a technical point of
view you want to make sure you want to
get it the business wants always get it
out as fast as they can and if you're a
developer you want to also do that but
also make sure it's right and there's
always a lot of compromise back and
forth and then when you have the
business such as what we had we had a
little bit of just confusion of what do
you even want on this app and and if the
business doesn't know what they want on
the app how can you really just kind of
follow and keep up to pace so we had a
lot of those you know challenges with
you know with some of our development
cycles so just kind of word of thought
is that you know that's that's one
aspect that I think that people kind of
miss another thing also as a best well
another challenge we had because we came
from developing mobile applications
before I phone we had to kind of figure
out how do we use get the WebKit look
and feel for iphone on the Safari you
know browser and you know make it look
like you're coming from an iphone
without like creating a whole new
parallel code
base so we had like a whole bunch of you
know challenges around that which I
think even now I still valid because
they're still you know non iphone apps
out there that have browser capability
and so you have to keep in mind who your
whole audience is it's not just your
smartphone's it's still you have to
think about the little ones that don't
have that still are you know using your
application you know on mobile so that's
that's something that we try and cater
to we also had and just even testing
because there's basically how many
phones out there and being able to to
safely think that you've covered all of
your basis for all different phone types
can be quite a challenge when you're
going through a cycle it makes it a lot
easier when you know you're just doing
like an iPhone app or an Android app but
when you're doing them you know a mobile
application for your browser on your
phone it actually is quite heavier on
the the QA cycle so I don't know if
anyone here is at all experience with
that too but it's um oh yeah yeah it's
it's definitely you know pain points
right yeah and let's not forget design
because it's very important in mobile
and designing when you're deciding what
platform you design you designed for
there's all kinds of structure it's very
different from the web as I'm sure many
people know already and following some
best practices so especially if you're
doing like you know things for browsers
you don't want to break the page and all
those great colors that you're putting
in and all the tiny prints like take
your phone outside and look at your page
in the sun and this is you know how
people are going to be looking at it and
using it you just to remember that human
beings are looking at this and that they
want information fast don't load too
many things on the page because it won't
yeah it won't call back from the server
fast enough
if you know I think the rule is what two
seconds if they don't get the page back
they start to think it's broken so it's
even faster than on the web they have
more tolerance on the web on a computer
than they do on a phone so just to keep
those kind of things in mind I just want
quickly plug I there's a woman in the
Midwest named Barbara Ballard who has a
fantastic design library for mobile if
people are interested in that area and
she's really a great person so check out
her stuff online too yeah I totally
agree if you're doing mobile make sure
that there is somebody who does visual
an interaction design on your team if
there isn't find somebody a visual in an
interaction designer who knows their
stuff is going to make your code be 5
million percent better but I wanted to
chime in a but about what Korean was
saying about use cases and stories in
building mobile apps for other people I
found that if people can actually
articulate how somebody would use their
app they are on a path to success and
it's amazing how many people can't do
that when they have decided they want to
build a mobile app and there's a trends
number of people who think that what
they need to do is take every feature on
their web application and stuff it into
a little tiny mobile app and if
everybody can't do everything that they
could possibly do on their website or in
their desktop application that they will
have failed in their agenda to release
their first version of their mobile app
because all of their users are asking
for this so I would it I think that is
not true well I mean if you aggregate
what especially if you have a mature
product this is really tough so I'm
making fun of people but it is a really
tough call and you have a mature product
and you're talking to a thousand
customers and if you aggregate what a
thousand customers are asking for you
will find that they want every feature
that you have
because there's a reason that they're in
there right and somebody wants to access
them on mobile so it is really tough but
the more that you can have a really
focused story like her in the saying the
more you can be successful the more that
you can look at it as it as a different
platform that you can provide different
things rather than just being an
extension of the website I think that's
that's a lot of people are a lot of
companies say oh we got to go mobile and
what they mean is we've got to take all
our brochures and all of our you know
our website and just cram it onto a
mobile phone somehow you know and that's
not really what it's about it's about
you know offering offering something you
uniquely something specific to mobile
something that you can only do that's
only useful because it's with you and I
I don't know I think there's too much
pressure to just duplicate like you said
just replicate everything from a website
it's not practical or is it really
desirable ya know so the other thing
that we have seen is um consider the
uniqueness and the nuances over the
specific platform that you are
developing an app for so just that you
have a very very successful app on one
platform just bringing it over to
another platform doesn't guarantee
success so sometimes we have seen
Abdullah produced very small changes in
the UI flows few icon tweaks interaction
changes that is HUGE from experience
perspectives I just wanted to bring that
up as well I would also add to being
very brief and very focused with
whatever you create and thinking about
the user on the go is to maybe not just
think about mobile but think about how
every channel might work together to
offer a customer experience how someone
might use your product on the go how
someone might use your product in their
living room how someone might use their
brought your product on the computer
thinking about how
those things come together gets very
interesting I've also really enjoyed
some of the simplicity that I've created
on mobile and bringing up back to the
computer that's been really fun as well
so Carlin are you volunteering to host a
cross-platform discussion maybe that was
yeah I definitely hear everybody that
keeping it simple as the most important
thing I know so we originally had our
you know very basic mobile website
version which is you know you'd use the
up and down keys on your phone to
literally go to literally go down but
and then we're like okay let's make
something that's cool right and we tried
to have you know a much more like scroll
bars and things like that and you I and
it just didn't work right and then when
we came out with our mobile website site
the touch screen version right we went
back to a linear layout and we found
that even though it's touchscreen
linearlayout definitely worked best and
I think you know the most basic that you
can keep something and don't put too
many you know too many extra visual
features in there and things like that
it's it's probably the best uh let's
talk about the future a little bit a
future I know several you have some
opinions about where you think things
are going next and what you would like
to work on next let's talk about mobile
future you know things like augmented
reality and projector phones and the
potential of likes maybe one day seeing
actual TV on your phone that works oh
did I say it out loud but yeah what do
you guys think about what's coming next
and what would you like to work on in
the future as well and that could be
five minutes from now or 10 years from
now I guess it's sort of a general kind
of technology but I see you know now now
that we have a lot of touch kind of
stuff with screens and with you know the
phones that I I foresee kind of like if
you guys have seen Minority Report
you know we're basically it's sort of
excuse me a virtual kind of projection
of stuff where you end up you know
moving the computer actually really see
that that is something in the near
future it's I think it's going to be
there I one thing I think it is really
cool that I see now with just the phone
screens being so big the barcode
usability basically going more to a
paperless world more than we do now
where you know you just scan your
receipt for a movie or the airlines and
you just use that and that's your you
know ticket to go in you just have it on
your phone you have to print out
anything else and I think that's really
neat i think a lot more things are going
to a lot more people are going to accept
that and have scanners for your phone as
screens get more sophisticated and you
know crisper i'm looking forward to
phones becoming faster that may seem
obvious but i do think that something
interesting happens when when computers
become faster you start you know in the
types of leaps that we've seen in the
last 10 years with mobile in the last 20
years with desktop computing you start
to be able to do fundamentally different
things that and of course higher
bandwidth that whilst we start to see
the right I've right immediately I think
we start to see these lines between the
mobile and the desktop luring you know
like you we should be able to toss a
document from our phone to our desktop
like Tom you know what's his face and
Minority Report and and I think that
that you know that line blurring even
more like why should I have to actually
sync my phone why do I have to make
conscious decisions about these things
the phone to just figure it out for me
and making interfaces intuitive is
actually very very hard and we does
require tremendous amount of compute
power and I'm really excited about when
we can
start to do more and more interesting
things because the phones will be faster
and I really think that we haven't
scratched the surface of what we might
do with these phones because we're a
little constrained by our desktop GUI
origins and I think as we start to have
these different input mechanisms and you
know we start to really be able to do
more interesting things with the camera
and the video recording and the voice
recording and we have more and more of
those more and more of those AP is
accessible to application development
and not just stuck on some other chip on
the phone as they are in some platforms
on I think that I think it'll get very
exciting do you feel like that's maybe
why we're behind several countries as
far as our phone development goes it's
not just the carriers it's our
imagination as well that they are
hitting the internet for the first time
on their phones and we have a desktop so
we have expectations do you have any
sense of that or feelings about that
absolutely i mean i think that i love
the stories I've read about cell phone
novels in Japan have you guys heard
about this we're so in Japan there are
people create novels by typing into
their cell phones and they get published
on websites and some of these have been
so popular that they've been publishes
books but the idea is that that not only
can you offer them in your cell phone
but then they're formatted for your cell
phone so you can read them on your cell
phone and this just speaks to you know
in a place where they're most people
access the web through a mobile phone
rather than through desktops because
landlines are so expensive there almost
every this phone is the ultimate
personal computer because you don't
share your phone with anybody the way
you share your you know most people in
the United States no not probably most
people in this room but mostly on the
United States share their computer with
somebody and I think it just it creates
a completely different experience and
two completely different usage model
just just for your last question my one
of my old bosses who is originally from
India and he was saying how he can't he
went back there once and everyone was
just
doing stuff on their cell phone stuff
like even you know buying a soda from a
vending machine was just payment through
the phone and that's stuff that's you
know definitely not here but I think one
of the reasons also that you know they
do use a lot of their cell phone and not
and we don't is also you know money is
you know like for instance in India I
would think the mitten but almost
everyone there has a cell phone but they
can't necessarily afford to buy a PC
desktop and they might not have you know
the power capability that also how's
that and you know the stuff that goes
along with it and you know just even
financially it's makes more sense for
them just to have everything mobile and
yeah I was in Japan in my mind I'd like
to go to Japan just on a field trip and
just check out what they're doing over
there wouldn't that be cool let's do a
field trip yeah the Google sponsored
yeah google sponsor us field trip I do
think there's just such imagination in
Japan I mean um I I don't think it's
happening anymore but there was um was
it I'm softbank that had a it OS on the
UM oh it's too far back in my brain I
think to totally remember but it was it
was a very immersive experience I mean
it was almost like a um well it was a
little virtual reality I mean it was
like and and that was just sort of
standard on your little phone my friend
Erica here probably knows about it but
yeah it was just standard I mean it
would just um and it wasn't just kids
using it it was thirtysomethings and all
kinds of people using it and it was
because it was so intuitive and even
though it was really almost video game
like where it's these cute little you
know cute little characters punching
into doors at opening a door I mean
there was actual Commerce going on and
kind of thing and I don't know what the
current state of that is but I mean
things like that seemed to go over image
I mean people that the adoption rate of
things like that is so much higher
somewhere like Japan I mean that people
just yeah the the last start up i worked
at was a japanese company and that's
what they were trying to bring over was
that kind of a virtual goods and avatar
based reality the issues that we ran
into here like they could do all this
great stuff in japan because they had a
really robust network they had flash on
there nokia phones the hands that's
worth so much more we were constrained
by both the carriers that there was no
flash supported so you know that that
there is a little bit of technical
catching up or leapfrogging that the
United States now has to do in order to
get to that place yeah also just
catching up to Europe I mean mm-hmm now
that the you know things are finally
kind of changing with the carriers but I
mean that's been years and they don't I
mean everybody in Europe knows what a
SIM chip or would it yeah yeah I'm chip
is you know like just a good I mean I
remember my aunt and her 50s or whatever
is talking about a SIM chip and I'm like
that's so interesting you know I didn't
even I'd you know I barely knew what to
do in terms of just what how to handle
having a mobile phone over there and I
in Dublin my little my cousins like oh
just you know just go to the store and
get or I'll give you my junker phone and
then just you know just fill it up and
whatever and I'm like oh this is so cool
yeah just put some minutes on it or
whatever and here that's sort of more
foreign to us madam yeah but well I'm
excited of course about all the you know
cooking related things you know I'm kind
of I just love the I mean cooking
capsules itself I think is comes from me
being sort of a futurist and interested
in how things could be so much easier
and how technology could be such a part
of your life and and and in such a
powerful time-saving way and also just
enhance your life not just you know for
the utility of it but just for
the pleasure of it the enjoyment of it
and I'm so I just love the idea of all
the things that could potentially happen
with appliances you know um
refrigerators ovens countertops you know
having having a screen on your
countertop I mean even these new iPads
that came out you just think oh wow you
could just have that you know just
started my wheels turning about what
would cooking capsules look like on that
and what what are the you know different
things that we could do with that medium
since that's a whole different medium
from the mobile phone which is a
different medium from the web which is a
different medium from print you know and
how can you kind of take elements of all
those and maximize it into the UM
what'swhat's offer that's new with these
new things coming out so anyway so um
mobile phones having um better hardware
faster hardware bigger screens I'm kind
of excited with two two categories bonus
AR augmented reality you'll see layer
it's a web browser in android market as
well as wikitude these are like you hold
your phone out there is information
overlay on top of what you're saying
you're traveling you hold your out or
the phone seized and tells you it's like
your personal guided tour so I feel like
that's that's there's a huge immense
potential of crazy crazy out there the
other thing I feel like we'll see a lot
is mobile devices have not been
traditionally been a gaming devices we
have seen a lot of games really good
games but I think like it faster
processor GPUs graphic graphic graphic
processors as well as great controllers
and hardware's I think we are getting
into spaces where gamers game developers
would seriously consider those devices
as
serious games we hear a lot of games
being multiplayer cloud-based so I think
we are going to see good titles in the
game space in this on mobile devices as
well so I'm not going to burn the dead
horse of mobile payments but I you know
Emma commerce but I think there you're
gonna see a lot of workarounds a lot of
things coming already in miami-dade
county and Los Angeles they have pilots
where you actually can pay now pay for
your parking with your phone so I think
you we're not going to have to wait for
the device makers the carriers and the
banks to figure this out and figure out
getting the chips and your phone you're
going to start to see workarounds from
companies such as PayPal etc to get
around that i'm also very personally
interested also in the interfaces coming
into your home I I would like to see
interactive television go a lot faster a
lot further very tired of Comcast and
directv and experiences that we get yawn
and would love to have you know see the
stuff with the appliances move forward a
lot quicker I mean imagine you're you
know in the morning your refrigerator
tells you to bring your umbrella because
it's going to rain this afternoon it
tells you what medications to take tells
you a your resting metabolic heart rate
and hey you better not eat that so
so I just it can't come soon enough I
really like where things are going right
now with you know being able to connect
to the cloud with your mobile device for
instance when I asked my palm pre and I
had to get a new one it was great that
everything was there once you know I got
my new device um something I would
really like to see happen more is you
know mobile education for instance you
know like people in Africa being able to
you know that's the primary way that
they're connecting to the internet right
and having some way that they could you
know watch it a lecture or something
like that and then interact with the
teacher I don't know personally I think
that's I'm very passionate about that so
that's really interesting to me yeah i
think when i forgot might end up being
one mobile device per child I mean you
know these days mobile devices have such
power that you know we will probably see
that happening first which i think is
really really exciting ok we're going to
start to wrap it up so we can do some
Q&amp;amp;A and the last thing I'd like to ask
from you speakers I'm going to put you a
little bit on the spot in one line maybe
to tell me how to succeed in mobile plug
whatever it is you're working on and let
me know if you're hiring that'd be great
we can start in the middle you have to
think about that would kind of put you
on the spot so to succeed in mobile try
something get experience really
understand the platform whatever the
heck you're doing and then you'll do
great things in focus um to plug my own
stuff download the mighty verse iphone
app
yay um tell me what you do with it send
me mail if you need a mobile app or a
web application you can also hire my
team at blazing cloud and how does
succeed in mobile I guess I'm still
figuring that out I mean um we're not
profitable yet but you know that takes a
while so succeeding in mobile in terms
of that um you know still trying to
figure all that out and then uh so but
yeah I guess just keep it simple I guess
there's different approaches you know
you can either do the sort of throw it
out there rapid iteration scrap it if
it's not working approach or you can
really do the a long brainstorm come up
with the idea refined the idea really
get the user experience idea but keep it
simple nothing you know and and that's
kind of what we did I think we put a lot
more thought into it from the get-go and
I think that is kind of important no
matter what project you're doing what to
like you said you need a user experience
designer it's amazing how little this is
understood like how programmers just
want to program something without it
having been designed first it's sort of
like building a house without a
blueprint you know it doesn't make any
sense so so I think one way to succeed
in mobile is really to think about it in
advance of even starting to think about
building it I mean at first think about
the user experience think about the
person using it think about the actual
consumer and what they're gonna do with
it and why it's useful make something
that's truly useful you know or fun you
know it's fine too but just think about
the user first cuz it's amazing how much
that doesn't happen you know so anyway
and um oh yeah and download cooking
capsules right now it's the cooking
capsules taster it's on the android
market and i haven't checked number
super recently but we have over 60
thousand downloads so far which is
really cool and
and we have eight recipes in the in the
first one it's for French ones for
indian ones and we're coming out with
another one's very soon that some brunch
recipes so um ate brunch recipes like
how to make your own eggs benedict and
quiche and whatever things like that so
anyway keep a lookout for that and and
let us know what you think and follow us
on Twitter it at cooking capsules and
say hello so how to succeed in mobile I
think I'm going to repeat here focus on
end users and be very very agile and yes
we are hiring I'll start with that too
we're hiring no just getting out of the
way and how to succeed in mobile I would
say and if you have an idea or a spark
or anything go after that and if you if
you're a developer and you don't have a
background in user experience or vice
versa um partner with people network and
get together with people i mean because
they can push on your ideas and make
them even better so i would just say to
get started get out there partner with
some blend and get your ideas out there
and people see that you have great ideas
and next thing you know you're creating
a next experience for mobile interactive
TV etc make sense I'm gonna have to
agree with pretty much everybody here is
a keep it simple also launched early
iterate often right I think that also
works for just online in general um and
check out pic vcom it basically it's a
dating site that matches people off of
their common interest like their
favorite movies music TV shows and books
yeah i mean i agree with everyone here
but essentially you know when you're
creating an something on mobile figure
out what it is the problem is that
you're trying to solve for your user and
and work out some design flows of how
that will make sense for the particular
device that you're thinking of you know
developing on for and my little plug
check
chictopia.com it's a it's a fashion
social media site so it connects people
that are inspired and with fashion
whether you're looking for inspiration
or out there to express your style you
know it's a way to connect with people
that have a common interest in fashion
like you and we're also hosting a
conference in new york for new york
fashion week so if you happen to be and
basically it's discussing you know the
topic of how online has really affected
fashion and social media how that's
impacted the fashion industry and so if
your are in New York next week on what
we have a conference on Feb through 13th
so you know please check us out and I
guess see mine would be you know take
your craziest idea and shop it around
out there cuz it's likely someone else
will either really like it or have the
same crazy idea and go big and then edit
it down and you know they do the stuff
that you're really interested in because
the passion will keep you going and
let's see my twitter is at chris mitt KR
is m ET my shameless plug I don't
Twitter during my events but I Twitter
other times not while I'm working um and
now we're going to open it up to Q&amp;amp;A and
also remember that we have desserts and
coffee in the side yes my question is
for Corinne I wanted to know how you got
Wells Fargo to let you do their iphone
app being the big huge monstrous
organization that they are why did they
do this in house rather than just
farming out to somebody because I've
seen other large organization we have
mobile apps you know and you go and you
look oh we bought somebody or we shipped
it to Estonia or something like that and
it works great it works fine so I think
it's really really cool that you
we are in a place where you actually got
to do something like that so maybe you
can just talk about how you got to do
that sure well you know to be honest I
think they you know the business folks
actually did look at third parties to
assist us with creating the iphone app
but what happens with that is there is a
lot of overhead in the negotiation you
know of getting the contract and to then
produce a timeline to produce the actual
application what it turns out we are
also doing some work in parallel to that
some in-house work in parallel to doing
that the negotiations and what we found
out is that you know we could actually
get a time to market even faster because
we happen to have the expertise in-house
so we just chose to go that path this
time it's not to say you know I'm not
there anymore but it's not to say that
they may not use you know they may use
another company for the next iteration
so it's it's we are mobile development
so we did have some people that had
picked up objective-c and you know you
know did at least the necessary things
that we required fourth feature set that
we wanted to put out there hey Carlin
could you talk a little bit to that too
ebay has something like four billion
hits a day and it is a very big company
and it has in-house mobile yes so we
have an in-house and mobile department
and we do all of the development for the
website in house um for iphone
development we still farm it out however
on all of the requirements and design
are done in-house for our first release
on iphone application we did that in
five weeks only so smokin so in order to
move that quickly we kind of needed to
to basically have that access non-stop
during that time I felt I worked with a
lot of outside agencies and for
terms it does require a lot of
hand-holding a find so just based on the
customer background and knowledge and
just having to move fast that's been our
approach so far I i work at Stanford
University where we have the luxury of
having an amazing class called
introduction to iphone programming it's
all free available online and through
the itunes store and it's all video and
Apple actually sponsors the class which
is great and I'm just wondering if
there's anything like that for the
Android platform because it's actually
how I learned to program for the iphone
and it would be amazing if there were a
resource like that for android i'll
definitely check back be awesome to have
10 I here we are working on it I keep
hearing about the debate between PDA
development to become a robust versus
the mini-computer becoming smaller so
where is that debate and how relevant is
it to you guys anybody I can call me
anybody well um I really don't care um
to be frank basically I evaluate new
devices as they come out whether they be
something that seemed like we're seeing
linux on mobile devices right and I
think that's probably what you're
referring to as a mini computer getting
smaller you know bigger PDA I think
there's just a merging of it and I think
people don't care what chipsets inside
right and right now the distinction
between a PDA or phone and a computer is
really that's chipset which is arbitrary
I mean it's like people don't understand
the difference between a desktop app and
a browser app even though
as technologists for like well of course
once on your desktop um but frankly
they're both on your desktop and
nowadays they look awfully the same and
so I think people people sometimes they
want big screens and sometimes their
screens too big to carry with them and I
think we're going to see more mix and
match type of things we'll see a lot of
experimentation with these all-in-one
kind of things like the iPad and I
certainly hope we'll see more and more
things that you know get near each other
and exchange data so i think it's going
to be like a guy remember reading about
when motors were first developed and you
would buy a motor from the Sears catalog
and then you'd get your coffee grinder
at attachment and you get your different
attachments that allowed you to do
things with your motor and I think
that's where we are with computers you
kind of get your computer and your
attach things to it and then maybe you
get another computer that's sort of in
the form factor of a mobile phone but
we're seeing these chips embedded
everywhere and they're going to be in
our refrigerators and counters and
watches and earrings and you know
whatever um and you know our whether we
like it or not the objects around us are
just going to get smarter and I think
they'll and cheaper or less expenses
yeah so I have a question for you from
an app developer perspective how do you
see like sporting Europe on these
devices some of which are like larger
screens some are smaller some are in
between I actually was going to speak to
that exact point is what we're seeing
here is at home and on the desktop you
get these screens that are just getting
larger and larger and larger and then on
the other side you see smartphones and
things such as the iPad and on and on
and so creating for these type of
experiences is starting to get very
difficult because you're seeing things
get wider and wider so how do you create
an experience that can work on this huge
monitor as well as on this tiny phone so
it gets very challenging to maintain all
of those different experiences and I
I wonder how we're going to do that in
the future well I think that um and as
the machines get faster it's easier to
have these intermediary frameworks that
helped write like 10 years ago you had
to do everything really custom for the
each device and you had to write native
code that was really really highly tuned
and it was very very expensive in terms
of time and effort to create a mobile
application and so it wasn't just that
the carrier's stifled creativity just
the the effort it took stifled
creativity and I think that now it's
much easier there's let this there these
frameworks that DUI for you you can have
these different affordances that the
platform gives to you and I think that
just as we've seen with desktop
development when we got bigger and
bigger screens the platforms did more
for us and I think that either the
device manufacturers are going to do
some stuff that really helps or
developers will invent it on top of that
because it's inevitable if you have to
continue to develop software for five
different fundamentally different
platforms you will invent a way to make
it easy because you know otherwise you
lose your mind so so I think that it is
a challenge and it's an interesting
challenge and we had you know it'll be a
while before we figure it out but I like
someone to address the future of mobile
apps versus tools developed in the cloud
specifically a few days ago I wasn't
aware of this but I guess Google's
google voice for the iphone was
disallowed it's one point bye bye bye
Steve Jobs he just didn't want the app
it company competed or whatever so
immediately Google went around and you
can get the exact same google voice by
just going on the iPhone on the web so
what's the difference here developing
apps as opposed to going on the cloud I
can I can speak to that um I think that
most uh it may be my corner of the world
but it seems like most mobile
applications have their fingers into the
cloud anyhow and web applications are
having more and more powers that are
kind of like mobile applications and you
know in terms of being able to access
the device capabilities you know click
to call being the simplest one and then
you can you can have voice controls
which then you're talking on your
telephone but you're doing things that
you would might expect are happening on
your native on your phone through an
application and you know I don't
remember who was talking about like
developers will find workarounds right
the when you when you can't do it on the
device you do it in the cloud if it's
more convenient to do it in the cloud
you do it there you need to do it on the
device when it's offline when you can't
reach the cloud but hopefully you know
that more and more we're getting
coverage everywhere so maybe it won't
matter in a few years so I think right
now we do have some challenges because
you know you sort of you have to build a
whole bunch of code in one place and it
won't run in the other place and you
have to shift strategies when technology
or organizations get in your way but I
think that just you know right now we
have a lot of choices and that can be a
painful thing and it can be a really
delightful thing I don't that answers
your question hi I'm I'm an executive
director of a non-profit and we work to
get 6 7th 8th graders interested in
science and technology and I think that
these teenagers are really untapped
market for mobile applications and I'm
wondering if you have any ideas of where
I can go or just off the cuff ideas
about how we can get teenagers to
appreciate in love technology through
their cell phones and developing mobile
apps for them
I think that's a great age to target for
developing I got my soapbox for a minute
and say that I think programming is a
life skill I think every fourth fifth
sixth seventh eighth grader should learn
to program not because they will become
software developers but because if you
have that kind of thinking you will
succeed in our world 20 years from now
10 years from now because every software
application you use has an expert
feature that you kind of have to be a
programmer or think like a programmer to
use so I really applaud what you're
doing and there are a number of
different organizations working on ideas
for teaching kids to program I think
there's a challenge with mobile devices
because the most kids don't have
smartphones and those are the easiest
ones to program but if you could get
smartphones in the hands of kids then
they could be programming in languages
like Ruby or JavaScript which are very
accessible to novice programmers so what
do you guys think about mobile money he
touched upon before and he talked about
the future but I mean I definitely see
the future being mobile money I just
came back from Kenya and it was
remarkable to see on my iPhone someone
sent me cash so what do you guys think
about that it's also jailbroken unlocked
that's why I could do
I think we do that today right I mean
with it paypal has member to member you
I can send you money but are you
speaking from bank okay I think a lot of
the third world countries to be cut like
a lot of people don't even have bank
accounts so they'll go in and get the
phone and use that basically as their
bank account so part of its
infrastructure obviously I you there's a
lot of things we should have here one of
the challenges is the interfaces are not
standardized so it's very difficult to
talk between them so I have been in
mobile like standards a few years back
and the challenges we face that the
banks are different interfaces that hurt
cause organizations of different
interfaces and it was very difficult
from a app perspective to develop an app
that could talk to basically anyone so
that's one of the challenges I know
there are also Sandra's organization
even credit cards organization and banks
trying to solve it but it's it's really
really a bottleneck on a challenging
process you know I I think I think that
could be the direction where we're going
I don't see it anytime in the near near
future just because I think even the US
public is really kind of hesitant to do
stuff that can just if for instance if
their phone was stolen or you know
security why's that but when it comes to
their money I think
the u.s. is a little more hesitant about
making it easier sometimes for people to
access their accounts so I think that's
that tends to be a challenge but then
you know basically security regulations
and all that to that slow it down well I
do think it's cultural like there I mean
there's cultural differences that make
it longer to adapt adopt here but I
think you're right that it is inevitable
like it's just too easy and there are
ways that you know to make it have the
proper to have the privacy protection
that we you know people demand here and
have the security and address the
security issues which frankly have been
addressed overseas in some ways much
better than we have we're addressing
here but I think that when those things
happen then you know we won't need
credit cards will have you know these
electronic transfers and it'll make
commerce much easier and more fluid I do
think and I do think we'll see micro
payments being much more cost effective
and that will change the types of things
that we buy and how we pay for things
and I think it'll get interesting in
that way because credit cards create
some odd pricing models that we
currently have and the other things that
I think we'll see that our part from
commerce and part from just the power
that having a computing device be
attached to you or carry around with you
will do is it'll give individuals more
power to be small business owners to
conduct commerce to beacon producers
even if they don't have their own
business I think we'll see
user-generated content so-called be
monetized so that you're seeing that a
little bit now with youtube and whatnot
but it's still pretty rare and you kind
of have to be a professional even if its
so-called user-generated content but i
think we'll see that individuals with
individual skills will be able to use
those school skills to produce you know
whether it's writing or spoken language
or apply whatever skills they have
wherever they are and you know and
contribute to the economy in ways that
we're not seeing I think a lot of our
skills being used today we have a few
more questions and we can always carry
on this conversation over coffee in a
moment so high um have any of you
developed for the ipad and if you
haven't why and if you have what
specifically that's specific to the ipad
not just the iphone i guess i hope you
know i just heard about it the other day
we have examined our app on it and it
looks awful don't believe what you saw
in the videos yeah it blows up basically
one pixel into two so your app can't be
reinterpreted seamlessly um my question
is worried about that you know how how
if the whole app stores there and it's
intended for these small devices and
then all of a sudden it's just well I
would question though and should we just
reinterpret a small app for that device
I would want to create a whole new
experience right right me too
I would want to look at how to create a
better experience for mobile experience
so it's a mobile device rather than just
the straight desktop experience which
can be overly complex anyways um I have
sort of a two-part question um there's
more about mobile ads I didn't hear
anybody talk about that and well in
general the mobile ad seen and what you
guys think about that and the second
part of my question is more about
Android and do you have something
equivalent to an Adsense for mobile apps
similar to how Adsense works for
someone's web application or something
maybe so I'll take the Android question
so I'm from the Android team so Android
from Android perspective a V developer
platform so Google monetization products
are very very separate from the Android
platform so well and didn't Google by
AdMob did I not hear that right yes but
I cannot comment that oh okay okay sorry
sorry anybody else want to speak to that
monetizing on Mitchell started mobile
average that we just started using
Adsense relatively recently and um uh
you know I hope that over time een I
think you have to have a lot of users in
order to to really render results from
it I mean because what we've been pretty
popular in our own right but uh you know
I mean honestly we just we just put it
we just integrated it a few months ago
and I just got my first check for a
hundred thirty-eight dollars so that
gives you an idea like how ha I don't
know if I should admit that but um but
I'm hoping that over time you know as we
as we build our offering that um you
know offering says we have many apps and
many impressions and also because we're
kind of a niche market but um
well in a way I mean everybody eats
right so it's not I like to think of it
as not that specific people go it's for
foodies no it's for people who eat but
Christina could you comment on that how
did you guys monetize YouTube on mobile
you can't talk about that okay hold on a
second oh sorry the bug to this um so
what's limiting you for not putting a
lot of recipes on your side because you
said only aid and I would think you can
put gazillions and your monetization
model can be okay give me 99 cents you
can download you know twenties recipes
something like that right I'll get some
kind of discount when you go to trader
joe i was thinking I'm thinking a lot of
monetization models yeah it sounds it
sounds funny that we only have eight
recipes and um the reason is that um
that we're actually producing these
cooking shows that that accompany each
one so um so I kind of look at it more
like and obviously you know we're we're
building the but you know we're gonna
have to build the volume we can't just
live on this few recipes alone but at
the same time it's like their their
collections of recipes and where our
quantity is I mean people are looking
for quantity and they go why would I go
there if I could get millions of recipes
you know on google or something um you
know if i could just google google and
get all these or go to you know these
other sites or whatever and the the i
think what's unique about us is that our
quantity is within each recipe so each
recipe you get you get a whole show that
tells you exactly how to make it you get
what tools you need you know um further
information about it and you know the
shopping list and then how to make it
and so it's sort of like how many at the
end of the day how many recipes do you
really need in your arsenal so i mean if
we can grow slowly grow this nice
library of really in down
and this really easy and in-depth
experience that's kind of what we're
going for because you know frankly it's
easy to get thousands of recipes places
but it's not as easy to get that kind of
experience and that's what we're looking
for and we're actually producing the
show so that's what takes time yeah
right yeah there's you know there's a
lot of there's a lot of really exciting
business models for ya and that's one of
them yeah that's one of them is the the
location-based stuff is huge I mean yeah
just I mean that's what's so exciting
about it is I think we have this sort of
fertile ground for as these technologies
come about and and and partnerships with
different companies where you know if
we're if we're making if we're making
fondue we can sell the fondue set
through williams-sonoma or whatever you
know we can we have all kinds of product
placement um so it's it's a matter of I
think really what we're trying to do now
is gain traction and get attention and
get more more users and um and then and
then kind of team up with different
companies who who want to promote their
we should we should probably talk about
this over coffee because you don't have
a microphone yeah we do have coffee and
dessert ready and and the speakers will
be available for as long as they are
free to discuss I need the speakers to
stay up front for a moment and thanks
again Angie and Google you guys were
great Angie go to a girl geek dinner Bay
Area girl geek dinner calm and give her
suggestions for other talks she's very
nice person and does a great job
