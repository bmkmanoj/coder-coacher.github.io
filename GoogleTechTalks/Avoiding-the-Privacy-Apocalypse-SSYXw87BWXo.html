public policy team in London looking
after our policy and PR at reach on
privacy issues and I'm happy today to be
able to introduce you to Gus Hussein and
Simon Davies from privacy international
if you've googled privacy international
you've probably quickly discovered that
they're one of the more influential
privacy advocacy groups worldwide and
we've had a long and arduous
relationship with them so they're here
to share some of their insights from the
outside world from the privacy advocacy
world and to end to get questions back
from you guys so without further ado
I'll turn it over to them Thank You
Anthony and thank you all for allowing
us into the Googleplex to to talk with
you this is a an honor and a surprise
for us so I'm Simon Davies and this is
Gus's saying where the two sort of key
policy and campaigning people in privacy
International and what I wanted to do
was talk to you about some problems that
we're facing and hope that you're able
to help in the solution as you've helped
with the solution on so many problems
down the years we wanted to bring to you
a challenge so we believe to be the most
important privacy issue of this time and
possibly of all times so we'll tell you
about that in a minute but first I
thought it could be useful so we're all
on the same page to to give you the 120
second briefing on privacy ok so again
that's 20 years in 22 minutes here the
entire London School of Economics
masters course you know in the blink of
an eyelid this is just so you know where
we are coming from and what we do and
kind of where you guys fit into it to it
so first this isn't a Western issue
there's something like a hundred
countries that have privacy laws based
on 415 own definitions of privacy so
this is why everybody in this room is
going to have a different definition of
this very unruly concept in fact it's
quite likely there are about nine
billion of them on the planet so you
know we've given up on the idea the
quest of a single definition 10,000 laws
to the best of our knowledge in
existence not all national laws
obviously the very often sectoral their
state their provincial there to do with
specific issues you know to do with that
say health or consumer rights or
whatever and all of this massive
activity going back decades is based on
eight principles all of which are common
sense to everyone in this room and
everyone watching and these are the
principles of data protection the
principles embed it in federal law in
the United States you do the right thing
with data don't keep it for as long as
you you know for a longer than you need
don't disclose it for unintended
purposes don't do the wrong thing with
it basically and those eight principles
have steered all of the rest of the
privacy realm throughout history now we
in our 20 years have dealt with an awful
lot of issues a huge number of issues
worldwide I mean we we base ourselves in
about 40 countries at the moment there's
the top-level view of privacy it's
basically what happens to you in society
around you all of the privacy issues the
thousands of them are to do with
personal autonomy all of our
relationships our culture our space our
body and the data that is generated
about us and that we generate but if you
break this out keep breaking it out
there's more and more issues we've
detected more than 1500 privacy issues
that we've worked on on the last 20
years alone 1500 separate privacy issues
it
to the point where it drives us nuts I
mean people say you know radio
interviews come up and they say yeah
what's so tell us what what's privacy
about and you go I've got like a minute
and a half before the next ad how do i
express the enormity of this subject and
its complexity but there it is and you
can imagine each one of those dots
whether it be identity cards or identity
assurance or you know an issue
concerning crypto can be magnified and
made more complicated depending on the
cultural environment around it so
literally thousands of different
contexts thousands of different subjects
and in tech areas and policy areas I
wanted to quickly now that's actually
was about three and a half minute
briefing so sorry about that the one
issue I would like to that we like to
focus on is this absolutely crucial one
that I talked about in the in 1995 we
made a decision to investigate the trade
of surveillance technology going across
too dangerous and non-democratic regimes
we worked with the European Commission
and with investigators across the world
and we identified in 1995 240 companies
many of them household names that were
flogging very dangerous surveillance
equipment to the likes of Rwanda Nigeria
Uganda places that at the time and for
the ten years preceding during the
investigation were police States
military States where people would be
hunted down and where people died in
their millions now it was made possible
because for example in edr mins brutal
regime it was Western surveillance
technology that prop that up that props
up the police systems it was Western
technology that allowed the South
African apartheid passbook system the
automated passbook
demand all of the awful discrimination
and the horrors that follow from that
all of the every regime you want to
mention through the 70s through the 80s
and into the 90s it was Western coders
Western companies that Prop those
regimes up the Guatemalan death lists
the political automated police death
lists I mean those who attended out with
the targeting of individuals actually at
front and center on the tender document
so the people the companies that were
tendering for that police system knew
exactly what they were walking into but
they were in it for the profits in 1990
I recall being in Bangkok for this one
on fighting against what was then the
military-backed regime I remember the
Smithsonian Institute here giving an
award for the brave use of technology to
control data systems for giving the Thai
government the most comprehensive
surveillance system in its history run
by the Home Office run by the military
and used with a specific intention of
tracking down dissenters outside of
Bangkok to the north of the country
these are this just shows you how
difficult this problem is it's
permeating the entire world and the West
is making a fortune out of it and now 15
years later from that report that we
wrote things have grown so damn
complicated then that's that's actually
why privacy is so difficult now it's
grown so much more complicated than
these profit-seeking companies trying to
spread bad technologies elsewhere so
everybody knows about the Iran protests
and the clamp down that occurred after
the elections and some of you may know
that the Wall Street Journal had a set
of articles that exposed nokia siemens
for having sold the telecommunications
kit to the iranian government because
aurelien the iranian telecommunications
companies actually owned by the military
in iran and this telecommunications get
to the wall street journal's surprise
had backdoors built in so the
garmin can get access to the
communications of the opposition move in
anybody who is organizing to oppose the
government at the time and they were
eventually harassed and tracked down and
made them were jailed and subsequent
other bad things happen and so the Wall
Street Journal was very offended that
how dare a European company help in the
trade of these bad surveillance
technologies and so when the media came
to us surprisingly we had to defend
nokia siemens first everybody got it
wrong thought it was nokia no it was
actually nokia siemens we had to defend
them because it wasn't entirely their
fault the reason they were building
these back doors and the technology was
actually because of the Clinton
administration where in 1994 Clinton
administration offered the
telecommunications industry in this
country five hundred million dollars to
build backdoors into digital
telecommunications technologies under
the regime of kolia communications
assistance assistance for law
enforcement act this policy was slightly
of some concern to like him to the
telecommunications industry in the US
they are saying well look this is going
to cost us and our European partners
don't have to worry about that so the
clever Clinton administration traveled
to Europe and convinced the European
telecommunications standards Institute
to make this a standard within all
telecommunications kit across Europe and
when we oppose this we were told how
dare you oppose the needs of democratic
states to gain access to the
communications of its citizenry to
protect them from child pornography from
drug criminal drug barons and so on they
didn't really consider terrorism back
then so then it's no surprise that 15
years later every telecommunications
company on earth when they sell
telephony technology have to build these
back doors in so that's why Nokia
Siemens got burned in Iran because they
had to sell that technology because all
the technology has that in it so that
was a year and a half ago and some of
you may have followed the news over the
past few weeks this is being reviewed
entirely by the Obama administration and
because back in 1991 1994 1995 when
Kalia was passed in this country one
thing that the government had to step
back on was information services and
that was what
we called the internet back then a
number of people ourselves included said
look if you build if you require back
doors into this burgeoning internet
industry you will kill it and so the
Clinton administration agreed yes the
law will specifically exclude Internet
services or information services and
that's what Obama wants to review now
why is it an AT&amp;amp;T is fair to ask this
why is it we must build backdoors into
our telecommunication systems once Skype
and Google and other companies do not so
now we're fighting the fight in a
completely different way because we
can't now go back on principle and say
no maybe the state shouldn't have access
to communications of all of its
citizenry because we lost that fight in
1994 and it ended up with people
actually getting killed so um here's an
interesting trend that we noticed go
back to nineteen ninety-five to this
report that we did on the surveillance
trade what you were looking at there
were bolt-on solutions for governments
obviously some of its remains bolt-on
like like like traditional military
spying equipment but what we found as we
moved into the 2000s with a lot of these
240 companies was shifting their energy
toward consulting with the main telco
providers and network providers and ISPs
in these countries these developing
countries these military regimes so that
they could engineer privacy from the
core of the system what many of you will
remember as surveillance by design and
clear is a classic example of that so
this was one of the biggest problems we
faced but on the fringes there was still
a multi multi-billion dollar industry of
these companies either going into such
regimes such countries and scaring the
life out of them or as they would say
presenting them with opportunities to
enhance the stability of the regime
this is of course as how they win the
contracts for the surveillance kid but
we were in give you an example we were
in Africa and Ethiopia working with the
United Nations with the UNHCR last last
year and our job was to go around the
camps and to find out what was happening
with security of the refugee camps and
identity systems and because it charming
picture here somewhere Gus of other way
are well you see not everybody's she's
not smiling believe me she thinks that
fingerprint scanner is red hot so she
was screaming little little girl here
the children don't like this but all of
the most vulnerable people in the world
are face scan well fingerprinted
photographed documented and of course
it's Western technology that plays into
the hands of regimes that don't know how
to use or will exploit this information
for the you know for unintended purposes
so for example it's one thing to say
yeah we should collect all of this
information on all of these people
because let's face it they don't care
about their privacy anyway or so goes
the myth but what we discovered was for
example we there's don't know if any of
you have heard of the Koran the Korean
people in Asia in Malaysia are hunted
down by the government for a bounty and
resold back to their family at the
border effectively kidnapped these
people are on the run remember we went
to a meeting in a secret location of the
Korean refugees while we were over there
as part of the UN mission what we
discovered was that the trust in
computer systems was so low it was so
degraded and the risk was so high
because basically files electronic files
are just bought and sold traded handed
over by the authorities to the host
government Malaysia that will then use
against the refugees that what they have
is a book they have a book with
everyone's names and details on it
this book is so valuable that it's known
its whereabouts is known to only two of
the Korean elders who would die rather
than disclose its whereabouts that's
what the data means to the Quran what it
means to the people who buy and sell the
data who buy and sell the machines to
keep the data and hand it over is over
here's just a few you know a few Meg's
of stuff you might find it useful the
Quran would die for it that's how
crucial their entire survival depends on
the secrecy of that one little book so
we that's why data in these countries is
so crucial people died as a result of
this massive accumulation the not just
the accumulation of this data about its
magnification its extension its
duplication the communication of this
data across borders is causing lives
lost it's causing genocide and we knew
this back from the 1970s and why are we
here in the most powerful tech company
in the world all of these years later
still talking about this nothing has
been done there are no guidelines there
are no standards those that exist like
export controls are circumvented
routinely on an on an hourly basis the
most recent work we've been doing that
similar to this is we're working on
medical informatics in developing
countries I know if you know but of
course in the United States as it was 17
billion dollars being invested in
medical informatics and that's that's
there's some great opportunities for
advancement but I would say there's an
equivalent amount of money being
invested in Africa and Southeast Asia
and introducing medical records
databases and introducing mobile phones
to aid workers so they can collect
medical information and share it with
other people and the current situation
is that it's in dire need of improvement
cause right now you have access
databases everywhere and you have
researchers particular from from outside
of Africa and Southeast Asia trading in
the medical information of people the
they're doing God's work they're there
to save people's lives to to cure people
to identify diseases and all of that so
they don't think that these put it
brutally the savages they're treating
care about these issues of privacy and
security so I actually presented at a
conference in cape town recently where
and youth understand we present to law
enforcement national security
conferences all the time and I never
seen a more antagonistic audience than
when I was presenting to a bunch of
people working on medical informatics
because again they're doing God's work
how dare we raise the issue of consent
because these savages are treating they
don't care about these things but when
you talk to the actual doctors who are
working in the field the doctors in
Haiti the Haitian doctors in Haiti the
Nigerian doctors in Nigeria the doctors
in Ethiopia when you actually speak to
these people they know what privacy is
and they know what they're there are
patients expect when it comes to privacy
but the chasm between the understanding
of privacy by the people who are being
affected versus those who are funding
the deployment of these technologies is
immense and we're having a hell of a
time breaching these and it's again it's
amazing twenty years later we're still
having these debates so much so like we
often get a debate about whether privacy
is a western value these coders that we
were working with were saying security
is a western value data security a
western value why should we secure any
of this information I'm not even talking
about privacy just securing it so I
remember one one of the best received
presentations was after mine where
everybody beat up on me was a guy who
was developing a medical records
management system on an android phone
because the use of mobile phones for in
the field is immense and the opportunity
is even larger and here he is with real
patient data showing it on a slide
showing this patients got this this
patients got HIV this patient is in
consultation for pregnancy issues
showing this data real at the wheel time
and I asked this stupid question well
what about the security of the device
and it's the classic answer we got in
the 1990s from the Microsoft's of the
world we're just building it for now
we'll sort this stuff out later we'll
sort it out later when these mobile
phones are all across Africa
containing all the sensitive information
and all these all the people building
this just don't see the concern while
the people on the ground do see the
potential for damage yeah and I think
see this is this is so strange because
when people think of the privacy issue
of course the the stuff in the headlines
is all about social networking or cool
stuff at google it you know as in the
1990s was all about crypto and it was
about color line identification and you
know to each yeah there's a kind of
characterization of this issue across
the generations but kind of in a way
nine-tenths of the world has been left
out of this because yeah these issues
that we're talking about you know when
we went you know that said we're
visiting here and we are talking about
border security with DHS or where you
know advanced biometric systems if
that's not the oxymoron we do talk about
these issues and we're finding that
increasingly they are again a
life-and-death issue in nine-tenths of
the world but those nine-tenths of the
world have been forgotten meanwhile you
know there's a million coders out there
in Turkmenistan in Russia and China in
Nepal and India and Pakistan there are
pushing the code out that are trying to
get involved in this stuff we were even
talking to them in refugee camps these
are people who want to take part in the
world and they're going to do it whether
they do it for good or whether they do
it for evil and this is the challenge
and this is why we need you guys we
really do and and we're reaching out
across the world for partners to try and
engage this huge population of emerging
engineers of coders who want to get him
involved in the 21st century who want to
improve their lives and who want to make
a difference to the world we want to
make sure that there is leadership and
that there's an ethical compass that
they understand the gravity of what they
are doing for the planet for good or
evil
and it's very difficult so let's finally
have a heart to heart because if you've
done any research on us you understand
that we've had some friction between us
and and Google over the years and we
want you to understand why it is we we
do the things we do and sometimes we
have these fights over principle because
sometimes principles all we have
sometimes some of the things you do some
of the things you say and i'm not saying
Google I'm saying the company's the
industry some of the things you say
makes our lives difficult we do a lot of
work in developing countries
particularly in Asia right now where
we're trying to do capacity building to
to help NGOs journalists and other
people and lawyers to understand this
right to privacy and build it in with
their within their legal systems because
most these countries have constitutional
protections that say yes you have the
right to privacy but there's nothing
that that explains what that actually
means that we're trying to build this up
and it's it's surprising that no matter
where we travel in the world we get
these these responses from policymakers
that sound a lot like the responses we
get from industry leaders in the US
privacy's of Western value privacy is a
social norm that's changing privacy is
from the 1990s we need to deal with new
things young people don't care about
privacy these same statements we hear
from leaders of companies in in the
United States word for word are the
exact same statements we get from
policymakers policymakers who've been
briefed before we got there we know
who's briefing them there's a finite
number of people who are traveling
around the world for us industry
briefing against privacy laws and it
drives us nuts because it makes it
difficult and I understand we could have
philosophical differences about how you
should regulate industry but when we're
not regulating industry of what well
sorry while you're fighting against a
regulation of Internet services in other
countries you're making it difficult for
us to call for a comprehensive privacy
regime to make sure the government may
not enter people's homes to make sure
the government may not fingerprint
people unless there's do dude cause make
sure the government cannot do certain
things
and so that we're one of the best
examples of this principle being
interfered with was gmail back in 2004
we ran a campaign to educate people
about the concerns around gmail and the
the keyword advertising within gmail for
what it's worth we've been taking on the
Bush administration for quite some time
right by then we got more hate mail for
going out to gmail than we did for going
out to the bush administration people
didn't understand why would we why would
we insult Google why would we questioned
their motives but for us it was an issue
of principle you were taking this thing
there was a communication that legally
is sacrosanct that is mentioned in
constitutions around the world as
something that may not be interfered
with and you were interfering with it
and we understand you were doing with
great care we understand we know you
weren't looking for keywords the report
to the government but when governments
want to start interfering with the
emails to find keywords what's the first
example they use Gmail does it so why
you concerned that's exactly what we had
to deal with in the UK government two
years ago wanted to do something called
intercept modernization program which
was essentially installing DPI
technology in every ISP in the United
Kingdom to have all this all the traffic
data reported immediately on a real-time
basis to GCHQ the equivalent the NSA and
we oppose this and eventually
fortunately we won but one of the
prevailing arguments from the government
was people are fine with Gmail they're
fine with their information being
interfered with in an email why can't we
do it in a facebook session why can't we
do it in a Skype session why can't we do
it in every other internet application
today and it's hard to fight that
similarly when it comes to the Facebook
view of the world and Zukerberg famous
statement about social values and and
everybody who speaks as if social
networking is this new thing and how
anybody who dares to use social
networking has given up all of his or
her rights to privacy about three years
ago the French government wanted to do
say database and a data mining
application the database of all children
in France and a data mining app that
would basically use all this personal
information on every single child in
to identify potential criminals by the
age 13 they want to identify which chill
which child not group of children which
child will become a criminal and when
campaigners oppose the government on
this saying you can't do this the
children have a right to privacy this is
wrong the French justice minister
responded all these kids use Facebook
say they don't care about privacy we
need to be able to hit back against
stupid statements like that and we do
but it isn't easy when these statements
are made by the leaders when these this
view that innovation must prevail and
all regulation must be left behind that
damages our opportunities to work in
these other countries and push these
issues forward so that's it work with us
I don't know how I don't know whether
you believe in karma or just putting
some energy into this but one way or the
other we know that the there is no time
left it's kind of we can't play around
anymore on this you know that it was
just the reason why we're kind of so
fixed on this now is because we've done
so much traveling to these countries in
the last year and it is what Gus says is
bang on the money we simply can't make
an argument to governments to companies
companies are saying our desk it's
culturally relative you know they don't
care about privacy and ND yes they do
you know ah you know Muslims I care
about privacy these are these are lies
and we are dealing with them they are
liars these people know better they are
spreading a disease of fun truths across
the world which is making it impossible
to entrench rights and security for
people in these countries so how we how
would you help in you know trying to
improve things you know 8,000 miles away
in the middle of a dust bowl
it's going to be a tough one but what I
would I would say is we need ideas we
need thoughts how do we create a more
ethical environment an environment based
on truth and and on the right perception
I know that the people in this room and
the people in this compound are capable
they already have changed the world and
this is a problem they could lick like
that and I know this to be true we know
it to be true the power that's in this
area is extraordinary so please if you
get strange memos that are sort of out
there on the tupperware but you're a
pyramid scheme saying please could you
give us a hand we need your ideas we
need your input give it a second thought
because we think this is the most
important issue of this century for
privacy thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
