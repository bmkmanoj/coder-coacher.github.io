you everyone for showing up on Friday
morning I know some people are working
from home because July 4th is coming up
but I really appreciate you guys being
here my name is Christine Hong I am part
of the international engineering
operations team we helped to set up and
expand our engineering centers worldwide
but this has nothing to do with my job I
just know Adrian and he is a guy who is
so passionate about what he does and he
has a big heart I thought he would be a
fresh breath of air for Googlers and an
inspiration to all of us a little bit
about Adrian he is executive director of
Liberty in North Korea or link he was
recently arrested by the Chinese
authorities in jailed in 2006 for his
work in helping North Korean refugees
escape to freedom and we have lunch
scheduled at charlies you'll see a table
reserved under link and we'll get
started there's link here is I EG hello
and thanks for uh thank you for taking
time out of your day to come here let me
speak and learn a little bit more about
this issue it's probably more to hear
hear about the issue and me before we
start I'd just like to show a short clip
that will it's almost a compilation of
recent news and just kind of footage
surrounding the North Korea crisis but I
will have to sign the DVD player yeah
okay but again my name is Adrian Hong
I'm from one from San Diego but I'm
currently stationed out in Washington DC
I travel a lot but that's where our
offices and organization is a non-profit
non-partisan non-religious non ethnic
group that is focused I guess number one
priority is on North Korean human rights
and I'll get a little bit more into what
that means
you're in second
children were starving dying they were
literally dying under my hand because
there was no food
you
now we're doing operation jump in
the South Korea mr. Kent we gotta make
up
you know people don't care
that's like traumatic things like this
to get people to
pay attention what's really going on in
the world that there are people only 30
kilometers or here suffering and dying
and starving and prison for no reason
they have no human wife
no one cares and multi
these measures to show people make
people care
Oh
time to a hazing
so again my name is Adrian Hong I'm here
speaking on behalf of a group called
Liberty in North Korea or link for short
and I'm going to go into a little bit of
background initially on what exactly we
mean by North Korean human rights how
many of you were aware of i guess the
human rights crisis in North Korea
before you got the email about this
event okay so there's a good amount of
penetration here how many of you were
aware that there were concentration
camps in North Korea okay great well we
have a very socially conscience just
group okay uh well as we're all know
burned into our collective memory is a
memory of the Holocaust right all the
ways early as elementary school middle
school and reading about the Diary of
Anne Frank and watching schindler's list
we have a very strong collective memory
of what happened in Nazi Germany and
during the axis power with the Axis
powers and six million Jews died for 25
million dissidents and criminals not
criminals but criminals according to
their state and other people that were
considered undesirable by the Nazis were
executed were killed and what is I think
one of the darkest times of the last
century after this happened there was a
lot of promises made by individuals and
governments around the world never again
was the phrase that was repeated over
and over again we can never again have a
situation where any country or group can
get away with destroying an entire
people based on their ethnicity their
race religion or political views and the
sad truth of it is despite all those
bold promises we have as you're well
aware the situation in dartford today we
had Rwanda about 10 years ago and
actually we have dart we now have North
Korea as well I'm going to get a little
bit into the background here north korea
currently has about twenty three million
people in its country actually closer to
24 hours of last year it is a communist
totalitarian state which is weird
because it's the only communist dynasty
in history where the father has passed
it on to the Sun and it's essentially
it's not even I think a pure communist
state it's essentially a cult it's it's
a religion based around the founder kim
moo-sung was was passed away about ten
years ago but it's still the leader of
the country and it's a country that is
very different from everything else i
think in the history of the world and
I'll get into a little bit more about
the details there and Kim jong-un as
you're all aware and you're all familiar
from team america world police is now
the current leader and he has one
me this is the Korean War that split the
Korean Peninsula into two so the South
you have a prosperous democratic
capitalist society and in fact if you
know any koreans or korean americans we
all trace our heritage from the south at
least one generation back because if
you're from North Korea you cannot get
out it's just the fact of the matter and
this was Kim Yuna song of course the
leader of North Korea sorry just
gratuitous that's good have taken that
out that's Kim jong-un the current
leader with Jung Jae min the last
president of China this is the border
between North and South Korea the most
heavily fortified border in the world I
think Bill Clinton when he was president
visited the border and said is the
scariest place on earth there are huge
amounts of troop concentrations pointed
at each other between South and North
Korea and technically the two Koreas as
well as the US and these other countries
are still at war it's only an armistice
it's a technically a ceasefire they are
not at peace in fact the United States
doesn't even recognize North Korea and
vice versa as legitimate countries in
the last 10-15 years about 2 to 3
million North Koreans died North Korean
went through a series of famines and
floods from 94 to 96 but the floods and
famines in and of themselves were not
the problem at the time of the floods
and famine North Korea received the most
international aid of all the countries
in the world a lot of it from the United
States they had enough food clearly had
enough food to feed its people but did
not in fact what they did is so then
since they got international aid they
said okay well let's not feed the people
with what we have to begin with let's
sell it on the black market let's feed
the military let's do other things with
that eight in fact there are eight bags
from the Red Cross or things like that
that's a gift of the American people
give to the Japanese people gift of the
EU that have shown up on black markets
in Russia and China also there have been
bags of heroin which North Korea exports
put into aid bags marked by the red
cross and used to smuggle out and so
this is a country that clear does not
consider its people as a vested interest
Kim Jong has been quoted saying that
only ten percent of its country has to
survive only ten percent has to survive
for it to be considered a successful
state so if you're going with that
standard they're not doing so badly
right now but an estimated ten percent
of North Korea did perish in the last
10-15 years about 13 million of all
24 million people in North Carroll
malnourished it's a medical state that
essentially you cannot recover from
chronic malnourishment you cannot if
you're a child from between the ages of
maybe 0 and 5 when your firstborn you
need to get regular food regular breast
milk nutrition otherwise you will get
stunted permanently physically in terms
of your growth in terms of your height
your weight and also mentally you will
get mental retardation because you are
not able to eat functionally when you're
a child and and 13 million of north
korea's population is currently like
that the average ration is 250 grams
which is a minuscule miniscule amount
and most of the people actually don't
even get that ration the world food
program supported 6.5 million people in
North Korea up until about a year ago
when they got kicked out and then now
they brought back in they feed 1.2
million people which means all these
statistics basically what it means is a
lot of people are starving in North
Korea three times as many people started
in North Korean west and years and did
and the Ethiopian and Somalian famine
and so this is a tremendous crisis that
very few people are aware of and the
biggest distinction with this crisis is
that it's man-made it is not a result
directly of a huge tidal wave of a flood
or an earthquake or a natural disaster
it is inherently man-made and that is
why I think it warrants our attention a
little bit more a seven year old North
Korean child is 105 centimeters metric
and a seven year old South Korean South
is 1 125 centimeters that's the average
height between the two countries now
these two countries were not separated
until about nineteen fifty they were one
country for five thousand years so
they're the same DNA the same genetic
makeup but that's the height difference
on average just at seven year olds once
you get older the average height for the
North Korean military's are on five feet
solid for the military would and even at
the DMZ levels you can see that major
distinctions between South Korean
soldiers and American soldiers as
opposed to North Korean soldiers in
terms of health there is no public
health infrastructure whatsoever the
hospitals are overrun there's no
electricity going throughout the country
there's a lack of clean water and
there's a huge huge epidemic crisis with
typhoid scarlet fever tuberculosis and
diseases like dysentery you know things
up did anyone play oregon trail when
they're in elementary school you have
died of dysentery that still happens in
north korea weakened immune systems
cause deaths from the common cold
because your system cannot fight it off
something we get
with a ninth sleep and diamond tab
robitussin if you don't like dimetapp it
kills people in north korea they die
from this because there is no there's a
weakened immune system because they
don't get basic food every day and
finally as i mentioned earlier there is
stunted growth and severe brain damage
in a whole generation of North Korean
children so that is essentially the
context the background of the situation
in North Korea without even getting into
the human rights situation already we're
starting off from severely malnourished
population no no medical care and public
health situation and everybody
inherently is born and raised with what
stunted immune systems and and just
health in general this is a on the right
you see there are two North Korean
refugees their age 21 and 22 years old
on the Left that's myself so those two
gentlemen are very very very small for
their age in fact they were joking
around they look like hobbits and they
were joking around about that but that's
the result of a generation of stunt
physical stunting this is actually when
one of our underground shelters in China
that I'll get into in North Korea the
only information that you get from
anywhere is from the government directly
outside radio news television print
media is all band which means the only
source of information whether it's about
history current affairs or politics is
from Kim jong-il and leaders if you are
caught reading or listening to outside
radio whether it's South Korean or
Russian or Chinese or American if you're
caught reading outside magazines and
newspapers if you're caught changing the
wiring on your television or radio so
you can get outside broadcast you are
sent to a concentration camp that is the
reality of what's happening in North
Korea so you have a whole generation
back when we're talking about not the
the Soviet Union and the Cold War you
had Eastern Europe and you had the
Soviet bloc where you know there was an
amount of propaganda and brainwashing
involved but you could always still turn
the channel and listen to voice of
America a radio for Europe or BBC and
you could get an alternative view and
can you keep you could get a sense for
what was really happening behind the
propaganda not to mention the additional
fact that many of the people that were
living during you know Stalin's rain and
after that had already been born and
raised before that happens so they knew
that the outside world was not really
like that and they bought into the
propaganda just to just for appearances
sake in North Korea it's been there for
over 50 years you have people that are
born and raised in the system and no
nothing else so when you're talking
about you know
up in North Korea reunifying when North
Korea's the South Koreans say or
engaging North Korea you're dealing with
23 million people that don't know what
the real world is like it's literally
like up unplugging from the matrix and
it sounds like a corny analogy but it
literally is that bad where you have
people come out and they're shocked that
there's cars everywhere in America or
they're shocked that South Korea is not
a victim of nuclear holocaust but
they're shocked at American zone of
horns which actually North Korean
children's textbooks have Americans with
horns and tails with pitchforks believe
it or not that's how far the propaganda
is gone and the fact that you have full
grown adults believing that and getting
shocked that that's not the case says a
lot about their mental condition there
are no freedoms of speech religion
assembly movement anything there every
fundamental freedom that exists in the
world in this country in particular
every fundamental freedom that is
guaranteed by the Universal Declaration
of Human Rights does not exist in North
Korea you cannot express even saying hmm
today's rations were not so great is
enough to get you to a concentration
camp in the past we've had refugees
testify that they had been for example
there was a magazine with a picture of
Kim jong-un and they put a cup down on
it and the condensation left a ring that
got them sent to a camp another woman
heard a South Korean pop song I don't
know where she heard it she heard it
somewhere and started whistling it to
her friends her three friends got sent
to a mid-level labor detention camp and
she was sent to a concentration camp the
other thing that's severe about North
Korea system there's about 250,000 when
the concentration camps now and for
example if Christine were to commit a
crime today and you know she she said oh
you know what today's lunch didn't
really taste that good that is
interpreted as being the state is not
good the country is not good the
leadership has failed us in one way or
another and it's supposed to be of
socialist paradise when she says that
she goes to concentration camps but King
her song has a principle that says three
generations must be punished for every
crime to wipe out the seed of dissent
which means her children and her
children's children or her parents and
her children are all sent with her North
Korea is the only country in the last 2
300 years that criminalizes children for
political crimes Mao Hitler Stalin they
all did not throw into political camps
they did it for ethnic reasons but other
things but for actions they did not if
you're a second grader and you go you
know what it's kind of weird that King
jr. gets all of our food and money and
we get nothing I'm your second grader
your precocious you should say what's on
your mind
we'll go to a camp and you will send
your parents and relatives with you as a
gentleman named Hong Jonghyun who's over
80 years old it was the highest ranking
North Korean defector ever to leave that
country he defected through Beijing and
ended up in Seoul he lives essentially
under house arrest in solar now when he
defected seventy households that means
70 families that were somehow related to
him were all sent to concentration camps
and so that is the impact of how it's
like in North Korea when you meet any
North Korean diplomats if you're ever so
fortunate or not there are always
traveling in twos and they never have
their family with them and the reason
for that obviously is so they can keep
each other in check and so that they
don't defect their families are
essentially held hostage the same thing
goes for Olympic athletes for folks that
travel abroad for conferences and
governmental relations and things of
that nature these is this is the map of
the network of North Korean
concentration camps that we know of and
many of these are accessible by our
favorite platform Google Earth as well
in fact that's been a tremendous tool in
helping spread awareness about these
issues and these are just the known
major camps
back during the Holocaust the excuse a
lot of people made was that we did not
know that it was outlandish and
ridiculous that human beings are capable
of such things gas chambers human
experimentation zyklon-b that they could
not conceive of a government
institutionalizing and turning their
energies to creating an infrastructure
to kill people in that huge number to
have train lines going to concentration
camps have guards his sole function was
to kill people the fastest to recycle
human hair human bones to remake goods
for the war movement that was ridiculous
and inconceivable for the outside world
and then obviously and obviously at the
time a lot of government officials
actually knew this to be true but after
the war ended the world was stunned
after the war ended people were worded
in shock the Allied troops that
liberated Dachau and Auschwitz were in
shock they could not believe that human
beings were capable of such and I know
evils overused these days but but it is
evil today we have unbelievable amounts
of proof eleven thousand refugees have
come to South Korea among them prison
guards and prison administrators people
that used to run these camps and say
this is how many people I had in my camp
this is the product that we were forcing
them to make there's how many public
executions we had a week they've labeled
each building to tell us what each
building was used for we know what time
they wake up what songs their forces
saying how many steps they have to take
around the building when they're
punished and what the names of the
guards are we know that much detail and
we have satellite pictures of all the
camps in North Korea that's the
difference between today and maybe
nineteen thirty-five or nineteen forty
we have the awareness it's just a matter
of a lack of will or political will to
make a difference about this in the
camps in North Korean in general there
are sister is a system of public
execution if you commit a crime against
the state that's warranted bad enough to
make an example of you say you try to
escape from a concentration camp so you
try to lead an uprising or say you just
say one day I am tired of a forced
military draft the military draft in
North Korea is over ten years ten years
at seventeen you go in for 10 years and
or more if you complain you're tied up
to a stake you're beaten up and they
fill your mouth with rocks does anybody
know why that might be I'm sorry close
they're already beaten up tremendously
but I mean they're filled with rocks so
they can't speak because if you're about
to get shot and publicly executed you
know you have nothing to lose at that
point you're going to speak your mind
and say this government sucks or our
situation is not right this is not
inherently morally ethically right so
they fill their mouths with rocks
and then they tie it into a post in the
public execute them we actually have
videos I have some available on to see
it of public executions in North Korea
the other thing they do in concentration
camps is that they make the family of
the victim or the accused come up and
put stone him to death before they shoot
him and they make every single person in
the concentration camp come up pick up a
rock and throw it at the guy in order to
say we are we agree with the state you
have committed a crime we are purging
you from our society if you do not you
will be strung up next in that is the
way north korea has created the system
you're either with them or against them
and if you're against them you die there
are no champion speaking on their behalf
there's no underground dissident
movement there's no revolution there are
no outside governments or agencies of
the UN speaking out for them are saying
today for more people are executed you
know last week 200 people died in
concentration camps it's just not there
there are force rapes and abortions in
these camps in particular when women
come back from China and I'll get into
why they end up in China to begin with
if they come back pregnant they're
assumed to be a child of mixed race of
mixed heritage probably with Chinese
blood in North Korea's official state
policy believe it or not is of a pure
Korean race where they say if you are
child of mixed heritage we will kill you
if woman comes out pregnant from China
they were forcibly abort the baby and
it's not you know in a hospital and
sanitary conditions they use a syringe
filled with salt water and if that
doesn't work they kick the woman stomach
until the baby dies and if that doesn't
work they wait to the baby is born put
it in a box and let it die out of
exposure that's the way they do this
weekly on a weekly basis in North Korea
in fact when Hines Ward if you're
familiar with the Pittsburgh Steelers
MVP for the Super Bowl when he won the
Super Bowl he South Korea was fanatical
about him they said look he's so great
he's one of our you know our sons and
we're so proud of him North Korea
actually went as far as to issue a
public statement that said that they
condemned South Korea's love affair with
mixed race and that they when they say
one drop of mixed race in the Han River
will not dilute 5,000 years of racial
purity the government issued a statement
saying this that's the kind of system
we're doing this it's unreal it's
something we watchin movies or we see in
the history channel it's happening right
now in 2007 infanticide as I mentioned
earlier is widespread in that country
hot boxes this is basically it's
literally a box just the size of a human
body where you crouch down
and you cannot move in is just in the
Sun and you bake there forever they
leave you out there for weeks if you if
you do anything that scene has any hint
of rebellion when you're in a
concentration camp defectors have
testified that they would sit in these
boxes for weeks burning their flesh
because obviously they can't move in
it's made of metal and any bugs and
caterpillars and rats that was scurry by
they would grab a need that would be the
only way they could survive gas chambers
there are strong allegations of gas
chambers in North Korea several
defectors that have left have actually
brought out paperwork detailing the
details of glass chambers that are made
of glass so that scientists can study
what effect the gas has on families that
are putting their together for example
one story personal an actor that I have
we were with a bunch of defectors that
came to Washington DC and we were
helping them tell their stories and they
were all arm wrestling each other
they're like there were like children
they're all are missing each other and
then one guy just was destroying
everybody else hands down easily and
then he said the reason I'm so strong on
my right hand is that when i was a child
they forced us to cut down wood every
day firewood when they what he would
grow up in a concentration camp
essentially so his right arm was
incredibly strong because he would have
to cut wood all of his life there was
another defector that's now 16 years old
that is now in the United States we
brought him out ourselves he pointed out
on Google Maps a cultural center a
museum in a school that he went to his
house he pointed out his house and then
he told us a huge complex the factory
down the street from the school was
built by them in elementary school every
day they wouldn't study math or science
or history they would walk out march
down the street and dig in coal mines
every day at the age of 10 and 12 and
they had to literally build this camp
that's the way the society has been in
North Korea at the camp I witnessed
public executions forced labor and other
inhumane atrocities a new prisoner in
the North Korean political prisoner
camps is taught not to consider
themselves as human beings the prisoners
cannot complain of beatings or even
murders even the children are subject to
forced labor and about one-third of them
died of malnutrition and heavy labor I
also suffered from malnutrition after
being imprisoned lacking even the
strength to walk
I witnessed the whole family being
tested on suffocating gas and dying in
the gas chamber the parents son and a
daughter the parents are vomiting and
dying but till the very last moment they
tried to save the kids by doing
mouth-to-mouth breathing later in ten
years or in sixty will surely turn out
that quite a lot was known in 2004 or
now 2007 about the camps of North Korea
it will turn out that information
collected by various human rights groups
South Korean churches all ball
journalists and spies added up to a damn
thing and largely accurate picture of an
evil regime it will turn out that there
were things that could have been done
approaches a South Korean government
might have made diplomatic channels the
US government might have opened pressure
the Chinese might have applied
historians and Asia Europe and here
we'll finger various institutions just
as we do now and demand they justify
their past actions and no one will be
able to understand how it was possible
that we knew of the existence of the gas
chambers but failed to act and again
these are more satellite pictures of the
campuses Jojo Kemp which is by far the
most notorious the Auschwitz basically
of North Korea and again the 250,000
people in there now and the half million
that died in the last 30 years they've
committed no crime these are not
criminals murderers rapists arsonist
these are basically citizens that have
you know expressed a little bit of
discontent or wanted to practice
Buddhism right you know any religion
outside of what the state has practiced
or one day did not show up to
re-education class every week every
person in North Korea has to get in
their little small group the whole
country is regiment into small groups
and you have to criticize each other
mutual criticism sessions where you tell
the other person what you did wrong that
week against the state any correction
says comrade so-and-so the dear leader
would not like it if you did this back
and forth there everybody is an
informant in that country everybody is
an informant in fact it's if you don't
report on someone else's crimes or
someone else's descent you will also go
to a concentration camp so it's very
well known in that country that these
are places work from where you cannot
return there are about 400,000 North
Korean refugees hiding in China and
other countries if you were in North
Korea today
a most likely you would want to leave
unless you're one of the military leads
or the political elites and so they
obviously try to leave across the border
into China now the border between China
and North Korea is a river at some point
there's no no wider than from here to
that door over there and at some point
it's only up to knee height so the
average person can probably sneak out
every 50 meters along that border if you
ever visit there you'll see them there
are little bunkers of wood with North
Korean soldiers sitting there pointing
at China for any refugees that might run
across there literally shoot them in the
back and that said if the Chinese
authorities will catch you they will
send them back to North Korea North
Korea's Constitution their actual law
criminalizes leaving the country without
permission that's a UN universal human
right to freedom of movement but in
North Korea you cannot leave without
permission you can't even leave your
hometown if you run out of food or your
electricity isn't work or there's no
clean water you will die if you know for
a fact the town next door literally if
it's 50 meters away if the borders right
there you cannot go over and get food or
water it's criminalized you need a
permit an actual permit from the
government to leave your town to leave
the country is treason no matter why you
leave if you accidentally got drunk and
stumbled over if you were hungry if you
if your little sister ran across and you
went back together or if you were trying
to defect whatever your reasoning was if
you leave that country you've committed
treason and it's punishable by death in
that country which means we have about
half a million North Koreans running
around in the underground in China and
Russia and these other countries
Thailand Vietnam that aren't hiding from
there authorities and China actually in
particular hunts them down and sends
them back to North Korea and the senior
national is reported that they're wired
through their collar bones because they
can't afford handcuffs they literally
wire them through their collar bones put
them in trucks and send them back other
refugees have told us that they
literally put barbed wire through their
palms and then tie them and we've had
refugees show us their scars here in
their hands and they actually marked
them physically so they know how many
times had been caught that's the reality
of what's happening to end that border
there at this moment these refugees as I
mentioned are repatriated to severe
punishment an estimated seventy to
ninety percent of the woman among these
refugees are sexually traffic they're
sold on the black market sometimes for
as little as a hundred dollars refugees
that testified that they've been sold
several times over if you're younger and
more attractive you're sold for a higher
rate if you're older and less attractive
you're sold for less and they basically
use them and discard them refugees have
told us that they got into a cab they
cross into China somehow they got into
haven't they said I want to go to the
embassy or I want to go to this church
and I want to go to my relatives house
the path driver picked up their accent
realized they were North Korean drove
them to wear off and sold her off what
do you do at that point you can't speak
the language you can't go to the police
because they'll send you back there's no
choice there's there's no solution at
that point there are other situations
where they go into a restaurant and the
restaurant pretends to take them in and
says you know what we'll take care of
you have some soup get some rest in the
morning we'll take you to a church and
they'll protect you the soup was drugged
they wake up tied to a basement and tied
to a pole in the basement that that is
the reality of what's happening to over
seventy percent of these women out there
so when we talk about sex trafficking
when we talk about human rights
violations when we talk about
concentration camps it is all happening
in North Korea today to a tremendous
tremendous degree among these many of
the children are also traffic if you go
out there if you go to the for example
the train station and northeastern China
you'll get swarmed by little kids coming
up to your waist asking for money every
now and then the Chinese government
cracks down and sends them all back to
North Korea as per their arrangement and
where they're put into cancer if it's
severely severely punished for what
they've done another problem we have is
this well first of all does anyone know
why there's a huge shortage of females
in northeastern China females of
marriageable age does anyone know why
that is yes the one-child policy has
resulted in sex-selective abortions
feticide and infanticide so basically
adds of 2010 China will be short by an
estimated thirty million females 30
million females I mean 30 million guys
are going to be needing wives and so as
a result this black market trafficking
market has created we're bringing in
people from Thailand from Burma but also
in huge numbers from North Korea now I'm
not saying all these unions between
Chinese males and North Korean females
or North Korean meals and Chinese
formulas are loveless and they're all
trafficking that's not the case there
are many situations that we know
personally even where Chinese male has
been very very noble and just a good guy
and they fall in love and they have
children a problem with that is even if
they've legitimately married with a
Chinese citizen that woman is illegal
for life even if they have a child than
child's father is legitimate Chinese
citizen he is illegal for life he cannot
go to school he can that get a job and
he can not get medical care there is no
life whatsoever in that country through
one or two years old that's okay you can
sit at home play with your mother you're
56 you need to go to school
if you're 10 12 or 18 you need to get a
job and get out of the house there's a
whole underclass in China so every
100,000 of these people that cannot move
cannot leave their homes cannot do
anything anything at all and so to
address this link is actually open up
about 50 underground shelters throughout
the region or we have our staff members
that go in there literally hide refugees
just like you would imagine an end
Frank's attic under the bookcase and
they bounce around different shelters
whenever one gets rated that that's the
only solution we can think of outside of
having the Chinese government change
their policy and I'm sure we're all
aware here of how difficult that is to
do the International Convention on
refugees defines a refugee as a person
who is outside his or her country of
nationality or habitual residence has a
well-founded fear of persecution because
of his or her race religion nationality
membership in a particular social group
or political opinion and is unable or
unwilling to avail himself or herself of
the protection of that country or return
their fear persecution all this fancy
talk basically means you cannot go back
to your home country because you will be
killed or punished all these refugees in
China effectively fall into that
category and so the UNHCR which is a UN
agency that deals with refugees should
by all rights go into China find these
people give them certificate and say
they're refugees and protect them from
repatriation of North Korea it does not
not not what's over there is no agency
in the world that is protecting North
Korean refugees right now there are a
limited amount that have escaped whether
they cross on foot all the way to
Mongolia or Thailand or other countries
that might let them out or somehow
they've gotten the guts to jump a fence
into an embassy it like the Spanish
Embassy and as the Spanish to send them
to the US or to South Korea by and large
most these people are just rotting away
in basements they cannot do anything
because the Chinese government will hunt
them down especially in advance of the
2008 Olympics when China it's China's
time to shine on the world stage so
these people are literally been chased
down being hunted and sent back in large
numbers at the moment this is the border
between China and North Korea if you
look here this tiny little bit of water
that's that that's the river that's a
tumor of it so you can imagine how easy
it is for refugee that's living across
the river and starving or being
persecuted to cross over into China and
China to them is a whole new world it's
shocking when they hit China they see
the amount of cars and television and
media
yeah the fact you have more than one
channel on TV in fact that you have more
than one type of cheese and in a
supermarket I mean it's it's shocking to
them they're stuck in a time warp so the
transition from there that South Korea
is huge and then from there the United
States is tremendous it's life-changing
for them but 400,000 these people are
living out there right now back before
the civil war in this country we had
something called the Fugitive Slave Act
does anyone know what that is yes feels
like class okay sure he does know
essentially the northern states were
free the southern states held slaves and
so many slaves escaped from by their
plantations to the north to places like
Connecticut and New Jersey and declare
their freedom that they had the southern
states rebelled and said we want you to
pass Fugitive Slave Linux which
basically said if the slave would escape
to the north we will send them right
back to where they came from and what
would happen when they got sent back
they would be tortured they would be
raped or they would be killed it was not
illegal to kill your slave at that time
it's a dark chapter in American history
it's a time when we compromise our
morality for the sake of political
stability I would say and it's happening
again this is this is just exactly what
South Korea with China what a lot of
these countries are doing they are
sending back refugees or taking an only
minimal amounts and discouraging them
from coming for the sake of good
diplomatic relations with North Korea
this is a detention center in China this
picture was taken by myself and I'm not
particularly ninja or CIA trained
literally we just went up there and took
a picture that's how real and accessible
this is this is where they process North
Korean refugees before they're sent back
to North Korea proper we know for a fact
that several people have died there
because we've counted the number that
have gone in and blew fewer numbers have
come out in fact the mother of one of
our activists in China also perished
here this is a North Korean defector who
was formerly a member of Kim Jong is joy
team Kim Jong and this sounds ridiculous
has a squad of about 2,000 woman split
up into three categories happiness
satisfaction and joy team they make up
singers dancers gymnasts and also people
that perform obviously it's essentially
as his personal harem and she escaped
when she was on the Pyongyang's official
gymnastics team and she came out to
testify at the United States about this
we've got defectors testify in the
Senate this woman on the upper left she
is the one that song South Korean pop
song and got sent to a prison camp for
whistling at South Korean pop song
these people have testified in agencies
throughout the world at the US Senate
the house of representatives the United
Nations the European Union and nothing
is being done for them nothing at all
and I can say that very clearly there's
nothing being done for these people so
link initially started as a reaction to
this when you hear about these things
your first reaction is wow that really
sucks your second reaction is well
someone must be doing something for this
so I'll just help them that's how we
started and we discovered that nobody
was doing anything about this and if
they were they were using human rights
as a means to an end and we felt that it
needed to be a movement purely for the
sake of human rights so we started out
very in the typical amateur grass this
way we had some concerts for them
benefit concerts we had protests we had
defectors speak this is outside the
Chinese embassy the Chinese mission
actually in New York to the UN and they
usually shut down and lock up and kicks
it out when that happens we had artists
starting to prepare art for this cause
and major forms where we had defectors
speak about their experiences all over
the country and since then we've
actually broached out to 100 chapters
worldwide all the way in Australia South
Korea EU countries and throughout the
United States and Canada in the last
three years we've actually developed a
great deal beyond that to where we got a
little bit more sophisticated about a
third of what we do is based on advocacy
a third of it is based on awareness and
a third of it is on underground work and
I'll get into that in a minute this is a
protest we did it in front of the South
Korean UN mission does anyone have a
question why we would do that in from
the South Korean mission after all it is
a capitalist free society they are not
actively running concentration camps the
reasoning for this is that South Korean
government has instituted something
called the sunshine policy where they
give unconditional amounts of aid to
North Korea and don't ask where it goes
if you give cash up to billions of
dollars if you give huge amounts of food
grain medicine to North Korea and don't
ask them who's getting it can we monitor
the food obviously they're going to be
used using it for legitimate means
beyond that the South Korean government
is censored defectors from sneaking on
publicly they've actively worked to
discourage groups like ours from
speaking publicly in South Korea and
prevented giving visas to defectors that
wanted to go leave the country to
testify about this in other words the
South Korean government is clamping down
on Human Rights dialogue to prevent bad
relations with North Korea and so we had
a protest as science of 22 million is
more important to talk talk talk though
is an island between Korea and Japan
it's uninhabited it's maybe the size of
googolplex and north and Japan and South
Korea basically declared diplomatic war
against each other over an island I
understand is important it is Korean
territory it comes with fishing rights
and mining rights but there are no lives
on that island the South Korean
president to date has said not a single
word about North Korean human rights we
briefed a congressional delegation going
from this country to South Korea to meet
with him and they asked him why is your
government not taking a stance on human
rights in North Korea and the president
of South Korea's answer was it is a
peripheral issue the rights of 22 now 24
million Koreans a third of all the
koreans on the planet is a peripheral
issue concentration camps mass
starvation malnutrition public
executions as a peripheral issue and so
generally you can separate our work as I
mentioned earlier into advocacy three
different categories the first
category's advocacy we do briefings of
governments worldwide I just met with
the Canadians and the French the
European Union we travel all throughout
the world I was at the Human Rights
Council in Geneva we're trying to
exhaust all available diplomatic
resources to get this resolved because
we're not advocating war or military
intervention we're advocating saving
their lives and where our point is that
what's happening in North Korea
constitutes crimes against humanity and
it does legally by the legal definition
it does a lot of people ask me what
makes North Korea different or why we
pick North Korea and it's not because I
happen to be Korean and in fact I think
that there are lots of just the noble
causes throughout the world that are
happening we need to get ourselves
involved in Darfur it's 34 years too
late we've called it a genocide for
years and we haven't done anything the
same similar situations are happening in
Eastern Europe in Tibet throughout the
world there are minorities being
persecuted for no reason besides a race
religion or political views and there
are lots of crises Katrina happened in
this country we have epidemics here in
this country in South America and the
tsunami you'd saw outpouring of support
the difference between North Korea and
all of those situations is that nowhere
have I ever seen and I you can say I'm
biased so much of a concentrated
incredible institutionalize deliberate
human rights violation as in North Korea
there's not a tsunami that we couldn't
predict and then we try to react and we
fail it's not a failed state but there's
a civil war and to warlords are fighting
for power it's not a disease that
rampages throughout society and the
government is just too weak to stop it
it's deliberate they don't need to build
these concentration camps they don't
need to publicly execute citizens they
don't need to take they have enough food
to feed the people they get huge amounts
of a four-mile all countries in the
world
they do not get that food to the people
it's a deliberate slow motion death it's
it's deliberately wiping out their own
population for political reasons than to
stay in power and that is what makes
North Korea is so different from
everything else it's entirely 100%
man-made and as a result if man doesn't
do something to stop it I think it's on
our conscience more then a tsunami would
be or tornado or an earthquake or
disease that we could not necessarily
stop altogether North Korea does not
need to be doing this in any way even
strategically there's no real
justification for these human rights
violations but so long as the rest of
world doesn't say anything about it so
along with the United States and China
and the European Union and the UN never
bring it up they will continue to do
this and basically we will not get in
there until they've all died and that's
that's just the fact of the matter so we
continue to do briefings all over the
world we do policy objectives where we
push different governments to take
refugees in to talk to the North Koreans
about human rights to help refugees
resettle and speak out in public in
terms of awareness we've had about a
hundred chapters throughout the world as
of last November we do a lot of
mainstream media outreach we're working
on for example Hollywood that does
movies on North Korea push them to make
sure they include an element on human
rights we try to get it out there in the
common culture so people are talking
about it and in terms of action as I
mentioned before we have something
called Project safe haven which is a
network of several dozen underground
shelters in China these are run by 2030
a year old something Americans mostly
that go and they're sneak in basically
and they work in the underground hiding
refugees and sometimes you have to move
them from shelter to shelter sometimes
for example last year we had a teenage
boy two of them actually that we're on a
train going to a different shelter
because they have to move so they don't
arouse suspicion the conductor ask them
for their IDs they didn't have them and
they got sent back to North Korea so
it's very very dangerous we also have
projects that feed North Korean children
inside North Korea we feed about 500 a
month obviously without the government
knowing that it's us doing it and we
also have something where there's about
15,000 North Korean forced laborers
outside of North Korea in democracies
actually some of them we have about
11,000 currently in I'm Shem sorry 3,000
currently in Russia North Korea always a
huge amount of debt to Russia but it
doesn't have anything to pay it back
with so what they did is they actually
sent three thousand slave laborers to
Siberia to cut timber all day long and
they're guarded by North Korean guards
it's essentially a North Korean prison
camp colony in Russia and Russia has a
country that the u.s. deals with all the
time
similar things are happening in China
Mongolia Libya Madagascar the Czech
Republic and Poland there's 15,000 of
these workers and countries like the
Czech Republic and Poland our
democracies and members of the EU in
fact we went to the Czech Republic went
on site to find these camps interviewed
the girls actually there were about
three hundred seventy two girls from 18
to 22 we interviewed them talk to them
about their circumstances they could not
leave the embassy at night they went to
their group housing they did not get
paid the pay that they received one
straight to the embassy essentially
they're slaves essentially and they're
in countries that we have good relations
with as the United States so we talked
to them and as of last May they actually
shut that down up there another fifteen
thousand throughout the world that are
waiting for somebody to do something
about and finally we actually actively
run underground railroad operations
myself included where we will take a
group of refugees that's ready and
wanting to leave the country to go to
South Korea of the United States or
anywhere else obviously they have to be
at a mental state where they're ready to
do so but if they are and if we think we
can do it without too much risk there's
always risk but without too much we go
on an operation we try to get them out
of the country that's what we did in
October and we succeeded in bringing the
third the first three North Korean
orphans ever into this country there now
enrolled in American public high schools
one of them is taking hip-hop classes at
the Y I mean their lives are completely
completely different completely
different and that shows how honestly
how easy it is to make change because
we're not especially trained we don't
have million dollars behind us we're not
agents of any government we're just
amateur grassroots people that are doing
this but it's managed to save lives and
then that's kind of one of the points
that I want to stress today is that we
need to band around to do this similarly
last December we had the same attempt
where there were six North Korean
refugees that we were trying to get out
and it did not work we actually it was
very effective we got very far and at
one point you know when the movie is
where I'm like you rob a bank and go
throwing and then the SWAT cars pull up
and there's like 300 soldiers and our
guards and everyone that's literally
what happened and three of my activists
including myself and six of our refugees
all got arrested and we'll put in
Chinese prison this isn't to brag about
you know that I've done time and we're
hardcore more so than that it's the fact
that the Chinese government criminalizes
helping these refugees which is a
violation of international law and
frankly just conscience it's just wrong
to be doing this and these refugees are
sent back by hundreds or two three
hundred a week
into North Korea with a face basically
certain torture and death the refugees
that were caught with us in December are
actually still in prison today we were
released for reasons that are still kind
of unclear to us other activists that
have done the same work even if they're
American citizens are still in Chinese
prison several the more tortured one was
released last thing saving with syringe
marks all over both arms and he still
experiences severe hallucinations at
night when he's sleeping he thinks he's
back in prison and starts punching his
family members trying to escape this is
a travesty it's an atrocity and it's
going along for too long without the
world pay attention and if you have any
questions about that we can get inta
later but in a wrap of this presentation
a lot of people say why are you so why
are you hurrying this why are you trying
so hard to make this happen and my
parents in particular say this why don't
you finish going to school getting a
family making a lot of money and then do
something for the cost and Langston
Hughes once wrote i tire so of hearing
people say let things take their course
tomorrow is another day I do not need my
freedom when I'm dead I cannot leave on
live on tomorrow's bread this is one of
the protests that we've done outside of
the South Korean UN mission this is a
contrast between the celebration and
tears over South Korea not making it to
the quarterfinals of the last world cup
in germany and the 23 million North
Koreans that are suffering as a result
of general apathy and a lot of people
say why are you talking about human
rights you're working against peace
you're going to cause war you're going
to called eat cause destabilization and
there's a quote by the Dalai demo that
addresses this perfectly says peace in
the sense of the absence of war is of
little value to someone who is dying of
hunger or cold it will not remove the
pain of torture inflicted on a prisoner
of conscience it does not comfort those
who have lost their loved ones and
floods caused by senseless deforestation
and peace can only exist where human
rights are respected where the people
are fed and where individuals and
nations are free
and these are diplomats walking right by
our demonstrations into their offices
finally as long as one dissident is in
prison our freedom will not be true as
long as one child is hungry our life
will be filled with anguish and Shane
what all these victims need above all is
to know that they are not alone that we
are not forgetting them that when their
voices are stifled we shall end Amar's
and that while their freedom depends on
ours the quality of our freedom depends
on there's our lives are longer belong
to us alone they belong to all those who
need us desperately this is ely wiesel
he's actually a Nobel Prize winning
author he's actually that guy right
there he is a survivor of Auschwitz camp
he's a Holocaust survivor very well
known he's actually based out in New
York and his argument is very clear we
are not truly free until everybody is
free and the people that are not free
need to know that we are doing something
for them I know this firsthand after
what I experienced in December being in
the prison sucks especially a Chinese
prison but knowing the fact that people
outside knew I was in there and that
they were doing something for me even if
it would take 20 30 years the fact that
they were thinking about it kept me
going frankly and I wasn't in there for
very long I wasn't there for 10 days but
it wasn't years now there are defectors
and refugees and activists that have
been there for decades people that have
been born and raised in a concentration
camp these people are assigned numbers
are taken away of their names and their
told that they're not even human that
their dogs that if you die today no one
will notice now if you're born and
raised in that society it's an atrocity
that we have to we have to account for
that we have to answer for finally
there's one last story and I'm very fond
of quotes I'm sorry for doing this too
long but you're all familiar with the
Good Samaritan story it's in the Bible
it's part of I guess judeo-christian
culture where there's a guy that's
basically beaten up and lying on the
side of the road and a priest and a
Levite walked by him and just kind of
look at him and keep going they don't
bother to help him and then a Good
Samaritan of Samaritan what the time was
not really kind of he was kind of on
marginalized part of society stopped to
help him and you know washed him up gave
him that gave emotion healing crimson
sent him on his way and there was a
point to that parable was that you
should help your neighbor Martin Luther
King talked about this parable but
articulated it a little bit differently
and I think it applies here he said and
you know it's possible that the priest
and the Levite looked over that man on
the ground and wondered if the robbers
were still around or it's possible that
they felt that the man on the ground was
merely faking and he was acting like he
had been
didn't hurt in order to seize them over
there and northern for a quick and easy
seizure and so the first question the
Levite asked was if I stopped to help
this man what will happen to me and
that's the question many of us asking
the world if I take my time out for this
cause whether it's North Korea or dark
fur or after school education if I do
this what will happen to my job my time
my personal health my fitness what will
happen but then the Good Samaritan came
by and he reversed the question if I do
not stop to help this man what will
happen to him and that's I think of it's
a fundamental difference in how we can
think about these situations that will
make us actually do a little bit more
the situation in North Korea I have no
doubt one day that these concentration
camps will be liberated I have no doubt
one day that North and South Korea may
reunify that will be able to take
tourist trips some of us already have
but wider scale of free access to our
strips in North Korea meet North Koreans
have them come over work here go to
local schools I know that will happen
one day my question is how many people
will die before we get there and the
direct answer to that is not when King
jr. gives up is not when the next u.s.
president presses the North Koreans of
the Chinese the answer to that is when
we as a people as a country as a culture
stand up and do something about it an
organization is incredibly small right
now I have 10 full timers for three
years I had two full timers those ten
actually joined on I think two months
ago nobody gets paid everybody works pro
bono we have no formal training
whatsoever but we've been able to save
countless lives of refugees we've been
able to accomplish a lot diplomatically
just because we're talking about it
because nobody else is and in a
democracy like this one that's all you
need is voices and constituents saying
we care about this but until that
happens these people will continue to be
in this situation and every man is
guilty of all the good that he didn't do
finally I'm going to show up I'm sorry
this is a group of the last the orphan
boy that I mentioned earlier that's
clearly me and my mom said why do you
even bother that looks like you but uh
these are three North Korean orphans the
14 16 and 17 years old they are the
first ones to come out of this come out
of North Korea to this country this one
in the middle he when he was 12 years
old he woke up and his mother had just
disappeared his father had already
passed away actually of starvation his
mother just disappeared one morning
about a couple weeks later his sister
disappeared in all of a sudden he was
homeless his neighbors sold this house
and he was homeless in the streets in
North Korea for three years just walking
around selling wood firewood that he
would get on the street then one day he
said you know what forget this I'm going
to cross over into China somehow as a 15
year old he crossed over into China
ended up in our shelters and last
October actually hadn't we had a
undergone mission where we're hiding
from the police and we actually brought
him out and now he's here these are
success stories these our lives that are
fundamentally changed and for him he can
do anything with his life he can be the
next Martin Luther King can be a teacher
you can raise his own family his life is
fundamentally changed forever there are
400 400 thousand more of him hiding in
the underground in China with no one to
speak out on their behalf if you're
interested in learning more about what
we do our organization website is linked
global don't Arg our blog is Zenga
comebacks whistling korea if you have
personal questions you can bring up in a
asked I have business cards as well but
essentially what we're asking is not for
you to just know about the situation
there's going to be a time 5 10 20 years
later when your kids will come home from
school or your grandkids and say mom and
dad did you know about this we just
spent a chapter learning about the North
Korean human rights crisis what did you
do and at that point we want to have the
excuse about saying that we didn't know
what happened because you just heard me
blab on about it for 40 minutes and the
excuse of ignorance will not be there
anymore we have satellite pictures we
have witness testimonies and the excuse
of nobody asked me to do anything won't
be there either because I'm asking you
now to please help at that point I think
as a society as a culture as a world
will have some accounting to do because
this is a failure of humanity this
really is it's a situation where human
beings do not need to die but they are
in huge numbers in huge numbers even if
it was one person dying unjustly I think
it warrants our intervention but one is
24 million suffering when it's 500,000
in prison
I want to talk to the thousands of
refugees being sold on the black market
I think it warrants our immediate
attention in action whether it's
politically convenient or not whether we
a lien 8 China and our business
interests are or the United States and
its administration and stability it does
not matter ethically morally and
consciously in terms of our conscience
this is the right thing to do is to do
something for these people to close that
I want to show a short video clip about
two minutes long of our underground
shelters in China so you can get kind of
a visual of what we mean when we talk
about shelters in the underground all
the people in this footage are actually
still there in the underground in China
we have not yet been able to get them
out and personally I am banned from
China for five years so our underground
operations that are on hold for a little
while can we try up the sound please

end of a plane
thank you
if you'd like to get involved in helping
over the situation please again check
the website a link above the Oregon sign
up for the listserv we do have times
when we need literally mass manpower for
petitions that because he work in things
of that nature specific things we need
nobody in the office gets paid and
that's okay the funding goes directly to
our shelters but you'd be surprised how
little we get a month it's literally a
couple grand a month that funds 50
underground shelters underground
operations briefings with different
governments all of that which means a
little bit more money can make a huge
difference and clearly save lives I had
a refugee come to me and was he was
about 30 years old he was very
sheepishly looking at me the whole time
like you wanted to say something and he
didn't and I asked someone else with him
does he want to ask me something he said
yes he said he cannot see he cannot
cross the street because he's almost
blind and then he wants to know if I can
get him some glasses I was like oh of
course I'll get him glasses you know I
was thinking lenscrafters 70 bucks he
says it'll cost four dollars for years
he could not walk across to properly
with that in esco because he couldn't
see because his eyesight was so bad
because of a lack of four dollars that's
a situation that there and the refugees
that I showed you in their pictures 14
16 years old I asked him after I got
arrested and the 6th refugees are still
in prison obviously I had a moral kind
of crisis where I was thinking is this
the right thing to do six people are now
in prison because of this and I asked
him what if you had gotten caught while
trying to escape how would you have felt
would you have been upset would you
regretted it and he said one day in as a
merit in America is more than a lifetime
in Korea is more than North Korea is
more than years in China he said that at
any time they would have a little bit of
fun and start laughing they would all of
a sudden have to stop themselves for
fear of getting reported by the
neighbors that they could not get a good
night's sleep because they would wake up
with nightmares that Chinese guards had
come in to rest them that's the reality
for these people so in terms of things
we need you if you if it's in your heart
to donate you can if you'd like to help
out in advocacy you can even
specifically with Google about eighty
ninety percent of these concentration
camps are just blurs on Google Earth we
cannot see them and I know that recently
in the news there's been announcements
with partnerships with nonprofits or you
get higher resolution pictures satellite
imagery for some of these sites for
example in Darfur with the Holocaust
Museum those are some things we need
because we can say go to this location
on google earth but there's nothing
there that's that you can't see anything
that's a huge tool to promote awareness
and engagement from the grassroots there
are lots of specific things like that if
you have questions but I know we're
ashore for time so maybe we take one or
two questions yeah one or two questions
and then we'll break
for lunch does anybody have any
questions or yes good question the
question is why is this not my car why
is not a bigger deal in South Korea why
is there no national out bra the easiest
answer for that is that South Korea
likes its economy as it is it went
through some hardship in the 60s and 70s
it had the IMF crisis and the 90s and
now they're actually the tenth largest
economy in the world and their reasoning
is if we harass North Korea about human
rights they will destabilize it will
declare war they might attack us or even
if they collapse they're refugees will
come to South Korean become basically a
huge welfare population the argument is
entirely based on economy and non
stability that's what it is you would
think that South Koreans would be the
most active given the fact that they're
literally blood brothers and sisters
literally in fact some of them came from
North Korea in the sixth season
immigrated here or to South Korea but
the South Korean government for the last
15 years has clamped down on information
to where believe it or not after sitting
through this you now know more than
average South Korean grad students on
this issue fact we had a lecture at the
at the Center for International Studies
in South Korea and they didn't know
about concentration camps happening 15
minutes north of them so that's the
situation that the South Korean people
aren't as well so I think it's up to the
grassroots everywhere else that know
about this to do something about it
other questions okay well interesting
you
