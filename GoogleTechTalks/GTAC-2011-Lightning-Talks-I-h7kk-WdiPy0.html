talks now I'm going to get some rules
here going we have 30 minutes total for
these lightning talks and there is no
room for negotiation here now we have
two mics so we've got Lucy Chris Tim you
Katerina and then sigh I think that's
the so so first to need to Russia and
Chris need to get your mics on and then
rusi when you come down Tim you need to
be miked up so you guys need to be ready
to be miked okay because there's only
going to be a few seconds in between in
between talks so let me get this set up
here so when I press play you're going
to have 15 seconds per slide and the
slides going to change it doesn't matter
what you're saying the slides are going
to change and eventually it's going to
get to the point of having a gee tac
slide and then I'm just going to turn
your mic off this gentleman here is
going to turn your mic off and the next
Mike's going to come on okay so
hopefully you guys have practiced this
who's first well and Lucy all right yeah
Lucy's first
in honor of all the Russian guests we
have a russian-speaking but he's
Bulgarian don't tell anybody I want to
make sure you're ready because i'm going
to press this and then we're going to go
you might have you might have 15 seconds
on this slide to to introduce yourself
so rusi rusev is from vmware i will
bounce up wit real quickly just to say
your name and where you're from and then
any additional time you have left on
that starter slide as yours to just sort
of begin the wind up process okay all
right we're ready for this this works up
I'll die all right
let's talk about cascading failures
cascading failures arise when a failure
in one component affects other
components around it triggering a change
action those rare but correlated faults
have the potential to bring the whole
system down oops and now give a few
examples all my personal email all my
important documents are in gmail so it
really sucks to get the following error
message it really sucks to get that
error message for almost a day so how
did it happen I did routine maintenance
are brought down some costs and the
resulting capacity problem spilled over
to other neighboring data centers
everybody likes to talk to friends and
family over Christmas but last Christmas
skype released a broken patch that
brought down most of their super notes
the remaining super nodes overloaded and
shut down as designed after a week of
scrambling and a week-long outage the
skype team was finally able to bring her
promote super notes at a remote cloud in
since I'm from VMware I will talk about
an outage that we had with our own
virtual infrastructure
alright I started today went on a story
today went down and that affected the
execution notes that were attached to
eat dead trigger 2 fav over to other
execution notes but the control Chanda
was on its way so customers could not
login or start applications and nothing
is complete without Amazon last April a
configuration change disconnected some
replication costs a disconnected cost
would start to contact expiry Libra
keishon process but as soon as Network
came back up it swept everything on its
way including the control channel that
affected higher level services and
pissed off quite a few startups that
were not quite prepared for it in the
final example it's from the physical
world and a fortunate example from the
physical world it's coming coming here
it is they had some pretty damn good
failure models except that they were not
prepared for all the outcomes that were
coming from it so what can we do about
it aside guru or the system tester can
create models to better understand their
system and reason about failure
scenarios of course those models can be
several times off so it might make sense
to perform actual test execution for
failure test execution virtual
infrastructure makes sense because with
virtual machines it's very easy to bring
that many VMS with
limited amount of hardware with virtual
device and networking it's easy to
inject faults and it's also easy to
bring down costs cluster source entire
data centers but after all the testing
I'm sure there will be still bugs
lurking around so it might be a good
idea to diversify disk and run over
multiple independently developed and
managed networks it is a cob that
independent teams would not help make
the same mistakes this is similar to the
end version programming approach to our
dependable systems that has been
successfully applied to a multiple
critical systems such as flight control
and three away switching but of course
the moody cloud it brings a whole new
set of challenges such as like having
less control over the remote cloud and
the need to fully test the multi cloud
automation thank you next time so I love
it I'm reading instead of listening now
Christian salesforce.com hi go for it
nice to meet you okay hi I'm Christian I
will give you a quick overview of two
important systems that we have in
salesforce com the rumor is that I have
an hour so I think that's barely enough
time for me so to set the stage let's
look at the challenges we have at
salesforce com first we have a large
number of developers or engineers on a
large code base that code base is about
4.5 million lines of code also we're
making a lot of changes to to that code
base roughly about 600 change list
actually the sites are old
okay the show must go on okay he always
said we also have a very complex product
it's a features and business logics we
have been building for the past 12 years
we also release often we have three
major releases per year and small
releases on a weekly basis sometimes we
even have multiple releases by the way I
don't know what I talk this fast okay
and the quality is extremely important
because we have a large number of paying
customers in fact we have hundred
thousand customers standardized their
business on the sales force.com platform
so busy quality is important to them and
important to us so what test automation
cloud will provide is that every time we
make a change to salesforce com we tell
we can determine exactly what what I
change has broken in terms of all the
integration tests we have and we give
the feedbacks within a day and we
guarantee ninety-nine point nine percent
accurate so just to summarize test
automation test automation cloud
essentially provide feedbacks that are
accurate complete and fast on approach
Angeles basis I know I'm out of sync
with the slides and that's expected so
how did we do it behind the test
automation called we have a large number
of hardware's to support over test
execution that we need to do and at the
same time we have the ability to use
external called infrastructures such as
AWS and we also have paralyzed test
execution we want to fully utilize the
resources we have so we can paralyze
tests across as many VMS as possible and
lastly most importantly we have
efficient algorithms behind the cloud to
determine when to run a test what tests
to run and how to determine the accuracy
of the results
and the one key 11 key algorithm is
partial runs out of time moving on for
youda youda is a system that would
create a box for engineers so after an
engineer checks in their code not only
they get emails on what test failures
they cost we also automatically create a
bug for them and in addition to that
when the engineer fixed the bug you know
the automatically validates the test
failures are indeed fixed if they're not
we will reopen them earlier this year
we'll also remove release the great
product or greatest system which we call
lock the lung by team essentially for
certain teams if they're not fixing test
failures in a timely fashion we would
lock those teams out it's kind of
interesting because of other services
are about making other scrum teams to go
fast but this service is actually to
slow down some of the team see if
they're moving too fast the cult can be
broken at times when the build is
program when the build is broken we
cannot provide the results so we created
a system called pre checking which
essentially don't allow people to
directly check into the source control
system they have to check into this
system which does the basic validation
before checking in their change great
I'm ahead of the site performance
testing we're also moving into the same
direction we want to leverage the same
infrastructure to provide performance
results except for timing based tests we
have to use physical hosts bass way this
is a funnel slide with content after the
release to the production systems we
also use a cloud to validate the
releases that we have done to ensure the
functionalities in production are
working as expected announcement
Salesforce is hosting a networking event
tomorrow night right here
and I hope to meet you guys there may
the force be with you very well done so
I've learned that Skype goes out about
for Christmas and they get bought by it
for eight billion this guy does
everything right and no one no one's
buying I don't get it alright next we
have Tim crooks thanks i'm tim kurtz
with the Signet software which has
recently been acquired by Weatherford
and therefore the little bit of name
confusion but super tiny so you can't
see so I'm just signet also I'd like to
thank everyone for coming to my
conference the Google timothy allen
crooks conference thank you very much ok
so a B of T in the cloud so smoke test
continuous integration automated basic
functionality test simple email comes
from the build system hits the art
parser the server sends cloud tests in
and we hit our 11 OS platforms for test
configurations 300 tests each these are
big tests big macro tests are run a
bunch of things and we have our buckets
of coverage which is our UI workflow
automation scripts and streets so what's
in the cloud representation of shipping
platforms that we need to get coverage
on and we can build up as many machines
as we need in here so we can spread out
the workload and get parallel coverage
so those are our a BF t client machines
and we have our configurations our SVC
configuration services on one machine or
upgrade that allows us to get isolation
and rule out network we skate a software
its supervisory control and data
acquisition we do a lot of network
communication between clients and
servers and databases so we also have a
paired up set of tests are standalone
client tests where we pair with the
server machine and talk to the client so
then using the same machines in the
cloud but we're reconfiguring on the fly
for those test configurations another
set of tests we do is our replicated
test where we're going server to server
class or sometimes workstation where
stakes in class we do a different set of
tests in this setup and all four of
these configurations do email results
when they're done we chose to do our UI
workflow automation and visual test very
similar to visual basic allows us to do
ooh some nice little screen design so we
can do test isolation a pretty
complicated set of configuration there
but that allows us to do manual runs out
of the system and do some isolation on
users machines developers or QA our
scripts bucket we have unattended
self-tracking self-described command
line so that allows us to get things to
run from development all by itself and
drop to a common log file that common
log file is how we hook everything
together so here's some scriptlet
examples nothing extraordinarily
fantastic about it other than it shows a
little bit of the syntax and a little
bit of the logging that happens our ARX
script was something we decided we
wanted to do internally because we had a
desire to have tests chained together
and in a given order so ARX was a format
we came up with to tie in both console
and you I based applications in house so
a little bit of the ARX format it's XML
and I never thought I'd be working this
much with XML bit so I am so that's a RX
and then our screens which are
self-testing so our skater product
allows us to take activex controls and
drop them an MDI client or to put them
out on the web and so this is a great
kind of one of each just throw them into
the screen light it up and then have
some scripting in the background within
the screen talking to this controls make
sure they're healthy and logging that
common logging output pass/fail here's a
sample of emails we get during the day
so we have about 5000 tests run by ten
in the morning 11,000 by the end of the
day and a full regression sweet runs for
an additional 14 hours so my email box
is always full and then the logging we
produce is per machine per run and so we
can drill down into those folders and
get exact detail of the scripted run and
then we also take snapshot logs in pre
parts as we're running the tests and all
those logs are collected as well and we
end up with about a gig and a half of
logs daily all pre parsed and any
crashes those processes dumps get
brought over and save decide machines
are all cleared reset and run again
and on every test that was me Tim crooks
all right next is the continuation of
our Russian contingent you can't areata
chemin sky you're talking about a tool
that was open source yesterday uh hello
I would like to talk about the tool
which is called script cover this is a
Chrome extension which provides new
JavaScript coverage for web pages I'm
very happy to be here by the way and
it's the first time I'm in chetek so
they actually actually the tool uncovers
which code instructions from internal
and external scripts of the page have
been executed and how many times the
results are displayed interactively the
coverage is recalculated when the page
loads and then when users interact with
the page and users don't need to make
any modifications to the code at all for
that should I say that coverage matters
does somebody disagree with that I hope
nobody so in fact coverage is a interact
quantitative measure of quality and we
should just know how to use this
information probably if somebody is
unsure that a coverage is important
think about it as a coverage of your
medical insurance they want to have any
problems with your medical insurance I
guess now if you want to be at coverage
for web pages but you don't know how to
do it script cover is your toll it's
easy to use because of the nature of the
two of this tool it has different
purposes and has different applications
it may be used not only for automated
testing this is something that we got
used for coverage but also for manual
testing and fur coat debugging and code
understanding for example for manual
testing when the this extension is
installed in the chrome the user just
navigates the web and performs various
actions on the page and takes a look how
coverage is changed let's take a closer
look at what JavaScript coverage this
tool script color provides you it
provides the total coverage percentage
it's about 9% for the page and then the
number of instructions for the whole
page and then for each script it
provides you coverage percentage and the
number of covered and total lines for
this script and in the rails report you
can see also the annotated sources for
each script if you have some selenium
webdriver tests any UI automation tests
and if you want to get coverage
JavaScript coverage if you want to see
how much of the application has been
executed you can use script cover for
the same purpose and he canna bleed
assimilate the effectiveness of your
test fields or if you don't like testing
maybe you hate testing at all and maybe
you are more in debugging you can use
this to see the annotated sources and to
find out what portions of code have been
executed yum ask me why I decided to
develop that tool initially I was
working for her own browser and I wanted
to debug some web good compatibility
issues that's why I needed this kind of
tool and I was using the tool which is
called GS coverage it's very nice tool
but it has some limitations one of the
limitations in that for compressed code
it works badly there are so many
instructions on one line it's not the
end of this file actually I just cut the
screenshot and this information of
coverage is useless but a script cover
formats this code and you see really
reach instructions has been executed and
which not this is much more helpful
another limitation is that GS coverage
actually calculates the statistics only
for external scripts for youtube com it
shows you the coverage only for one
external script but script cover shows
you coverage for this external script
and for one more external script so this
is that script from the previous slides
and then for a bunch of internal scripts
you can get all these data for cold in
the web page itself it's much more
meaningful information and finally the
script cover is very fast and easy to
use you don't need to read extensive
documentation you just install the
extension in the browser you don't need
to write any tests you don't need to
actually save the web
aged in some director locally to modify
the code is you need to do it in other
with other tools but with script cover
you just never give the web and you see
the results it's really easy and fast
the tool has been open sourced recently
and you can read the blog post in google
testing blog and also in open-source
blog from today and I'm very thankful to
everybody who helped in Google to make
this happen and if you are passionate
about coverage if you want to help if
you want to ask any questions please do
this thank you very much you guys are
actually pulling this off ok we have
side chintala from app labs ok guys wake
up coffee is five minutes away so i'm
from apple apps world's largest
independent testing company we are 20
finder testers and 25 developers it's
only company in the world the developers
are underdogs so it's cool to be here
and I always love to hang out with the
testing communities I have 18 beautiful
slides with good pictures so I'm not
going to speak anything so each picture
says 1,000 words ok skating so I'm going
to say a few words so today I'm going to
talk about in a sourcing the cloud for
the performance testing how many people
how many of your online today right now
ninety percent right you know no wonder
there is a web traffic explosion
happening so eighty percent of people if
I ask and what is important for your
speed or functionality ok here a lot of
people are increasingly saying is fear
is important because they are taking
functionality for the granted so there
are so many web applications out there
really working very well you know where
instead of our own google and results
are always instant but in a sad news is
that there are so many web applications
they do not meet our expectations what
are the two reasons no performance
testing planning or ineffective planning
or in a poor performance testing
technique so i will talk about it so
when I say 1.0 what is happening
traditionally so you have physical load
generators in a network bandwidth
infrastructure administration overhead
and licenses which you are buying for
the entire
here and there is a lot of ideal time
even though you do not use it for the
entire year so you are paying for it so
how do you solve this problem that is
what we are going to talk about it what
are the challenges with the problem the
1.0 so lot of cost of testing is
increasing dramatically because you are
not using the infrastructure for entire
but you are paying for it so what is the
next challenge make a guess speed your
testers are waiting forever for the
pristine clean test environment right is
always a competition for the shared test
a test environment so that is another
challenge what is the next challenge
make a guess okay provisioning so you
always waiting for the provisions of lot
of customers are asking for the web app
or to test it on so many types of
browsers for instructional when we are
testing for them they ask for 250
possible possible of possibilities of
combinations in a different hardware
software and browser combinations the
unique combinations we are about 250
combinations how do you solve
performance testing 2.0 leveraging and
sourcing the cloud so if I move both the
physical load generators a network
bandwidth to the cloud and half of the
problems are solved because you have a
complete abstraction of the test
environment so no need to pay for the
entire you know period that you are
owning you're paying for only only the
period that where you are doing the
testing so basically you are increasing
the test coverage because in a cloud is
elastic in nature so what what are the
types of hardware infrastructure that
you would want to get you know you are
able to get it and increase the test
coverage and the most important is
realistically load right you know you
never know what exactly the type of the
load that you are expecting when you go
live so you want to test in your pre
Prada environment of the dev environment
in the realistic mode so only the cloud
is able to provide in a lot of
infrastructure at the low cost so what
is the end result so we are able to
ensure a quicker time to market because
you are not waiting forever for the
infrastructure to be ready which is
elastic in nature so finally the end
result is in a cloud is allowing you to
bundle everything even if you are is
testing services provider or a testing
services
consumer testing as a service has become
a reality so is it everything is a good
news you know so there's still another
challenges the top three challenges
leveraging the cloud is reliability
security and the granularity of the
control that you have on the
infrastructure so these are the problems
that needs to be addressed there are
many cloud deployment options out there
and also a I think I believe somebody
was speaking of public clouds private
clouds micro clothes and community
clothes or if you mix and match
everything there are hybrid clothes you
know how do you how are you going to
choose which cloud provider that you are
going to be looking for you know so
there are three or four questions that
can ask what is the type of control that
they're providing on the infrastructure
the technology stack they're able to
provide and the data security the
security compliance that they're able to
ensure in a pci or he / socks complaint
so these are the three questions you
know that you need to worry if you are
going to be choosing the public or the
private provider so since it's only five
minutes there are not too many takeaways
cloudy's for real in a performant
testing on the cloud is a reality and
it's a viable option so if you're
testing services consumer data provider
testing as a service has become a norm
everybody is asking for it again and it
is not a silver bullet you know choose
your options carefully whether you are
ready for it or whether do a proof of
concept into your own mat and that's it
thanks
may I may I breathe a collective sigh of
relief for all of us Googlers that that
worked we're not professional conference
runners this was this was brought to you
by a program manager on Google feedback
and a test engineer on Google Chrome's
so and it worked well</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
