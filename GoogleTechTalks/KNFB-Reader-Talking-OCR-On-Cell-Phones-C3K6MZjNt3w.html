today to speak to all of you look
forward to addressing your questions and
showing the technology I would like to
begin by giving you just a few words of
introduction of myself and our company I
am blind and have been blind all my life
grew up in the Midwest and and in 1974
moved to Washington DC where I became
chief of the Washington DC office of the
National Federation of the blind the
National Federation of the blind is the
world's largest organization of blind
people and we often say that of is
really the most important word in our
name because that organization is
directed by blind people all of its
leaders and the vast majority of its
members are blind people and I was
honored to work for the National
Federation of the blind for 34 years
early in that career I guess it was a
year or so after the time that I took
over as chief of the Washington office I
met a young man who rides very high in
the saddle in the technology world and
that's Ray Kurzweil Ray has invented
many things but but many technologies
that that affect the lives of blind and
disabled people and we're going to be
talking about that technology today Ray
Kurzweil came into my office in
Washington and I believe late March
early April of 1975 so roughly 33 years
ago right now and said he had invented a
reading machine now this was this was
pretty phenomenal because you know we
didn't have desktop computers at that
point in time
were devices that institutions had they
they occupied large rooms and and in
some cases whole buildings we weren't
used to thinking of a person using a
computer to perform a single task well
he had devised a computer that was
dedicated to serving as a reading
machine for blind people he also had
invented a flatbed scanner to work with
this computer and he had invented the
text-to-speech translation technology
that was necessary to acquire visual
images and process those images into
full word ordinary English speech so
this was truly phenomenal I was thrilled
to have the opportunity to address the
the possibility that blind people would
be having a device an electronic device
that could read any time almost any
thing that was an ordinary print because
because otherwise we're very very
dependent on somebody else to read to us
I would say that for me as a blind
person if if I could name any particular
thing that the fact that you can't do it
because you can't see it would be not
being able to read things that are in
print that would be the major disability
if you were we can't otherwise we can't
drive and we're working on both of those
problems nowadays to both to be able to
read things and and to actually operate
vehicles technologies can help us do
these and when Ray Kurzweil came along
he brought to us the possibility that we
could tackle the reading challenge well
many things have occurred over the years
technologies have have advanced
things are smaller and less expensive
than they were then
the first reading machines we agreed to
purchase six of the pre-production
models of what at that time was called
the Kurzweil reading machine and they
were about the size of a an
apartment-sized dishwasher I would say
or a washing machine
and and the scanner was on the top and
the computer was in a large box below it
this device actually did do what it
promised to do although it took it a
while to do it you would put a piece of
paper down on a glass plate and the
camera would cycle under the under the
glass and look at the document much like
operating a Xerox machine I guess you
would say and then probably at least a
minute later the words would begin to
flow from the machine and these were
primitive sounding compared to the
synthetic speech we have now but they
were certainly ahead of everything else
which meant that there wasn't anything
else so there were people who were very
very excited about the Kurzweil reading
machine the National Federation of the
blind purchased the first six of these
machines and actually my the reader I'm
going to demonstrate was just receiving
a telephone call so this has come quite
a ways since the days of the dishwasher
this is what it looks like now it
actually operates on a cell phone well
we'll get to the cell phone product in
just a minute here but it it was
receiving a phone call so it can do more
than just read to you it can also accept
and receive phone calls
now the apartment-sized dishwasher style
reading machine was very very popular
and actually came down in price fairly
early on in the 1980s and
became quite ubiquitous among libraries
and schools and and institutions that
serve the blind it did not achieve
widespread use as an individual device
because of the price primarily and but
over the time that too dropped and and
the Kurzweil what's now called the
Kurzweil 1000 which is technology that
does the same thing and much much better
and then the device of the 1970s the
Kurzweil 1000 is software that runs on a
PC so by the mid-1990s when we all
started to have personal computers Ray
Kurzweil started another company called
Kurzweil computer products to bring a
product to market which would run on a
standard scanner scanners are very
popular now and of course desktop PCs
are widely available in laptops and so
forth so it was possible to have a
reading machine in a form factor that
was far smaller than the original device
and a reading machine that would also
perform other technology functions such
as word processing and you know access
to the internet and email and so on and
so forth the drawback obviously of the
technology of the 1990s was that it was
technology dedicated to a fixed
workstation a desktop PC and a scanner
and although that technology is still
very good and still sold today the
demand is coming more and more for
mobile technology in 2002 Ray Kurzweil
and the National Federation of the blind
teamed up to enter the next era in the
development of reading technology for
the blind and that is the mobile reader
we undertook this task even though the
hardware to create the mobile reader
didn't really exist there was no small
computer with enough power
there was no digital camera with enough
resolution and enough flash capacity to
do what we needed to do for a mobile
reader but Ray Kurzweil is a great
predictor of the evolution of technology
and we asked him well how long do you
think it will take until the we actually
do have a small computer and digital
camera that we will be able to use of
course we would have to design the
software he said well he thought it'd
take about four years and and we said
well how long do you think it would take
to design the software for this it's
probably about four years so this this
coincidence of developments came
together and in July 2006 we launched
the first truly portable reading machine
for the blind and I'm holding that in my
hand this is called the Kurzweil
National Federation of the blind reader
it it combines a PDA and a digital
camera and you see here on the side this
is the PDA portion it's the flat large
piece this is actually the screen of the
PDA although it doesn't perform any
function during the program but that is
the screen these are the keys of the PDA
and then the digital camera is this
piece the smaller rectangular piece at
the bottom of the unit and it's used
just by pointing down at or down or at
whether it's down or sideways whatever
direction it is the camera needs to
point at the document and the picture is
taken in using the down arrow
of the PDA in the program it is possible
to view a somewhat dim image of the
target document through the screen of
the PDA provided you can see enough to
do that most people don't use that we
call that the viewfinder mode and it is
available actually this reader is a very
excellent reader it's the first reader
that that's truly portable but we kind
of say although it is portable and it is
certainly handheld it's not really
pocket-sized
you could probably put it in your pocket
but it might make a fashion statement
that you weren't exactly hoping to make
so it's probably not pocket-sized people
who have purchased these obviously take
them wherever they go and use them
throughout the day I should mention that
the PDA functions of this reader are
disabled for the purposes of this
program and so although this this is a
fully functioning PDA in this reader
when the reader is engaged the PDA is
dedicated to providing the computer
services that the reading machine needs
it's the processor for the unit the
digital camera is set on a remote mode
and is not available for use as a
standard digital camera it is
communicating with the PDA and the PDA
is controlling the camera I should
mention that this is a five megapixel
digital camera with a xenon flash and
those criteria are really quite
essential for adequate performance as a
reading machine but I guess I would
describe the performance of this device
as exceeding our expectations it does a
wonderful job
of capturing text notice I didn't say
scanning because we we aren't performing
the functions of a scanner here we are
capturing text we're taking a digital
image of anything in print and the
program is looking for text as a matter
of fact it's looking for text to such a
degree that lines or dots on a
background could be interpreted as text
and the reader will work hard to find
them so I often carry a dark background
with me
that's a flat background I'll show that
in in a moment as we demonstrate the
mobile we started selling the Kurzweil
National Federation of the blind reader
to the public market primarily blind
people some people with learning
disabilities and that occurred in in
July 2006 at that time I was still
involved working at the National
Federation of the blind in Baltimore
Maryland and I had the privilege of
leading a very large-scale beta test of
this device imagine putting out four
hundred units of something to be beta
tested we had people who are blind in
every single state we had I think many
states had as many as ten units and then
some others smaller numbers but in all
400 beta test participants it was a way
also of introducing the device to the
marketplace because frankly it's a brand
new challenge to think that blind people
can take pictures and the results of our
pictures can be something that is read
to us in intelligible speech in
intelligible speech well that's what we
did so we we had a large-scale beta test
it was very very successful we launched
the product in July of
2005 2006 after that and in fact
concurrently with that we proceeded to
form a company to carry this product
forward and do further development and
marketing of this technology and that
company is represented by our on our
website knfb reader and we'll make sure
that that website is shown as part of
this video it is knfbreader.com and
that's K and FB reader one word.com and
you can check us out on the internet and
take a look at our technologies we still
sell the Kurzweil National Federation of
the blind reader but to a very large
degree the hardware is is now something
that you know this hardware lasts it has
a very long useful life if you're using
it but but the it is not marketed for
much longer than about 18 months at a
time so we would have to be moving from
platform to platform to platform very
rapidly to avoid that we knew all along
that we would have to get on to another
platform that we could accommodate to as
the changes come along and that platform
is the cell phone this is the cell phone
that rang a while ago and and this is
called the knfb reader mobile and the
knfb reader mobile was first announced
to the public on January 28 2008 so this
is really brand new technology that we
have here this is running on a Nokia n8
II - that's a Nokia and 82 cell phone
and at present this is the only cell
phone that will really run this reader
it
it has but let me be accurate and say
that the processor of quite a number of
cell phones that are Symbian will will
run this reader but the cell phones do
not have the camera characteristics that
we need and I mentioned two of them we
need at least 5 megapixels of resolution
and we need a xenon flash and we also
need to have adequate control over the
camera speed and such I'm sure there are
engineering details about that that I
don't begin to understand but the point
I want to have understood is that we
cannot install this technology simply on
just about any old cell phone on the on
the market there is no other currently
that will serve adequately for the
purposes of the knfb reader mobile we
believe there will be but but as we
speak today there there is not now we
might as well demonstrate the knfb
reader mobile rather than me just
talking about it but but so basically
we've gone from a washing machine size
to a desktop pc and scanner to the
Kurzweil National Federation of the
blind reader and now the mobile so this
technology is totally progressing in the
way that many technologies do it's also
coming down in price the knfb reader
mobile will that first of all the the
phone is available for five hundred and
fifty dollars usually you can see it
online for less but there have to be
certain setup procedures done to to get
it to work so generally it's available
through our dealers and again you can
look on the website of the
knfbreader.com and see that we have a
how to purchase page and you can find it
in in all across the United States we
have a network of over 40 dealers that
sell the knfb reader mobile as well as
the Kurzweil National Federation of the
blind reader so I'll demonstrate this
device and show you how it's going to
work I'll step over here to the podium
and I have in front of me I mentioned
that I use a a backdrop it's a I take a
cloth fabric and I use a velvet black
cloth I probably would not need to do
that in this setting but when I have a
background that I'm not completely
familiar with I like to get into where I
have a known background so that's why I
use the cloth the consequences of not
doing so might be a long time of
processing in order for the document to
read and so the background tends to get
around the clutter that might otherwise
exist so I've got the phone I actually
have this connected to a Bluetooth
speaker so the audience here are hearing
this through the Bluetooth speaker not
the speaker of the cell phone but it's a
pretty nice loud speaker on the cell
phone anyway and now I'm going to launch
the reader I just press one button and
the reader will launch okay ready and at
this point the voice that you hear when
it when you heard the word ready is the
voice of the reader this is a TTS two
text-to-speech voice that blind people
certainly are very familiar with we hear
it on our computers all the time and
that certainly made it a good choice
it's not our only choice but it's the
good it's a good choice for this device
so it says ready when it comes up and
and it means that it's ready to take a
picture
a document in front of me I'm just gonna
hold the reader above it I'm gonna press
the down-arrow take and picture the
picture snapped and I can move the
reader puts articles and labels format
at the point where the picture what's
the green counterclockwise relative to
the page it's not a bad picture for a
blind person one degree relative to the
page expanding the limits the
uncertainty of exploration proceeded to
a specific location is a journey
progressing to another identified as the
nation is adventure in other words if we
know where you're going it's travel if
you don't it's exploration traveling
often requires determination energy
fortitude and resource for this but
exploration also demands intuition faith
the tolerance for uncertainty the
willingness to embrace change and the
recognition that the object being sought
can not always need to find with
precision and will sometimes lead to
unpredictable consequences when the
exploration is pursued with passion and
faith the process not only produces
knowledge but also stimulates the
development of the explorers as well
there's exploration in a matter of
discovery or is it a process of creation
yes Elliot said we shall not cease from
exploration and the end of all our
exploring will be to arrive where we
started and know the place for the first
to accept without criticism the revealed
knowledge and unseated by our
predecessors is to me ok that's the
first page of a of a document that was a
speech delivered by the president of the
National Federation of the blind in
Atlanta Georgia last July July of 2007
very typical example of the performance
of this device this is a this document
is straight text
it's the reader ought to be able to do
that that would be its optimal example
before we go on I want to show you some
other kinds of text that it will read
now that was a flat
that was a flat background and and had
no pictures or anything I have a
document with a picture and different
size of print on it and also columns and
this the first example had no columns it
was straight text this time I'm going to
take a picture of this document which
has as I say different sizes of print
columns and and it's also a larger
document it's an eight-and-a-half by 11
inch page whereas the first sample was
well bigger than 4x6 but I don't know
the exact dimensions but you can see
it's not a full typewritten page before
I do this I'm going to illustrate
another feature of this device which we
refer to as the field of view report and
I will do that now by the way I'm gonna
save the last document so bear with me
while this say the same March 26 2008
file 0 to 17 and I say I said I could
also save the actual image I chose not
to I saved that to a 2 gigabyte micro SD
card now this time I'm going to
illustrate an alignment feature there
are two ways of doing that one is you
can line up visually I I can't
but you and many of you could well if
you turned on the viewfinder and as I
explained in this device it has a
viewfinder this one has a very good
viewfinder you actually see a bright
image of the dock of the target document
through the screen but in this case I'm
going to use what's called the field of
view report and it will I treat it as
advisory I don't really need it
at when we were originally designing the
technology we kind of thought you know
the idea that blind people would be
taking pictures and not seeing the
target we're going to have to have a way
for them to line up the image I actually
thought that turns out that we're only
taking pictures at about a foot away it
isn't really that hard well maybe I
should say it is hard and then you
accept that this is a very hard
demonstration but it isn't that hard and
our customers have great success in
using this technology in this case I'm
going to use the field of view report
I'm going to start a little higher than
I normally would to get a good picture
but I want to get all four adulate I'm
holding the reader above the page now
I'm not going to position obtain
enlightenment all four edges are visible
35% filled rotated 1 degrees
counterclockwise now I'm going to come
down because I want to be closer for the
picture please maintain position obtain
enlightenment all four edges are visible
47% filled rotated to clean I can
certainly take that picture but I'm
gonna giving it closer
filled up in record flesh will activate
please maintain position obtain
enlightenment bottom with right edges
are visible
63% filled rotated for the green
counterclockwise alright it said bottom
and right are visible so I'm gonna move
left and I'm gonna move forward and I'm
going to try it again
field open report that will activate
please maintain position obtain
enlightenment all of our edges are
visible 60% will we'll take that picture
taking picture it feels like it's about
the right height off the page and and I
got all the four edges at labels format
this camera is forward to green
counterclockwise relative to the page
incidentally the the rotation I'll
comment on in a second it doesn't really
matter much Admiral Consulting Group

to serve as the new england director for
the new yes okay well that's a that's a
guys bio sheet does the kind of work I
used to do so but but the point of this
is the columns and the other well the
picture the other extraneous things that
are on this page I've had far more
complicated pages with pictures galore
and yet the reader does a nice job of
working its way around the pictures and
just reading the captions and actually I
wouldn't even know the pictures were
there the next example is glossy it's
you know it's one thing to think that
you can read a flat image
which my previous two images have been
this is glossy you don't think you can
get any glossy ER it also has different
sizes of print I think there are also
columns on this although I forget now
so I cancel out of the previous document
and by the way the reason for cancelling
out of the previous document is I can't
take the next picture until I do but the
other point being that while I have an
active document on the reader I can
manipulate through the document by line
by word by sentenced by character by
paragraph by word I guess I said so I
have the ability to navigate through the
document where and and now I've canceled
out so I can take the next picture now
this one being a glossy image and I'm
just going to use the point-and-shoot
method this time rather than the field
of beautiful picture okay and in picture
inputs articles and labels format camera
0 degrees clockwise relative to the page
Amen I said it was hotels and resorts we
know Carolyn Sylvester resident wait up
w we've always reacted to your
suggestions what in life and what you
don't like so don't be surprised that we
are making improvements to enhance your
pictures days the inning later the
senior WL at will be reinventing our
guest rooms to include no carpet and no
wall covering no test chairs no relaxing
chairs and Ottomans no curtains no okay
that's a hotel I stay at customarily in
Boston now and they've have refurbished
glossy image few words garbled don't
think it's because of the glossy image
we place filters over the lens
and over the flesh these are called
polarisers want to say about the
instances where the reader doesn't read
or the synthesizer doesn't give you what
you understand as a normal human word
this is okay we're often not going for
letter-perfect here we're not we're not
actually doing this to translate a book
or well we might be doing it to read a
book but we're not doing it for a
commercial purpose it's an individual
picture that's being taken to read and
and a certain level of inaccuracy is
something that you get used to I
certainly get used to it on the internet
because our screen readers that speak
what the screen sees don't always give
you internet gibberish a lot of times
and not normal words so we're accustomed
to working around the the background
clutter as you might say want to
illustrate another thing that I think is
truly fantastic we have a divide method
this is what we call our training page
we have a method of helping people learn
how far you should be from the page and
it illustrates the power of our
technology I'm going to exit from the
last document and hassled I'm going to
go to a different format for this and
this will be called bills and memos
rather than books you may have noticed
it's been saying processing image in
books articles and labels format I'm
going to go to the bills and memos
format for settings press ENTER for
other options press upward I'm gonna go
to settings settings and I'm gonna go to
reading and format reading for articles
I'm gonna go to bills and memos sarena
corvax vegetto memos bills and memo
ready and and now what I'm gonna do this
time is I'm going to take a picture of
this document that I said is helpful in
showing you how to line up a picture and
it will give me some interesting
information taking picture I'm gonna
hold my position this time when
processing picture and bills and memos
format cameras 87 degrees
counterclockwise relative to the page
training page detected processing
information the reader is twelve point
three inches above the page 1.0 inches
right at zero point nine inches back off
center for best results lower the reader
two inches one inch to the left and one
inch forward one inch to the left and
one inch forward okay let's try it again
this gets to be a game actually have a
fun game some of you might like to try
it I get addicted to getting the correct
reading pictures open memos format
camera is what degrees clockwise
relative to the page training page
detected processing information the
reader is ten point five inches above
the page zero point two which is right
at zero point one inches back off center
correct middle position I scored on that
one in two shots now you know you don't
have to do that you you literally do not
have to to be in what this told me is
the correct reader position although we
would say that the reader will perform
optimally in that position if I was too
high the text is going to be more
garbled possibly not so much in this
light all of us way too high it would
depending on the lighting circumstances
but this page will help particularly a
person who is blind to get the idea of
what a correct reader position feels
like so that's our that's our training
page speaking of results that that might
actually be a little garbled this is my
last sample yeah
you think it'll read this we're gonna
try it you know Ray Kurzweil is our CEO
for knfb reading technology and Ray Ray
likes to have me read books he writes
books and so he likes to have me read
the books with the reader you know I
like to read books but in the morning I
need to know what the coffee is whether
it's decaf or caffeinated coffee and so
I have a bag of coffee here I this is
often the first picture I take in the
morning if I'm staying in a hotel and
and I'm going to take this picture now
I'm going to switch this back to books
articles and labels but without it we're
gonna go I mean ik format books I mean a
quarterback's lifts all boats are they
okay and we'll take this picture taking
picture
okay picture snapped pre-processing
picture inputs articles and labels
format cameras five degrees
counterclockwise relative to the page
sometimes we get a good read on this and
sometimes we don't
it's obviously chewing away on it the
progress beeps mean mean that it is
working on it and if it gives up now the
more complex background is it's not a
larger document it's smaller but the
more complex background leads to the
longer processing time in this instance
if it is processing long enough that I'm
concerned that the result might not be
real good but usually with a couple of
pictures I can determine what this is
and I don't have the patience to wait
much longer if it doesn't come through
with something we're going to quit I'm
actually going to quit because I don't
want to take up more time with it so I
can cancel the canceling and it'll
cancel by the way I did not mention that
when it reads print is also displayed on
the screen and there is a yellow
highlighter that moves across the text
and the text that has been read displays
in blue and the text that is about to be
read displays in black this is to help
people with learning disabilities so
this document when it does read gives me
the directions which are pretty well
known there's only one fact I want to
know on here and it says usually 100%
cafe of Arabica coffee 99.7% caffeine
free which is and and it can it can do
that I don't really care about all the
other information last example this is
also a currency reader and I have a US
currency note in front of the reader and
I'm going to I used it I use a different
picture method for the currency we hit
zero on the keypad for the currency
detecting orientation process in u.s.
image playing wait $10 okay now I'm
going to I can do more with that I know
it's a 10 so now I can find out its
orientation $10 the image is rotated
right the Vilna side up okay so that
might that might matter if you're
arranging money to go into a bill
acceptor machine so it's a very good
currency reader virtually always you get
a match and we haven't had any false
positives that people have reported so I
think we do a very good job we don't
read currency in quite the same way that
we read text we are matching against a
database of US currency and yes if you
wonder it does read the new five dollar
bill so we would have a problem if it
didn't well that's the technology it
again I think in the mobile it is
exceeding expectations it's it's just
wonderful technology it's life changing
technology and I know that that this is
a very sophisticated audience here and
I'm sure listening in and and and I
understand that the engineering aspects
of this technology are truly a curiosity
and something that people want to know a
lot more about but I just want to say to
end this presentation you know on the
personal side
I'm not primarily a technologist as many
of you are my career has been more in in
government public administration
programs that help in in the case of the
groups that I've represented blind
people advanced in society I've used
technology because
it helps me do the things I need to do
but I'm not interested in it solely
because of of the technological aspects
of it I want it to perform I had an
experience that brought this home to me
I've had many many experiences with this
technology but about a year ago I was
travelling I had this device the
Kurzweil National Federation of the
blind reader I went to an airport this
was in Baltimore I was traveling out to
the Midwest to see my mom who had just
gone into a nursing home and I and I was
traveling alone I went to the restaurant
they didn't offer me a Braille menu and
I didn't ask for it I just took pictures
of the menu I made a healthy choice off
the pinatas like to point that out
and and I and I I ordered the food was
brought at the end of the meal the bill
was brought I snapped pictures of the
bill paid in full and cash exact change
and left a nice tip and walked out of
the restaurant and on the way to the
boarding gate I just had to stop in the
hall and poke myself and I said you know
you have had an experience in life that
you have never had before and that is
that I did business at an establishment
where print was the means of
communication and I read every little
bit of it myself now you know maybe
that's not a big deal I don't object to
somebody reading print to me but it
enhances my capabilities it enhances my
understanding of what I do
I said recently on CNN I have to remind
myself that I can now read print well
that's pretty phenomenal
that is truly pretty phenomenal and I
think you know dr. ramin mentioned this
at the very very beginning we're only
getting started with this technology
today we're doing a pretty nice job of
recognizing print in the future we'll
recognize people will
recognize objects will read signs will
I've done a demonstration of our
technology seeing whether a seat is
occupied you'd like to know that unless
you want to sit on the person
Ray Kurzweil gives the example of our
technology being brought into a room
with the person that's using it and
looking around the room and says well
your ex-wife is 25 feet ahead of you on
the left you can go see her if you need
to or not if you don't so but but the
point is that I agree with with what we
said earlier the this is the beginning
of eyes in your pocket or artificial
vision or whatever you want to call it
and I'm not talented enough as many of
you are to understand the other
applications that this may have in the
space that you all work in but I'm sure
you are and I'm here to bring you this
technology to show it to you and to hope
that it can develop into a longer more
fruitful learn learning and working
relationship and I thank you very much
and if I guess I'm certainly available
to stay for questions and would be happy
to answer any questions but I will say
and I will try to repeat the question I
will say that raising your hand to be
recognized will not help we haven't got
this to this point yet you will have to
maybe say your name and I can recognize
you
okay I have a question regarding reading
barcodes so is there any ongoing effort
in that direction there is an ongoing
effort in that direction and we hope to
be able to do that it should be
something that we can do we are not it's
not a product yet okay okay when do you
expect that to
be completed oh I would think in the
next year to 18 months it's it's not
that the job is that hard it's there are
lots of priorities for this bar codes is
one of a growing list of demands from
our customers that they would like to do
read and and and be able to see you know
I could list a bunch out color is
another one that's very very high on the
list actually being able to which you
can do but not we haven't completed all
the niceties about connecting this to a
PC and then and actually taking using
the PC as the processor and taking
pictures reading much more rapidly
storing thousands and thousands of pages
but we could do that too now I mean the
list grows and barcode is definitely on
it okay thanks hi I'm when I noticed
that
you need to put it into particular mode
article mode versus bill mode etc
wondering one you know what happens if
it's in the wrong mode what kind is it
are that the typical errors that come up
and so it's better to put it in the
right mode and the other is other plans
to have that be something that's
automatically detected we certainly have
the the question is on modes setting the
modes and and and the possibility that
the modes could automatically be
detected on the latter point the answer
is definitely yes we haven't really
gotten quite that far but we only
currently we actually envisioned in the
beginning that we would have lots of
modes we don't we only have two ones
called books articles and labels and
one's called bills and memos and and
then we don't think of the currency as a
separate mode that's a set
function all together and you don't even
use the same picture-taking method so
treat it as two modes the distinction
between these modes is books articles
and labels recognizes curvature such as
you would have that where the print
letters are close to the spine of a book
and somewhat curved or even on a product
label around a can or a bottle where
there's curvature now there are limits
to how much curvature we can handle but
but we use books articles and labels for
this the other thing about books
articles and labels is it recognizes
columns and so I would refer to books
articles and labels as our most robust
format the other one is bills and memos
I don't think our engineers would like
this but I would call this our most
crude format it reads across the page it
ignores the columns too it ignores the
columns and and you may want this for a
spreadsheet now will we ever be
intelligent enough to know that in this
instance you definitely want to read
across rather than defaulting to the
column format we might that would be a
question beyond me we have certainly
discussed that but I would say that our
strategy has been to limit the number of
formats rather than expanding them I see
thank you yes
next question okay well if and and I
just want to say as we end the session
that those of you who would like to come
up and and actually get a hands on you I
believe in I'm kind of like the the car
salesman you know you have to sit in the
seats when you put this into your hand
I've found that people say oh my I have
to have this and and and that's the way
it just feels it's so good you just
carry in your pocket take it anywhere
snap pictures and and read on the go and
so if you'd like to put it in your hand
please feel free to come up
I just want closing mention our again
our website
knfb reader dot-com are obviously our
how to purchase page we can we download
software directly from the page on to
our readers the software has to be
activated for the particular reader
obviously and the polarisers have to be
installed on the reader to make it work
we have a great group of dealers all
across the country my role is to go out
and talk about it my position is vice
president of business development our
CEO is Ray Kurzweil our corporate
offices are in Wellesley Hills
Massachusetts and other than that were
everywhere letting people know about our
product and the wonderful things it does
and thank you very much for your
attention</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
