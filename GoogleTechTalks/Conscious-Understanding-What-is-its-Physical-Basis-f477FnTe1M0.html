ultimate search engine would understand
everything in the world and would always
give the right answer for search queries
given the computational resources
available here it might seem like just a
matter of time before somebody does this
for a 20% project or maybe all our
computer power and algorithms won't be
enough and it will require a radically
different idea of how understanding a
curse our speaker the renowned
mathematician and physicist Sir Roger
Penrose will be talking about this today
he is a Meredith's Rajpal professor of
mathematics at Oxford a fellow of the
Royal Society of London and winner of
the Wolf Wolf Prize for Physics with
Stephen Hawking the Dirac metal at the
Copley medal and many other words he's
written two insightful and controversial
books the emperor's new mind and shadows
of the mind and co-authored the large
the small and the human mind on the
physical underpinnings of consciousness
and the question of whether computers
can faithfully simulate human thought
let's welcome Roger Penrose
well thank you very much it's a pleasure
to be back in Google I visited briefly I
think a year and a half ago or something
like that is this machine working by the
way no no is it is it working can you
hear me at the back
barely it's probably not working that
makes a noise doesn't it well I'll I'll
do my best
ah anyway I've been asked to talk about
this topic about whether computers can
simulate human mental activity it's not
something which I've worked on for many
years so I'm afraid my talk will be to a
large extent things that I've thought
about some while back I've been thinking
about other things recently on the other
hand there is a piece of information
which I obtained quite recently which is
new certainly as far as I'm concerned
and at the end of the talk so you have
to stay to the end to see what's new
about this talk yeah but let me say
things which are not maybe so new I
think I understand what is new with
regard to Google is using overhead
projectors
here we have I hope this is focused
recently well let's just check we are
the issue of consciousness is really
what I'm going to be talking about not
that I know a great deal about what it
is but I know something about what it is
I don't think anybody knows much about
it I'd also take the view that
consciousness is a crucial aspect of
human understanding and so if we don't
know what consciousness is or we don't
know how to simulate it if that's what
we're trying to do then we were
certainly fall short of what human
beings can do whether it's actually
active in any sense sort of something
which goes along as a kind of whether it
actually plays an active role is also a
disputed thing I consider myself and it
must play a not active role otherwise it
wouldn't be there to some of these roles
in which it playing I hope I can be
heard over whatever it is here we have I
wanted to say the one can talk about
consciousness in terms of various
subjects here computation which is the
most popular I suppose and it's the sort
of thing with people would be concerned
with there are I imagine existing
science that is not necessary
computation but at some aspects of
science maybe physical behavior or
biological things or do we have to
extend our present physical worldview
into something which is broader or is it
something beyond science altogether but
I want to argue that it's number three
it is the rules now I certainly don't
want to go beyond science but there are
present day science is something which
in my view falls short of having the
scope that would be needed to encompass
remote inerrancy sorry about this one
second let me just mute the most remote
sites can you please mute your
microphones thank you this is this
technology which
well okay I hope it's I hope you can
hear me anyway
that's there's an order to understand
what's involved in consciousness we're
going to need to go beyond even existing
science it's not just going beyond
computation but the science that we know
today but it certainly would be science
of some kind that's certain with me my
view and their various arguments from
different subjects philosophy
mathematics physics biology and
psychology and so on mainly I'm going to
talk about mathematics and physics
primarily because that's what I know
about a little bit of biology very
secondhand I'm afraid but there will be
some of that to know here is ok there
many manifestations of consciousness and
consciousness also has sort of both a
passive and active aspect active is
usually discussed in terms of freewill I
won't have much to say about that
passive that's more things that
philosophers refer to as qualia like
pain love red pride determination
intelligence disgust will most things
all involve consciousness is one way or
another but I'm going to concentrate on
one particular aspect of consciousness
or whether it really is an aspect of
consciousness is another question namely
understanding and the question is is a
computer or a computer control robot
capable of genuine understanding we were
genuine of course one can always argue
about but of course their words the
meanings of words can shift to and so
it's never quite clear but my own
personal understanding of the meanings
and we've talked about three words here
none of which I would want to define
none of which I even know quite what
they mean but I think one can at least
say something about the relations
between them I have here the word
intelligence whatever that means
understanding whatever that means an
awareness or this particular aspect of
consciousness
and I would argue that whatever
understanding is or at least whatever
intelligence is it requires
understanding the certainty of the
normal use of the word intelligence
would mean that understanding is part of
it so that it's a requirement for an
intelligent entity that is capable of
understanding I would claim and also in
the normal usage of these words I would
think that the word understanding does
imply some sort of awareness it doesn't
seem that something you would normally
say that an entity understands something
if it's not even aware of it so
awareness whatever that means seems to
be part of understanding in this part of
intelligence I think one could argue
about these things but personally the
normal usage seems to imply these
connections
so if understanding can be shown to be
beyond computation and that's what I
would
one can see to some degree then
intelligence is not a matter of
computation entirely anyway on itself in
itself the more of a certain aspect of
awareness and perhaps all aspects of
awareness are beyond computation also so
that would be the claims that I'm trying
to make here so I want to say something
about understanding but I'll only talk
about understanding in a very particular
area it's very hard to talk about
understanding generally but it seems
that in mathematics at least one could
say something about it
before I want to do that I think I'll
not quite address the argument that way
just because I think it's worth
mentioning that certain other arguments
that have been made in connection with
consciousness have some relation to the
argument I'm going to give although
they're completely different from it so
let me address some of these first of
all I want to put forward it you can see
these slides are quite old and I haven't
used them for a while because they bit
faded but here we have four different so
the points of view one might take what
these polarities the points of view you
might have something in between
somewhere but a it's the sort of strong
AI point of view that all thinking is
computation in particular feelings of
conscious awareness are revoked merely
by the carrying out perhaps the word
merely is a little bit weak
carrying out of appropriate computations
it's computations of some sort there's
the play alternative B is that what
awareness is a feature of the brain's
physical activity and whereas any
physical action could be simulated
computationally well that's the
assumption here the physical activity
could be simulated computationally that
computational simulation alone cannot
revoke awareness and this is the
so point of view i think john searle was
arguing for rather strongly or going
down the list of it the that appropriate
physical action of the brain evokes
awareness but that this physical action
cannot even be properly simulated camp
computations so there's something going
on which is not a computational action
when I say computation I mean
essentially during computation so once
looking at something there is an issue
in all these things about whether
discrete devices are necessarily limited
by being discrete as opposed to
continuous I'm going to take the view
the sort of standard view that there
isn't an essential difference well I
think there's some mathematical
questions here which may still not be
resolved in that connection
so whether one has to worry about
whether computation in the ordinary
sense of the word which is basically
Turing computation is all we need and
that's I think what one normally means
by computation or whether there is
something else which you still call
computation but involves continuous
parameters is there something different
there I'm not going really to get into
that particular question and then
there's B which is awareness cannot be
explained by basically by science so
that's a further point of view I wanted
to
that's it and now I just wanted to say
something about various other arguments
and how they relate to these viewpoints
there are two arguments that I want to
address particularly one of them so
Chinese room actually I'm assuming
people really know these things I don't
know whether they do but because it's
not central to what I want to say but I
thought I just if you do know it then
that's fine this is the Turing test
which I imagine people are familiar with
and here we have the Chinese room
argument of so where you imagine
somebody who is trying to answer
questions addressed in Chinese sits in
this room and he hasn't the remotest
idea about Chinese he doesn't speak
Chinese but he has the rules of how to
manipulate counters and things like that
which give the answer to this Chinese
question and so on and the question is
does he understand any Chinese even
though he's manipulating the rules and
gives the right answers that's the sort
of thing yeah that's one argument and
the other argument is one that was
particularly put forward by David
Chalmers in the book of his where you
assume it's possible to replace neurons
one by one by computer units without
change of external function and so on
and the question is whether the internal
experience or qualia persists unaffected
when you make these replacements and I
should say that the
the cell argument basically is an
argument against pay but it's one of
these more or less the Turing test
basically distinguishes a fee from C and
D and the charmers argument charmers
argument it argues against be an either
for a C or D and these things are not
usually put in a way that you can't
quite see that that's what they're doing
but I I don't think I want to go into
these things if people want to ask me
about them I couldn't say something
about them but the main point I want to
make is how they really relate to these
different ABCs and deals and it seems to
me you can accept all the arguments you
don't have to maybe you rather argue
against their particular arguments that
they make but if you accept them or they
all seem to be more pretty consistent
you see here we have a well ABCD the
Searle argument as I said it's an
arguments against a so it's saying that
it's one of these three is the people in
DC could the police turn your microphone
off thank you these things in blue here
are basically a question if whether
consciousness is or is not one of these
things so is it scientifically
discernible or not scientifically
discernible that to say if you have a
device which is purports to be conscious
can you tell whether it is or not by
asking it questions so that's basically
the Turing tests so the Turing test says
yes you can tell the difference and if
it's a good test that means that if it
passes the test then you
it's conscious if he doesn't pass the
test you say it's not conscious that
wasn't actually what Turing said
incidentally but it's the way these
things can be interpreted in this
officer that interpreted in this kind of
argument the Searle argument here is
whether there's any understanding
involved in carrying out the rules in
the Chinese room and so he argues that
consciousness is something below this
line here and the girl argument but I'll
say something about shortly is to say
that it's to the society this time line
here and Chalmers argument it says on
this side of this line so I would claim
that all of them seem to be supported by
see so if you happen to believe in C
you'd be happy to accept all the
arguments if you don't like C then you
have to find holes and whichever
argument sits on the wrong side of the
line of so I just thought it's of some
interest to indicate that let me just
move on I expect you've seen this is a
nice example because nowadays computers
we've got so powerful that no doubt they
can do this one in the tri seni way but
at the time that this chess problem was
put forward it's not quite the one
that's most familiar with you it's a
good example of how understanding can do
something you can have a computer which
is extremely powerful but if it doesn't
understand what it's doing
you can have a lot of trouble with an
example like this so in this one white
what's brown course but white is to play
and draw and you can see there's this
barrier of pawns here so the black has
an enormous advantage and extra to two
rooks and I guess that's what it is so
it should be easy for a black to win but
of course the if you could just plug
that very it's very easy to think that
if you give him this position that the
bishops you take the rook but if you do
that of course and you open up the
barrier and these species can pull their
way through the hole
check make the king eventually but
certainly when this problem was put
forward
there wasn't any computer that could
give the right answer to this problem
whereas it succeeded extremely easy for
a human being and it was a nice example
to show the difference between the
thinking's if you like of a computer and
a human being fact I think it was one of
a test a series of problems made up by
William Houston and David Norwood where
half the problems were easy for humans
in hard for computers and the other half
were the other way around and it was a
sort of anti Turing test because it was
extremely easy to tell which were the
humans in which were the computers so it
just showed that there was something
completely different going on in in the
way that they were addressing how hard
to play chess of course with computation
you can still find the right answer to
this problem here it's just that you
have to go many many moves deep in order
to get to doing it purely
computationally to see what the right
answer is in this particular case it's
completely obvious if you know anything
about chess what the right answer is
going to be so just the other straights
that there's something very different
going on the chess on the other hand is
a computational game so it's not really
a test of computability or not because
you could do this one purely about
computation it's just it's not the best
way to do it
so let me something address an issue
which is a bit more directly to do with
that and I just mentioned something
about the girdle argument so let me I
think it's easier for me to use this one
here oh because there's a table here
that's reason I'm doing
I hope it's alright for people I use
this machine primarily I'm thinking of
this this is not quite the form in which
the girdle argument is normally
presented but it has to do really with
the issue of the perception of
mathematical truth and the claim here is
that whatever it is is not something
which can be reduced to a set of
mechanical rules so that's it seems to
me that girdles theorem very clearly
says this although it's very
infrequently presented in quite this
form so let me say what it does say in
again in not the form that's normally
presented but in a form which is
actually much easier to prove than the
initial form of girdles theorem what
girls theorem tells us that for any set
of mechanical theorem proving rules and
I call that ah the basic basic thing
about the rules is that they're
mechanically checkable so if you have a
set of particular rules you're allowed
to use and if they have been correctly
applied that can be mechanically it's
purely purely computational rechecked so
that's what the rules their
computational in that sense and then
what you can do what Colonel shows you
how to do well it's really the girdle
touring version it's the Turing version
of girdles theorem which shows you
directly how to do this that you can
construct a mathematical statement which
I'm calling G of R which if we believe
in the validity of the rules are that is
to say if you really trust ah to be a
set of rules which only prove true
results and you can restrict your
theorems to be a very simple type of
result these things called pi one
sentences and the pi one sentence is
something like what pheromones last
there well I say it's a simple kind of
thing it needn't be a simple thing to
prove Fermat's Last Theorem we know it
took 400 years
was to prove but it's a statement where
you can set an infinite set of things if
you like each each one you can check
computation and you can run through them
if it's true that means you can keep
checking them one after the other and
but the fact that there every single one
of them is true is a statement of this
kind it doesn't matter what you don't
have to know our pile on sentences are
for this particular statement here this
just says for this particular type of
mathematical statement and that's all
you need to consider and it's a
basically logically simple type of
statement and if you have a set of rules
are which purport to give you proofs and
these rules are of such a nature that if
these rules are correctly carried out
then you would accept that there is a
proof so if you regard the rules are as
giving you proof they don't give you you
know they would not give you two equals
three for example as a correct theorem
so as long as you trust the rules then
you will have to trust also as true a
particular statement Geor I can give you
the proof of this thing too like the
proof depends on trust in the rules
better to say let me just say what it
says if we believe in the validity of
our then you have to accept you bar
whereas Geor cannot be used cannot be
proved using our and that's what that's
what girdle shows and if you want me to
I can I can give you a demonstration of
that
you want me to okay that's not that's
not sure it's not where people people
well I don't know maybe it is what you
have to do is consider computations
which depend on a number n and these are
essentially computer programs which
depend on a number n so and because they
are computations and you could write
them down alphabetically or numerically
whatever it is you could list them so
you have the zeroth one the first one
the second one etcetera and this listing
can be entirely computational there's no
it's to you about that so it's a
numerical ordering of computer programs
so suppose we have an algorithmic
procedure a which acting on the pair of
numbers P and NP is the the number of
the computation and n is the number that
acts on and that a has the property that
when acting on the P of n it comes to an
end provided and provides us with a
provided demonstration that the
computation C of n does not terminate so
you see you have these computations some
which terminate some which do not and I
like to use as an example can I'm
talking about natural numbers 0 1 2 3 4
etc can the natural number n be
expressed as or can the natural number Q
let's see we expressed as a sum of n
square numbers I'm not sure I've said
that the right way around
let's just see
and if it's three well yeah if it was
three square numbers then you can see
that not every number can be expressed
as the sum of three numbers because
score seven isn't assign three squares
but if it's four then you can try each
one try each one for each one and you it
never comes to an end because it happens
to be a case by a theorem due to
Lagrange every number is the sum of four
square numbers I have isolated the right
way of using is I mean that that's true
the thing is that you check it for each
number and if it see if I said I think
I've said it right
suppose we have navaratna procedure
which acting on the pair Elenin and then
which when it comes to an end provides
us with a valid demonstration that the
computation C of n that's not terminate
well you see see you Ben does not
terminate in the case of adding Sampson
squirt for squares so if n is 4 minutes
let me not go into that because I
haven't come prepared to talk about that
we can talk about this proof here so
this is what a is supposed to do if a P
of n stops then CP of n does not stop so
these conferences not all computations
will stop some will just keep on going
that's for example looking for a number
which is not the sum of four squares
that computation keeps on going forever
now you might have a proof that that
will keep on going forever and that's
the sort of thing a is supposed to do
for you it says okay now I've told you
yes it will go on forever so if a P then
stops then that's telling you that C
okay so suppose you believe that suppose
you trust a if you trust a then you're
going to believe the statement well you
also believe that in particular case
when P equals n then a if a of N and of
n stops then CN n does not stop
Hey and then must be one of the
computations here
it depends only on n on one number and
so therefore must be one of these
computations but since this is exhausted
this rule that must be one of them
so a n of n and you could find which one
it was it's not as though this is a the
difficult problem it may be difficult
technically but it's not a
mathematically difficult problem then a
n and n will be one of the seas and you
can find which one it is so you put N
equals C and then now you have this
statement if a K of K took its it put N
equals K K is the particular computation
which gives you a n of n then if K if K
of a of KK stops then C K of K does not
stop that's just the state Norman hang
up here but substituting K in hence C K
of K does not stop but a is not capable
of ascertaining this fact because it
doesn't stop C so therefore it no good
for deciding this particular one even
though by this argument I've just shown
you we can see that if we believe that a
doesn't make mistakes then this
particular statement it won't be able to
establish and that's all I've been
saying
something whether it's consistent or not
that's that's irrelevant I'm just saying
if you're prepared to use the system of
rules then you know how to transcend
that system of rules by understanding
and the understanding is what's gone in
here this understanding does not follow
the rules of a it's something that we
read okay we may not understand
immediately because I've gone rather
quickly but it's not in principle
difficult perhaps I should leave this
one on the other one so so you can spend
the rest of the talk but it's I should
say there's nothing contentious about
this I mean there are contentious things
about things I say undoubtedly but this
is not contentious this is this is
accepted by logicians you might argue
about any particular particular
statement whether or not you know it's
true or so on and so forth but that's
not the point about this you see it's a
general statement that any system of
axiomatic procedures that you accept as
giving you proofs you can transcend and
you transcend by using understanding
it's mysterious thing I think it is and
I don't think it's you know you can get
round it by well and then we can get
round whether we in our understanding
you see maybe something which we don't
understand which is calm computational
going on in the back of our heads or
something that's possibility to give
examples sorry I keep taking this
microphone away from my mouth and maybe
that makes me fade away but it's not
deliberate example of this thing here
okay now there's a sort of kind of
example is mathematical induction which
is a very familiar with math improving
results in mathematics elementary result
so that numbers
and it goes as follows you say you wish
to prove that some property P of n is
true for all natural numbers n and you
can do it this way by establishing this
true for zero and then you show that the
truth but n plus one follows from the
proof of the N and then the Equality is
true for all n so that's that's
mathematical induction very familiar and
the question is now and that's called
first order piano arithmetic if you like
to use this in the basic laws of logic
are the computational rules such as
those provided by ordinary mathematical
induction sufficient for establishing
the perceivable truths of arithmetic I
say perceivable that means using the
kind of incitements involved in that for
example and girls theorem tells us no
and it's quite nice to see I think
people used to say well let's not worry
about these things
because they're all incredibly
complicated and girdles argument uses
the little numbering of factoring things
into primes and so on and who would be
interested in any such thing it's
actually quite interesting that in
fairly recent years people have produce
lots of examples of things which are
which I like this which can't be proved
by induction and so on I would have
intended to bring you the slide about
good Stan's theorem which is perhaps the
most basic one to see which is a very
nice result but let me give you
something else which is cooler to it
practice nice in its own way proved by
the same people this is Kirby in Paris I
think it's the same people
this is her canoes in the Hydra here we
have Hercules and he has to kill this
creature here which is a lot got lots of
heads you see you could see them here
and it's a kind of tree with heads in
this example and Hercules has to try
chopping off the heads and if he chops
all the heads off he wins but of course
that's not the whole story because it
grows no new heads all the time and the
rule is that every time he chops off a
head then if you chops that head off you
see then from the base just below where
this has come out it grows a new head or
new two heads or three heads and so on
in fact the number of head new heads it
grows increases by one each time so here
you see he's about to chop this one off
so that's that one and the rule is that
you go down to the base here and you
grow another head I'll see you grow
exactly another one of the same that was
above it so you see that it's too
sticking out a bit so you got another
one with the two sticking out of it
there okay the next time he decides to
chop that one off and you have to go
down one and then you repeat what's
about it this time you repeated two
times and the next time he chops the one
at the bottom that's a bit more sensible
in a way because there's no way to go
never mind
and then you chops them this one off and
you see because four heads and then five
heads and six heads and so on and you
see the number of heads is going up and
up and up and up and if you go up
enormously absolutely enormous
the question is how clever this Hercules
have to be to make sure he wins
eventually and the answer is he doesn't
have to be he can be it cleric
incredibly stupid whatever he does he
always ultimately wins and it takes an
enormous number of chops and the tree
will grow enormous leader vastly huge
and the other thing about it is there's
no we're proving this with mathematical
induction
it's a girdle theorem for
let's try the curious interesting
example you might say how do we know
it's true do we go to that argument well
in principle and you might say we do but
it's not really in practice done that
way it's done a different way you can't
prove it by ordinary induction but you
can prove it by what's called
transfinite induction which is an idea
introduced by Cantor and you introduce
what to call that an ordinal number for
each one of these trees and what you
show is that each time that Hercules
does a chop it increases this
transfinite ordinal number so you're
talking about infinities and ordinal
infinities and the fact that if you have
a reducing the chain of ordinal numbers
then this will ultimately come to an end
and so that's the proof that Hercules
always wins
but the proof can't be given in terms of
ordinary ordinary type of induction you
need this thing called transfinite
induction
okay now I should say that these things
I've been saying up to this point are
not contentious although people argue
about aspects of this I take the view
that what it's telling us girdle and so
on they're telling us the computational
rule this is another way of putting it
computational rules cannot characterize
the properties of the natural numbers
there are always things called
non-standard models what Douglas
Hofstadter called supernatural numbers
which don't which satisfy your axioms
which which aren't natural numbers so
the question is how do we know what
natural numbers are if we were just
computational people you can't build in
the rules of what natural numbers are in
a purely computational way that's
another way of saying what it is yes the
child can you just show them a few
examples of natural numbers and they get
the hang of it and what is it that's
going on well I don't know what's going
on could you try and I'm not quite sure
to what degree I should try and go into
the logical things I think I shouldn't
you see you might say that the main
catch to this is that how do you know we
might act according to some algorithmic
procedure which we don't know and if you
don't know it then you can't construct
this statement here and how do you you
certainly you might even know to know
not not know that it's the right one you
might have come across it without
knowing that it's the right one and
things like that and those arguments are
perfectly things you have to consider if
you want to make a completely logical
argument now consider that that I in my
book shadows of the line I went into all
these things as far as I'm aware apart
from there were some basic
misunderstandings pointed out by a few
logicians and they're easily corrected
so the later printings these are
corrected
I don't know if I should bother to give
you these things here I think I wrote
there is a thing in shadows of the mind
where there's a discussion between this
chap and the this is an AI creation that
he's made after many years and yes it's
discussion with it which sure well I
won't go into it the claim is trying to
show that proper understanding cannot be
carried out simply by purely
computational procedures I guess that's
something if people want to ask me
questions about it I could go into the
afterwards then I think it would be
waste time to try and do that right now
I should say that the one thing that I
have written on this topic within the
last few years was a result of a
conference in Vienna in honor of girdles
hundredth anniversary and there was a
book produced only some when I say it
was was a book there's supposed to be a
book produced I was asked which somewhat
surprised me to give her thought this
sort of final popular talk at this thing
because I knew there were some people
logicians there who had some trouble
with some of them as I was putting and
then the book was reference very
refereed in great detail by a couple of
logicians and so on these people and
they were perfectly happy with the
article as it's finally appeared the
only trouble is I don't think it has
finally appeared I've never seen the
final article it's quite sight it's
about five years ago now and it's I keep
getting things which look as though it's
about to come out maybe some people know
whether it's come out or not it was the
Proceedings of this conference in Vienna
in armor of girdles a hundred
Camping's anniversary well let me go on
and I think as I said people want me to
talk about those things in more detail I
can do so better the claim here is that
there is something non-computational let
me move down this thing
slowly something on computational in
mathematical understanding and I think
that's I would take that's pretty
clearly true because of things like this
that our understanding seems to be able
to transcend purely computational
procedures if you believe the
computational procedures then you can
transcend them and that's what this is
telling you if it's some computational
procedure you don't believe what right
do we have to use it and as
mathematicians so it seems to me there
is something in mathematical
understanding which does go beyond
computation and then I would say there's
nothing special about mathematical
understanding it's just part of human
understanding generally okay it's a bit
more refined and more careful so on a
bit more abstract but there's nothing
fundamentally different I would argue so
it's human understanding generally and
then I say human consciousness because
understanding as I was saying at the
beginning of this talk to me a crucial
aspect of understanding is awareness
that you have to be aware of what you're
thinking about and whatever that
awareness is doing it's mysterious but
it's doing something seems to me which
enables us to transcend what you do with
purely following logical rules is there
a line to be drawn between human and
animal consciousness my own view is no
that this isn't the right place to draw
a line simply because one sees so much
similarity between human beings and
other animals that I would very be very
reluctant to put a line between them
here
it's almost anything you can point to
which stig distinguishes humans from
animal
you can find there is some animal which
does it it may not be always the same
animal that does it but you can find
pretty about anything you can think of
there is at least one other animal that
does it so it's hard to see apart from
just magnitude and so on there's a clear
cut one thing that distinguishes humans
in a way which makes me believe at least
that there's a lack of consciousness in
animals so where can we drill draw the
line well somewhere maybe somewhere I
wouldn't say all animals are conscious I
hate to think bacteria for example other
animals I'm not sure Paramecium seems to
be do quite clever things but I'd hate
to think that really is conscious
non-computer belief here in some aspect
of consciousness for example
mathematical understanding strongly
strongly suggests that non computability
should be a feature of all consciousness
and if that's the case and if you
believe that consciousness is not
something mysterious which doesn't come
out of the laws of the physical world
and that's what I do believe that it is
somewhere out there in the physical book
world that we have in physical laws
something non computable now I want to
make a point that this is nervous most
people still want me to have this up
yeah
just so you see what I'm talking about
here just to show that there's a real
issue here I can give you a a non
computable toy model of the universe
it's not 8v universe it's a totally toy
universe and this toy universe perfectly
well there are absolutely clear cut
rules you have a discrete time which
goes 0 1 2 3 4 etc the state of this
universe at any one time is given by a
pair of polyomino sets but the polyomino
has a set of squares like things you see
here all equal size the squares glued
together along edges in a plane shape
could connected continuous and you have
a set of a finite set of these
polyominoes to be one of your SS so you
might start with the empty set and then
build up I just randomly chosen numbers
here because that gives me these numbers
up but you could computationally list
all the sets of polyominoes on the
finite sets of polynomials this
enumeration is to enumerate all possible
distinct finite polyomino sets in a
computational way now in this so-called
universe we have a pair of polyomino
sets and we start with s 0 0 and the
rule the way the laws of physics in this
universe are that if the state is SP s Q
at a time T then the state is to be SP
plus 1 s Q so you add 1 to the P you go
along to the next one for the first of
the two polyomino sets if SP tiles the
plane so can you cover the entire plane
using the sets of shapes in your
polyomino set and if it cannot tile the
plane then you swap them over so you
take you go to p plus 1 but you put that
second and you just go on like this so
your evolution might be
sort of thing I would say there now this
evolution I claim is actually completely
deterministic this rule is a completely
deterministic rule but it is also non
computational there is no computer
algorithm which tells you how this
university Volvo sets
single cross for example will tile the
plane you can see it doing it here this
shape will - if you have these two
shapes either one by itself will not
tell the plane you quickly ran into a
problem with little hole gaps you leave
but if you use both together then you
can tell the plane and here's an example
that single shape will tell the plane
and this is just to show you it can be a
little bit complicated even with one
shape you have to use eight different
orientations of that shape but all of
those tile periodically if you take this
set of three tiles then you find if they
will tile the plane and there I've
started doing it but it never repeats
itself there is no way of tiling the
entire plane with these shapes in a comp
in a repeating way now I give you this
example because this is an essential
ingredient to the proof that Robert
Robert Berger gave that there is no
computational algorithm for deciding
whether or not a finite set of polyomino
shapes he didn't quite state it that way
but it follows at once from his result
finite set of polyomino shapes well will
or will not tile the plane the problem
is to decide that it will not pile the
plane that way around
sorry I forgot but anyway you can't
there's not an algorithm for deciding
yes or no whether a finite set of change
shapes will tile the plane in case
you're interested it's if you want to
know how this is done
a quick clue because it was based on a
set of tiles gave made by Robert Amman
where he had these shapes like that and
it's a hierarchical scheme I think I'll
just show you very cool basically you
put these orange lines on the tiles and
so it's a questioner explaining that
arrangement
you can see the green shapes are showing
you how these things are grouped and
they follow a similar sort of there's
slightly different shapes but they're
basically the same and then these things
again you get bigger and bigger and each
time it's a hierarchical arrangement
incidentally the fact that the tiling
problem is non-computational depends on
an arguments that you give show that
there must be non hierarchical tilings
too because how right if you could the
best you could do would be hierarchical
ones again it would be competition show
there wasn't album there deciding the
tiling problem so everyone then we go on
okay so the idea then is there's
something in the physical world which is
non computational that's the claim
and this is what one is trying to this
is the model the orc or our model is a
model due to Stuart Hameroff and myself
to try and find a possible place for non
computational physics acting in the
brain now before we get to that we would
require something which goes beyond
standard physics you see there's an
argument here which also has some little
bit of loopholes but not very big ones I
should say that is that physics as we
know it today is in effect computational
in fact it's as we know we can do vast
computer simulations and Astrophysical
processes and all sorts of things
extremely well and these simulations do
work extraordinarily well if you know
what the physics that's going on in the
system if you you can guess what oh if
you get guess what that physics is you
can work out the implications by doing
horrendously long complicated
computations so we know that an awful
lot of physics is computational
basically you say could say that
Newtonian dynamics is basically
computational there is this caveat at
the beginning I mentioned continuous or
discrete so you have to worry about that
problem but that problem is probably not
essential and so if you accept that then
Newtonian mechanics is computational
basically relativities computation or
quantum mechanics what about quantum
mechanics
well quantum mechanics is a slight issue
big issue I should say quantum mechanics
consists of two procedures one is
basically what's called unitary
evolution or the Schrodinger equation
and this is linear and it's computable
it's similar to classical mechanics in a
sense in many respects it's more
complicated you have many more degrees
of freedom and so on so calculations
could get very vast on the other hand it
doesn't seem to be non computable one of
the features of quantum mechanics though
is what
say something about that one of the
great beauties of quantum mechanics you
see you said that quantum mechanics
involves two ingredients one is unitary
evolution which is a deterministic
evolution computer more which tells you
can know what the state of a system is
now in principle you could compute what
it's going to do indefinitely into the
future the trouble is that doing that
doesn't give you what you want to know
necessarily what you want to know is the
result of an observation and the
observation process is where the
probabilities come in and that is not
part of unitary evolution in fact it's
inconsistent with unitary evolution
which is a big puzzle because if you
would think that if you have a measuring
apparatus trying to measure what some
quantum system is doing then the
measuring apparatus together with the
quantum system or to be a new quantum
system and therefore its evolution ought
to be deterministic and there shouldn't
be these probabilities that you get in
quantum mechanics so where are the
probabilities come from do they come
from lack of knowledge do they come from
environmental decoherence is there's a
common view or what well a basic feature
of unitarity
Schrodinger equation here I've got an
example where we have a photon coming
out of a laser say hitting a mirror that
comes and hits this green thing and
produces a whole lot of junk thing and
the wrong thing
produces a whole lot of other Jack now
quantum mechanics tells you that if two
things are possible to happen I'm sorry
yes thank you this beam splitter which
allows half the light to go through and
hard to be reflected however you can't
think of that as every other photon
going through or something like that
what you find is that the photon
necessarily sort of goes through and not
goes through at the same time and this
you can test because you can put other
mirrors in and test interference between
these two alternatives so you can't say
what happens all the other happens you
have to say that you nature keeps track
of both alternatives so that is the
superposition rule is that any quantum
state pair of quantum states you can
fight you can form me you could sort of
add them together in this sense well
more or less that's what it says now yes
the problem here we have the
schrödinger's cat course not just a
green thing in a brown thing but here we
have the thing going right through a
device murderous device here we have a
gun then it kills the poor cat you see
or you see you could put in a mirror
and the cat's okay or you can with a
beam splitter in which is basically
showing he was doing although of course
he never actually did the experiment he
was very humane person he wouldn't
consider doing such a thing
I'm sure it's just a fourth cat but then
you see according to shredding this
equation it would be alive and dead at
the same time okay you say well is it to
do with the environment I've put the
environment in here
is it to do with an observer coming
along and looking at it is it to do with
the consciousness of the observer and
you can see there the observer has an
image of the cat in in his mind you see
and here's the live one and there's the
dead one and of course the
superpositions if they extend to all
orders then it doesn't really help you
there are lots of arguments people make
and I don't want to go into them they
tend to go into one if you take
unitarity or be sure doing a question to
its limits you are led to what's called
the many-worlds interpretation which
means all these things happen at once
but it doesn't really explain why you
don't see these mixtures of things it's
it's not a complete explanation even if
true to me these things just tell us
that quantum mechanics is not right at
all levels and there are other reasons
for believing there's in my opinion I
may say so much a minority opinion but
it's the big unknown in my view of
modern physics is what nerve to do with
a measurement problem in quantities
there are things you can do
proposed experiment for trying to do
just the sort of thing I was telling you
there of putting an object into
superposition two places at once and to
see whether it can persist or whether it
spontaneously decays into one or the
other and the claim that I'm making in
some other people particular do she who
put forward particular view on this
before I did is that its gravitational
effects which caused the reduction of a
state that is if you have a
superposition alive and dead cat would
be an example and simply flip over to
one or the other in a very short period
of time tiny tiny fraction of a second
but if you had a very small thing like
in this example a 10 micron mirror
little cube you could maybe hold it in a
superposition for about a second
displaced from itself by simply about
the diameter of a atomic nucleus here
that's the idea and so it's
experimentally testable it is not yet
being experimental II tested but at
least it would represent if true a
deviation from standard quantum
mechanics and it seems to me you need
something like this in order to have
something with a chance of being non
computational so the idea then is that
it's whatever the physics is going on
here which goes beyond standard quantum
mechanics I believe the case that there
is something beyond standard quantum
mechanics which is causing the the
reduction of the states the what we call
making a measurement that there is
something there whether it's to do with
gravity is one question and certainly
it's a big question whether it's got
anything to do with what's going on in
the brain so the next argument is that
maybe it is something to do with what's
going on in the brain the odd minute to
explain this to you what do people
thinks going on in the brain well the
usual argument indeed we've got neurons
and we've got axons and synapses and
goodness knows what dendrites and
synapses and this sort of picture people
tend to have and it's a bit like a
computer going on here that these
neurons behavior
like what transistors or what have you
but if it selves are really very
sophisticated structures they've had a
lot longer to develop than human beings
have and cells seem to very
sophisticated objects so one of the
ingredients and this is something I
didn't know about when I wrote the
emperor's new mind I should have done
that it was Stuart Hameroff who told me
about microtubules
these are little it's it always seemed
to me that neurons weren't much good for
trying to preserve any kind of quantum
coherence if you want really to get
quantum mechanics up to a level at which
what goes on beyond quantum mechanics
could begin to have any role you need to
keep it isolated and what the actions of
neurons they just aren't isolated I mean
they they disturb you have these
electric fields which disturb what's
going on in the rest of the brain
uncontrollable ways so it seems to me
pretty hopeless didn't stop me writing
the emperor's new mind but it seemed to
me that something you needed something
more
now Hameroff came up and with this idea
that microtubules are playing an
important role these microtubules I
should say these are substructures of
cells generally not just neurons they're
all over the place
there has to be something special about
them in neurons and the claim is that
there is something special about them in
neurons these microtubules excited me a
lot more than what neurons might do
because they are tubes they could
isolate what's going on inside perhaps
they're very very symmetrical structures
here we have it's another picture this
is just a fanciful picture of looking
down a microtubule
what you find is they've got 13 of these
rows and they spar around in the two
different directions with eight and five
these are Fibonacci numbers which is
kind of intriguing here Hema offsider I
should say is that there were sort of
conformational States of the individual
tubulin proteins these are the things
which make up the microtubule they have
two parts to them an alpha and a beta
part and that they could be in different
kind of geometrical relationship
depending upon the placement of an
electron in inside that was his
suggestion and here we have a bit more
of his suggestion and an important fact
that I want to mention here is that
there are known to be two types at least
the microtubules this I don't think
either of us knew when I first came to
know about these things I think is
called a lattice in the be lattice the a
lattice is the very symmetrical kind
which is drawn in these pictures
the be lattice one is where the lattice
structure is a bit the other way around
where the Alpha and Beta part of the
tubulin are the opposite way in arranged
in the lattice and then you find there's
a scene things don't meet properly at
the end and these are the ones that
people normally see in cells and they
are used they seem to have an important
role in cells transporting molecules
around the cell so they certainly hadn't
fought a role but they would not have to
be the ones which have a role to play in
the brain that would be the claim and
amorous idea was that you have these
some kind of cellular automaton
originally with these tubulin
confirmations get propagated along the
microtubules however you would need for
the scheme that we later developed to
have something where you have to it's
involved with some kind of quantum
coherence so that these actions if
that's what it is
we'd have to be involved in quantum
superpositions now I've got another
slide somewhere
let's see what it's got to well I can go
to this so the picture is something like
this you have lots of activity going on
in microtubules where you have some
quantum coherence of quantum state which
is preserved without disturbing its
environment as the idea and these are
sort of tuned by means of these
connections which act as sort of nodes
to the vibrations in them and so on and
these influence the strengths of the
connections between each and the next
now there are these interesting
structures also which are present right
in the batteries which I find also very
fascinating because you have highly
symmetrical structures these things you
may well know about these c60 molecules
which are carbon just this would be
carbon at the vertices of this truncated
octahedron or a soccer ball but you find
these is a somewhat larger scale made
out of these protein entities which are
called triskelions and it's very
remarkable that these should be found in
the sitting right here you see what are
they doing there these very symmetrical
structures but very symmetrical
structures have an important role in
that you're liable to get certainly a
thing like this there's thing called the
hum tell it the Aunt Eller effect which
means that you you can have some kind of
quantum activity at the lowest level and
then the next energy level can be quite
a gap away from the lowest one so it's
something a bit like super Kondik
conductivity going on
well you see what you would need in
order for anything like this to be
remotely possible would be something
sort of like superconductivity going on
in microtubules and it's certainly been
argued by many people who might say very
sensibly that in the warm brain and so
on you're not going to get things like
superconductivity taking place well I
was always very suspicious of these
arguments because we know so little
about what's going on in cells and they
are extremely ordered sophisticated
structures so that is a simple argument
of a general kind is hardly likely to
give you my Dean much insight into
what's going on from these very very
sophisticated structures so what I want
to mention at the end here is something
which I only heard about very recently
about microtubules this is but the
terminology ballistic lossless conduct
conductance is what's being referred to
and these are single a lattice
microtubules at room temperature which
with a alternating current stimulation
in the low megahertz range and these
people here look like a couple of
Japanese people in Indian who have done
some experiments on room temperature
isolated individual live a lattice
microtubules and this is the address and
so on and that what may seem to find is
that the resistance that you would have
normally in a microtubule something like
Jigga ohms drops to less than one ohm
and it's how much less they don't know
because the one ohm is what you get from
wires the copper wires so they're better
than copper wires it could be that
they're much much better in fact the the
terminology they've used this is
ballistic that seems to be a new
technical term it's what seems to be
going on in these microtubules if you
could show that it was something like a
tenth of that of an ohm
one hundredth of an ohm this will be
pretty convincing that this is actually
something like superconductivity where
you do need quantum coherence I don't
quite understand this bit here but this
is what they call it a fourth circuit
element I should say that there's a bit
of a problem here about finding the
literature and I kept asking Stewart how
on earth kind of give tell me a
reference you see and he said the
trouble is that these people for various
reasons which one might think about have
want to patent it first and so although
the patent application is public so you
can read I don't know how to find it
myself but you can the principle find
the patent application and see what
they're saying but until that's accepted
as a patent they're not prepared to
publish this result so apparently there
was an earlier paper in which they
predicted it but the actual observations
still slightly under wraps I would like
to be able to say more about it I'm
afraid at this point it sounds extremely
exciting it seemed to me for a long time
that microtubules were the best bet for
anything of our quantum coherent nature
to be taking place in the brain I never
was persuaded by any of the arguments
that's tegmark for instance max tegmark
had tried to argue that that they were
decohere in a tiny fraction of a second
but of course these are using general
arguments which don't take into account
the very special cysts it's very special
environment and structure that these
things have which has to be very special
otherwise of course he would have
decoherence taking place much too
rapidly it has to be something very very
special particularly in making use of
the symmetry there is a point that
struck me about microtubules for quite a
time which is the fact that this
straight you see you've got these long
lines of tubulins whereas if people make
them in dishes and they can do that they
can get them to unroll and roll up again
instead of having 13 you can have 14 or
12 and when you do that then there's a
slight spiral one way or ella there's
nothing which is straight in them what
does nature doing to have them straight
when it's not playing as far as I can
see any structural role
what's it doing being straight so it
seemed to me that there could well be
something of its nature which is what
they're doing and that and one reason
I've felt this was I read a paper once
about nanotubes where there you can have
sort of superconducting type behavior
but this occurs when there you you have
you follow along a very small number of
atoms until you get the okay until you
get to the next one and if it's twisted
then you this thing affects the effect
drops off very rapidly so it does depend
on them being straight
so the straightness seemed to me to be
if it's playing a role very likely a
quantum mechanical role and I think this
seems to indicate that there is
something like this going on I should
mention also that quantum coherence
apparently has also been seen in
photosynthesis so photosynthesis
proteins I don't know anything about
this but it does say that they is there
are observations nowadays which show
quantum activity are quite a large scale
and to argue that these things are
irrelevant to biological processes it
seems to me most unlikely to be correct
that they do have very important roles
to play and in view of this it seems to
me that it's not at all unbelievable
that microtubules play the sort of role
that I claim and Hameroff and I both
claim should be part of what's going on
in conscious activity so let me stop at
that point thank you very much
hi professor fearo's let me ask you a
couple of unrelated questions first how
does consciousness relate to our free
will in and second why people need very
abstract forms of art like music and how
does it relate to consciousness I think
they're both very good questions too
good for me probably and the question of
free will is an interesting one and I'm
not one of those people who can who sort
of dismisses it I think there is a real
phenomenon to be understood there and it
certainly the the active aspect of
consciousness this is to do with free
will whatever free will is there are
also these funny experiments that people
do which try to show that well you will
you really knew what you're going to do
ahead of time my activity in the brain
which seemed to precede one's apparent
choice when this was made I think this
is very difficult because you don't
really know when you make a choice and
so on and are these they tend to be
filled of random choices which is not
kind of what you'd like to use your
freewill for so so I think there are big
mysteries and puzzles I think it's a
very deep question and I all I can say
is I think it's a real question and I
think it's part of the consciousness
question and I I think both these ones
this one and the art one which is also
an interesting one you mentioned music
was it particularly I think it's also
something which puzzles people greatly
because it's very hard to see what role
as an evolutionary role music has to
play and nevertheless it seems to be
something which is almost universal in
humanity is also present in in Birds
you get birdsong and they're having
experiments have been it's particularly
for birds which which don't have much in
the way of plumage you see so so the
male is trying to show off and attract
the female it's always that way around
and sometimes they do this but I have
one from wonderful plumage you see and
the female gets attracted by this and of
course there's an aesthetic element
there too and sometimes it's because of
the songs this thing
and then they don't they're pretty dull
to look at but experiments have been
done because it's certainly some of them
are better singers than others and and
the experiment that have been done is to
have human beings come and judge which
they think of the nice tunes and
organized songs you see and they seem to
agree pretty well with the ones that
attract the female birds so it's as
though there is something which is which
is quite beyond species you know which
which is and again even more striking it
well what about flowers flowers come
about because of insights and the you
know before insects there weren't any
any flowering plants and and it's
somehow the the beauty in plant and
flowers is appreciated by insects but
does that mean they're conscious I hate
to say but but there is something very
profound in in in in art aesthetics it's
what part I didn't show you my platonic
slides and so on because but I think
that that there is a role even I would
the closest I could get to saying
anything here I suppose is that if you
look at this is extremely primitive but
you think of musical chords and you can
take three notes you see now if you take
the three notes what C c e and g c e and
g that's right and the frequency is 1 to
2 3 to 5 something and and you play that
to the chord and it's a very pleasant
sounding chord now if you put them so
that the relative frequencies are just
the same but in the other order then
it's just slightly that's a minor chord
you see and it creates a different
emotion definitely a different emotion
already you know that primitive level
and so so something about the three
together which is which is because
because if you try to find the least
common whatever it is you've denominator
you find you have to go to 15 where is
the other one I forget what it is now
but but the the major one even though
individually they're just the same
chords
as a triple there's something more I
wouldn't say a non harmonious but it's
slightly slightly there's a bit of a
tension there which you don't get with
the other now is that something that one
in a certain sense perceives directly in
the in the physiology of the brain and
that music is K taking that further and
further that there is something direct
directly which relates in some way to
what's going on in consciousness some
kind of coherence of some kind which
which is respected by the brain directly
and which has nothing to do with the the
way the things are connected which is
much more to do with the kind of quantum
effects which I'll be talking about it's
pure speculation I don't know but I
think they're very good questions and
maybe someday we'll have answers to them
thank you thank you yeah you mentioned
that you feel that our understanding of
quantum mechanics has a misunderstanding
or missing something what do you think
that is it's incomplete but I say
stronger than that I mean Einstein said
it was incomplete and I agree with that
but in a certain sense wrong and I think
there are I could make about four or
five arguments in favor of this belief
one is the most direct one which is that
the process of measurement or the
reduction of the state simply is not a
unitary process now you can really
involve many worlds and says to do with
something perceiving and goodness knows
what but if you want to try and explain
the world as it appears to us this
reduction seems to take place something
seems to happen actually out there in
the world it's not just which world is
being chosen out of her it's just the
world that we're talking about is the
world that we all perceive together and
in that world unitary unitary evolution
is not the whole answer also there's
arguments from gravity which have to do
with the basis of the experiment which I
indicated to you here one of the
strongest motivations behind that comes
from two of the basic principles of
general relativity on the one hand
quantum mechanics on the other the
general relativity principle absolutely
fundamental is the principle of
equivalence that is dropping on an
acceleration is equivalent to a
gravitational field and that there's a
tension between that and the
superposition principle I can't go into
the argument in here but there is a
clear-cut tension and you can actually
demonstrate this mathematically and this
gives some indication at a level at
which you might expect to see some
deviation from the standard
superposition principle and that's what
goes into this experiment another
argument comes from black hole
evaporation and there's a big argument
about whether information it's lost in
black holes or not I think that's very
strong case can be made that information
is lost that violates unitarity and
that's one of the reasons that a lot of
physicists don't like it to be lost
including that she'd say Stephen Hawking
when he changed his mind on this topic a
few years ago his original argument was
that it was lost but the if it's lost
that does violate unitarity I think it
has to violate unitarity
I'm not unhappy about that so I think
there are several arguments looking
completely independent of one another to
indicate that there has to be something
beyond quantum mechanics in which the
reduction process is not explained just
by environmental decoherence or
something like that for something else
for finally going on my own view is it's
going to be an absolutely radical change
in our way of looking at quantum
mechanics it would make almost no
difference it's a bit like quantum
mechanics sorry
it's a bit like relativity general
relativity making almost no difference
in Newtonian theory Newtonian theories
offer us what one normally uses for to
see what you know satellites do and so
on it's almost the same misguided steins
there but I says there's completely
different framework you look at it as it
come from a completely different point
of view and it leads you in a different
direction I think we're gonna have to do
that to quantum mechanics do you have
any ideas about what that theory might
look like when or what what or what yes
but nothing that I would stick my neck
out to support and nothing that I have
time to say right here thank you
yes hi um I was curious if you're
familiar with some of the experiments
that were done at the pear lab at
Princeton that seemed to indicate that
consciousness can influence the results
of random number generators yeah I know
I mean I should say yeah maybe I may be
prepared to believe lots of crazy things
and that one I have problem with I have
heard experiments of that kind yes it
would cause a lot of trouble with other
things but I haven't seen a particular
one so I should you know it would be
unscientific unscientific of me to say I
don't believe it
but my initial inclination would be to
be suspicious of it Thanks yeah so I
view this mainly as I guess an attack on
the church touring thesis you know that
claims that everything that is
computable steering thesis yesterday yes
we have to speak air what we understand
by that because anything that is
computable in an informal sense this
computer computable by a Turing machine
okay yeah and I guess to cut to the
chase my question is so suppose there
exists these microtubules or whatever it
is that goes beyond the traditional
sense of computation suppose I donate
some of these things out of my brain or
whatever right and I connect them with a
traditional computer and that thing all
of a sudden becomes capable of you know
deciding whether Turing machines halt
and whatnot what makes it so certain or
doesn't make are you certain that these
things could not be harnessed for
something that we would call an
artificial intelligence I should make my
position on this clear because it's very
easily misunderstood the first place yes
I agree with what you say is the
church-turing thesis that is the way I
understand it and that's what they meant
originally went to church and Turing
church put it forward initially
yes I see no reason in principle why one
shouldn't be able to make use of these
things in a device the normal way that
one talks about a device or a robot or
something like that is in terms of a
computationally controlled device but
that's if you like just the definition
and I don't see any reason why some
latter-day Frankenstein couldn't put
together something out of microtubules
or whatever it is I should say that even
these people here
I believe that experiment they're doing
most recent experiment have been to do
work with things which are not actually
microtubules but which use the kind of
structure that microtubules have to see
whether they can use it you get the same
effects that so this is they're trying
to do that very thing now whether that
would be conscious you see I think the
argument that Tamara and I try to put
forward is yes consciousness needs this
but it has to be but more than that
because after all you know any
observation in a quantum mechanical
observation doesn't involve presumably
much of a conscious event that might be
a very tiny bit of consciousness or
something which somehow has to be made
coherent in some big structure but that
would be part of what you're suggesting
I see no reason why they couldn't be
done surrogates my follow-up question
down would be there seems to exist vast
literature on the topic of trans
computability so if you allow for more
primitives beyond what can be done in a
traditional computer yeah you get you
know a richer families of languages and
so forth well you have those things
called Oracle machines and so on right
and then there are several levels of
these things and so forth so do you see
any correspondence between what we call
consciousness and one of these trans
computable I mean I would say that yes
in certain sense that's true because you
see it doesn't mean none of the argue at
the girdle type arguments tell you that
you could solve any non computable
problem it doesn't mean you could see
the answer to a mathematical problem of
a cone
a tional major that never says that it
does say though that you can see the
answer to some of them see if you can
see what the computational procedure
that you're trying to to transcend is
then you can transcend that particular
one whether you can make a device using
such a structure I have no argument
against I'm not sure how happy I feel
about it that's another question but
it's certainly not part of any of my
arguments that that couldn't be done I
don't see any reason why I couldn't be
there thank you
so this this is nearly the same as the
previous question do you think there's
some level of the arithmetic hierarchy
which is strong enough to describe
physics as some level of the arithmetic
hierarchy no because when you see if you
believe my pocket nuts
all the arguments can be repeated you
see you just take the Oracle machine say
okay replace replace Turing machine by
Oracle machine all the way through there
justise computer bleah list of all and
so on so forth
so yeah then you transcend them so there
you can't point to a particular level of
Oracle machine which would represent
what would I would claim is what can be
done with consciousness so it seems to
transcend all those levels is there some
so delicately placed at the end of all
that which is what consciousness been
achieved who knows but that's a
possibility which is
and to do that I think this yes so this
is a somewhat aggressive question but
you mentioned that aggressive did you
send it degress aggressive question well
you mentioned that you weren't able to
read Sawyer's paper because the patent
that they had filed on his work it won't
be long I shouldn't think that's what
I'm told and and I was recently thinking
about Alexander growth nd egg using the
faculty owns the copyrights on his work
to prevent them his works on analytic
geometry from going back into print and
I was wondering if you had any thoughts
about sort of this current status quo of
how scientific communication works
around intellectual property laws and
whether he wrote suggestions to engage
this question to comment about here I
think I don't know I guess I worry about
both sides of the argument and I haven't
formed a clear view I mean I can
understand you know intellectual
property being important and so on but
on the other hand when it comes to
mathematical things people often accuse
me because you know about perhaps I
shouldn't mention it we moved into a new
house you see and my wife noticed that
the toilet paper had a certain pattern
on it she says isn't that doesn't that
look familiar to me and I hadn't
couldn't see without my glasses on so
that they were Penrose tiles well I have
to be cautious what I say about this but
the company which involved making things
through the court called pendaflex which
make made puzzles based on my designs
and so on and they were they were duly
appalled by this you see and decided to
bring it up this happened to be the
toilet paper sheet it was what is it as
Kleenex
so it's pretty dangerous to take them on
but they did and I thought with some
quite clever arguments the whole thing
eventually was settled out of court
which is all I'm allowed to say about it
other people say other things but that's
all I can say I will except for a
general point the general point would be
that the issue is whether something has
been copied from something covered by a
copyright whether if if on the other
hand something has been constructed
according to some mathematical rule or
mathematical principle that's in my view
at least public property thank you
thanks for coming and talking to us my
question is going back to the Tran
sentence and the argument so the
argument seems to be that we can
transcend computation and therefore we
can sort of understand it but there
seems to be an assumption that human
consciousness can actually understand
itself so is that really true or do we
really need something that you have an
cent conscience does do you understand
rather not say we can because I don't
understand no the arguments I've tried
to give you see I admit there so there's
a certain fuzzy edges to all these
arguments but in shadows of the mind and
as far as I'm aware all the logical
arguments have seen been put forward
afterwards don't refute the argument I
gave there although there's some points
in it which which needed in the early
printings was there were some errors and
one of them had to do with a good
completeness and all that so just ignore
that bit but see the argument there was
not really it was it was thinking about
could you construct a race of
intelligent robots using principles that
we understand would improve their
performance you see so there would be
kind of you know could use that
you could use natural selection you
could use all sorts of ingredients into
it so that in detail you wouldn't know
what was going on but the general
principles whereby these devices would
improve their appearance they approve
their performance would be in principle
known because it would be fed into the
whole thing in the beginning and so the
argument was that anything of that
nature still would run into girdle
problems but it's it's much more of a
fuzzy argument and one has to it's hard
to formulate it as a symbolic logic
argument which is probably why I
logicians have sometimes but but I I
suppose the main reason I have it's not
that I don't disbelieve those arguments
I think the main thing is it's something
much more obvious than that
you see it's if natural selection is
going to produce beings that can
understand good Stan's theorem although
Hercules in there what you call it you
see in all these arguments which doesn't
require a great deal I mean it's not
very complicated you have to think
background and you know get your mind
around it and definitely invoke your
conscious mind but what you're actually
doing is not that complicated and it's
something which you could imagine could
have involved in natural selection not
for that purpose but in order to you
know catch mammoths or whatever they
used to do in the old days and so in the
old days a development of understanding
and being able to put yourself in the
place of a mammoth or whatever it is you
have to do and all these things which
require consciousness it seems to me is
what is is what what we what developers
and as as a sort of side effect happened
to me you can apply these things to
mathematical problems it's not as though
the mathematics but somehow evolves see
one of the loopholes for the girdle type
argument is there some so vast and
sophisticated algorithm that we act
according to that we've got no hope of
understanding it but how did that evolve
I mean it's ridiculous that couldn't
have evolved it doesn't make sense from
the point of view natural
that a thing like that could have
evolved when there was hardly any
selection in favor of mathematicians
goodness they probably do quite well
here but most places it's not the best
thing to do if you want me a lot of
money okay
hi are you familiar with Henry Markram s
work in simulating whose rate was this
so Henry Markram not sure tell me about
it
he's using basically a bunch of
processors just to simulate neurons to
build her little brain yeah yeah well
the people who simulate simulate worms
and things like that is it to do it like
sort of thing she's planning to simulate
a human brain well III guess I'm not
familiar with this specific work but
I've heard things of this nature and I
would imagine that what's being done is
is a computer simulation if the standard
is what is it I don't know but I mean it
would come under the heading of a
computational system so I would be very
suspicious of that actually producing a
believable simulation but I'm certainly
worth doing even if for the
negative-negative reason you see if you
see this doesn't work you see then you
learn something I mean even things it's
evil things flying these people who are
very good at doing the arithmetic of
computation you know the what they call
who can do rapid multiplication of big
numbers okay not as fast as a computer
but I remember hearing this argument
given to me by my very distinguished
neurophysiologists that if you take him
to account all the processes with
neurons are going on in the brain
there's no way they could do it that
fast what are they doing I don't know
how much of an argument that is but but
it was presented to me as an argument so
I guess I would be a little doubtful
that you get very far in simulating
human behavior in this kind of way
in fact one sees and I don't know how
far they've got with these Turing there
is it still annually people have
during tests and how far they got can
they do no good still shaking heads no
that was the impression of that yes yeah
yeah mark Markham has a time frame of
ten years ten years that's the usual
time frame my question is about
intelligence and understanding yeah I
have a couple of friends who work at a
hedge fund in New York they don't claim
to understand the stock market but they
write machine learning algorithms that
do really well so I would say they're
being very intelligent and similarly you
don't claim to understand the workings
of a cell in exactly how quantum effects
become large but if it turns out if your
theory is correct everyone would agree
that you're being intelligent that this
is an intelligent theory so until just
seems to be all about making predictions
and being right why does it require
understanding well I was showing my own
use of the words um I just wouldn't use
intelligence necessarily for coming out
right okay and after all people who make
lots of money on the stock market
certainly have come out right but you
should do proper statistical tests and I
suppose give them IQ tests first and
then see which ones succeed and which
ones fail I don't know probably
intelligence plays a role in that but
how many people have failed in these
activities too and is it correlated with
intelligence can you measure
intelligence well with a test even I
don't know but in any case it's only an
aspect of it you see I think sure being
intelligence helps in getting things
right I agree with that that's nothing
against my arguments though and not
understanding what's going on in the
process isn't essential to making use of
it that certainly happens a lot I'm sure
how many people will understand the deep
quantum mechanics going on in certain
processes which actually fundamentally
depend on it I'm sure
don't so it certainly I would not say
it's necessary but I would say that that
an understanding is there I don't mean
it has to be the understanding deep down
of what's really going on in the system
but there is an element of understanding
as part of the intelligent behavior I
would claim that's just just my use of
the words I feel unhappy I know that
people call devices artificially
intelligent and the word intelligence is
there you know buildings can be
intelligent and so on so forth
I sort of wince every time I hear that
word but I can see the word is being
used often in a way which does not agree
with the the definitions of it the usage
that I was putting forward there thanks
I was just trying to understand what you
meant when you said intelligence
requires understanding well to me if I
if I underst if I reality I would say if
I'm reacting intelligently as opposed to
just sort of even instinct instinctively
say I might get it right instinctively
without understand around doing but
that's not so much intelligent that's
just that's acting ok some people might
call that intelligent it's not quite the
usage I was I was employing here thank
you thank you for your talk I just
wanted to ask a couple questions about
the microtubules so first of all are the
microtubules found in the human brain
structurally different from you know
what is found in other parts of the
human body other cells yes that is that
is an important point
people used to bring that argument said
why isn't my liver intelligent or
something
yeah conscious most cells in the body
I think tend to be B lattice actually
certainly for a long time because people
observed with the transport of
organelles molecules with microtubules
and they always seem to be B lattices
and so they began to wonder are there
any a lattices the a lattice it also the
ones that come apart is a big role that
microtubules play is sometimes
disassembling and assembling and
oneself animals swim or only me but when
it grows it's it's what you call it pods
these things these things are produced
by a microtubule growing and the growing
and shrinking is done with B lattice
microtubules the a lattice ones are much
more stable and I'm not sure the status
of this at the moment but certainly
there if there was going to be any hope
of producing this coherence it had to be
a lattice of microtubules and when I
last consulted people about this island
about five or ten years ago there were
some known in some kinds of double there
weren't many anuses known but now I
think there are a lot known
so there are known a lattice is outside
of the human brain and other organisms I
really couldn't make a different
statement there but certainly the ones
in the brain have to be much more stable
they mustn't be the ones that come apart
and assemble and and they're in a
different kind of environment to the
stability there's that there was always
an argument people used to bring about
so colchicine see which which makes the
microtubules disassemble and so the
question is why doesn't that make you
unconscious when you've been treated for
gout which is what colchicine is used
for gout and and the thing is it doesn't
cross the blood-brain barrier and then
say well no we've injected these things
into their dogs and okay they they they
don't seem to lose consciously do become
demented but that's how do you know if a
demented dog is conscious or not so I
don't know I don't know the answer to
your question but I think the evidence
is that a lattice is an important
ingredient probably the environment how
are they structured and the fact that
they are stable structures which is what
happens in the brain and is very
different from the microtubule structure
you find in other cells you find them
all over even implants is not
necessarily animals microtubules I think
a lot of them are very different in
detail structure there but so far I mean
as far as we know a lattices are mostly
found within human brain
I would that's my belief but it's not I
haven't asked somebody who knows about
these things recently on that question
so a little cautious about that thank
you okay I have a question about a
different lecture you once gave on a
slightly different topic if that's okay
but it's a choice chime yes so you gave
this lecture about 15 years ago in
Ottawa in conjunction with MC Escher
exhibits you talked about a trip you
took to Italy and a number of
photographs you took of the same
landscapes he had painted and I was just
curious whether you had ever published
or written up some of the contents of
that lecture I'm supposed to be writing
a book is that the thing you're talking
about no sure once you gave in if you
don't remember it that's okay but it was
a really really good lecture I'll tell
you about it if you want thank you and I
enjoyed it so much I would really love
just to see it written up sometime
so that was my question it was on the
trip you had taken and you had
photographed a number of the same
locations that MC Escher had sketched
and you talked about his relationship
between some of his tessellated work and
Penrose tilings troubles I'm to write in
two other books at the moment that's
great please keep it up thank you so
assuming all right then human brain is
not reducible to computing machine but
physical development of human brain is
we understand now we don't understand it
very well but like human physical
development like doors have to thousands
a beginning
it's becomes this kind of computing
process which we as we described our
synthesis of proteins so given a
computing machine classical at curing
like what we have he has development of
proteins like DNA at the beginning and
very basic construction blocks atoms
magnetic so get computing machine
constructed on campus and machinist
ourselves as like to putting together
two of the other questions yes I think
that's right and I have nothing against
that and it maybe you can put something
together without knowing why it works
and that's without the understanding
could certainly be there and maybe by
putting together these ingredients that
these people are playing around with
maybe they don't have to be microtubules
there might be made of something else
and put them together and maybe
eventually something would would come
about which has this but it's going to
be a long haul and I don't see it
happening for a foreseeable period of
time because there's more so much which
you don't understand about what's going
on not just the complication but things
in principle and things which also a
sort of a heritage I mean if you're
going to start from scratch rather than
involving what has built up over over
many many many millennia in developing
from southern earlier creatures I mean
you there's a lot of my view
consciousness and understanding in
animals already which we're building
upon something else more than that but
something they're already wishes beyond
what we can do at the moment
yep thanks for coming I had a comment
and a question my comment was on the
chess problem you showed you talked
about how it was difficult to solve
computationally I think was the word to
use but of course it'd be easy to write
a program which could solve that chess
problem oh I've been cut off it's
difficult to solve using it's difficult
to solve using the usual yes look ahead
but it could be solved another course
that's the trouble with these things
after the event you can always make you
could say whenever you were given this
particular problem make this move you
see so so that's after the event you can
always make use of the understanding
there's somebody else is put into that
so I agreed but I think that one could
actually apply that kind of understand
George is agreeing with your general
point which so my question was this
girdle's theorem applies only to a
consistent system but human thinking is
notoriously inconsistent yeah so how do
you address that well that's the Turing
that was the Turing less out if you like
humans make mistakes my initial reaction
to that was that it's it's not really
the reason I mean because because you
know mathematicians make mistakes all
the time
from personal experience but the point
is that these mistakes are correctable
you can go back and see yes that was a
mistake you can see it was a mistake
these things are correctable mistakes it
has to be subtle unbuilt things that
you're completely blind to and never see
it okay I mean yeah these arguments I
talked about in shadows of the mind and
I get you know I don't want to look at
that book again but I do talk about
those things in the book whether you
think adequately or not you can have a
look and see what you think but
certainly making mistakes has to be
addressed and I agree with that I don't
think it's the answer and I think one
can make a good case that it's not the
answer could there be a blindness which
we can't see yeah but then that's also
addressed what kind of a bonus you see
yeah and sometimes the blindness is the
things that you don't see until you see
a contradiction you say that this is
gone off again when Bertrand Russell
produces this paradox there was this
magician who just finished his book and
this little thing about how it can
happen to somebody when it's ugly
point sounds narrow which undermines the
entire thing which in fact is what
happened but evidently he didn't see the
error in this even though he worked long
and hard on his book so there are
examples of that kind but still when
they're pointed out you can see the
errors it's a bit different still you
see these errors would have to do things
even when they're pointed out they're
unseeable to you but I try to address
this sort of question whether adequately
or not you have to look at it I'm not
gonna look at it I used to the fact that
recently and a baby and she's not six
months old
and I was pretty amazed about certain
things that I'm watching so for example
she has this happen now so she would
grab things and throw so that's the way
she plays
so recently we had a like a very heavy
object on the table and she tried to
first lift it as usually it usually does
but within one or two tries she
immediately realized that she can't lift
that so she had to tilt its side world
sideways and then pushed it from the
table phone back
so she accomplished a task that way and
that was with such little feedback
because she didn't have I mean she was
not cheating have any training in that
she was interact with anybody she
actually see us do it do it much but
somehow it came into her like that's
sort of how I guess human consciousness
is different from machine machine
consciousness wonderful yeah so
basically the training I mean without
training she could do that
and in some sense like so I've never so
basically when somebody pinches a
shinobi sort of to start rolling our
eyes and I sort of involuntarily in some
sense so some part of it is like
emotional about it some part of its
actually reacting to the physical world
around us so this is I guess I like you
really didn't going back to the child
thing some psychologists seem to think
that I mean babies learn true then sort
of interaction environment in some sense
they're conscious of who they are
will relative to the environment that
you're interacting with so it's kind of
like an order relative order that they
have wronged themselves so I mean your
thought you have any thoughts on that
yeah I'm quite happy to believe it comes
very early I'm just hearing recently
about some experiments that were done on
very young one-year-old basically I
think altogether between one two years
but these are one year olds and it had
to do with if you have an object and you
let's see and you move it somewhere then
they can see you know it's moved to and
so on and if someone else goes out of it
you put it underneath something see
suborn you put it underneath it above
you see and then someone else has seen
that goes out of the room and then when
they're out of the room you take it out
of that bowl and put it under another
bottle you see and then the other person
comes by and the child expects that
person child already knows it's under
the other book has it seen it there but
it expects the person who was out of the
room to look under the bowl that it was
been
previously and they see this by where
the child is looking can you look there
you see and so it's already putting
yourself in the mind of the of the adult
so it's very interesting to see how
these qualities which are regarded as
quite quite sophisticated right and
buzzing machine learning techniques we
talked a lot about training and yet like
for example my babies kiss she had no
training prior training prior knowledge
about this thing so it's someone came to
her somewhere I don't know where from
evolutionary instinct or hi thanks for
the talk I'm not very familiar with
quantum physics so perhaps this
questions a bit naive but I take it
you're saying that some kind of quantum
effects in the microtubules may be
helpful with these non computable
problems that you're pointing out and
perhaps rates consciousness and I was
wondering the microtubules are within
the cells how would these quantum
effects be communicated between cells
yes there may a lot of part I'm afraid I
was rather rush at the end and one point
I should have stressed which I didn't is
that it has to be a large-scale coherent
thing it's not individual microtubules
thinking about one has to talk about
quantum some kind of quantum state which
is global on the brain and this has to
do with the problem people talk about
which is the binding problem how is it
that somehow the brac of the brain seems
to act as a whole and and the
microtubules would simply have to
contribute to this global activity so
consciousness would would not be a thing
possessed by individual microtubules and
this is the thing that happens with
quantum mechanics of course with
superconductivity you it's not the
individual electrons it's it's the
quantum state as a whole which one has
to refer to now there was a second part
to your question which is I was
wondering the microtubules are within
cells yes how does it get up yes there
are several points here and again which
I didn't mention one is how does the
coherence how's it supposed to get out
into other neurons because if it's
global it's got to be many
your own activity well there are these
things quite distinct from ordinary
synapse junctions which are called gap
junctions which are much closer and
people puzzle for a long time what on
earth they were doing in fact there was
an earlier theory about quantum activity
in the brain which had to do with gap
junctions and so the idea is that this
quantum coherence has to propagate in
some sense through the gap junctions
it's not a it's not a synapse
propagation on the other hand they do
have to influence the strengths of
synapses because that after all is
what's controlling movement and so if I
move my hand like this is it's those
things doing it so you have to the basic
idea is that the strength of the
individual synapses must be coherently
controlled in some way which which is
this kind of quantum behavior but it has
a lot it has to the edge of quantum it's
not quantum mechanics as such because
that's computable you see it has to be
at the point where the state gets
reduced and then you ask how much
movement is there in the totality of the
microtube there's not nearly enough in
one microtubule for instance in the
totality of microtubules which might be
involved in some fork process and is
there enough coherent movement there to
involve the reduction of the quantum
state so to become some actual action so
this is the sort of thing that goes into
this model a lot of these things are
guesswork of course and vague and other
respects and so on but the general idea
seems to be plausible and certainly
encouraged by things like this thank you
ok again thanks for the talk and thanks
to Google for hosting it my question
might be related to the previous
question about humans not always been
being accurate and I believe you had
briefly mentioned potential contention
with the girdle argument about the
difference between discrete computation
and computation and I say it's related
to the question of humans being
inaccurate because one might claim that
human knowledge is not true and false it
actually is belief upon a spectrum of
truth and false and so I'm wondering
what insights you might have and how you
see the girdle
argument extending to well the usual the
usual argument which was actually put
for by Turing himself very early on was
to do with well continuous isn't such a
big deal because you can approximate it
to such a great precision that you might
as well be discrete and this I think is
what people of course do with with
computers these days or many photographs
and all sorts of devices depend on
digitizing and there's and there is a
lot of advantage putting it in digital
form but there is still a mathematical
problem about whether there is a
difference between the trouble with
competent with continuous computation is
as far as I'm aware and I think this is
still true
there is no theory comparable with the
standard Turing computable Turing posts
church computability notion where
different people came up with different
way of getting at it at church certainly
and riposte was very similar at airings
and girdles which was different and they
were all equivalent they were all shown
to be equivalent so there is just one
notion of discrete computability and
that's what we all accept wears for
continuous systems everybody comes up
with a different notion and they're in
equivalent and each one of them has some
problems connected with it and so it's a
bit of a mess as far as I can make out
the theory so it's much nicer if you can
assume that digitizing is OK in there
and get away with it so I'm happy enough
to take that stand although I have
certain qualms if I might could I ask do
you think that the quantum mechanics
might actually provide a mechanism of
actuated whatever a continuous algorithm
might be I think you raise a nice
question which I haven't fully studied
if there's the colleague I called Tim
Palmer who wrote it he's recently wrote
a paper in the Royal Society I think
where he has some idea of getting around
things to do with bells inequality you
know the nonlocality
having kana mechanics by invoking
basically this difference between the
continuous and the discrete and using
certain discrete models you can get
around these things and so on I haven't
fully understood it but certainly he has
tried to explore this difference and
whether there is an importance in them
and I think it's something which needs
attention
so yeah it's in my view it's not a it's
not a closed book thank you very much
hello Sopranos my question is again
related to you know the consciousness in
children so it's it's been kind of
noticed that when kids grow up what was
the case I miss what you said oh I'm
just saying that my question is related
to the notion of self and consciousness
in children yeah so it's it's been kind
of notice that when kids grow up they
don't refer to themselves in the first
person they kind of think of themselves
in the third person did at a point in
their development you know five or six
years they kind of flip and they say
that okay I thought in my young son he
he had great deal of difficulty with
this you and I business stuff you can
understand it's funny it's a funny it's
a slightly odd thing he changed the use
of them right so my - my question is how
much of you think how much of that do
you think is intrinsically there in a
you know human being at birth and it's
kind of social triggers which releases
that versus how much of you think is
kind of influence which you know leads
to that development this is a big day
but it's the prj on the one side
well-known psychologist whether whether
it's whether the sort of grammar is is
getting built to it to our thinking or
whether it's all kind of I think my
guess would be somewhere in between that
we get some for each that there is
something in build about an awful lot of
it depends on on the environment and how
you grow up and again one of these
programs I heard on the radio recently
had to do with this had to do with
distinguishing sounds that apparently
very young children less than a year are
able to distinguish lots of different
kinds of sounds but as they grow up they
get they kind of lose this ability it's
because the ambient language that
they're used to doesn't distinguish
between certain sounds and others that
are crucial and those ones which are
crucial the child retains and the other
ones tend to get get weighed down
whereas in a different culture it's
different ones and and so it's very much
that's something which certainly
involves a very cultural thing depends
how you're brought up and so on but
nevertheless then probably some
overriding aspect to all this which is
inbuilt so I'm sure it's a mixture of
those things</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
