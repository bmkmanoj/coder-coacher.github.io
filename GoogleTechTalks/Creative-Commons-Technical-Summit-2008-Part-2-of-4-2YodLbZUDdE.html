next panel on digital asset management
on the web and on the desktop we're very
pleased to have three different or three
presentations as part of this three
speakers so we're going to have a little
five to ten minute presentations and
then there'll be a time for discussion
and questions from the audience so our
first speaker on this panel is Gunnar
pentakus from Adobe and he is well I'll
let him tell you he's gonna talk about
so thank you hi everyone
I'm very happy to be here very excited
about participating with Creative
Commons it's something that I've been
evangelizing within Adobe we've lost
five years four years we even invited
Larry to come out and talk to two Adobe
which was great I'm gonna talk about XMP
metadata it's a technology that we have
from Adobe for embedding metadata into
files it's a it's a pretty lengthy
presentation and it's going to be
available on the web as well but I
wanted to go through there first of all
let me get an understanding how many
people have heard of XMP or know of it
so about well that's pretty good about
half maybe a little bit more in half 67%
so this is a presentation I give to a
lot of Adobe's customers and also
partners and and talking about what what
is metadata I think everybody knows what
that is here why we need it you know
here's a list of things that are
happening in the need for what we call
intelligent media which is assets that
are effectively tagged richly and have
information associated with them and the
bottom line is you know everybody's
getting overloaded with assets and
metadata is becoming a strategic
advantage because fundamentally if you
can't describe it and add information to
the asset you really can't control the
asset in many different respects another
way that I pitch metadata and sometimes
app to to think back on is imagine if
your files could talk and you can
actually have a conversation with your
files and I think a lot of the
interesting ideas that are coming around
with the semantic technologies and so on
is really kind of building that
foundation of communication that we are
eventually gonna have with our files
right tell me you know who you're from
and tell me a little bit more about him
or her and tell me about the rights can
I use you can I not
where were you used
things like that who else are you
related to so all that web eNOS is going
to be coming with with the Semantic Web
a lot of fundamental technologies an XMP
is based on a lot of that technology as
well so we call it a platform because it
for many different reasons one is it
provides a vehicle for carrying
information through the files themselves
and it's also supported within the suite
of our products I'm not going to go into
each one of these b-but they stand on
their own when we were looking at
developing this back in the turn of the
century we we we wanted to identify some
key requirements there and some of these
were mentioned earlier and some of the
other discussions and some questions
came up about you know different
languages and so on robustness the key
feature about XMP is we put the data in
the file we built on standards RDF and
XML serialization of rdf we have it's
very extensible fundamentally XMP is
schema neutral so you can put whatever
type of schema that you want meaning
whatever type of data you want to carry
in the file universality we're always
striving to add more file formats and
support more file formats where we can
where we can actually define where to
stick the metadata in the file
fundamentally we believe that's where it
needs to be because that's where the for
of the file goes the data should go with
it internationalization you know Unicode
capabilities which a lot of our
customers such as the IPTC for example
which is a strong standard in the
newspaper and photography world adopted
XMP as their as their platform for their
new standard because it supported
multilingual capabilities and that was
important for them as they start
thinking about the Olympics and China
and so on and so on
so when we sort of step back and say
well what is XMP it's a lot of different
things right we've talked about the
packaging technology I'm gonna go into
each one of these very quickly to give
you an example of what this is about so
when we talk about the packet this is
basically the way that we put the
metadata in the file it's pretty simple
right it's jamming XML into a file
format and we do it in such a way that
one you know we have this unique
identifier at the top of the packet that
says hey I'm a packet there's some
metadata coming and then we have this
XML chunk RDF slash XML chunk which is
where all that goodness lives and then
we lead a bit leave a bit of padding
there the reason we do that is there may
be another process downstream that may
not necessarily know about the file type
per se and wants to add additional
metadata and so that there's a padding
space that you can throw in some
additional information and then finally
the end so it's it's pretty
straightforward and simple in terms of
how we use it in our products we we use
it across you know the Adobe products
Photoshop and so on and we add we add
the metadata in the file formats
themselves so it's very simple in the
sense of a picture or it's one file you
add information to the picture when you
start talking about you know an InDesign
layout and different assets coming
together we start to build a structure
where we need to support what we call
document level metadata and object level
metadata and so where we have that those
capabilities in in InDesign and our goal
is fundamentally to preserve as much
metadata as we can across the production
chain because it's going to be useful
down the road somebody's going to want
to know where this stuff came from and
what are the rights associated with it
and so on so from the specification
perspective the schema perspective the
Adobe tools themselves have a set of
schemas that they look to and a
standardized upon in terms of what
information flows through the tool set
so there you know rights based
information media information a lot of
Camera Raw information for how to
describe the changes to the camera raw
file things like that we also work a lot
with external standards groups because
they're excited about XMP because this
is a vehicle for them to get their
standard implemented into a set of tools
and we've worked you know as I mentioned
closely with the IPTC a number of
different groups here including Creative
Commons plus advertising add ID for you
know
associating metadata to advertising
chunks and so on
all the way to archive the interesting
thing about this is you start looking at
this it's a workflow that captures
metadata from capture you know from when
the photography takes a photographer
takes a picture out through archive
through the workflow and and that's what
we're we're trying to promote some
interoperability throughout the workflow
with the with our tool set in terms of
how the user interacts with the metadata
we have what we call custom panels this
is basically a dialog box within the
Adobe products that you can customize to
show a UI that's related to your
particular schema and define things such
as this is a drop-down list or a text
box or you know a bag of values or so on
so you can describe the user readable
label also the layout and the storage
how this stuff is actually stored in the
XML that's embedded in the file and the
good good news is that you know with the
cs4 products coming out this is actually
going to be moving to be a flex based
interface so if you're a flex developer
you now have a very rich interface that
you can tap into that's not only static
but also can connect to web services and
so on and so this this becomes really
interesting and instant becomes more
like active metadata rather than just
static metadata we also have a media
organizer within our suite called bridge
which has some capabilities for showing
metadata I'm not going to get into much
into this but it's also very extensible
using flash and so on so probably the
most exciting thing I think for the
community is is the fact that we have an
SDK that's freely available under a BSD
license and what this SDK does is allow
you to read and write metadata in a
consistent way in multiple file formats
and it lists listed some of them here
these this is this SDK is actually the
same set of libraries that we use in our
Adobe products and the reason we did
that is we wanted to make sure that our
partner community and the community in
general was reading and writing
relating metadata in the same way that
our tools are so that we have
consistency in that respect and that's
available from Debbie from our Adobe URL
here so in terms of a platform we have
you know a lot of partners that we work
with that have supported XMP and this is
where it gets to the original you know
asset management has this relate to
asset management well XMP is really a
communication technology that our
partners our asset management partners
can use to link between our desktop
applications and their back-end systems
through the media that's flowing between
the between the two so in many ways you
know I keep I've been calling some Pina
communication technology because it's it
carries the information in the file
wherever that fall goes it's a list of
partners that we use publishing partners
and online vendors and so on and so you
know going forward we're always looking
at the lifecycle of of assets and media
and and how metadata can play a role in
the reuse there you know remix thing the
mashups whatever of that and how to have
a consistent communication platform
across that lifecycle from multiple for
multiple uses and so you know from a
business perspective you know I think
there are a number of opportunities
around efficiency rights is definitely
becoming a big issue both for Creative
Commons and also CC plus you know we've
had conversations about you know
offering the the commerce side of it as
well and how to do that in a consistent
way and you know fundamentally the great
thing about metadata I always call it
it's sort of the technology the possible
you could do whatever you want with it
and I think there's going to be more and
more opportunities coming up to take
advantage of this communication channel
between it that's in the asset itself
and so I invite you if you're a
developer check out the SDK start using
it give me feedback and and that's it
are there any questions
great we can take questions at the end
after it is as well come as a group
thanks Gunnar for being here and talking
about that so Steven is gonna arms
yes Stevens guys speak next from
songbird and while they're switching out
computers I just wanted to mention that
something it's kind of been hinted at
but not really it said directly both by
grounder and Ashish is that and been a
little bit - I guess so if you read the
CC rail paper there's a section not only
on HTML but also on other media types
and XMP is the sort of concrete
expression that we recommend
recommending for a lot of these
different content types because it's
freely licensed and made available
appropriately and because it is
extensible and it meets sort of our sort
of what we identified as priorities for
being able to be extended and be
standards-based and that sort of thing
and so we're happy to have Gunnar here
today talking about that some more I'm
actually kind of curious says how many
people have heard of songbird wow that's
pretty good now for the follow up how
many people actually use songbird it
seems about right all right so for the
people that haven't heard of it or for
the people that I know are just dying
for us to get to one oh so that they can
start using it real quick just in one
slide what a songbird songbirds a
cross-platform media player were built
on the Mozilla stack our whole goal and
our message has been that we're going to
be a media player for the web we're
gonna play all the multimedia content
that you can find on the web and we're
gonna make it look like there's no
differentiation between remote content
versus your local content so because
we're built on Mozilla we got a lot of
cool extensibility it's super easy to
customize extensions and skins and all
sorts all sorts of open api's to extend
them songbird go from the client side
and from the web side and I'll show an
example that in a little bit
it so there's a lot of there's been a
lot of talk about metadata and that's
really all I'm going to talk about here
but you know back in the days when we
had vertical silos of communities like
the AOL community and the CompuServe
community and Delphi and prodigy where
you had a service provider that
controlled all the content that went on
there it was obvious where the content
came from who was delivering it who
owned the copyright and things like that
AOL could vet everything that went onto
AOL's network CompuServe could vet
everything that went on the computer's
network that becomes less so these days
right
where you have this huge massive
internet and those vertical silos of
content are now gone and just very
CompuServe is still alive apparently in
some small little portion of AOL so our
message has been we play the web we
connect any web service any website to
any device so that's that's what we want
to be sort of getting there now but what
are some of the problems so like I
mentioned you know in in this slide
there's a lot of the Internet's huge
there's a lot of content on the internet
and there's a lot of problems with
metadata on that content it's it can be
inconsistent it could be incorrect
it could be non-existent how many people
you don't have to name your names but
how many people download torrent files
of new albums and things like that and
you see like the comment field is like
ripped by hacker teens or something like
that right it's it's annoying like you
get this you get this content with
really lame or incorrect metadata and
that's why we have a ton of services
like free DB musicbrainz Gracenote all
those things that become metadata
repositories places for you to get the
correct metadata so this is the problem
with a lot of the content on the web and
if our message is we want to get that
content and put it into your library and
display it next to your local content
you know you've gone to all these great
lengths to tag and correct your metadata
for your local files to make sure
they're all correct
and you want to you want to be able to
make sure those propagate cleanly to all
your local files that you can tag remote
media files as well there's also the
problem of subjective versus universal
metadata I downloaded some mp3s the
other day where the genre was best song
ever like that's completely subjective
right there's a lot of people in America
that feel you know Britney Spears is the
best song ever I disagree strongly so
you know like that that sort of metadata
it's it's correct in the sense that
you're describing your data right
metadata is a way for you describe your
data there there's a ton of songs I
would easily go through and tag all my
Weezer songs best song ever
but it's subjective so we need to be
able to apply subjective metadata that
maybe doesn't get propagated to the file
that you know when you send it to all
your other all your friends they're not
necessarily going to want to see that
and then there's also the issue of a
non-standard or unsupported metadata so
metadata fields that no other player is
currently using or supporting and
metadata is useless if people can't see
it right so this is my last slide I'm
not very big on slides but so what are
some of the things songbird is working
on so where we've been working with
Creative Commons recently to build in
the license support into the metadata
for id3 tags and ape tags and augggh
techs and all those so we're we actually
followed the Creative Commons spec they
have on their wiki and we integrated
that or we made a bunch of patches to
tag Lib which is a really common open
source tagging library that a lot of
media players like I know em rock and
songbird use it I believe rhythm box
does as well so we built a bunch of
patches for that for license information
working on propagating those back
upstream into tag Live 2.0 some of the
other things that we've been trying to
do are connecting the user
that's consuming the content back to the
content creator or the origin so when
you download a file from let's say
ccmixter or jamendo or magnitude being
what it connects you back to the artist
page of magnitude or being able to
ultimately connect you back to the
artists website themselves so right now
we're doing the first thing where were
able to can't connect you back to the
site that you downloaded the music from
and we're working on ways to do the
other one of the other things that we
want to do is make the user aware of
license and copyright information and
this is something that not a lot of
media players are doing right now
I think if she's mentioned rhythm box
might be it's something where we're
definitely trying to do you know media
players can play a lot of legal content
as well as legal content we're driving
very hard to make sure that the user is
aware of what their content is and I
mean we get users coming in to IRC
channel all the time like can I use
longer to download illegal files and
we're like well yeah you can it's it's a
web browser much like you can use your
car to crash into someone and kill
someone I mean yeah it's a tool whatever
you're gonna use it for it's kind of up
to you but users have that heightened
awareness that you know there is a legal
versus legal content and we want to
distinguish between the different
licenses and how they're using that and
consuming that content so one of the
things that songbird does is it scrapes
web pages for content for audio content
and eventually video content on that web
page right now it's really really simple
and just looks for like supported files
like mp3s logs flax things like that
we're trying to make it extensible now
so that we can do really cool things
like parse microformat information or
you know RDF a is for the CC rel stuff
would be really cool and then display
that license information that may be on
the web page and not actually embedded
in the file itself but parse it and then
display it next to the media file in the
web playlist that we pop up I'll show
this I'll show a demo
a little bit and then eventually we
could propagate that back to the file so
that it can be actually embedded in the
file itself if the format supports it
and this is again you know just making
the user aware of license information
about the media content that consuming
we've tossed around some other not quite
fully baked ideas generic meta data
repositories being able to have metadata
repositories for license information
concert event info album art I mean it's
it's super extensible right now you've
got to make a provider for every single
repository so we have a last.fm
repository and a mg repository and
they're tied into this full extension
mechanism and we want to just make that
into some generic you know where you can
just describe your event repository in
an XML format let's say and drop it in
and then the user can just drop in
whatever repositories they want for
their content to be checked against and
then one of the other things that
obviously has a media player we could
really do is for helping users correct
their metadata is doing some acoustic
fingerprinting stuff which is something
we we've done a mock-up but it's not
been really great and what we want to do
is just be able to put that into the
background so when the user is idle
where which is actually the use case for
a lot of media players where people
started up play music minimize it and
then go start doing the rest of their
work and you know in this age of quad
core you know multi-threaded multi-core
CPUs where we have a web browser and a
text editor up and you don't really need
those other three cores we could be
doing useful stuff like acoustic
fingerprinting matching that up against
musicbrainz information stuff like that
so before just wanted to show songbird
real quick so I know when I was talking
about the web playlist thing that kind
of I saw some eyes glaze over but I'm
gonna pull up jamendo and I know a good
friends from jamendo are here so I hope
your websites up otherwise I'm gonna be
embarrassed
so jamendo is like a totally great
example of you know a site with a ton of
Creative Commons license
content that works really well in
songbird and what they've done right now
is they've made some specific API calls
for describing content and license
information that songbird can then
propagate so see when we go to like this
page right here
and I'm on a shrunken screen so those
things kind of contract it a little bit
but you can see this is popping up this
whole web playlist area where I've got
download buttons I can download this
content into my library I can play it
directly from like from the webpage
itself
there's share buttons and what jamendo
is doing that I don't think any of our
other I've not seen any other website
use is they're displaying the license
information the Creative Commons
licenses right here right next to the
track and currently in this version of
songbird that I built last week
we're not propagating this license
information back into the file and what
we want to be doing is propagating that
back in so that when I play this track
outside of the jamendo web page I'm
aware of that when I send this track to
someone else that license information is
embedded such that everyone can see this
and that will propagate easily because
definitely one of the things that
songbird does as a media player and a
web browser is it lets you mash up all
sorts of cool content off the web like
when I go and start playing something in
my library I see if I have this
extension loaded that's what this works
Nathan gave me bad vibes about live
demos now I'm all nervous come on work
right so like this this is an example of
an extension that's pulling a ton of
content from all sorts of various
websites so like last.fm Flickr it's I'm
playing Bad Religion right now and it's
grabbing you know concert info from
last.fm about Bad Religion Flickr photos
YouTube artist bio from Wikipedia lyrics
from lyric wiki and tags and stuff so
like it's all sorts of disparate web
sources all coming into my media player
and one thing that's noticeably missing
is license information right like I
could see the Flickr one if I click on
it and pop up that Flickr page what
would be really cool is a uniform way to
if these web pages provide that sort of
license information by microformat or
RDF or whatever then we could then be
aware of that and display that you know
in a tooltip or however over or
something like that so that's all I have
I'll turn it over to Lucas
thanks Steven
so our final speaker of this panel is
Lukas konzi and he formerly of Yahoo
Fame I'm not maybe he's gonna tell us
what he's doing now but I'll turn it
over to him and many friends who are
here web so he sure
oh there we go we'll be not online no
I've got a weird imperator extension all
right so but right now I'm not working
for anybody I'm taking a summer off and
having fun I'm just gonna talk about
something that's interesting to me and
let me let me just use the the real Mike
it's fine but thanks all right so this
presentation is on my website Gon's comm
slash web of songs and let me point out
that this is kind of this hand hacked
side where I made and you're welcome to
modify this and improve it it's a very
simple and easy to do and Emacs friendly
alright so the context to this
conversation is about making music a
first-class region of the web and and
and and this kind of is related to asset
management and curation in in the
following sense that we can assume or I
assume that if music is web year then
all sorts of web technology that manages
curation is going to become useful
without any music specific work so the
music specific work is to kind of
transpose the whole musical world into
the web and that involves a variety of
things in particular two general types
of activities one is developing web
technology that supports music so for
example our group that developed X SPF
created a webby playlist form
and that was kind of web work to support
music but there's another way of
thinking about these this work and that
is adapting musical practices so the
music people who deal specifically with
music do a lot of things that are kind
of make it less Webby for example I
would kind of think of pure peer
protocols as being unwed II and and I
would try to move music away from
file-sharing networks that don't use web
protocols so so here's my proposal that
I'm going to talk about in this in my
ten minutes here and that is that there
should be a good URL for each and every
song and I mean one good URL for every
song so there are this is kind of a
loaded proposition with a lot of little
pieces let's be specific on what the
pieces are comprehensiveness every song
out there should have a URL and and and
actually as it happens this this is this
is an ongoing thing that nobody needs to
really get involved in in making happen
over the last five years or so pretty
much everything has been ripped and is
being uploaded somewhere courtesy of a
lot of different projects and the kind
of a law of the digital world that
everything gets digitized and steeps
onto the internet somehow or other so
that's that's coming on pretty well and
in this talk I'm gonna talk about unique
identifiers I'm sorry that there should
be a single good URL for each song and
I'm not going to talk about the
stability of URLs of songs because we
all know that song songs on the web come
and go constantly these are bad URLs
they pop into existence and disappear
after a week and that's no good but I'm
not gonna talk about that here but but I
just want to repeat this proposition
songs should have URLs no no I'm serious
about that I'm not kidding
and every song should have a URL and
there should only be one and
and then we get a little bit meta and
and and point out this is a way of
thinking about Internet and music
technology that people who are
interested in it that you might want to
you might want to consider this this
this way of approaching internet music
is being different and more productive
than I've been working on BitTorrent
which is kind of fundamentally unready
okay so so we're talking about the
uniqueness of URLs for songs that is to
say the proposition is a song should
have one URL and and you think about the
current state of things that it couldn't
be less true that each song has one URL
let's say there's a hit song in the in
the world of mp3 bloggers that means
every single mp3 blogger rips their own
CD puts it on a server gives it a
different URL and then takes it down
after a week and then some of these end
up on file-sharing networks maybe some
of them more on student accounts to last
for six months and and fall apart one of
them is on the record company say the
record company may actually have the
song on their site it's probably on
MySpace if it's the hit it's all over
the place and this causes a real problem
in terms of bringing the benefits of web
enos to the music world because I you
can't you can't accumulate link count
inbound link count and all the other
supporting technology that makes the web
work for text for blogs for photographs
in a lot of ways because people
generally will deep link to a photograph
rather than make a copy of it and that's
a good thing for the web as a whole
because then you have extra links points
same photograph it indicates context
semantics popularity all sorts of
goodness it's kind of nutritious for the
space that photography comes from the
practice of deep linking and of sharing
deep links and this doesn't apply to
music and the reason is everybody
invents a new song every time they have
start a new conversation I'm sorry
everybody invents a new link for the
same song every time they start a
different conversation about that song
so this is it that was a long-winded way
of talking about something that is
described in the web architecture
document this way that dividing the web
of related resources is harmful let me
point out this is that this is in the
web architect principles of web
architecture and and what we're doing on
a practical level here is taking stuff
out of good practice good web
development practice and applying it to
music we're just simply saying no no
music related practices should be the
good ones and not the bad ones kind of
raising expectations in a way so web
architecture describes us in terms of
Metcalfe's law network the benefits of
network effects and that seems a little
more new-agey than I'd like it but I
think it is clear enough ok so why
aren't we reusing song URLs for reasons
number one there's a taboo against deep
linking to your third-party mp3s this
isn't universally shared but is widely
shared and a lot of people will get
really mad at you they'll call it hot
linking hot linking is if it made them
hot under the collar it's just the
weirdest little you know social thing
there's also a kind of an atmosphere of
fear uncertainty and doubt about good
linking practice as it applies to music
in particular because the music industry
is having a difficult time making this
transition and and and so you know most
people think that music is illegal by
default and and therefore URLs a normal
URL is is is a is a broken way of
dealing with music on the web I mean I
mean she says most people feel that URLs
that are straight up as they apply to
music are illegal and and you couldn't
sell them you could spend 45 minutes
talking to your English teacher about
this and she would not believe you
nothing you could say that would
convince her number number two one of
the reasons why there is so much
duplication of URLs relatively minor one
but it's
that anytime you have a different media
format you're gonna apply a different
you're gonna provide a different URL so
let's say you have the wave version and
the mp3 version you're gonna have one at
dot mp3 and one it dot wave gives you
two URLs and and the reason that you're
doing this is that that HTTP content
negotiation which allows for this
specific way of splitting the namespace
into redundant URLs that you know apply
to the same abstract object the song a
different set of identifiers is the
specific URLs without mp3 or WAV that
that's happening because the content
negotiation features of HTTP haven't
been broadly adopted and and-and-and-and
don't seem to have momentum towards
becoming adopted it's a very obscure
part of HTTP in this part and and
there's so there's some very practical
web work that could be done to improve
adoption of content negotiation
number three complementary activities
workaround provisioning bottleneck what
I mean here is the main practice of
music related activities on the web is
for complimentary activities such as
writing about music such as such as kind
of accumulating digital identity so for
example you take a an act you like put
their song on your on your MySpace page
and you kind of do it as a form of
clothing so if you think about this that
the Dana Boyd quote is culture in
identity out you take in you know
artifacts of culture and you put them
out as parts of your identity I like
Puccini and that makes me refined right
so so that's a complementary activity
and in order to practice any of those
complementary activities on the web with
relation to music you have to find the
URL you're so you have to find that file
yourself and put on the website yourself
you're going to have to do your own
provisioning so in doing your own
provisioning you're always going to have
to create
new URL hence there's this endless
minting of redundant URLs for the same
songs long-winded makes sense a number
for few pure-play provisioning sources
this is kind of another way of saying
the previous item but it is that there's
very little web activity related to
providing songs almost nobody really
provides songs it's a lousy business and
what people provide is social networking
identity commentary annotation but those
are the products the songs are there as
a compliment and and there's almost
nobody who does really does provisioning
and archive.org does provisioning when
YouTube YouTube in some capacity exports
media and and as could be thought of as
being in a pure provisioning business
and there are a couple other contexts
but basically nobody does pure-play
provisioning and and as a result there's
an endless splitting of the number of
provisioning sources and minting of new
redundant urls so alright last slide all
right so what can we do about these
issues here I'm just I'm just gonna pull
some things out of the air and and and I
sort of I sort of want to plant in your
mind more than the specifics of these
arguments this way of thinking about
music that you'll raise your
expectations of the music industry and
expect it to just do the same to have
the same good practices as every other
part of the internet and and and these
so all these things sort of flow from
that expectation so what can we do about
fixing these things these are kind of
you know novel ideas but one idea is you
centralize the sole sourcing and this I
what I what this idea is there should be
a single source for each media item as
much as possible but anybody can be that
single source
and and we should develop technologies
and practices to make that possible so
for example you are a label and you put
out a CD you then host all the songs in
that CD and all the format's anybody is
gonna like and you and you manage
distribution of those songs web wide
using technology and business practices
for example you might have a big list of
accepted referrers you might say bobs
bobs blog can direct link to the song
and Mary's blog can might say we're
gonna allow YouTube and other video
sites to use the song and remixes by
accepting that as referer header and
letting YouTube use smile to do
client-side remix this and put together
the movies on the fly recognize this is
kind of a pretty far-out piece of
technology I'm kind of making up on the
fly but the point being that that you
can actually you can you can do a lot of
creative hacking and and business work
to allow song URLs to become more and
more focused on single providers and
let's say it's Matador Matador could
just run the web server for you know
this one song on their album and there's
a lot we could do to make it possible so
it's kind of wacky but it's an
interesting space to be in and it would
have a direct impact on this on this
problem and make music web ear and make
recommendations lat work better and all
these other things that are genuinely
good number two content resolution
content resolution is a as an idea from
from X SPF and and what this is about is
that you would have dynamic the this the
the representation of the resource that
is the song would be picked up
dynamically at runtime and it would and
they and the description of of what you
need to know in order to do that fetch
would be the static
things so there's a document contains
metadata metadata is kind of a query it
says this title of this song is more or
less like this you know hit me baby one
more time with misspellings or whatever
that's going to be and a runtime we're
gonna do a search and we'll figure out
what URL to use to actually find the
song and that back-end URL changes all
the time we expect it to you know we
expect those things to fuzz in and out
of existence
but at some point somewhere somebody's
hosting hit me baby one more time and
and so we're gonna map between those two
things
content resolution is a kind of
client-side thing it says what's
persistent is the query the query string
and the information content that allows
you to map a user desire a user thought
I want that song into a specific URL
that gets turned into a specific set of
bytes PCM bytes get mapped into speakers
right so this is a query that's
persistent it gets carried away it's
kind of a pure technology and lastly pax
romana and let me just say pax romana is
by far the most likely thing to happen
here because it always happens in our
industry and that is there's one or two
winners everybody accepts it and and any
any truth that doesn't come from the one
or two winners is unstable and
unreliable and and we and we embrace it
so for example it could be that the
there that that I know there's there's
some enormous industry player that's
extremely stable and it's capable
provisioning songs with relatively
stable URLs and all the other URLs are
kind of winking out of existence so
rapidly that nobody wants to use them
and so everybody converges on using this
one major vendor let's say we're talking
about Rhapsody and Rhapsody is providing
a link for stairway to heaven and it
works pretty reliably and even though
rhapsodes a kind of pain yes over the
years that one link persists and anybody
who posts their own rip of stairway to
heaven on their mp3 blog like that link
is no good it's gone in a week so
nobody links to it so rap city and ends
up becoming the canonical source of
stereo to heaven this is kind of how our
industry works in a lot of ways and it's
it's not a great theme and it's really
not a good thing about our industry and
and that is the that's the likely
solution cuz it'll happen naturally it's
a few dominant vendors are able to
provide stable urls those are the ones
that'll survive that's it for me the URL
of this page is Gon's com slash web of
songs you're welcome to to hack the
source of this presentation it's very
packable easy as pie and that's it
thanks a lot thanks a lot Lucas so we
are we actually need to move along so we
may have time for a couple questions
while we're switching computers we can
take those for the panel and maybe we
can have other further discussions in
the hallway or at lunch so are there any
questions for any of our panelists while
Mike is setting up doesn't the sole
sourcing model creative real asymmetry I
mean in the sense that they will be in a
one source or one resource or one song
with essentially enormous control over
that kind of content once everyone has
converged on the URL I mean there is
some Beauty to redundancy because it
makes the whole thing much less
enforceable and doesn't lead to this
enormous power shift
I actually see that as a as a benefit
could everybody hear that okay so okay
so this is this is a very central issue
that the decentralized sole sourcing
solution gives a lot of power to whoever
owns that URL and and and the amount of
power can potentially be destructive so
so I would say that I think that's
actually that's a that's a benefit of
that approach that that we'd say that
rather than chasing copiers all over the
internet that the data publisher of
somebody who a rights holder would
manage their relations with the with the
Internet
but by controlling access to the URL and
there was extensive technical tools for
access control and it's a pretty good
toolkit and it would be kind of a less
confrontational crazy you know less
legalistic way of managing control and
so maybe a more constructive environment
I kind of like that aspect of it but you
don't have to like it because it you
know it's just it's one idea of how to
do it so we actually need to move along
to our next talk I'm really sorry that
we don't have more questions because I
have interesting thoughts about all
three of our presentations but so I
thank our panelists for being here today
and up next is Michael inks fair who's
going to give a talk about kind of
setting the stage for our afternoon
panel about digital copyright registry
technologies technology landscapes
challenges and opportunities Thanks I'll
go fast because this is going to be
fuzzier as you can see from the
landscape
and I'm between you and lunch so
everybody knows what this is it's a
hammer and sickle symbol of communism
Bill Gates called Creative Commons
coming us a few years ago but that was
he was wrong about that anyway what do
you think this is it could be a stylized
hammer hammer and sickle but does
anybody recognize what it is it is the
symbol of the US Copyright Office which
runs a registry so why do I bring this
up because I'm not casting aspersions on
the US Copyright Office at least not
right now
this is a statement from the Creative
Commons frequently asked questions that
was launched with the launch of Creative
Commons I pulled it from the Internet
Archive useful service and you can tell
from the timestamp in that URL from just
some December 16 2002 you can read it
and here's the full context it's
Creative Commons building a database of
licensed content absolutely not we
believe and then that's not a
centralized soviet-style information
bank control West single organization
and the rest of it describes basically
the this stuff that you heard about this
morning and that we've actually been
building for the last five years so why
talk about digital copyright registries
right now well there are a bunch of
reasons but first I want to tell you
this so one reason that a lot of people
are talk are thinking about copyright
registries and things like this although
in and that has kind of a downstream
effect of people asking Creative Commons
is because of not this which is a
picture of Wharf of orphan rock in
Australia but people are talking a lot
about orphan works and this is actually
not an orphan work in fact we know who
took that photo and it
in a database of powerhouse museum and
in Sydney I believe another reason to
start talking about copyright rarity
she's now
and I couldn't believe how good of a
segue Lucas's presentation was is the
the kind of yin and yang of
centralization and decentralization we
we now have met probably many many
millions of CC licensed works and not to
speak of the billions of cultural works
on the web that are published in a
decentralized manner but all the
centralization often creates opportunity
to opportunity for centralization to
pull out the value that's been created
and in a decentralized way and Google is
the primary example of this we've
created more value through
centralization of stuff that's published
on the web than anybody else and
obviously a right and the reason why
Lucas's talk was so perfect for this is
he wants to have a unique URL for every
song on the web but then what's his
prediction about how that's going to
actually happen pax romana a couple of
one or two big players are actually the
preferred providers so a bunch of other
reasons those are just two that I
quickly found in pictures of and orphan
works are definitely not the primary
reason there's decentralization and
centralization there's the need for
provenance this this is also kind of a
symptom of our great success that know
there are millions of works available
and more prominent users want to make
use of those works but they need to they
need to know more than just somebody on
the web has said that you can use this
with attribution but but who and what
are other rights that go along with the
work for example in this particular
context a good reason to talk about
registries is that registry like
functionality
is a good aspiration and framing for the
technologies that we're building even if
nobody ever builds a registry the kind
of things that you expect a registry to
be able to do you ought to be able to do
on the web if if the technologies that
we've been talking about have been
successful then what they're simply a
bunch of people doing work in this area
many startups some that are explicitly
building registries you'll hear from
some in a minute or a per lunch some are
accidentally building registries as a
side effect of what they're doing or
maybe it's not so accidental and then
there are four and nonprofit efforts
leading in the registry direction and
finally because of all this people keep
on one keep on asking what what is they
didn't read the FAQ five five years ago
actually though that's no longer in the
fact and we've learned a lot in the last
five years so who knows whether so we're
at an exploratory stage and people want
to know what we're going to do so this
is the this meeting is really the
beginning of that exploration so then
right so in case you don't know
copyright copyright law and the in the
u.s. registration was has was required
up until 1978 I believe although
remember I'm not a lawyer and I'm gonna
go through really quickly because we're
short on time so one problem is that and
this is one of many changes that that
really is a recent Creative Commons
exists is that 1978 copyright became
automatic you no longer needed to
register to register so instantly
whatever problems a registry had before
1978 the problems got much bigger
because a tiny fraction of things are in
fact copyrighted are
or in the registry and for what it's
worth you can see the kind of volume
that the Copyright Office does 500,000
registrations in 2005 they have
electronic filing now in beta I think I
think I read someplace on one other side
they have registered like 33 million
works in the couple hundred year history
which sounds like a big number until you
think about web-scale and if you're not
saying about billions it's still pretty
small which means Creative Commons is
still pretty small though we're
inflecting all the time so what makes a
digital copyright registry as opposed to
just a registry which is basically you
ship a National Library Copyright Office
some stuff and you know with a little
bit of documentation and it's on some
paper and maybe a researcher can uh can
look it up
well digitally digital copyright
registry obviously all if the interfaces
are digital presumably you can deposit
the digital work you can do the kind of
queries that you can do against digital
works it doesn't require hiring a
researcher to go and look up stuff in a
car catalog all right think much more
interestingly digital copyright
registries early says you'll see in the
stuff that's that's emerging or not
necessarily defined or primarily
motivated by registration meaning here's
a work I want to establish that I'm the
copyright holder or I basically
documented in some sense but there are a
whole bunch of different use cases that
are resolving an effective registries
being built and then typical web stuff
it's you know gonna be at scale
typically even if it's within a
particular genre it's going to be global
of course the US Copyright Office is
specific to the u.s. there are various
other national libraries but you expect
the web to be global even if you're
targeting speakers of a particular
language you're gonna have users all
over the place
so where's the demand coming from for
these various registry like things
obviously user generate content upload
filtering a lot of people once that some
are good and some are bad but it's
certainly creating a demand to be able
to recognize content license
management's one way of thinking about
this is digital asset management in that
we had a the last panel was in part in
part on user meaning that that's within
large organizations that are managing
lots of UGC lots of content deals they
be there's kind of internal needs to
create applications that are effectively
become registries so that just so they
don't have to get a license twice for
the same content if nothing else user
media organization this is kind of the
dual of that the on my desktop I have a
photo and I want to know whether or not
I can use it not only whether I can use
it but a bunch of other facts about it
collective rights management this is
something we don't touch on much in the
US but collective rights agencies are
are more powerful elsewhere and being
able to have them collect on long tail
stuff means that they need to not only
get their current databases into shape
which is a massive project but expand
them cultural heritage institutions or
some of them institutional some of them
web projects are essentially developing
big databases of contents with metadata
about the content including rights you
could think of the powerhouse museum
they should the picture of the orphan
work as one example of that finding
where content is posted this is this is
kind of a a use case that a lot of
people it's it's a demand people want to
know where their content has been posted
on the web but order to do that you need
to have crawled a whole bunch of content
and have some way of identifying the
content and once you've done that you
may as well figure out who owns the
content and then you have all of the
classic pieces of registry coming from a
completely different angle and then
there's time stamping which is for the
copier from the copyright holder
perspective is kind of the traditional
or a district's case I want to
demonstrate that I and the person who
created this and nobody else timestamp
this before me but also from the user
case I want to be old a timestamp a
license assertion for example you know
that been published a photo and his
Flickr stream and if he takes it down I
want to have a record of it it might be
good to have a third party record that
and what better third party than
somebody who is keeping track of
copyright holders and works and things
like that so a bunch of people are
trying to meet the trying to meet these
demands the and many of them are here
and I'm going to characterize the people
meeting these demands as fitting into
several different buckets and many of
these projects fit in multiple buckets
and won't agree with how they're
characterized but that's that's just a
problem with categorization so redo this
slide duck with tags if you if you want
to complain about that so the simplest
case is basically replicating existing
replicating the US Copyright Office
although it's you're not actually
registering a copyright now you like to
call this build it and they will
register so basically you put up a web
app that's backed by database and you
have a form and people can say this is
my work and then you give them a
certificate
and you can build other services on top
of that and I I'm sure that each of
these has has a story on in terms of
what what additional value out there
they're providing on top of that but you
actually using the the the technology
that I gave a that I promoted on an
earlier panel semantic media wiki I
think you could put together a build it
and they will register register and
approximately what's your estimate on
that Nathan okay well if in fact in fact
I was just talking about some talking
somebody and they did this I don't know
if they are using semantic media wiki
but it would take you know five minutes
to to I'd sue some other very very short
amount of time to develop a build it and
they will come register with with a wiki
so that's a simple case hopefully people
are building on building more services I
don't talk about so another another kind
of another class of suppliers or
basically people who have other needs or
they're already managing a database of
works about a particular domain
collecting societies are a good example
of this in order to in order to collect
from cafes and whoever else o'clock from
and distributes royalties accurately the
needs to have a giant database of of
music basically and they're already
curating that and so they could open
that up to other these other other uses
and basically become a registry service
I already mentioned cultural
institutions cultural institutions as
another kind of that that kind of case
so but we also have web projects that
are essentially trying to manage all the
information about a particular domain
into that are here are musicbrainz and
open library music and the opens in the
music space and open library currently
in the book space although I think they
have have more aspirations than that
another is satisfying an internal need I
already talked a bit about that big
companies needed needing some manage of
their of their kind of licensing needs
however another interesting case of that
is not managing internally but building
what is effectively a registered in
order to be able to provide another
service now know Inc I know they're here
and gonna be on the next panel is an
example of that all of them I think
they're an example of that and but they
can talk about themselves and I want to
speed through this another class of
suppliers are people who are effectively
building a registry or something that
could scale to a registry as a side
effect of providing some service
attributer is here and and I they can
describe their service I kind of like I
hinted at in earlier slide you can and
jamendo is also here and I understand
why one of their aspirations is
basically to be the database of all
openly licensed music I think they're
just surpassed 10,000 of them so
congratulations to them
then in kind of other domains or not
entirely other domains there's people
like last.fm
which effectively has built a database
of all music that exists because
whenever some percentage of people who
have their play their music it reports
so they actually know a lot about about
a lot of music that doesn't exist either
because of that tagging but in any case
Flickr Flickr is in Flickr is another
example of a site that effectively could
be thought of as building a registry of
photos but they're doing it entirely as
a side effect I mean they have billions
of photos including for the most part
copyright information about them and
photographer some cases geolocation and
in some sense that might be more
valuable for a registry built as a
side effects because they actually have
have the work and the costs of creating
the registry was purely a side-effect
YouTube is obviously example of that for
videos so there's gonna be a little bit
of overlap here so I'm gonna go through
these slides even even more quickly what
are some different approaches were
creating registries one is cataloging
works and user action and attention or
two good ways to bootstrap that
musicbrainz last.fm are good examples as
quarreling the web is kind of a classic
case existing catalog curation by an
intermediary I mentioned collecting
societies view and cultural heritage
institutions as examples then finally
you have the explicit registration by
copyright holder which is the classic US
Copyright Office and case and the
Builder and they will come registry case
and I think I was planning to mention
crowdsourcing in with respect to the
user action case some people don't like
that but there's this great talk on
Commerce and community that that I
recommend that you all look at which
there's a URL for if you decide to do
that sort of thing
another approach you're doing a registry
is to go I'm sorry alright
so those are approaches to building a
registry then what are approaches to
using a registry although I call it
catalog here for some strange reason one
is that you have you have a marks you
have a work that is marked with a
reference to registry so this and this
this gets to where the kind of build it
and they will come use case can become
useful as they face a massive
chicken-and-egg problem but basically if
they're if they're providing a
certificate that is published along with
the work
then that provides basically a
provenance link that somebody can follow
and get back to the registry content
derived identify or lookup to registry
basically this means that if you have a
work and there's a way to identify the
work by looking at the content itself
then that can get back to the registry
and something I've been involved with I
believe Gordon the founder of Bitsey is
is here took that approach and people
are taking fuzzier approaches to
identifying photos and things that are
essentially using not necessarily
content derived identifier as country
they don't content derived lookups
although identifier and lookup are
synonymous in some cases then there's
searching the registry which has a whole
bunch of different variants from
actually talking in a few words to using
VN API then there's a whole bunch of
processes naturally built on top of a
registry which you know could include
things like acquiring additional rights
for work because the register because
given the registry you actually know who
the copyright holder is so what are the
challenges for people building
registries and using registries
I've probably hinted at a bunch of them
but identifying works is always a
massive challenge and could basically do
a whole could do a there are conferences
dedicated to this so identifying a debt
identify you know owners is another
problem it's less of a problem in the in
the traditional case although somebody
can still fraudulent
the traditional registries case although
somebody can obviously still make fraud
you want some ownership claims namespace
monopolists you know there have been
there have you know there are there are
a bunch of people there have already
been a bunch of failure failures over
the last few years in this space people
either implicitly or explicitly trying
to build a right
three and many of them whether they
realize it or not basically when I say
I'm going to dole out identifies four
works and I'm gonna get a critical mass
and then people have to pay me to get an
identifier so an example of this would
be like digital object identifiers
although there have been many less
thoughtful attempts as well I think
creating monopolies unnecessarily or
without a great deal of thought is is
always dangerous then there's there's
making it webby copyright registration
is has not was not the web didn't exist
when it was developed and a lot of
there's a typical problem of kind of
bringing copyright together with
technology which causes a lot of
confusion I think that's one of the
values that Creative Commons has is that
we actually have copyright lawyers and
technologists who I understand their
respective domains and can actually talk
to each other and it makes sense then
there's the problem which I've repeated
twice on this slide which is basically
in terms of the benefits of creating the
registry has to be greater than the cost
of creating its and meta crap is another
way of saying that basically copyright
information has just metadata about
works and creating and curating that
metadata is costly if there isn't clear
benefits it's gonna be bad data and
that's that's a problem at any registry
has to deal with and even if even if
you're taking the approach of crawling
the web because you have to have have
some some quality control related zet
there's a problem of who pays
a problem that that was hinted at with
metadata generally in earlier talks is
that if you don't if nobody sees it it's
worthless and you're asking people to
create registries and initially they're
gonna be small not integrated into a
bunch of software so the benefits are
not gonna be great for anybody which
creates a chicken-and-egg problem and
who's gonna pay to boot to stir up that
process then scams are yet another
problem and a lot of very few people
will understand copyright period and
even just for copyright registration now
there are a whole bunch of scams out
there it's basically saying pay this pay
me on this website some money and I'll
make sure your copyright is protected
forever I'll register your copyright or
whatever we have a whole bunch of people
claiming to be copyright registries but
they're actually not that then we have
to do an awful lot of Education to make
sure that's kind of copycats who are
just want to collect a registration fees
and provide no value to the user
don't proliferate and gain market share
and I say that digital copyright
registries won't actually be copyright
registries in effect in the sense that
when you register something with the US
Copyright Office at least in the u.s.
you can have you can get some advantages
if you actually go to trial and all this
insert I am NOT a lawyer and go no
further but but that doesn't mean that
we wouldn't aspire for eventually the US
Copyright Office to you know fully
embrace the web or you know for them to
embrace Creative Commons and people we
work with you know to build to build
registries that could that would effects
copyright registry but it said it's a
it's a dangerous education path that we
have to take so I think this is my
second last slide this is a very very
funny entry in the US Copyright Registry
um you can actually go into a search on
the Library of Congress home page it's
the entry for Code version to the book
by our founder Lawrence Lessig and the
funny thing about it is the copyright
claim it's is Lawrence Lessig CC
attribution share-alike so obviously
somebody tried to Commons enable the US
Copyright registry but of course you can
actually if you can actually click on
Lawrence Lessig CC attribution
share-alike but of course there no other
authors is that exact name so it was a
good idea but if in fact if in fact they
had a field for license or for public
license then CC attribution share-alike
could be a valet for that field possible
you can search the registry based on
license which would be cool so what are
some there are some things that
registries or proto registries ought to
do support to support the Commons both
in terms of the registry being registry
space being a Commons and something that
can grow the web and supporting openly
licensed materials thinking about
interoperability and I think using
Semantic Web technologies is a good way
to do that is one way to make sure the
registry space is itself Commons like a
way to go even further down that road is
to think of registries as open services
possibly where there's some community
governance in some cases possibly
publishing of source code open source
I can never remember this this word when
I want to think of it test Suites and
reference implementations and this has
nothing to do with copy or artistries
but the the OpenSocial foundation that
was blogged about a bunch a couple of
months ago actually has a bunch of
really great principles around keeping
the keeping the protocols and code etc
around social networks open and I think
that people building registries should
look at that example and then finally
registries in terms of supporting the
the Commons of of the stuff they're
registering obviously we want anybody
building a registry to build awareness
of Creative Commons licenses into that
and do a better job than the hack that I
just showed you so then I think that
that registry I I mentioned towards the
beginning that one of the reasons to
talk about registries now in terms of
technology is a useful aspiration and
framing for the technology we're
building but I think you can take that
beyond copyright and that the issue
basically the issues of provenance there
are particular relevance to copyright
but they're really a problem on the web
generally which is decentralized and you
want to know what agents can you trust
what data is true etc and it's possible
that people innovating to build
registries that can solve those problems
for copyright well will contribute to
the general health of the web which
would be fantastic this in general
copyright enforcement has been horrible
for the health of the web and has led to
many problems with music
for example that Lucas described um and
then of course Creative Commons is all
about using technologies that will
enable the sort of thing and I did a
quick
and of Lucas's Lucas's slide where he
was talking about comprehensive unique
and stable URLs for each and every song
he wasn't proposing a registry was just
a proposing that people had URLs for
songs in the web which comes to my final
aside the web is the registry there's
not going to be one registry to rule
everything particularly not for all
domains so the challenge that I want to
put to the next panel is what does your
registry add to the web and that is my
view so now I guess it's time for lunch</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
