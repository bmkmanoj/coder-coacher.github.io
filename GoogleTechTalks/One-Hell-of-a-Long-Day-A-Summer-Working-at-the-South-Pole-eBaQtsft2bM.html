couple of quick questions that may seem
to be orthogonal here one is um how many
of you had been had been following along
on the road trip blog while I was gone
whoa and how many of you have taken the
machine learning cart course here that's
pretty impressive okay so there gonna be
some aspects here that are familiar to
everyone okay first of all hi I'm Pablo
thanks for coming I also have in the
audience I'm gonna embarrass Zach a
fellow pulley Zach lash who is a one
about by my best friends down there and
a south pole veteran as well and I'm
gonna be picking on him as my as my
plant in the audience when I ask
questions excellent great so so this all
you know just the high-level background
was started about two years ago when I
was sitting sitting around with an old
friend who I'd lost touch with and
finding out what she'd been doing for
the past decade and it turned out she'd
been working at the South Pole and I
said wow what was that like and she
looked up and said magnificent
desolation and I said how many people
recognized that phrase okay
what's it from no not yes it not from my
blog but but okay uh-huh
it was Apollo missions Buzz Aldrin that
was how he described the moon okay I'm
gonna be a bad frisbee thrower here can
you pass this back well that's a u.s.
Antarctic Program patch for the first
correct question sorry about that okay
so yeah that's how Buzz Aldrin described
being on the moon and I and I said I
know that quotation she said yeah when I
was a kid I wanted to work on the moon
base and they haven't built it yet so I
figured the South Pole is about the
closest I can get and I said tell me
more
so that was about two years ago and I
spent the next year sort of thinking
about and looking at the various
Antarctic program job postings and
slowly building up brownie points so
that my wife and kids would let me go
away for that long and um made as much
as many friends as I could do this much
research as I could and after a
surprising amount of luck I landed
position with the program and I spent
the last roughly three months from the
end of October till the beginning of
February working at the South Pole doing
tech support being the guy who fixed
your computer if you happen to be at the
South Pole
so since I'm an engineer I'm you know I
have outlines for everything and this is
gonna be the roughly outline of the talk
first I want to straighten out and get
people properly oriented of what
Antarctica is and why the heck people
are down there talk about the process of
getting to the pole for me the real meat
of it is gonna be here just like work
life play what it's like being at the
pole and then questions I've got a Dory
page set up and we've also got
microphones so you know don't be shy so
okay actually one important disclaimer
here almost all of the pictures we've
got here are either things that were
fortunately up on my blog er that I have
stolen from friends who have posted
things or I grabbed off of the web
because we lost all of our pictures in
the Christchurch earthquake on the way
back
yeah just can't stay away from adventure
okay so let's start with basic
Antarctica orientation okay how many
people recognize this this is the Arctic
it's at the top of the planet it's got
about 15 feet of sea ice there's no land
under there it's just floating sea ice
and there are polar bears up there no
penguins okay that's up at the top okay
the other end is Antarctica okay
Antarctica is actually a continent it's
a real honking big continent instead of
15 feet of ice or so it has roughly
9,000 feet of ice no polar bears but
around the coast various sea life like
penguins for example okay let's get the
straight arctic top Antarctic South okay
now another thing another popular
misconception is Antarctica is really
big so you know we have a familiar
continent here well
Miller country at least here
Antarctica's one and a half times the
size of the United States it's big um
it's got 90% of the world's ice 9,000
feet stacks up a lot of volume and 70%
of the world's freshwater worth keeping
in mind it's got a lot of other
superlatives
okay highest driest windiest coldest and
emptiest continent on earth highest um
average elevation surface elevation in
Antarctica is 9,000 feet it's got a lot
of mountains you don't see most of the
mountains because most of the mountains
are buried below the ice sheet yes it's
still the tallest mountains in
Antarctica or over 16,000 feet high the
South Pole itself is at 9,500 feet
before because of atmospheric effects
and it actually the physiological
elevation is 10,500 feet in case so it's
high it's dry antarctica is a desert in
the South Pole we get less than two
inches of precipitation annually we get
a lot of stuff blown in from other
places but and that but it's a desert
it's dry it's the windiest it regularly
breaks 200 miles an hour some places on
the continent it's the coldest this this
is my friend Marco who's actually from
Palo Alto he's a winner over this is him
geared up to go on his morning run
this is him after about half an hour
coming out of his morning run he sent me
this photo last week when it dipped down
to minus 89 now let's let's put some
some real numbers on this just to get a
feel for a cold okay
late October when I headed down Palo
Alto was a chilly 68 degrees Fahrenheit
okay from Palo Alto flew to McMurdo
McMurdo Station is a big station on the
coast it's basically the summer limits
of where the sea ice melts where ships
can actually get this as far as it as
you can get it's the big base at McMurdo
in late October it was ten degrees
Fahrenheit this is springtime okay ten
degrees Fahrenheit okay so then we went
from McMurdo to the South Pole now this
is a difference of 58 degrees this
not a small amount okay so from McMurdo
in Antarctica I went over hem ffice eyes
that we went to the South Pole where it
was minus 48 degrees okay now 58 degree
difference here and a 58 degree
difference here so the same difference
between Palo Alto and the edge of
Antarctica - and edge to the center now
if you do this iteration one more time
carbon dioxide comes out of the
atmosphere as a solid of its own accord
okay but you know it turns out that you
know you actually you can you can beat
the pants off of that because at the
pole in the winter it's gotten down to
minus 117 I've talked with people who've
overwintered in conditions like this and
they say if they were actually looking
for the carbon dioxide but they couldn't
actually tell it from the rest of the
stuff that was coming out of the air but
you know but in terms of low
temperatures the Russians think that
that we we Americans at the pole are
wimps because they've got Vostok base
which has recorded temperatures even
colder than that
so emphasize I just want to kind of let
it sit in is it cold
yeah okay um also it's the emptiest
around the coast you know people you
know around the coast there is marine
life but for marine life you actually
need access to water which you only have
around the perimeter and emember this
thing is one and a half times the size
of the United States okay
so there are no indigenous peoples who
have ever lived in Antarctica unlike any
other continent and in the center of the
continent there's nothing that lives
there nothing lives there that wasn't
brought in on a c-130 yeah that was a
bacteria came in a c-130 okay in the
this is a bit of a pet peeve because
whenever I told people I was going to
the South Pole they said Oh take a
picture of a penguin for me okay okay
no penguins at the South Pole they're
around the coast but remember this is a
big continent telling p.m. this would be
akin to somebody's telling you that they
were going to coming to the United
States where are you going I'm going to
North Dakota awesome there's this great
whale watching tour
there are as many penguins at the South
Pole as there are whales in North Dakota
that's about it's about the same
distance okay okay um so that's the
overview of Antarctica um South Pole
obviously isn't the only base there are
a lot of bases all over the place all of
the bases buy from all of the countries
are governed by the International
Antarctic Treaty which basically says
there's no commercial exploitation no
military activity or you can only have
scientific and environmental studies
there
you can't leave any trash there just
pick up after yourselves all of the US
bases are administered by the u.s.
Antarctic Program under the NSF there
are three bases there's McMurdo which
I've already mentioned that's down on
the coast that's the big city they're
about in peak of the summer there may be
1500 people there you know people that
live in dorms and they work in separate
buildings etc out on the on the Palmer
peninsula there's Palmer station which
is a very small base this tops out at
about 40 people in the summer they
mostly do biology yeah quick question
east and west yeah actually um let me
take just a moment um that that's a good
question
standby excellent question because
normal coordinates don't work we use
what's called grid coordinates and the
meridians are are our coordinates so the
prime meridian zero degrees is north 90
degrees 90 degrees east
latitude east longitude is east ninety
degrees west longitude is west so you
know this is pointing towards Greenwich
this is pointing towards the
International Dateline
excellent question yes throughout
America
okay there's Palmer station they do a
lot of a lot of the marine biology and
that's about forty people and then there
is my home of Holmes South Paul okay
this is what it looks like South Pole
has about 200 to 250 people in the
middle of summer going down to about 40
people over wintering this is a sort of
a view from the distance of the entire
complex there's the main station here
there's the big physics stuff over here
the ski way it's not a runaway it's a
ski way because the plans that land
there have to use skis and so the pole
you know what's special about the pole
okay it's defined as the rotational axis
of the earth because of that you know so
you've got the earth turning like this
the Sun doesn't go up and down like it
does in normal attitudes it basically
just goes around and around and around
every day and as the Earth process a
moon moves through its orbit eventually
the earth moves to the point where the
Sun is behind the body of the earth and
so this we have one day and one night in
each of them lasts exactly six months so
um what's wrong with this picture
being the South Pole at all right it's
not it's it there is something else
wrong with this picture
good good so is this isn't actually the
South Pole
that's the South Pole this other one
this is the ceremonial South Pole that
sort of stays put but the geographic
South Pole it is computed each year and
a new pole marker is put in place right
now there are about 70 80 yards apart
maybe a little bit more okay so I said
one day which we sometimes call summer
and one night which we often call winter
summer is when most of the activity
happens
sunrise happens around September 22nd to
23rd and and it's actually not around it
actually takes it actually takes two
days because it gets light around the
horizon gets a little lighter a little
lighter a little lighter and eventually
the Sun breaks the horizon late October
it's finally warm enough to get the
flights in temperature peaks in late
December popular I know and we have
total of around 200 250 people depending
on what's going on January starts
getting cold quick by mid January the
temperature is dropping two degrees per
day by mid February it's so cold that
the airplanes can't land and get off
again they like that getting off part so
they have to get the last of the summer
population out and the winter
overpopulation as I said is about 40
sunset is from March 21st to March 22nd
I just got a picture which I wasn't
clever enough to load up here from one
of my friends there of showing showing
sunset a few pictures of sunset as it
moves around the horizon okay so that's
rough orientation South Pole big cold
harsh why are we there is one important
word science yes we are there to support
science and it's important ice thing is
that on the South Pole science is a mass
noun it's I remember sitting there one
of my early days are there some banging
upstairs at my desk and I looked over he
said what I thought we were done with
construction here and Ben leaned over
said yeah somebody decided they needed
to nail some more science to the roof
so so so why did you come to the South
Pole to do science well there's some
special things about it first of all
it's remote so it's great for stuff like
atmospheric studies where you don't have
humans polluting things it's quiet
seismological II there's very little
radio frequency and light in the night
there's no light interference and it's
rarefied you you're two miles up thin
very dry atmosphere and at night the
atmosphere is perfectly stable perfectly
smooth you want to shine you you want to
get good good pictures of space you
can't do it any you can't get any closer
to space than here in the winter okay
so because of that as you might imagine
there's a lot of atmospheric studies
this plot by the way I don't know if you
can read it should scare you these these
are the carbon dioxide measurements at
the South Pole going from 1955 to
present-day seismology so this is the
there's a seismic vault I mentioned at
the South Pole
lots of physics physics is a single
largest scientific endeavor at at pole a
pretty picture at gosh is that can you
guys actually see that no that's just
way too dark it looks nice on my screen
that's the South Pole telescope at night
with aurora borealis and great stars
over it
thank you that was gratifying
okay I want to just talk about one
physics experiment in slightly greater
detail because it was the biggest part
it was the biggest experiment that was
being worked on while I was there and
because it's so freakin cool
okay um neutrinos go through matter like
like it wasn't there because neutrinos
just don't notice these things in order
to get a neutrino to interact with
something you have to put it through a
whole bunch of matter and then to detect
that it's actually hit something you
have to be able to see through that
matter so what you really want is this
large dense clear volume of something
with no other photons around yes ice so
what uh what these guys have done is
they've taken basically a square mile of
surface area and drilled 88 holes
mile and a half down and embedded these
digital optical modules called daams
into the holes and they have embedded a
cubic mile of ice with sensors and
computers so that when a neutrino goes
through and happens to hit interact with
a water molecule the light can be
detected real from all of the doms paths
compute and they say yo we have a
neutrino it's it's a scary huge
experiment I mean think about a hue
become a Liz a lot of space any case um
so that's science at the pole that's why
we're there so I decided I wanted to go
yes Eric yes they have been getting
neutrinos if you go to I think it's ice
cube dot Wisc dot ed u-- university
wisconsin is the u.s. partner there they
actually I think have live data they'll
show you another one so getting to the
pole step number one get a job at the
South Pole I'll talk a little bit more
about this during the question period
because it's it's there's not a really
easy way of describing the process there
are two main groups of people at the
pole there's the support staff who keep
science going there roughly 150 250 in
the summer 30 40 in the winter and then
there's a science staff the or as the
support staff refer to them the beakers
and they tend to rotate through
sometimes some only come up four come
down for a week to do their experiment
some are there for the entire season
some like like Robert Schwartz are there
as far as I can tell haven't left for
the past decade
so so that's step one get a job at the
poll number two step two is actually get
yourself to the poll to get to the poll
it starts out in the US you fly down to
Christchurch and there you stop at the
anti the Antarctic Program Center where
they give you it's the ECW gear the
extreme cold weather gear as people are
fond of saying there's no such thing as
bad weather only bad gear this stuff you
put it on you go outside you don't
notice the weather at least for a little
while
zach is giving me a grin he spent more
time out in the weather than I have okay
you've got your gear once you've got
your gear next day or so if the weather
holds you get on a c-17 which my friend
Beth calls the magic tube has no windows
you get in on it you get in it you sit
down in a few eight hours later you get
off and you're somewhere else you're on
the Ross Ice Shelf outside of McMurdo
and you are in Antarctica and you're
going Wow okay but the adventure is only
started because the next day if the
weather holds you get on a c-130 also
known as oh it's a c-130 Hercules just
refer to as a Herc that flies you from
McMurdo the thousand miles inland to the
pole some interesting things about the
Herc skis jato rockets they don't
usually use jato going McMurdo to the
pole just cuz they don't need to that's
more for the field camps okay so you
climb into the her akyuu wandering
around you're bored you make new friends
you look out the window there is a
window there and then you have a suit
you suffer through a landing unlike
anything you've felt before imagine you
know it unless you used to fly unless
you used to fly US air back in the 70s
but you have 130,000 pounds of of
military aircraft with skis no shock
absorbers hitting two miles of ice poop
and just the sound and feel of it is
something completely unreal and then it
gets a little scarier because then the
engines stop and they say okay time to
get out you climb out and this is like
okay
two miles up on an ice sheet as large as
the United States it's minus 45 not
counting the substantial windchill and
you discover you can't really breathe
when you blink your eyes freeze shot
that was a new one for me and you
realize you've never been happier in
your life you are at the South Pole of
the world funny thing is is you get used
to it pretty quickly I'm gonna try to
see if I can shift over here to UM this
is a video that I shot with a friend of
mine just a couple of weeks after
getting there
ah come on give me this back okay good
morning everybody good morning temperate
friends you'll notice I'm wearing a
flannel shirt it is Sunday morning it's
about minus 42 and we're gonna do an
experiment here we've been asked all
sorts of things about what happens when
water is exposed to the atmosphere we've
heard if you toss a cup of water up in
the air and little freeze we've heard if
you toss a hot cup of water up in the
air Lupe's we've been asked what happens
if you pee off the second-floor balcony
will it freeze we're gonna do try to do
some of those experiments here we have
no it's not good water must come out
here to the edge it's worth listening to
the sound remarkably calm air and so
it's nice and steaming hot let's get the
camera right off to the edge so we can
watch what happens and we're gonna go
one two three it makes it makes this
sound and then it's gone
you can have a lot of fun okay
in any case so so you've now gotten to
the pole and you've sort of gotten used
to it now we're gonna sort of dive into
the main part which is sort of work and
life at the pole life at the South Pole
Station this is your world effectively
this is the station there the
outbuildings etc and the station itself
is a work of modern engineering it's got
all of the comforts of home so we've got
and we've got a gym
there's the greenhouse there's the
galley
Holloway's you know you where this is
basically what I what I wore you know
walking around I'm except I instead of
wearing these because I had to tie these
up I was I'd wear my fuzzy slippers and
here's his dorm rooms the dorm rooms are
nice and shiny and modern they're small
they're very small but they're you know
they're quiet and comfortable and they
um they the house about a hundred people
now what's wrong with what I've just
told you yes okay yeah I already give
you one of these okay yes so the thing
is is that not everyone lives in the
station um the low folks on the totem
pole the people who are supporting
science live out at what is
euphemistically called summer camp
summer camp because it's only habitable
in the summer and it has all of the
comforts of summer camps summer camp is
actually as a series of 14 1950s era
Korean War surplus army army tents
they're called james ways they're
insulated that's really dark yeah well
this is what they look like from the
outside this is what it looks like from
the inside you've got sort of plywood
separators on either side an unheated
floor something that is over here but
the thing that separates you from the
Holloway is a glorified military bed
sheet and you have nominally privacy
it's about 8 by 8 you have normally
privacy but you hear every sound that
everyone in the dorm knows
you wait a little while you know at
11:00 you're gonna have to sit up and
yell Bruce you're snoring and you know
that Cornell is gonna come in he's gonna
shut the door he's into turnaround using
a whack the thing on the back of his
backpack against the frame and it's good
everything's gonna go he's gonna say
sorry and he's gonna do that tomorrow
night too so in case um so that's what
life looks like for for uh slow folks on
the totem pole so let's go just go a
little bit unto day in in my life so I
wake up and I was one of the lucky ones
because these James boys have been
around for so long the people who have
lived in them especially if they are
carpenters we have a lot of carpenters
down there have made their own little
improvements so I had instead of having
a bed sheet I had a plywood door I was
the envy of my James away for having a
door I also had a window which was
pretty awesome except that the Sun never
goes down and so every night I had to
sort of take my jury-rigged cover and
cover it up so I'd have some dark and
then take it off in the morning so this
is my James way that's the hallway at
night so stumble on big red and I throw
on my car hearts and my big bunny boots
and I stumble out in the darkness - this
is my front door and everyone else's
front door and I stumble the roughly 50
yards across the snow to get to the
bathrooms
the joys of summer camp and you know
where I sort of brush my teeth and shave
maybe and I look at my watch and if it's
Wednesday or if it's Saturday then I say
it's a shower day we're allowed because
all of the water there has to be melted
from ice all of the ice has to be melted
with jet fuel and all the jet fuel has
to be flown in hot water is a scarce
commodity so we're allowed to showers a
week two minutes of water per shower you
get used to it
okay yes did I make it all the way to
the bathroom at night this is where the
unheated floor is a bonus we have we're
not gonna repeat that one but it's a
good point well most people who live in
James ways have have what are non
euphemistically called pee buckets you
have your little jar or whatever and
instead of going outside at night you
and it helps with the floor freezes
because that the floor is unheated
because you put that under your bed on
the floor and freeze a solid yeah okay
can we can we get the collective oh
thank you that's that's that's what I
felt like also okay so finally it's time
to go into work and I go walking you
know walk across the roughly quarter
mile of of snow to get to the station
big imposing station with steam coming
off of it walk up the back door this is
the back door to the station is called
destination Zulu the front door is
destination alpha this is DZ versus da
and in the door that's a industrial
freezer door inside destination Zulu I
take my gear off I you shuck off my
bunny boots and my and my big red put on
my fuzzy slippers and go upstairs to
breakfast food is one of the great joys
at Paul the gal it's it's not quite as
good as Google but it is awesome
the galley staff is there because they
want to be at the South Pole and there
they they love their pulleys and they
want to work their butts off they really
go out of the way the let's see oh so
what do we have here oh yes this was the
real imitation crab bakes and it's
labeled with artery-clogging sauce and
over on the left it was labeled that
cheesy meat-eaters pizza of doom this is
this is Cristina when she took over the
breakfast thinks just we got these
amazing yeah
Zacks nodding his head yeah you remember
the the raspberry marscapone is stuffed
french toast yes yeah you eat well at
the pole yeah cap do you need to eat
more than usual you get to eat more than
usual it's great for for hot meals a day
actually they're the three normal meals
and then there's what's called Midrats
midnight rations for the folks on swing
shift and because the Midrats folks are
only cooking for about 40 people instead
of 200 people Midrats is really nice if
you're not working swing shift or you
actually have to get permission to
attend Midrats
and so you've I remember the time the
last week I I I went over to a split
sleep schedule and was going to Midrats
I remember Liz he was the Montego Bay
shrimp with some sort of pilaf and a
molten chocolate hot cake I'm sorry I'm
getting hungry here they feed you really
well so after breakfast I actually have
to go to work so like people in winter
eat stuff as good as Midrats actually
I've been told Ben was telling me that
it's even better than Midrats in winter
yeah he's just taunting me right no no
they gue you right they can't fly they
can't fly anything and in the winter so
basically the summer is spent stocking
up on stuff on stuff that's not
perishable freezing it out in the berms
to be retrieved and also getting in the
greenhouse started so that they have
fresh vegetables to support to support
40 people over the winter that's a great
question thank you okay so it's 7:30 in
the morning and I have to show up at my
desk my desk is there there's a Ben
yes Eric ah what what is what do I mean
by 7:30 all timing is an illusion
starting time ee so no um excellent
question
um what we do is we use New Zealand
Daylight Time I don't know why it's it's
roughly 21 hours ahead of time here or
three hours past the next day so right
now it is 4:30 in the afternoon on
Tuesday at at South ball no other
direction you're right it's late morning
yes Devin is practice for four months
yeah Mike no no it's all it's all New
Zealand daylight NZ DT yeah it just
makes it so that we have to get up early
to meet with the folks in headquarters
in Denver I think that's why they do
that yeah those four Souls have to get
up at 5:30 to talk with us hand me some
more coffee cake so any case this is
what my desk looks like I sit down I
start fielding problems usually there's
a mail from overnight of people who are
having problems with their email people
whose computers aren't working people
who forgotten to plug the printer in etc
you know desperate desperate urgent
needs from Denver to you know let them
know something irrelevant etc and I do
this from 7:30 until about noon when or
you know whenever it is that that we
decide that it's lunchtime and we go off
and get lunch but actually one of the
big problems is is the internet down yes
the Internet's down I don't know if you
can read this this is a this is one of
the signs that I hung on my desk is yes
the Internet is down yes we're working
on it no we don't know when it's going
to be fixed would you like to hear a
knock-knock joke in the meantime
whoo wait no no
knock-knock not the internet and the
reason the problem is is that so we're
at the pole and they're all of these
wonderful geostationary and
geosynchronous satellites that are
supposed to cover yeah and so you do the
geometry and they would have to go
through the earth to get to the pole so
it's only the satellites that have some
eccentricity there to have our it's not
eccentricity what is it called when
you're all at an angle some inclination
thank you I'm gonna run out of these
things
whoo I'm getting better have some
inclination that actually come up over
our horizon for any amount of time and
because we're a National Science
Foundation project we are at the bottom
of the pecking order for any sort of
bandwidth so we only get the cheap slow
satellites when they happen to come up
and when nobody else wants to use them
okay I don't spend all of my life behind
the desk sometimes I get to go out and
fix other people's things like plug-in a
printer at the neck next door over the
Med lab or go over to comms where Tina
has some sort of problem and then I'm
always scared to go over to Commons
because Tina says y'all I can't get this
thing to work and the problem the reason
why I'm scared is because Tina will have
already tried everything I could think
of I am irrelevant because Tina can do
her job and mine better than me but you
know sometimes it's you know I actually
get to leave the building and go down
into the tunnels underneath where the
power plant is because Rick our power
plant guy is great at breaking computers
I think he went through three different
machines or else often too the logistics
arch which this is where our materials
that are brought in from the berms that
brought in here to to thaw out to 50-55
until we need them upstairs this walking
through the arch always made me feel
like I was in the last scene of Raiders
of Lost Ark it just it never went away
so so this is what I do six days a week
ten hours a day one of the things that
really threw me was you you don't get
you it's not obviously the impact of
having discretionary vacation days like
you know
I'm not feeling well today or you know
I'm kind of burnt out I want to go out
and do something for her you know I'm
gonna take a vacation day you don't get
to do that at the pole it's there are no
V you know there you gets at you get
Sunday off but the kind of I'm gonna
take a day off no because you're the guy
and there aren't any spares and that
sort of gets to you but I am NOT one to
complain because I I am what what folks
who work outdoors in the real weather
folks like what folks like Zack refer to
as an indoor house patch I I show up at
the galley for lunch in my fuzzy
slippers with my mug and I sit down next
to these folks you know like Eric would
come at come in and his car hearts would
still be still be smoldering from where
he had set himself on fire it was if I
have nothing to complain about so it's
either people do hard crazy real jobs
that are basically you know these are
people who are really working as opposed
to me and so let me just back up a
little bit and talk about what other
people do yeah
what sort of people you have at there
you know so so we're a very homogeneous
crowd here you know we are Silicon
Valley kind of well yeah we are at the
pole you need every sort of skilled
labor and unskilled labor that you would
need to run a town actually to build a
town you know 2,000 miles from anywhere
else at minus 57 degrees so um because
of this you end up working very closely
with people who you ordinarily wouldn't
encounter in your life and you end up
depending on each other and so you you
you end up having at the galley you know
you've got you know Carlstrom via the
principal investigator Harvard professor
of this hundred million dollar project
sitting exchanging two stories of how
his day was with you know folks who
never made it through high school you've
got left-wing liberal hippie freaks from
California
bloodying up and talking about airplanes
with right-wing redneck conservative
folks and they're your friends because
there are the folks you live with and
there are the folks who work with let's
see so here just some of the I don't as
I said I don't have all of my pictures
of the people who I hung out with these
are things I've managed to grab so this
is Bryce he's one of the cargo guys I
worked with Iraq combat vet Jared Jared
is another cargo guy forest fire fighter
smokejumper Montana smokejumper and yoga
instructor Ã©lisa Ã©lisa iight interent
many Minnesotan drives the largest
tractor ever made for her day job
self-proclaimed folk dork banjo
aficionado
Ricky Ricky gates fastest man in
Antarctica dishwasher he also holds a
number he also holds a number of world
records such as the speed running time
up the top of Pikes Peak and things like
that then oh god you can't well you
could you can see his you can see his
electronic shirt Ben was there sis
admitting when no one else could
daniel senior pc tech i'm also
professional musician in his spare time
Ben and Daniel were the guys that I
worked most closely with Meegan Meegan
is a South Pole sort of lifer she's been
spending last decade or so working at
the pole as much as she can she's um
Meegan is not quite human I mean she's
she's been coming down to the pole for
really long I mean this is this is
probably spring yet so it's probably
it's probably only minus 20 or so so so
yeah vegans great you will be sitting
around talking about stuff and she'll
say well love to keep two of to keep
talking with you folks but I think I'm
going to go ahead go downstairs and play
tractors for a while
this is not the biggest thing she drives
this is only a d7 Haley I love this
picture this is picture by Ricky the
Ricky and Haley are all both incredible
photographers um Haley was our grub
blogger she she was the one who's
responsible to forgetting the food that
was down in the logistics arch up to us
in a form that the kitchen staff could
actually turn into food we love Haley a
kayak instructor no actual home owns a
car I believe but that's has it has no
actual residents just awesome awesome
person who else do we have
oh um the GA s a lot of people come down
to pol as general assistance which
basically means they get to shovel snow
and shovel snow and shovel snow so those
we have Joel and Marie and I think
that's max up there occasionally they
get to do interesting things like drill
holes put dynamite in it and blow them
up yes big shovel
cap cap need on captain don is our fire
chief also on certain occasions Captain
Christmas this will become more
explainable in just a minute this is
this actually one of my favorite is an
example of the people you end up working
side-by-side with so we have Lou tree
who is a very traditional grandmother
from Albuquerque and Rachel who is us
has a master's degree in international
policy used to work for the UN doing
conflict analysis in Somalia they both
decided they wanted to come to the South
Pole and they spent the summer washing
dishes too so they could do it and they
were just happy they they were they were
yeah they were very pleased with these
choices any case well then there's this
guy that's me
being a wimp I'm all bundled up this is
a this is this is just logistics arch
but in case so I said you counter a lot
of folks who wouldn't normally encounter
and one of the nice things is you
actually really grow from it you spend a
lot of time realizing the things you
have in common understanding their
lifestyle and and and and appreciating
you why do they live that okay yeah I I
think you're crazy but I can understand
how a rational person would might have
that as a business and also
in sort of um because you're in under a
microscope as much as they are you know
when you know Dan and I are sitting
there looking across each other
at you after a recent conversation about
politics you know he's going well I
guess he's a nice guy even though he's a
loony it gives you an opportunity to
think more about who you are and how why
you've made the decisions that you've
made and it's been it's a wonderful huge
growing growing experience and all of
these people no matter how different
they are from you well with one or two
exceptions become your friends and
because you're so this is last part here
this is these are the people loaded up
as I said you know you live with these
people you work with these people you
play with these people there isn't
really a work-life balance because these
people are your life while you're down
there and you become you just when
everything anything needs to be done if
it's your job you do it if it's not your
job you probably still do it so you know
once or every week or two Tina would get
on on the I would say good morning poll
sort of like Robin Williams but without
people shooting at you
good morning poll we have freshies @dz
we need people to bring in freshers @dz
and the the front loaders would bring in
these pallets full of fresh vegetables
that have been flown in on a c-130 and
everyone would throw on their stuff and
line up down the stairs and just do
basically a bucket brigade coming up you
know everyone from you know you know G
A's who who are using this as an excuse
to I can put the shuffle down I don't
have to thank him to folks like you know
John Rand who's been coming down to pole
for yeah actually probably 40 years he
helped to design the new station he is
so far above the hierarchy he's like
loyalty you know um the dish pit they
always need help
almost need help washing dishes so we've
got here let's see one of the one of the
plumbers a one of the firefighters our
meteorologist and the head of the South
Pole telescope project just rubber
gloves on all pulling in together a
greenhouse so that's kind of working
that's there's also a lot of playing
together you know is who else you're
gonna play with South Pole
Key Club yes you can ski at the South
Pole it's not very good skiing Marko
again Marko brought a bike down the bike
turned out to be amazingly popular we
all wanted to borrow the bike
lots of music I'm gonna go into that
little later there's a nice gym swing
dance classes basketball all sorts of
stuff happenin
I'll see if this one will work so that's
a sledding at the South Pole quick what
time of day is it
oh good good very good I'm gonna
positive now so so Zach you should be
able to tell look at the shadows shadow
shadows are coming coming that straight
that way that's north this is a little
bit after midnight this is one of the
things that kind of throws you is you
realize that all of those things that
you want to do after work before it gets
dark not so much of an issue yeah I'm
cat Oh awesome awesome question why is
the station built up on okay you guys
duck my range isn't that good well let
me let me answer that after I've gone
through some more slides but that's a
really important interesting question
Carl
um did I have to get special camera no
no I just sort of kept the camera inside
big red and popped it out when I was
doing the panoramas that I tried
shooting for Street View
we took a Nikon d90 put a thermal sock
around and stuffed it full of chemical
hand warmers so they're all so quiet
indoor activities you know we've got a
great Reading Room's a pool table
arts and crafts room good places where
people can kind of hide and head out and
mellow out terms of mellowing out not
everyone uses the recreation time for
recreation a lot of people who have come
down to pole let's say as dishwashers or
janitors actually have aspirations of
kind of moving into another jobs and so
what people often do is when they come
off their normal shift at 5:30 they go
volunteer on somebody else's swing shift
so a ga who just tired who wants it who
likes a pole but doesn't want to keep
shuffling will volunteer down at the
machine shop to maybe develop some
skills build the personal relationships
so that next year they can get hired as
a heavy offer as a machine operator or
as a carpenter and you basically you
build skills this way I wasn't
particularly looking for a new line of
work but because I was an indoor house
pet and I'm not really in I get I I got
um Restless I started volunteering after
work with the the swing shift cargo team
which was huge amounts of fun and I
learned what it really meant to be cold
so I got to learn how to how to Marshall
and direct the the 130s into and really
you know help the fuelers help build
pallets I got to learn how to drive a
skid loader it there's just this is
something you can't do anywhere else
and so so I'd like to think that if the
Google thing doesn't work out I could
probably get a job as in cargo three
months see well uh yeah actually if you
do if you do the early season in McMurdo
you can work it a little bit more
what was the freak frequency of flights
um when the weather was good we could
get up to like four flights a day but
there were weeks that we just didn't get
flights because of the weather and you
know then they'd all stack them in yeah
another question
ah oh right a religion there um there
were there were chaplains that rotated
through every you know would come down
to do Mass or your priests you know um
chaplains to do a service maybe once a
month or so you know other than that we
were sort of on our own yeah Randy yeah
so during the winter in theory they can
parachute they can airdrop stuff airdrop
is something that is a really awful
awful thing it turns out later in the
slideshow if we I don't think we got
there um when you airdrop stuff it ends
up embedded about six feet into the ice
and you have to go out there and dig it
out and if it's minus 100 degrees it's
just it's no fun so airdrop is
considered sort of the last last resort
let's see okay real play at the pole let
me just um you imagine a lot of stress
builds up doing this stuff and when it's
time to cut loose people like cutting
loose and we have a lot of opportunities
to do so on the weekends so you know
thinks things like Thanksgiving
Christmas etc are pretty well celebrate
you know Thanksgiving the kitchen staff
really goes all out you've got you know
I forgot what did we have Thanksgiving
well with for Thanksgiving it was
obviously turkey but I think the the
beef wellington and lobster and was that
was Christmas right four different kinds
of turkey that was it that was the big
thing for Thanksgiving so so good meal
special meals
lots of music so open mic nights New
Year's Eve so you have 200 250 people at
the pole New Year's Eve we had three
different bands police love to dance
they went into a New Year's Eve or
actually was near Year's Eve since it
was a we celebrate holidays on the
weekend on a Saturday so you get a two
day weekend so we celebrated on the
second and they went until three
the race around the world that was
another fun thing that's Christmas Day
people familiar with beta breakers okay
Bay to Breakers meets Burning Man it's a
two and a half mile run around the
compound it compasses both the
geographic and and ceremonial pole and
people dress up there are some serious
runners and people create mutant
vehicles and let's see what else is
there yeah in January we have the South
Pole International Film Festival spiff
where we this year we had a seven
entries of if you come to me afterwards
I can point you to just do the spit
films that are online some really good
stuff some starring members of the
audience yes
and then suddenly it's February and you
go well it's time to go temperatures
minus 40 again and starting to see
contrails and it's time to pack up your
James way get on the Herc and head home
and and you find yourself back here and
you go whoa and then everyone asks you
one question would you do it again yeah
so let's do I need I need to answer a
cat's question okay excellent we're
going to do this by going to some
history here this is the this is not old
the original poll station 1957 the new
dome you can see there are these nice
long metal arches and the dome and
everything and 15 years later the dome
is mostly under snow nice and the arches
are completely under snow and ice what
happens is even though we don't get a
lot of precipitation all of this stuff
blows in from everywhere else and the
surface pack raises by 8 inches per year
old Paul the original pole station is
enough 40 feet underneath the dome they
got tired of trying to dig it out
actually you hear you can see it with
the construction of the new station
here's the dome in sort of this crater
that they've keep carving out so the new
station they just put up on pylons and
the idea is that every 20 years or so
they
Jack the pylons up a bit more okay other
questions oh you know I should I
realized I should go to the dory because
I've had I think we're nominally almost
like out of time but I should really do
the Dory thing come on
Dory questions for Pablo at the poll is
anyone actually submitted them no whoo
Oh what Carl has another question though
sure yes is there some kind of
personality screen yeah so a lot of it
is so for the winter over is the winter
over is you actually have to go through
a psych test and they ask you do you
want to what do you want to spend winter
at the poll say yeah you're crazy
no no with the summer the summer it's
you have to go through a fairly
extensive physical eval and and the it's
mostly personal interview because during
the summer if you turn out to be
unworkable they can send you home but
there is a personality that definitely
works and a lot of the hiring is not who
can do the job the best the the
criterion is who is not going to screw
up who's going to be perfectly adequate
at the job but I'll be able to deal with
in close quarters for the next three
months and that's why so much of the
hiring is kind of face to face Perth in
person yeah
so how did you get keep in touch so
there was email and when the satellites
were up when the tea dress the
high-speed satellites were up tigress
the high-speed satellite had about the
bandwidth of a cable modem for the
entire station then we would you could
actually so we weren't allowed any video
a chat that just too much of a bandwidth
THAAD but you could actually make phone
calls through and in fact my desk when
the satellites were up I had a phone on
my desk that was that rang through from
a Denver area code so you know if people
in the station where people from McMurdo
or Denver could call me also that meant
wrong numbers could call me and I was
one number transposed from a funeral
parlor in Las Vegas and so I kept
getting these phone calls like hi his GJ
there I'm sorry ma'am this is not TJ's
funeral parlor come on I know he's
trying to avoid me but just tell him
that that Brenda calls is you have not
called teaches well who is this um you
wouldn't believe me
TJ tell TJ's you don't want to tell them
that they've called the South Pole
because either they're not gonna believe
you or they're gonna believe you and
they're gonna tell their friends hey
call this number you're gonna talk to
the South Pole yeah how would you get
one of these jobs um we've gone over
there
okay um we've gone over the official
time so let me let me say thank you to
those who wanted to bail out and then
I'll sort of pause for 15-20 seconds so
they can escape and then talk a little
bit more about the jobs things okay
thank you all</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
