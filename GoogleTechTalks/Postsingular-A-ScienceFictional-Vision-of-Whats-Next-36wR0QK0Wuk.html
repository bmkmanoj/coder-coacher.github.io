a great show I first became aware of
rudy rucker about 12 years ago when one
of my co-authors said hey there's this
book about a lisp hacker who writes
genetic algorithms you should read that
and I found it hard to believe that
somebody would put that subject into a
book but in fact Rudy did in the hacker
and the ants and and did a great job and
and in the process to told me more about
what it's like to work in a Silicon
Valley company then I had already
learned in the last couple months of
working in one so that was great gave me
an idea of what to look forward to but I
think in in this case is one of the rare
instances where the Wikipedia actually
does a pretty good job of summarizing
our subject and Wikipedia rights rudy
rucker is an American computer scientist
and science fiction author and is one of
the founders of the cyberpunk literary
movement and of course goes on from
there but I wanted to add just one more
quote from Ken Goffman also known as are
you serious who had and aside from that
he's a great guy so I think that
about covers it and and one more quote
is from Rudy himself who says life is
gnarly and and let me just say if you've
ever seen I'm sure most of you have read
many of his novels like they cover a lot
of subjects in science fiction in the
singularity he's going to tell us about
post singular life is very interested in
the in the notion of multiple dimensions
a common science fiction topic and in
the notion of cuttlefish a not so common
science fiction topic and general you
know I'd say I couldn't necessarily
recommend the lifestyle of sex and drugs
and math and rock and roll's to
everybody but certainly seems to work
for rudy rudy rucker
Thanks it's nice to be here today and I
first met Peter I was teaching on a I
class at San Jose State that was my day
job for 20 years being a computer
science professor and I realized that
Peter Norvig who co-authored the book we
were using was lived somewhere in the
area and so we got him to come and he
gave us a great guest lecture I think it
was about using neural nets to steer an
airplane I believe you know and then I
read a news article about google and i
saw that Peter was now the director of
research here I thought wow that's
that's great and so so I hit him up for
an invitation and Here I am so are its
fun to be at Google as a science fiction
writer you always dreamed about the
future where you'd have the universal
encyclopedia and all the information of
the world at your fingertips and it's
worked out faster and better than I
expected it still amazes me that the
Internet is free and that it didn't
somehow get co-opted and made into like
the US post office or something that's
kind of kind of amazing anyway today I'm
going to talk about a novel I wrote our
recently it's called post singular and
uh if you're impecunious you can
actually read it for free online if you
go to my page rudy rucker calm / post
singular and but it's available in
hardback as well and we so i can
actually i got email from a lot of
people when it first came out who worked
at places like this and they say yeah i
read i read your book and my cubicle
sweet no go down and do likewise the the
novel it's about well there's this word
that I'm sure I don't have to explain to
you the singularity and the idea being
that at some time in the not-too-distant
future there'll be this dramatic change
in in in the science and tech of the
society that we live in and one of the
first people talked about this was
vernor vinge II he's also a computer
science professor and Anna science
fiction writer and he made the remark
that if we had good enough AI so we had
computers that were as smart as we were
then they could rapidly become smarter
because we could up there ram up their
chip speed gang them together assuming
that the software was scalable big
assumption i guess and then set them to
work designing even better machines
better software and you might get this
exploding exponential curve and in this
book i'm talking about a slightly
different kind of singularity well in a
way i'm talking about this but it's
funny how quickly ideas ossify in
science fiction like now singularity
sort of means Ray Kurzweil its
particular vision of what's going to
happen and you're going to shoot up nano
machines and they're going to clean all
the gunk out of your veins and you're
going to upload your brain and live
inside a computer what a great life that
would be huh you never can never leave
work you know but uh the thing that
always gets my goat the most having a
high tech job is when you've been
working all day and then you have to
wait for the computer to turn itself off
it's like I'm not done yet you know I'm
not done yet but anyway so so I wanted
to do something a little different with
the singularity here and so I started
out with the first kind of a rapid
scenario and another big inspiration was
charles stross
rota an amazing book is it what they
call a fix-up in science fiction that is
to say it's a series of short stories
that's fixed up to make a novel it's
called accelerant oh how many of you
read Excel around it okay and what I
liked that that Charles did was some
science fiction writers have been saying
well we can't see past the singularity
now we're stuck you know we sort of
can't write about this and straw swiss
you know let's just go let's just do it
and see what happens and that's really
what science fiction something that it's
good at is to say let's uh let's just
dig in and imagine the unimaginable you
know if we are going to do it who is so
here the way this book is set up this
first is sort of a bad singularity and
then a better one and then an even
better one and the bad one it's the sort
of it's the sort of more conventional
notion of the singularity that you hear
sometimes it's the idea let's take earth
and grind it up into nano machines and
we'll make the machines out of computor
onium whatever that is okay and then
it's supposedly matter that somehow
optimized for computation though I would
submit that matter already is optimized
for computation on quantum computation
that's what matters doing all the time
but be that as it may there's this sort
of notion that you sometimes say let's
grind earth up into a whole bunch of
nanomachines and then let's convert
let's upload ourselves into this huge
huge swarm computation and so as not to
waste any solar energy let's put the
this Metro a sphere around the Sun so
every bit of Sun is being soaked up by
these evil glittering little Intel chips
and there are and we'll all be living in
their happily ever after which that's
bogus at so many levels it's it's
something I blog about sometimes there's
there's a couple of problems with it but
for the sake of a novel it's good to
just say let's let's see that
can do it one of the bogus things that
happens is the person who's president is
an evil half-wit named dick dibs and he
arranged it so only his political
supporters are the ones are going to get
uploaded into the new virtual earth but
then fortunately in the first this all
happens to the first or second chapter
the the main character is this man
called ond and he works at a he works at
a high-tech company called exha exha
actually it's called Nantel and then
later they changed their name to XOXO
and he finds a way to reverse the NAD
computation after it's eaten all of
Earth and then the Nance turn out to be
reversible computer serving goes back to
normal and then the president is
executed by lethal injection so it's a
kind of a happy situation then let net
then on still keeps working and he wants
to make a more less less corrosive kind
of nanomachine and he has this idea for
something called orphids and it's sort
of a joke on our foods that you're
hearing about a lot these days you know
dust sighs rfid chips and i always i
want those to be here because I'm always
losing things so I want to be able to
Google my possessions ok I want to be
able to have like an orphan ship when
everything I own and be able to find it
and privacy privacy is gone why worry
about privacy ok uh I just want to know
where my glasses are and if somebody
else can find them too that's ok with me
but uh the orphids i called them orphids
here and on has this idea he's designed
the orphids and this is a part I'm going
to read you it's about them and his idea
is to have them not be so furiously
self-reproducing as the Nance they'll
only go up to you know a certain density
of about one per square millimeter
and stop so I'm going to read you a
little bit about this and then we'll do
some questions okay and I should explain
in the passage i'm going to read there's
a is two couples there's the engineer on
and there's his wife neck tar and then
there's another couple there's a man
called craig or who's he fishes for
cuddlefish in the San Francisco Bay it's
the invasive Farrell cuttlefish has
gotten here from Burma has taken over
the bay and they're very lucrative
because you can get the rhodopsin out of
their skin and which is this very labile
chemical substance and people are using
them to wear these things like contact
lenses they're called web eyes so you
can actually see you know a computer
display on your contact lenses and so
he's he's catching cuttlefish and his
wife are is called Jill and Jill is very
beautiful okay I used to think and
craigor is having trouble with he has
the file reports on all the cuttlefish
that he catches and it's he sort of
complaining about this because he's not
good at paperwork being a fisherman I
used to think the feds micro managed
independent fishermen like me so that
they could tell the public they're doing
something about invasive species said
craigor but now I think they want to
drive me out of business so they can
sell my license to a big company that
makes campaign contributions that's
where my new tech comes in sidhant we
label the cuttlefish with radiofrequency
tracking devices and let them report on
themselves like bar codes or orphids but
better it's not like I get my hands on
the cuddles until I actually trapped
them said craigor so how would I label
them they're smart enough that it
actually be hard to strap the same one
twice what if the tags could find the
cuttlefish sidhant pink and grinning he
glanced around the circle of faces and
reached into his pocket introducing the
orphids he said holding up a little
transparent plastic vile etched onto one
side were the
ionized Beetle and flowing cursive
letters of the XOXO logo my big surprise
whatever was in the vial was too small
to see with the naked eye but Jill's web
eyes were displaying tiny balls of light
little halos around objects in rapid
motion orphids are two bar codes as
velociraptors were to trilobite
continued on the orphids will change the
world not another nanomachine release
exclaimed nekked are jumping to her feet
you promise never again on they're not
Nance never sit on his tongue a bit
thick with the beer and tobacco they
smoked and illicit cigarette orphids
good Nance bad orphids self reproduce
using nothing but dust floating in the
air they're not destructive orphids are
territorial they keep a certain distance
from each other the cover Earth's
surface yes but only down to one or two
orphids per square millimeter they're
like little surveyors they make meshes
on things they'll double the numbers
every few minutes at first gradually
slowing down and after a day the
population will plateau and stop growing
you'll see a few million of them on your
skin and maybe ten sextillion orphids on
Earth's whole surface from then on they
only reproduce enough to maintain that
same density you might say the orphids
have a conscience a desire to protect
the environment they actually hunt down
and eradicate any rival nanomachine that
anyone tries to unleash sell it on said
craigor grinning at nectar orphids use
quantum computing they propel themselves
with electrostatic fields the understand
natural language and their networked by
a quantum entanglement continued on the
orphids will communicate with us much
better than the Nance ever did and as
the orphanet emerges we'll get
intelligence and amplification and
superhuman AI the secret XOXO project
muse jill watching the darting dots of
light in the vial you've been designing
these orphids all along sly odd in a way
the Nance designed them sit on before I
rolled back the Nance the Nance sent nan
tell summons
mainly great code Co here at quantum
states human language comprehension
autocatalytic morphogenesis a layered a
neural net architecture for evolvable AI
the Nance nailed all the hard problems
but on Sid nectar in a pleading tone
we've been testing the orphids for the
last year to make sure there won't be
another disaster when we release them
sit on raising his voice to drown out
his wife and now even though we're
satisfied that it's all good the execs
won't formally pull the trigger there's
been a lot of company politics a lot of
infighting so that's why I've gotten in
formal approval to go ahead and release
the orphans myself ha said nectar
approval from yourself you want to start
the same nightmare all over again she
tried to snatch the vial from ons hands
but he kept it out of her reach next are
symmetric features were distorted by
unhappiness and anger her voice grew
louder mindless machines eating
everything mommy don't yell shriek too
that's their son chill nectar said ond
fetting her off with a lowered shoulder
where is your nicotine euphoria believe
me these little fellows aren't mindless
an individual or if it is roughly as
smart as a talking dog he has a petabyte
of memory and he crunches at a petaflop
rate one can converse with him quite
well watch and listen he said a string
of numbers a machine coded web address
and an orphan interface appeared within
the web eyes of two and the four adults
the orphids in the vial are presenting
themselves as cute little cartoon faces
maybe a hundred of them stylized yellow
Smiley's with pink dots on their cheeks
and gossamer wings coming out the sides
of their heads hello orphids said Jill
bixi looks at her daughter bixi looked
up at her curiously to Jill her
daughter's face looked ineffably sweet
and vulnerable behind the dancing images
of nanomachines hello Jill sang the
orphids their voice is sounding in their
listeners earbuds after I release you
fellows I want you to find all the
cuttlefish in the San Francisco Bay on
told the orphids
ride them and send a steady stream of
telemetry data to ftp XOXO org slash
mertz boat can you show us a real
cuttlefish the orphids asked their
masses were like an insect choir the
individual voice is slightly off pitch
from one another those are cuttlefish
sidhant pointing to krogers holding tank
settle on them and we'll release them
into the bay okay by you Craig er no
wasted craigor those Pharaoh cuttlefish
took me four days to catch leave them
alone on their my daddy's cuttlefish
echo dance echoed craigers son I'll buy
them from you said ondas eyes glowing
market-rate the orphids will blanket
your boat too they can map out your
stuff network it make it interactive
that's sort of the plus the publicity
for your assembly gist sculpture comes
in your sandwiches will be little
societies the AI hook makes them hot
market rate mused craigor okay sure he
named a figure and on to instantly
transferred the amount all right said
Gregor wiretap those pharaohs and spring
them from death row weren't you
listening to it on center with the
orphids doubling their numbers cried
nectar were doomed if he opens the vial
she lunged at her husband on danced away
from his wife keeping the orphids out of
her reach his grin a tense rictus to was
screaming again stop it on to acclaim
Jill things are spinning out of control
I don't want your orphids on my boat I
don't want them on my kids they're
harmless sidhant I guarantee it and I'm
telling you this is going to happen
anyway I just thought it'd be fun to
kick off or fat night in front of you
guys be a sport Jill hey listen up
you're our orphids you're our friends
aren't you yes and yes chorus the
orphids the discordant voices overlapped
making tiny wavering beats that was very
nice of you to think of us on said Jill
carefully but you better take your
family home now they're upset and you're
not yourself put the orphids away I
think tracking the cuddles is a great
idea putting craigor half a step behind
Jill as usual
tegi my stuff is good to my sambal just
can think Thank You creger sidhant he
turned clumsily towards the kala fish
tank this time he didn't see nectar
coming she rushed him from behind a beer
bottle clutched in her hand and she
struck his wrist so hard that the vial
of orphids flew free the chaotically
rolling jar the chaotically glowing jar
rolled across the jack deck choo caught
up with a vial and screaming like a
banshee he wrenched it open and threw it
high into the air on a trajectory
towards the tank stop the yelling yelled
choo perhaps he was addressing the
orphids make everything tidy through her
web eyes Jill saw illuminated or fadat
spiraling out of the vial in midair the
paths forking and splitting in two and
now her web eyes overlaid the scene with
the tessellated grid showing each
orphids location some were zooming
toward the cuddles but others are homing
in on the junk crowding the boats aft
additional view windows kept popping up
as the nanomachines multiplied chill
hugged her daughter to her side covering
the slender girls dark hair with her
hands as if to keep the orphids offer
ond bent forward rubbing his wrist
creger gave nectar a quick embrace
calming her down and then he stared into
the tank using his web eyes to watch the
orphids settle in do you at least have
an undue signal for the orphids nectar
asked aunt presently like you did for
the nance only a minute had elapsed but
the world felt different human history
had changed for good orford computations
aren't reversible sidhant because the
physical world keeps collapsing their
quantum states decoherence I can't
believe you attacked me like that nectar
I can't believe you're ruining the world
snap nectar I want you off our boat Jill
toad on begin you've done what you came
to do and for God's sake don't spread
the word that you did you release here I
don't want cops and reporters trampling
on us sorry Jill reply donned wiggling
his fingers his wrist was okay this is
so historic that I'm video blogging it
live it's it's already on the web web
eyes and wireless you know creger
hustled and nectar and shoe onto one of
the mertz boats pisa
plastic dinghies which would ferry them
to the dock and return on its own the
dinghy twinkled with orford lights watch
me on the news called on are we right to
just sit around esta craigor Jill asked
craigor after I'm left shouldn't we be
calling for an emergency environmental
cleanup I feel itchy all over the feds
would trash our boat and it wouldn't
change anything said craigor the genies
out of the bottle for good he glanced
around scanning their surroundings with
his web eyes those little guys are
reproducing so fast I see thousands of
them each of them marked by a dot of
light their mellow don't you think look
I might as well put those cuddle fish in
the bay I mean and already paid me for
them and this orphids all over the place
anyway what the hey free the cuttlefish
he got busy with his scoopnet Jill's web
I grid of orford viewpoints had become a
dish like a certain shirt s elation
which was thousands of cells wide with
the central cells big the outer cells
tiny and ever more new cells growing
along the Grim of the rim the mast
sounds of so many orphans was all but
unbearable I hate their voices to Jill
half to herself having the voices in her
head made her feel a little high and
after all our work on recovery from
pseudo coke addiction she'd learned to
dread that feeling being a little high
was never enough for Jill she always
wanted to go all the way into the black
hole of oblivion is this better came a
smooth baritone voice from the orphids
the many had become one you actually do
understand this you last the orphids a
few of the orphids I images slewed
around as craigor carried his first
dripping net of cuddles to the boat slow
gunnel and lowered them to the bay
waters we understand you a little bit
said the voice of the orphids and we'll
get better we wish the best for you and
your family Jill will always be grateful
to you will remember your boat as our
Garden of Eden our alamogordo test site
don't be scared of us I'll try said Jill
and the unadorned natural world her
children were cheering and laughing to
see the freed color fish jetting about
in the shallow waters near the boat
maybe this is going to be okay Jill said
craigor maybe said Jill letting out a
deep shaky sigh she poured herself a cup
of hot tea look at my cup she observed
it's crawling with him an orphan every
millimeter they're like some some
endlessly rama fiying ideal language
that wants to define a word for every
single part of every worldly thing a
thicket of meta language setting the
neighbors at an ever greater remove from
the name her mind was teeming with words
it was like the orphids were making her
smarter her hand twitched some of her
tea spilled onto the deck now they're
mapping the puddle splash bringing it
under control normalizing it into their
 consensus reality our worlds
being nibbled to death by nano ducks
craigor we're nano profound said
craigor maybe we can collaborate on a
show a web page where users find new
arrangements for the the merits boat
inventory if they transfer to payment I
physically lug the objects into the new
positions and the orphids figure out the
shortest paths are wait we get some
piece of plastic slug ease to do the
heavy lifting and the orphids can guide
them I'll just work and bring in more
junk I'll be this lovable sage and the
merits boat can be like my physical blog
and you can dance and be beautiful and
at the same time in toning heavy
philosophical raps to give our piece
some f'd men are immediately going to
begin using the orphids to look at the
exact intimate details of women's bodies
said Jill with a shudder can you imagine
oh no publicity for me thanks creger
spoke no response to this he lowered the
rest of the Pharaohs into the bay a
Fisher of merits a Fisher of men peace
dear cuttlefish the empty dinghy swang
swam back towards them orford lit like a
fairy nosing up to its mooring on the
side of the merits boat spooked by the
dinghy the skittish cuddlefish
maneuvered and changed colors for safety
the skins were thoroughly bispectral up
contours voluptuous said Jill I didn't
say that out loud did I said kreger jeez
you're picking up on my subvocal mutters
this orphan netlink is like telepathy
almost I better be a good boy I learned
how to damp down your access to my
activities whoops did I say that out
loud to this mesh is all over you Jill
in case you didn't know already said
Jill holding out her hand she'd been
ignoring the changes to herself and her
family but now she let herself see the
dots on her fingers dots on her palms
dots all over her skin the glowing
vertices were connected by faint lines
with the lines forming triangles a fine
mesh of small triangles covered her
knuckles a coarser mesh span the back of
her hand the computation of Horford net
was going to have real-time articulated
models of everything and everyone
including the kids yes the orphids had
peppered Momotaro and Big C like chicken
pox oh this is happening way too fast
goddamn that aunt Jill knelt beside her
daughter trying to wipe when the dots of
her daughter's smooth cheek but it
wouldn't come loose by way of
explanation the orphids odor assumed in
schematic image of a knot of long-chain
molecules an individual orphan they're
far too tiny to dislodge we're like
cuddlefish in a virtual net said craigor
shaking his head he sat down next to
jail in the deck each parent holding one
of the kids look out there said Jill
pointing the orphids were twinkling in
the bay waters on the bridges and
buildings of San Francisco and even on
the foothills and mountains surrounding
the bay Jill and craigor hadn't really
believed it when ond had said it would
take only would only take a date for the
orphids to cover earth but everything as
far as the eye could see was already
wrapped in meshes of Horford dots I
don't know whether to or go
snowblind said craigor forcing a hick
chuckle where does the expression come
from like why those two particular
options I'm so scared said Jill in a
tight voice I don't know if I can do
this all these head trips they might
want to use again I want to turn myself
off just relax Jill said craigor how
about the way on to next we're fighting
what a pair of
birds hey I guess to put them puts them
under a lot of stress said Jill weekly
yes at craigor padding Jill's cheek I
enjoy and but please don't be a geek and
a drunken maniac and this is the same
guy who saved her three years ago weird
did you notice the way nectar was
talking about her new friend Jose I can
see an affair taking shape adultery is
going to be in is going to be an open
book with orphids tracking every inch of
everyone's body maple people just maybe
people just start accepting it more the
world has had known it was over but
craigor was gossiping as if nothing
about human nature would really change
you ok said wrapping his arm around Jill
Oh craigor said Jill leaning her head on
her husband's familiar shoulder always
be to be here for me I'd be lost without
you drained by shock and fear the two of
them dozed off there sitting on the soft
deck with the kids so I think I'll stop
there and
take some questions
I see this book is sort of it's when you
write science fiction you're writing
about the present usually so what I'm
writing about here it's a different way
of looking at what's going on right now
like the idea of having GPS markers all
over the place so you can locate things
and so then what if we have GP a GPS
marker every millimeter apart so
everything becomes covered by a mesh and
you can see everything and how does that
change people's behavior in in a science
fiction novel I often think of science
fiction novels as like thought
experiments you set up a situation then
you go into that world and you simulate
it for a sustained amount of time and
see what happens are you like stunned
okay can somebody ask your question
watch the pic about
when you run simulation you like to get
some ideas of the error bound so maybe
you run same relation multiple times and
also you accept whatever up once you get
rather than saying well not only do that
p simulation but it also has to tell a
good story and so on so how does that
affect the experiments you do in writing
a book well that's an interesting
question nobody's ever asked me that
question I always say that science which
is a thought experiment and you're
saying yes but when you're doing a novel
you're not really doing a totally free
simulation because you have the
constraint of making a good story and
also you only do it once sometimes I
will take a topic that interests me and
write multiple stories about it but make
it a usable a good story that's sort of
you sort of have to do that otherwise
well that's the fun of it it's uh what
makes writing hard is there so many
things that can happen and then to sort
of sculpt it into a sort of seemly form
people often run into this when they try
to write their life story I was
mentioning to Peter at lunch I'm retired
from teaching now that seems like a lot
of retired people i know they say i'm
going to write my autobiography and then
they always encounter this problem that
a written document is linear and your
life is anything but linear it's it's
hyperlinked it's fractal it's branching
everything reminds you of something else
and so that's a the craft of writing is
about finding a way to make a path that
sort of feels right and has a shapely
shaped Lee curve to it yeah
negative characteristic of Golden Age
science fiction in my opinion is that
the women are just claps and I was
stunned by what you said in introduction
to your book especially because i've
read other you know here are the man
these are their careers here are their
wives one is very beautiful is the rest
of the book like that is your but
Natalie choice for me or was that just a
long section well okay I guess I left
myself open for that one didn't I uh
actually Jill is uh Jill is a really
interesting character she's a recovering
addict she's a product she starts as a
product dancer and then she becomes a
sort of very powerful person who does
this sort of guerrilla attack on this
company sort of like Intel and blows it
up and then ants are coming from so uh I
guess when I think about Jill I tend to
think about how beautiful she is but I
do make a considerable effort to make my
women be strong characters yeah I think
that's actually something I'm pretty
good at nectar also is quite a powerful
character she does a lot of stuff uh I
mean she she clobbered on with a beer
bottle already but she's a she's a she's
a chef she runs a restaurant she does a
lot of cool things so no I think I think
it would be safe to say that that I'm
one of the less sexist science fiction
writers that there are okay because i
have i've been married 40 years and i
have two daughters and i put up
I've interacted with women a lot over
the years so I think I started to say
put up there hanging myself again okay
but uh check it out the actually one of
the main characters in this book is a
woman called thuy nguyen and she's all
to the hero of the second one the sequel
to this is called Hylas owing that
relates to the idea that everything
could be alive that's an actual
Wikipedia word high-lows Oh ism it's
this philosophical belief that objects
could be alive because something uh like
print maybe some of you have this
feeling to of being tired of digital
machines it's like you've seen enough of
them and I have this dream of analog
computation quantum computation some are
replacing digital computation so we
could have be using brute matter as our
computers the only problem with that is
the interface it's hard to I mean if I
have just any ordinary object just I
mean a stone this the stone is the atoms
are vibrating there's phonons traveling
around inside there there's a huge
amount of computation going on but it's
the input-output problem how do you how
do you get information in and get it out
but at the end of push singular I have
them find a way to do that and so on
Hyla ZOA court of like an ant world but
all the objects are alive and as I say
one of the main characters in there is
thuy nguyen she tweeze very cool i can
show you a picture of her if you like uh
let's see thank you for you go here
one thing I took up recently was
painting I wrote a life a novel about
the painter Pieter Bruegel it's the only
science fiction novel have written and
then I started doing paintings of my
books while I was working on them and
there's a this series of this is a
picture of and what I do is I get the
images and I post them online at this
place called image kind so you can
theoretically by Prince of them not that
many people do so this is a kind of a
big zoom that's the back of tween winds
head she's got two pigtails see and uh
let's even get a smaller picture maybe
that'll show k and that's uh that's it
any flying alien they're not bad
necessarily they're called the hull
they're flying stingrays and the person
writing inside it is too and that that
guy I guess that's Hieronymus Bosch he
gets involved in the novel as well it's
with science fiction you can sort of
bring in anything you like so that's
sort of a long answer to your question I
don't know if I switch your anxieties
about my political correctness or not
yeah you think that privacy is gone yeah
so what do you think is going to replace
it or what do you think that will happen
now the privacy is gone I think push
back it's like if somebody tries to ask
you about
it will become increasingly easy to push
back at them and do the same thing to
them so it'll be maybe a little bit like
I don't know like the Wild West where
you don't shoot somebody because I'll
shoot you not that I mean I don't I
really just like violence and guns maybe
that's not the best metaphor the idea
being but if somebody is tapping you
then you can mount them for whatever
they're doing because everybody's got
something obviously the previous
forgettable for pressing also sort of
much as a rule so there's a personal
well that's again we have to go after
the government I mean we have to
vigorously go after the oppressors we
can't just drift and let them screw us
take to the streets you know I mean
don't let them get a free ride for
things that they're doing that are
illegal see that they're persecuted and
prosecuted and I think that's that
hopefully would be easier in the future
because in principle yeah there's enough
laws that it's hard not to be in
violation of something at any given time
yeah put singer my bumper like what
about the grace logic I didn't quite
another grey goo okay well in what I was
doing here with basically in the the
Nance scenario was kind of a gray goo
scenario okay where they actually eat
everything and that's it so then that
was in the first two chapters this book
and then I say well suppose nanomachines
are inevitable we'd want to have some
nanomachines that acted like antibodies
like an immune system so like if bad
nanomachines show up there's always one
of these good nanomachines around and
they will devour them so that's the
that's the that's the take on it if
ninety-nine percent of the simulations
everybody dies in Chapter two you can't
publish any of those and you're left out
publishing a book on the one percent
where they haven't arrived it's like an
entropic principle of science fiction
simulations usually published at once
Claire yeah and then they all died you
know the I don't I tend to think maybe
we overestimate the fear of the gray goo
problem because after all nanotechnology
when you get down to it is often just
another word for biology I mean that's
what what's going on you know with
viruses you know they're doing they're
doing things with molecules and their
the Nature has been keeping it real for
you know millions of years it's evolved
and the idea is if you say well I'm
going to make some artificial organism
I'm going to get some naked strand of
DNA and it's opportunistic and tries to
eat things I'm going to set it loose and
it's going to be able to eat everything
in the world well that's I mean nature
is cunning I mean there's a lot of every
virus wants to eat everything in the
world to every bacteria was too
everything in the world I mean the whole
earth is full of things that want to eat
everything and they don't manage to do
it because there's lots of other things
that they make it their business not to
get eaten so I think it would not be so
easy as is sometimes feared to wipe the
earth out with some sort of biotech
nanotech kind of thing so i think it's
it's a more the system i think is rather
robust and there's a tendency sometimes
to overestimate a happy narrative the
back yourself because you have a ticket
can you rephrase that so you said as you
might you find a narrative that makes
sense basically story yeah let's thank
you what we will do also is until the
story of our buying store several years
or rather the skiff and advancing
yourself and starting now to the
footpath yes that is out what if I
served in a boy but now the Glee
documenting everything do thank you oh
it's harder done well I think it making
you like it I think I'll turn this
weekend narrative of my my life I don't
think I necessarily do it by falsifying
my past you know I don't say that I went
to Harvard no but I guess there's things
that I would emphasize you'll play up
more and play down more there it's a ton
of a matter of emphasis one thing kind
of tangentially related to your question
that's always interested in me is this
idea of accumulating enough data about
yourself on your website so that it
becomes in some sense a simulacrum of
you and I was actually again I mentioned
this to Peter watch as I was thinking of
lately if you do like a Google site
search specifically of your website it's
with just a little bit of front-end you
should be able to make something like I
have suppose I had all my novel which on
my website which I don't touch some of
them and I've notes for all my novel
it's like my talks mi blog blog and then
you can go there and ask it a question
as if you were talking to me it's like
the question you just have and with a
small amount of a on of course you start
with no AI at all and just do accrued
search on the words in your question and
then find ones that where I've written
or said something relating for question
so you can get kind of an answer like
that and then with a little more AI you
could make it a little bit the really
hard thing would be to use that data
base to start generating to write my
next book or than being able to write
but that's a hard problem but the it
gets back to that autobiography thing
could I then make it enough so that you
could talk to it it'd be a little bit
like talking to me Peter mentioned that
some people did this with philip k dick
they made a big database of everything
he'd written and then you could search
it and you get the sort of an answer to
your question so that's the kind of
answer i just gave you
speaking of brute searches you know the
singularity in AI I've seen a couple
examples recently where I can't remember
the specifics of one of those as a tech
by the tech talk here where somebody
tried to come up with some smart AI to
solve some problem and then somebody
else comes along and does a really dumb
algorithm but has terabytes of data it
comes up with a better smarter system it
seems like a lot of the attempts to come
up with AI or getting beaten by you know
fairly dump system that just have lots
and lots of data yeah I really think
that's true that's that strikes me I
mean the particularly the example I've
just been talking about simulating a
person like rather than making up a very
complicated description of their beliefs
you know at some sort of if-then system
if you can just get ya terabytes of
things that they said or did then you
can just search that it seems like it's
not elegant but it seems like it would
work pretty well again that's something
we'll see more of people do this this
thing like that guy what's his name bill
who records everything that he says
gordonville and then there's even been
great be science fiction movies about
this kind of thing you so record your
whole life and then it's easy enough to
use that to simulate behaviors that you
would do so yeah and that's a that's
something you guys are helping to do so
i think that's cool
I always wonder if if you could
physically google the world would there
then be ads on everything I would there
be an ad on my glasses when I found them
I don't know the answer would be that
that as that you don't want to see are
not making anybody money adds that you
do want to see they don't bother that's
right yeah it's nowhere to get better
glasses yes we're gonna go once you find
your glasses suggestions we just need to
change the word yeah yeah already get
the little shake okay I think I've used
up in those much time as we have here so
