is elle doit annamayya and once people
hear me about music 21 and no
obligations to score following and peter
starts here well first of all music to
the wine is a project developed at the
MHD and in which michael cooper dyson
sphere today what is the name of the
project first of all that mean inclusion
you know that during the last years has
been a very surely not related to
computer and music and we just changed
the way that we acquire my pride and
music and music how you can know the
vienna seoul just looking over and he
also changed hope for some of how and
composers change the way to innovate and
their sport you can do it now and using
computers for example there are lots of
programs and I sound like the first of
the week we listen today and there for
example you can detect with Sony's
playing a musician chest and using my
phone or an education so that many
applications related to analyzing the
salmon and the music but what about
scores there are no obligation or
there's not a half and wasn't changed to
the nicest force so for this reason
music 21 was created on developing music
only one in the surf one that M what is
a turkey for helping people class to to
answer questions every seemingly and
really about music and analyzing this
force because for example and what if we
are asked in
and how many what is it was repeated
noting a song well maybe not then you
could take a sudden then count the notes
and say okay this one is that motivated
okay but if i say this the most repeated
note by true man or something was it
well the answer is not m or for example
this one 45 views towards its own world
well this is you can get the these
answers just running wine or two lines
of code with music 21 because the II's
is on the score that would get the
solution very fast this program also has
had this goes and it allows you to
compose songs there are lots of frogs
now and that proposals can use to but
what if you wanna do a song you wanna
write a song and taking apart from I saw
another one was awesome well you can do
it I'm just opening research with music
to anyone and taking the part that you
won and mixing them and then creating a
finalist for more than 10 lines of code
this let me show you an example of what
is the work we did know for example by
2morrow japan well this is only an
example go there the most important
thing is that now I mean this
information you can and analyze the
behavior of these composers whatever but
what how does it work how musical one
word it analyzes songs and formats and
then let you use this data and Prime
using this data and then yep always you
want an example
before whatever they must format that
musically run support I well they must
go there are more than this one but that
was born like musicxml you see nearly
words and then you can do is to get some
hair with this format then program from
that this formatting to music to run
further do what everyone with the data
and then if you want and compare back
the sound something to their Fergus
format and then if you want to show it
with very fast as you can see nice you
can use whatever but well to me do with
music Tony one with the bow Charlie the
application you can create using this
program for example if we can use data
you could generate example we create a
static generator of chondroitin we can
meet a broad few rules we were monique
and cultural roots seta length from the
Koran and the computer will generate a
it's worth of mistakes and this could be
for example used by students or whatever
m for the competition or for example why
not we could create our brain later you
we have a song that we want to convert
into rail you can let the song and beta
and get the nose the Sharps flies
whatever the rhythm and then just using
some definitions say this stuff is no
this no these two applications are in
the digital library during directly and
well they're beginning that I'm gonna
play it is this for
we wanted to create a software that that
we shows you the screen a score and then
slides the pages automatically and then
you can just play some interview under
the end and so this was a real yeah how
does it work well of course the computer
has to protect the sound has to show you
the scores and meet them and so the
fireworks with audio not just with the
media buttons no sorry no no we gotta be
able this is the time because with maybe
that's that's okay and so how it works
okay we need scores hydrophone and our
computer but we wanted to do as general
as possible and we didn't want to use
expensive hardware or microphones so we
decided to use only a laptop worse than
this one so we have met with a little
bit words and and we use the microphone
of this laptop and regards the nude not
only from a violent one and then it
shows you the screen and the text will
give you this way which of your playing
powerful yes this is a and this is using
any amount of money and songs because
well it has to take them at the progress
of the signal and you can with this one
of the problems of these this
well let me score and we need the score
we will need to show the score in the
screen and back wheel something you have
to and I to the store because we
withdraw what are the notes inside is of
course the rhythm of the Department of
the notes whatever so many circuit as
clean as for as possible so we decided
to come c scores and then we use the EMR
system there are the worst and so forth
that convert the image or what into a
dieta word but we use a November system
that recognizes the note and then
translate that is not into music 11
software notes so we can use all the
sounds we just have to scan this scan
them these songs and happy and use the
software and we gather the data of the
awesome this 15 either one is the signal
that um well we are using at the
microphone of a laptop so that why he is
very it's very low and and we have the
roadway of the album so we have to to
process this see you in order to do that
we use in this case at the first
function that it works pretty fast we
have to take it fun it is that we want
to record leaving few seconds the sound
then we process the Sun record again
young faves doing 666 sequin legacies
and the sound wicked and processes are
again and I'm to the end of the song
so we have to process this sound very
fast having me I was just seeing the
sound because you can finish the song
and it doesn't make sense so using the
scale at the pershing function tool to
find the points of the signal and with
different the frequency of the signal we
can get there reaches of town and also
the rhythm the lamb are they not this we
can state which no displaying the
position and the this is an example of
the processing visit bien we have to
process the alley we have here the
frequencies and then we have to decide
when some of the stars this is a our see
you and knowing the declaration of each
frequency we can estimate it this is
what about for example with these we
have the last step that is the matching
and well have to take into come
different things first one is that we
are using a normal recognition so you
can produces some nice so the extraction
is not perfect we are processing this
the audio using a microphone operatic so
the audio is not good and you have too
much they the notes that we that we have
from the score the rhythm and the note
that we have from the audio and the
rhythm and then predict which one is the
part of this song at your place this
would be a ninja an example and this
software and takes for the mighty song
different parts and then calculate which
one has the most similar to the score
sorry play through the audio and finally
depending on the last prediction because
if the operation is here doesn't make
sense that the next one is here so be
sure and the probability of out of the
scope this XY is the one and then
automatically and when that is the best
moment it's like slipping let me show
you an example of this is omnia this is
a soft one I was playing the piano for a
further performance because I'm a
pianist but and it's only had 20 seconds
beauty and you can see that i'm playing
this song and when the software conserve
that is necessary it is attacking the
position every time and things that is
the best moment it's like the Texas so
what does its part the bridge when
hopefully on your past yes relation part
yes that is a fine when I in this page
and depending it decided effective the
business and the base of the ring on the
position protection because it takes
position n is a line with this part it's
nice the pages and slowly but if the
affection is here speak of the time is
faster yes in the second page
oh wow it's gonna we're gonna get a
little bit of feedback you know can you
play your speakers loud I think it's
going to work gets this one because it
is such a feedback loop in plugged in
what now that the basic research
feedback
but it was in debt and when I said
everything works with my off on its own
so you're going to play the same time
because it doesn't work and to be useful
for em to guess when you have whatever
the deck and was we connect connect in
some way computers &amp;amp; ok this one now we
use the melody of the violins and we can
detect that the measure of the plane I'm
well that's all thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
