the computers using simple quantum
simulation thank you okay thank you very
much for the invitation and thanks to
all the speakers so far for being a hard
act to follow so what I want to talk
about today is an issue that you should
not require convincing is important
which is determining whether the
adiabatic quantum computers or quantum
annealer that one might build are
actually doing what you think they're
doing so this is the most super
superfluous slide imaginable for this
audience but this is adiabatic quantum
computing you start in some simple state
of some simple Hamiltonian you drag your
Hamiltonian over by switching on into
right interactions and what matters is
the instantaneous eigen spectra at each
state particularly the gap okay so
another way of thinking about what I'm
talking about today is to think is there
a distant future for these machines so
one question is can you turn them into a
universal adiabatic quantum computer so
i'll spend a bit of time telling you
what that is one thing as hartman said
is that at some point we might just feel
that we've developed the technology
enough by pursuing this annealing route
and dive off and build a gate model
machine we might make a sequence of post
annealing modifications which I'll
define later so that when all these
companies working on quantum computing
have merged into a single large company
they can then build a universal
adiabatic quantum computer and then the
other option we don't want to talk about
so I don't find this joke funny actually
okay so let me tell you about universal
a QC so this is a construction that goes
back to get AF really I'm wim van damme
and director on of formalized this into
a proof the adiabatic quantum computing
is equivalent to regular quantum
computing what you need is something new
something extra which is what's called a
clock register you have your regular
logical register that stores the state
of your computation and the trick is you
make a hamiltonian which is defined so
that the ground state is one in which in
which time is encoded in a superposition
so the ground state of this hamiltonian
is what's called the history state every
time slice of your quantum circuit
represented by these unit ares UT occurs
as a separate term in the superposition
so if you measure this you see the time
in one of the registers and then you
look in the other register that's the
state produced by your circuit evolving
for that time and if you look at the
terms that you need to do this you have
some H clock which makes your clockwork
you have some initialization so that at
the beginning your circuit is forced to
be in the initial state at time T equals
zero and then you have this propagation
turn you evolve forward by UT that's the
teeth gate in the circuit and you
advance the clock from t to t plus 1
this has to be hermitian so you also
need the possibility that you undo that
and decrement the clock so you go
backwards in time so it was no surprise
that this construction goes back to
fireman who would never think of
anything going forward in time without
also thinking of something going
backwards in time and so this is the
construction that you use this evades
many thorny problems by the use of the
superposition state of course what you
do is you sample from the time evolution
of the search
yet so okay just sample a lot okay and
eventually you'll see the end or if
you're a computer scientist you say do
nothing for a long time and then most of
the circuit is the end state okay so of
course we know that we have to prove
this is efficient so we want to know
about the gap and this is unusually easy
we can apply a change of basis defined
by this unitary operator and what that
happens then is the Hamiltonian becomes
independent of the circuit and if you
stare at this and you've ever done any
numerical analysis you immediately
notice that the Hamiltonian is a
discretization a rather trivial
discretization of the kinetic energy
operator for a quantum system and then
you can immediately know that the gap is
going to go like 1 over the dimension
squared this is not rigorous it's just
the fastest way of me communicating that
to you but you can rigor eyes this ok so
this sets out a list of desiderata which
are actually those I don't actually know
what the Latin for the opposite of
desiderata is but they're not so
desirable in fact so the gap spelling is
1 over T squared ok so that's polynomial
so if you're a computer scientist at
this point you go home but the problem
is is that there is no Moore's law for
dilution refrigerators so eventually
your gap is going to run into the
thermal noise so you actually this is a
general problem with these constructions
I think including the ones that Toby was
talking about is polynomial increases in
Hamiltonian Norma regarded from a
complexity point of view of that as
acceptable polynomial increases in
Hamiltonian norm in the lab are not
possible ok so so that's a problem and
it is that's a really serious and
interesting question ok that a lot of
people thought about so types of
coupling you need XX that you guys are
just build XZ or you need X and Z Z so
the locality of these constructions
varies from five local to two local
so on so i guess my contribution to this
area is this pay for the joke via Monte
from a long time ago now while we showed
that just adding an XX to the transverse
sizing model is makes it Universal
modulo these issues with making their
coupling strength scale and it has to be
non stochastic XX okay so how do we
modify locality I'm kind of going
through my seeds list of questions from
the panel discussion here so the central
trick is what are called gadgets so a
gadget is a perturbation theory
construction rather as Toby was saying
what we want to do is we just want the
low-lying levels of our Hamiltonians to
agree so I want to build a physical
Hamiltonian which has two local
interactions but using it I want to
simulate a Hamiltonian that has k local
interactions so what I do is I switch on
some ginormous penalty term and the
strength of this penalty term is the big
problem that splits my energy levels
into a low energy sector and a high
energy sector so then I turn on some
small perturbations that splits my
degenerate low energy sector and what I
do is work out what effective
Hamiltonian describes my low energy
sector okay so because of the
renormalization group we know that I in
fact all of physics is the low energy
sectors as some theory that we don't
know which I guess is the one that et
has on his cell phone so this is this is
you know connected to ideas and
renormalization so here's an example i
have three cubits every coupling every
edge here is a physical to local
coupling that in principle can be built
in the lab I have three and sellers the
green interior ones I have a nun seller
Hamiltonian that forces these to be in a
superposition of 0 0 0 and 1 1 1 I have
physical couplings that couple the
answers to the red cubits and I have
interactions among my red Cuba's then
the effective Hamiltonian is then three
local it's actually ends up being this
product ABC
okay so just taking it forward let's
here we are doing quantum annealing
today the gate model remains a little
bit in the future perhaps universal a QC
is an intermediate thing we could do
maybe even with all these caveats I'm
inserting about coupling strengths maybe
we can make a little toy like a four
qubit universal adiabatic quantum
computer that i would be very excited to
see that what do we need to do we need
to add XX gadgets and a clock that's
three things alright so that we all know
if you ask yo experimentalist for three
things they stop listening at two so
let's think more generally about post
annealing modifications so i'm going to
again just masood set this up nicely so
i'm going to talk about non stochastic
interactions gadgets and complex
interactions but not too complex i'm
just going to talk about XX of course i
cannot walk past a number plate like
this without taking a photograph of it
notice this is a british car which is
this is not a british car rather so you
know i wanted to have something that
would work ok so let's think about the
justification for XX so here's the
propaganda so this is the simplest non
stochastic terminal i explained in
detail what that means in a minute so it
powers a lot of stuff if you can build
XX you can opens the door to a lot of
things you can do gadgets you can do
simulation which i'll say it more about
in a moment you can be universal like
you see as we already talked about so is
it useful for annealing so this is a
great question and i refer you to lay
low ha moseys talk which is the last
tour of the session that's in here i
think it removes quantum Monte Carlo
talks from the agenda for this meeting
which is the most important goal if you
don't want to hear anything more about
instant tongs you should build an xx
couple but more importantly it's just
what's next okay we've we know more
about XX now then we knew about X in
2004 okay so it's just what's for dinner
we should eat our vegetables okay so
let's toke
I stick a bunch of times and I don't
think anyone yet has really defined it
so let's define it so it's the quick way
of saying is all the off-diagonal
elements and negative or zero okay but
you have to be slightly careful because
you can get immediately confused by that
that means up to simple local
transformations because of course if I
write down our favorite Hamiltonian with
a positive gamma hear you say Peter you
clot that already does not satisfy your
definition but if I just take any
individual term and do a local handle a
local transformation on the Hamiltonian
on the Keith qubit this just leaves this
term alone it flips this okay so that's
the local transformation that can make
it a trivial local transformation that
can make it stochastic so the simplest
non stochastic is xx you could ask me
about why why but don't so it's the
simplest thing you can do that is
stochastic and cannot be removed by some
simple trick okay so let's try and put
some more intermediate steps so I want
to talk about adiabatic simulation what
I'm talking about is now nicely special
cases of this big general theorem that's
lovely to have that Toby was talking
about so I want to break up these steps
i'm going to tell you about something
you can do with just adding XX and
gadgets okay so if we do this and then
we added a clock and we would have
Universal so this is an intermediate
thing to do and I like chemistry so the
Hamiltonian I'm going to think about is
the molecular electronic Hamiltonian
it's just quantum electrons moving in
the field of classical nuclei and here's
the Hamiltonian in real space so we have
to discretize it this is a long story
now but we just use molecular orbitals
so we these are eigen states over the
single electron some single electron
problem and then we use second quantize
notation so we define creation and I
elation operators that place electrons
into these states or remove them and
because electrons are fermions they have
to obey these anti commutation relation
after all that we can write a second
quantized Hamiltonian in terms of these
operators okay so this is just a chapter
one in any electronic structure book
what does this have to do with q-bits
well we need a mapping from fermion
operators two cubed operators and I
think Rolando was the first person to
realize that you could use something as
old as the Schrodinger equation the
Jordan vigna transformation to do this
and what's important is that every time
you exchange a pair of electrons you
have to pick up a sign so you have to
keep track of the parity of the number
of electrons between every pair of
electrons this means you needle these
long long long strings of Z operators
that are effectively counting parodies
what does that mean that means that the
Hamiltonian going from n orbitals to n
qubits becomes an N local Hamiltonian on
it touches order every qubit in 2002
bradley and kitty everett this nice
paper on fermionic quantum computing
that has a construction that leads to
log in local hamiltonians i'm not going
to describe that you can read their
paper it took us 10 years notice to
understand that paper and use it for
chemistry which paper by killiow it's
not so bad so now the couplings okay so
what's the input what's the effect of
this locality on the coupling strengths
in our adiabatic Hamiltonian well you
have a ten local Hamiltonian you're
trying to make n local terms with a
gadget you're going to get you're going
to require Eric to build you coupling
strengths in your Hamiltonian that the
scaling like some number raised to the
power n that's exponential so that's not
scalable so better is some number to the
log n okay that's polynomial so that's
scalable but as I said earlier there's a
big difference between scalable and
buildable so in principle we could do
think about doing a small simulation so
we use the same gadgets and this is
joint work with Ryan who's sitting back
there who's now at Google
I think the important thing about this
work is that this is like trying to take
a step towards universal adiabatic
quantum computing without a clock ok so
it's intermedia and it you in you know
again it only needs XX plus is easy ok
so that's still got two things in it so
it would be better to just reduce
ourselves to try and find something that
rich just needs one new thing so now we
move to the idea of validation ok so if
we think we're going to need these extra
constructions we're going to need
gadgets we're going to need clocks
sometime in the future what can we do
today with the systems that we have to
make sure that the systems we have today
at least somewhat capable in the future
of doing these things and then a just an
elementary sort of thing ok if we can do
everything with XX we should be able to
do the things that we teach in our
quantum mechanics classes so can we can
we do very very very simple quantum
simulation of say the one dimensional
simple harmonic oscillator and then you
know can we show evidence that
superposition States exist in an
adiabatic quantum computer between
states with very different hamming ways
that would be a very nice thick today so
I I think I have time so when I first
got interested adiabatic superconducting
quantum computing no one had done
tomography and superconductors and John
Martinez he's sitting here was using
phase cubits as probes of these
parasitic two-level systems in the
substrates and that and so the face
people I think this is a correct story
and you can correct me if I'm wrong was
the worst qubit when you started doing
this but it's there for the best probe
of the environment so you've got this
great information about the environment
and then you're able to fix the problems
of the environment so this what I'm
going to talk about now is very sort of
in that spirit we're going to define the
most inefficient possible simulation of
the easiest quantum system to simulate
that's not because I don't know how to
solve the simple harmonic oscillator
okay it's because we want to use this as
a probe of the capabilities of the
machine if we make it really hard for
the machine to simulate something we
understand really well that gives us a
very good diagnosis of what the machines
do so that's it's the kind of backwards
idea but that's the only okay and the
reason we're doing this is because if we
had a gate model machine the
requirements to make a universal gate
model computer the same as the
requirements to test the universal gate
model computer I once you have a
universal gate you can do tomography but
once you let go of that and you say i'm
going to do eight things adiabatic lee
you lose the ability to validate the
machine and it becomes a separate
problem and this I think accounts for
the volume of literature in this area to
a large degree all right so I want to
hammer I want to still need to be able
to measure something so i'm going to use
as my tool my hammer is going to be this
what's it called tunneling spectroscopy
that I guess two or three of the authors
of this paper in the room so this is the
idea of how to adiabatic Lee determine
where the energy levels of a system are
and here's one energy level and here's
another energy level so that's what I'm
going to use there's actually a quote in
the New Statesman this week saying with
a hammer everything looks like David
Cameron's faced I guess you might have
to cut that out before posting this okay
and what's the tech what's the system
what's the inspiration for this
originally is this nice paper that
actually a mathematician friend of mine
pointed out to me so this is looking at
some highly exotic phases in the in an
izing chain this is like the gay Bay
plea style where you find some actual
physical material that has a transverse
sizing Hamiltonian there's two bits of
physics here there's this EA symmetry
business which I'm not going to talk
about but these Peaks here our evidence
of what's called kink confinement and
I'll defined that but the point is that
these Peaks appear in positions that are
given by the zeros of the airy function
okay so it's this amazing system that
you have this lump of stuff in a fridge
and it spits out the it spits out
these mathematical numbers so this is
this was sort of part of the genesis of
this world okay so that what we do is we
have the kink basis so physically what
these kink basis or the clock states are
is you take a ferromagnetic chain and
you put a twist on it so it all wants to
be the same but there's this one awkward
member that doesn't want to I'm sorry
this is another Briggs a jury that
doesn't want to be the same and then
what that causes is the zero energy
states that have one domain wall in so
then you can label them by the position
of that domain wall so that's the kink
okay so that's the basis what's the
transverse field in the kink basis well
if you think about what a uniform
transverse field does to a basis state
it takes a basic state and it returns
you the uniform superposition of all the
Hamming one distance states okay in
other words it flips what each of the
qubits so you get all the flips almost
none of those are in the kink basis
because you've put another pair of
domain walls into your system but two of
them are namely the one that's the
domain wall shifted this way and one
that's the domain wall shifted that way
so if you look in the if you project
back into the kink basis you get the
fact that you get the upper and lower
off diagonals if you think of this as a
matrix and so out of this you can build
a kinetic energy term again a
discretization of the second derivative
so if you take the projection of your
transverse field minus some constant
then you can get a what looks like a
kinetic energy all right so as a local
field look like well a local field is
going to give you plus h I if it's to
the left of the kink and minus H I our
eyes to the right of the king so you get
this potential term where the potential
is this annoying some of your fields
okay and the obvious case is if I have a
Const
local field I get a linear potential
that means that the solution the
eigenstates of the linear potential of
the airy functions that sort of confines
the kinks and that so that's King
confinement oh okay so there's a some
stuff here that you can do any
polynomial potential just playing around
with some identities you can figure out
what your local fields have to be
exactly and we get an annoying again an
annoying increase in the requirement for
local fields they rise exponentially
with the degree of the potential but
what the hell we only want to do linear
and quadratic anyway so that's not so
bad but in principle you can do anything
you can put anything exactly okay what
about errors so I'm projecting back into
this subspace so how does this work well
the first thing is we've got obviously
we've discretized into a finite number
of qubits so we've got discretization
and it errors in our simple simulation
so the limit as the number of qubits
goes to infinity is that some continuous
Hamiltonian and deviations from that a
standard numerical analysis okay then
we've got leakage error so this is the
fact that the limit as the penalties
that we've imposed to pushes into the
kink basis go to infinity we should
exactly be projected into the King basis
so okay so we've got a large penalty and
we want to know about Corrections so we
exactly know how to do that that's
exactly what gadgets give you okay we've
got some low energy theory which is this
one dimensional Schrodinger equation and
the gadgets are going to tell you about
leakage errors and so therefore this is
a strange thing because the errors the
deviations from what you expect are
actually telling you about the presence
of virtual excitations in your system
which are actually desirable to make
gadgets okay
so the there are think there are three
things you can do with this so if this
works at all you can make clock States
because you you're displaying a
capability to produce superpositions of
states with that with very different
Hamming ways the leakage errors in the
simulation tell you about the presence
of virtual excitations or the strength
of virtual excitations these are going
to tell you whether gadgets are going to
work at all okay so if you have a noise
model that's raising those virtual
excitations gadgets won't work and both
of these things you we can do today
right this is just Isaac model physics
it's very interesting when you go
through and work out the first error the
first error can be used in fact to
detect a physical xxo I'll just tell you
about that and then I'll stop okay so
what's the thing look like so there's a
kink at the end right because this is a
kink and then there's a kink somewhere
in the middle right so it's really the
ground state really has two kings and
then for King six kinks and so on those
I have to put on a penalty to get rid of
the 0 King States that's a technicality
here's my horrible gadget equations I
show you these so you can stand there
and be happy that you don't have to do
gadget calculations okay that's the only
reason I'm Trinity so if you do the
gadget calculations what do you get
here's the effective Hamiltonian it's
the projection of the Hamiltonian a
constant term a boundary term and a
stochastic x.x term so in this
simulation the first error you see is
actually a stochastic XX okay that's not
what we want we don't want stochastic XX
we want non stochastic XX but remember
that the idea here is to use these
simulations as a diagnostic so what if
you actually built a non stochastic XX
it would be this term a term of this
form with the opposite sign okay so you
could use your physical XX to cancel
this error that would change the error
scaling of your tiny little toy
simulation therefore you can use that
change in error scaling
to detect the presence of a physical XX
okay so you do a simulation you look at
the errors without any physical XX which
one you get a certain scaling of the
errors then you switch on your physical
XX the scaling of your area changes
that's your detection okay so let's just
look at some these are just mathematical
simulations so this is the error
functions if you haven't seen them
recently these are the continuous error
functions in the discretized simulation
this is the discretized simulation of
the simple harmonic oscillator functions
through obviously a very coarse
discretization it's nine points and the
ones with leakage errors of the points
so there's some small difference between
the points and the lines but not too bad
what what about what I was just talking
about if you look at how the errors run
with coupling strength this is just 8 10
and 12 going from blue to red to black
if you then look at the eight qubit
thing and imagine getting rid of that
stochastic x.x immediately see a jump in
the scaling of the errors okay so that's
that's hot one way at least of detecting
an on stochastic XX so I guess one
should be conservative so I say
experiments observing these effects
would fail to invalidate the presence of
XX okay I have one minute so I can tell
you about something that I think is fun
about these simulations here we've got a
situation where you've got quite highly
entangled set of qubits simulating a one
particle equation okay so obviously in
the one particle system they cannot be
entanglement because there's nothing to
be entangled with so when you talk about
entanglement you're talking about
entanglement in the thing that the
simulation okay but what does that
entanglement in simulation translate
into if you look at it in the in the
kink basis what resource is it and it
turns out there's a very nice story here
to it translates into a measure of d
localization called the inverse
participation ratio so if you take a cut
this is our condensed matter physicists
think about entangling
you take your system you cut it in half
you ask what's the entanglement of this
half with that half so if you do that
and then you move the position of the
cut you get these grafts here so I've
plotted that just the amplitude of the
eigen state which is in red on the Left
axis the entanglement is the blue curve
on the right and it's all it's doing all
the entanglement in the qubits is doing
is giving you the D localization of the
single particle in the simulation ok so
I quite like that because all this talk
about coherence and D localization this
is you know to achieve delocalization
here you need a lot of entertainment in
the physical qubits so that tickles me
ok so the point here is that doing non
scalable simulations is more than more
than a toy activity ok it's a good can
be a good probe of properties that you
need for the post quantum annealing AC I
guess sorry I guess that means post and
healing can we please do some XOXO
experiments I guess I've been saying
that for how long have I been saying
that area like 12 years now so I'm just
you know like any fanatic I'm just
redoubling my efforts so one big
question here is there's been a few
talks this week about locality reduction
techniques that's fantastic we need
better locality reduction teak
techniques i also want to just end with
a worry I know there I know I made a
joke about Connor Monte Carlo here but
there's a huge huge firming on quantum
Monte Carlo community you know non
stochastic XX is a way of introducing a
sign problem into our business here but
I do worry that the Fermi on Monte Carlo
community has probably not spent a huge
amount of effort thinking about non
stochastic XX so all of this is subject
to the criticism that if if that
community really took this on maybe they
would come up with some good heuristics
for non stochastic xx and we'd have to
still keep listening to firmly on
quantum on
Carlito's okay thank you very much for
your attention all right we have a Tim
for a couple of questions and I guess
person has to come to this mo I see
liseth
so when you use these gadgets is the
sort of history state you get faithful
in the sense from Toby's talk uh yes
yeah oh I was worried for a minute they
asset so you you so you eloquently
pointed out all of the problems in my
talk the fact had the difference between
scalable and buildable which I
definitely you know a totally agree with
this one over poly gap or sort of
equivalently the further you need to
take very large couplings strength to
overcome it there is of course a
solution to making the coupling strength
large which gets rid of it which is to
cheat and just put lots more couplings
so that you can have it there's a
trade-off and you can I think one can
make this has been made kind of fairly
rigorous in fact that between I coupling
strengths or order one coupling strings
everywhere but very high degree
interactions still 22 cube to body but
do you have as a theorist who slightly
closer to experiments than me have any
idea of which is worked way those easier
yeah so there's this you donk I and
Danny on the guy paper where they show
you can pump up the effective coupling
strength by having higher degree
interactions I actually took a slide out
about that because I was talking to my
experimentalist friends over here who
was saying that there's you know that if
you put more coupling strengths in the
coupling strength will turn to get down
so there's a try it seems that there's
an experimental trade-off there one more
question
