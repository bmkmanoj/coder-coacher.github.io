Matt lives in providence rhode island
and is the founder and CEO of a company
called tell art which is a industrial
design and service design firm with
companies on the client roster as
diverse as Nokia and Humana the
healthcare organization and Otis in
addition to that he's on the faculty of
Rhode Island School of Design up there
and where he teaches amazing skills like
sketching in hardware and had a the how
to do crazy beautiful things with
switches and um I think you'll enjoy
what he has to say so without further
ado Matt Cottam thanks Matt Thank You
Charles so um as a brief disclaimer I a
lot of times travel with this amazing 70
year old mentor minuses polish guru and
information design neo he starts off by
saying I'm here to teach you and very
important design principles and Matthew
is here to entertain you and so I don't
have any important design principles but
hopefully you'll find it entertaining so
first thing is a survival tactic I
graduated from school after to
industrial design degrees in 1999 and so
you can imagine after being in school
through better part of the 90s as a
freshman I started off with pine as a
browse as an email client and ended with
choosing between several color browsers
and it went from doctors having you know
shoebox-sized cell phones and their cars
to everybody having one in students
having them so as an industrial design
student that conformed of period I
really it was lucky to come out with a
sense of responsibility about learning
how to design with digital media or
digital materials in and also embraced
the traditional craft based house like
education that I gotten at the school so
one of the ways that I tried to learn
that for myself was I I was really
interested in furniture as a chair that
I made when I was a senior its leather
and bent plywood and you know all that
MZ stuff and we spend a lot of time in
crafts and shops and
to make something like that you start
with quarter scale models usually
they're little you know would that
joints are duct taped or hot glued
together or something but even though
that the construction methods aren't the
same as you would build a full-scale one
if you push down on it if you blow on it
or something the legs will deflect or
it'll fall over in one direction not
another and tell you something about how
the full-scale model is going to behave
you can you can move quickly through
ideas even on a full scale you can take
plywood and drywall screws and screw
together junk materials really quickly
and iterate seven eight chairs and a
night and have people sit in them and
give you feedback and sawzall off parts
of the backrest and have them sit down
again that way of working is ingrained
in me as the only way to work and but
when we started working with imagining a
cell phone we had a block of wood and
that was lacquered up it looked really
sexy looked like a cell phone we were
using Photoshop to make fake little
screens under you know laminate plastic
and so but it didn't tell us anything
about the behavior the best we could do
is act out scenarios and pretend with
each other so I started when I started
teaching right after school the first
thing we did we didn't have any real
prototyping tool kits that were at a
level that were accessible to designers
I created this project called what is a
switch where students had to just go to
the workshops and get scrap materials
just trash stuff in it was important
that it was free and in quantity like
drinking straws and things like that and
then imagine gestural interfaces how to
capture human gesture to close a
conceptual circuit and the important
thing is that not only is this analog
and before we have to start talking
about programming or anything like that
each student's responsible to bring back
50 examples in just from between a
Tuesday and a Thursday and that kind of
forcing them to speed through iterations
really you throw away the first 20 and
the rest are sometimes brilliant and
this is just one video there's more on
the web I can turn you on too I just
taught it in nozzle Norway recently and
every time there's really surprising
really amazing examples that come out of
it and you can see how they move across
different materials that the great thing
is when you find trash scraps sometimes
you'll find a whole bunch of triangle
they're cut offs from somebody else's
project and so you start by just working
with that geometry and that repetition
or this student invented a gyroscope
without knowing it those are dowels
inside a drinking straws he had never
heard of a gyroscope sensor and
accelerometer before and didn't have to
have any of that friction of working
with unfamiliar materials or or
techniques before he could start to
imagine how it would be in his hands so
I'm going to keep going on here then the
next thing that we could do Charles was
just telling me that Silicon Graphics
used to be in this building well they
used to be in our school too and since
we had a whole SGI lab and that's where
we learned alias and all that good stuff
but as I was graduating that hardware
had become dated and we were moving into
pcs we didn't need I ryx anymore and so
they they took all the computers out and
they brought them somewhere to hopefully
be recycled but they left us milk crates
full of the SGI keyboards and so I took
them into my class and we took them
apart and inside we took out the
microcontrollers and soldered wires on
to the the column in rows you know pads
and then we're able to create toolkits
for ourselves so we used flash which we
already were learning and had installed
and said you know take two wires
attached them to the hacked keyboard put
it to the metal door put it to the metal
door frame and then in flash say if the
letter A is up start the video if the
layer a is down stop the video so now we
were able to control the physical
environment with our gestural what is
the switch projects but using something
that didn't require any drivers it was
operating system level events now USB we
the bottom right here is a wireless USB
keyboard so in two thousand four thirty
dollars we were able to create something
we could stick inside of a foam mobile
model and have 30-something inputs that
was wireless across the room and there
was no other way for us to do it in that
amount of time so the next thing we did
wanted to be able to control actuator so
many people have used something like
Arduino or know what I'm talking about
okay so there's this really popular do
it yourself I'm trend now with Make
Magazine and arduino and there's lots of
toolkits out there used to be
pick programming or basic stamp and
things like that and the 90s a little
bit less accessible than it is today but
my company that started right as I
started teaching decided we needed to
make that easier to so what we did was
and we wanted to facilitate
collaboration between designers and
engineers we didn't just want to make we
didn't want to just take what was good
for engineers and lower the bar by
dumbing it down because we had to have
the respect in of both groups and so we
created something that you can use
either flash or java and there's
tutorials and really thorough
documentation for either environment and
then you can use them with our software
that's really just an XML socket server
that talks to over USB any of this kind
of hardware so any old MIDI instruments
any of this kind of wireless Arduino
fidgets RFID readers stuff like that so
now our students in literally a couple
of days are able to work with sensors
and actuators and flash and tie that to
the web and to animation into video and
all these things that they weren't able
to do before and so to give you just an
example this is a four day assignment in
Sweden they assignment was to think
about repetitive stress I'm so it turns
down a bit and how people get you know
bad hands bad eyes bad backs from
sitting and working at computers all day
and think of funny interface
interventions that would cause them to
have better habits so it's literally day
one industrial design graduate students
no programming no electronics experience
and then Monday Tuesday Wednesday they
are starting to build Thursday we're
debugging and friday we're exhibiting or
people are able to come and participate
in the ideas and now I teach nine weeks
out of the year and oh me oh and these
students are really special here we're
using a make controller by make magazine
and the people at making things in San
Francisco is Brian hinge from tell art
so here's one about needing to drink
more water it's just a simple force
sensor stuck under a beer coaster and
but it takes over your desktop you'll
see here
if you haven't taken a break in a while
your desktop will actually disappear on
you and you see the backstage of your
computer here and so to get your desktop
back so that you can go back to work you
have to ask your neighbor in the office
to pull on these handles with you and if
you hold it for 30 seconds then it
stretches your desktop back out with the
force and then this little blender makes
your fruit drink and the fan comes on to
cool you off and let sit back down these
are just little DC motors and confetti
inside of a plastic water cup you know
literally the first two days they're
getting exposed to stuff they've never
done before they build all the stuff in
about 24 hours and you're using a rubber
Mouse as a game controller using a shoe
taking this is just a hacked keyboard
stuck with upholstery foam and a blanket
into a chair every once in while your
desktop goes away and you have to do a
lap in the car in order to get your
desktop back and again this can be
plugged into any computer and run
connected to an swf that could be on the
web it just couldn't be less fussy is
our goal using a pedometer to solve sort
photos using an office chair to sort of
to navigate a PDF it's a little Fleck
sensor stuck to the piston on the bottom
of the chair a couple of four sensors
under your butt so you can lean one way
or the other than navigate there's one
at the end here is so most over I want
to say for you it's sharing photos with
your neighbors we're really really firm
believers in this philosophy of fake it
till you make it if people build
anything that isn't that's unnecessary
for the demo to communicate the idea
they get demerits so this one with the
two photos as much as we could have
spent today and done this you know with
a network and just have to flash movies
talking to each other we realized wait a
second we have to really long vga cables
and a computer with a dual display card
why don't we just make a really wide swf
put these things 30 feet apart and no
one will know the difference and it's
not because we couldn't it's because we
could move on we could think more about
the user experience instead of making it
work so this is a little bit of a
digression
really believe in this hands-on things
so being from a design school where
handcraft where we still use chisels and
mallets to make dovetail joints before
they let us use table saws before they
let us use CAD when I got a project to
work with Massachusetts General Hospital
this guy Ryan Bardsley and and the army
actually through an art school it was a
difficult thing to socialize around as
you can imagine so I kind of
untraditional to have the army come and
sponsor a project but because we were
making simulator for training combat
medics and we learned just how it what a
severe situation that is we took it on
and we did a lot of in the field
research and I can't really talk about
how exactly that some of the solutions
work but the reason why I show you some
of these images is just to illustrate
how these industrial designers faced
with a relatively high tech device had
their own approach that's valuable yet
and so we were taking force sensors and
sticking them inside a rubber legs
within two weeks instead of sitting in
Eagle CAD and solidworks for three
months before we had our first prototype
we literally just started pouring Dragon
Skin into into molds right away and so I
think the results are different too i
mean parts of the body are made out of
hacked camera tripods we didn't go down
in mill every part that we wanted
although any parts we did need we would
just go down to a bridgeport make it
ourselves here you can see we're just
using telios to do some of the Paulson
and arterial system controls these are
people from the Army Rangers came and
did a lot of testing for us but really
simple but incredibly powerful
presentation these guys had never seen
in one week I can just put pressure on
the femoral artery and it stops the
spurting of blood and I was using a
timeline in flash with keyframes to make
the blood spurt I mean it couldn't have
been more primitive but I think that's
the good part the nice thing about
designing something like this is you
have the perfect model around all the
time so we were casting muscle groups
and fat tissue and bones and we could
always kind of feel each other's arms
there was a lot it was a very touchy
feely class we cast fellow students and
teachers faces and hands and head
and all that stuff you can see I'll just
show you one more a little bit and then
we'll go on so this project still going
on its back at Mass General Hospital and
hopefully it'll get manufactured someday
so it's in still in the research world
but so we cast the hands of the Brown
University rowing coach and embedded it
with all of our electronics and bones
and poseable structures and I can't
really say much more about it than that
but you get the general idea and so what
this did for me the reason why I show
you this besides it having the combining
the industrial design and the
electronics is it made me realize when I
was doing research that I didn't know
how to ask good questions industrial
designers being told oh go BF nog refers
or go be anthropologists and I mean we
can throw those words around some of us
have taken ethnography class enough to
know that we can kind of fake it or do
whatever but we're not ethnographers are
not scientists but worse than that when
I would be making a lung I was asked
well go make a lung and when you get a
hole in the chest cavity you get a
sucking chest wound and tension
pneumothorax and you know this whole
cascading series of physiological events
and I didn't know how why should I know
that the pleural cavity of your chest is
a vacuum and that we don't suck air in
through our mouths we actually just use
our chest muscles to pull air in through
our mouse as an example and so I started
studying medicine and I became an emt I
started riding on an ambulance and then
got really carried away and really fell
in love with it and went to two and a
half years of paramedic school and then
1600 hours of clinical residences and
still treat patients in a trauma center
and emergency department and rhode
island i joined the i don't i didn't
want to you know become an ambulance
worker all the time although it's a
great job so i found other ways to apply
it him on the National Disaster medical
team for the department Health and Human
Services and train for deployments to
hurricanes and catastrophic events all
year and so we actually do it these are
and so just as part of that to give you
an idea how extreme it got and
and when I decided to kind of look back
at what my goals were when I set up and
this weird tangent i did a 48 hour shift
and got to deliver five babies within 48
hours and there are all girls and I left
there and I was speechless and I
realized that there was absolutely no
other way that I could have learned that
and there is definitely no way that I
can communicate that to somebody and
that's the same as some of these
experiential lessons that we create an
industrial design it just was sobering
as a teacher to realize there is a very
obvious threshold between what you're
able to teach and what people and when
you just need to set up a scenario for
people to learn things themselves and so
I'm going to breeze through this a
little bit but one of the projects
following that I tried to apply that
stuff in was we realized through working
on the disaster team that hazmat suits
from for medics really were awful they
are designed for firemen and firemen are
really in charge of these scenes but the
problem with hazardous material scenes
as people's airways are the first things
to go and the airway is the most
important thing without a Peyton airway
nothing else matters and so we realized
if met if people are waiting 30 minutes
plus we looked at a bunch of statistics
to get out of a hazardous material seen
through decontamination to definitive
care even to advanced life support care
then what we should do is try to make
suits that and training systems for
medics so they can get in and at least
intubate patients inside the hazardous
seen this is a major cultural problem
with the fire departments and and with
security it's a training thing it's a
cost thing but we took it on anyway
because we had the luxury of being
inside of education and so I had you
know been starting hundreds of IVs where
it was able to act as a dummy and we
which wasn't hard we took all the rubber
gloves and actually started trying to
really do some of these interventions in
the end to make a long story short we
created a suit that I know works much
much better than the state-of-the-art
one and we're now just kind of dealing
with the reality of technology transfer
out of a school into industry may or may
not happen but I hope
somebody is so we made a full-scale
model the the major things were you know
being short I a sailboat so I always
have these big pants so you can pull
suspenders and without that putting on
these suits and even a size small the
problem with things that don't fit
perfectly as a crotch will be between
your knees and so internally having some
Bibb suspenders based on my sailing
pants no matter how big the pants where
I could at least pull the crotch up to
to fit and you would keep you from you
know trip hazards and things like
integrating the jacket into the pants
things like the hood being integrated
into the jacket one person can do it
using the snap locking wrist we looked
at the psychological benefits of seal
assurance just that having the cliq
versus having somebody just duct tape
your wrist and hoping that they got
every spot I think was really a benefit
for the user and so this is will take a
whole history of suits to describe but
we made it so that was really efficient
you could use it within different level
hazards and so here's just a really
quick kind of non scientific proof of
concept the guy on the left is using the
state of the art suit guy on the right
is using our suit they have the same
amount of experience putting these on
and you'll see these these booties are
actually like dishwashing gloves
material and they're awful and our boots
are actually integrated into the pants
they're over shoes the guy on the left
is having help from somebody using this
really expensive duct tape called chem
tape to duct tape the seals so our guys
done at two minutes and you can see how
this goes on plus when we watch people
using these suits they're constantly
getting tangled in all of these elastic
bands and the wrinkly soft face shield
is becomes filled with condensation
right away and you can't see anything we
actually pipe a cool stream of air over
the head to keep the screen from Condon
saying but a cow
so there's our totally on scientific
experiment here's the doctor just doing
some different interventions with the
suit on so then again I wanted to find
fun ways to apply medicine so I joined
the National Ski Patrol speed up here
and then I threw a class about it I have
the luxury being able to pick topics or
the next course just kind of just in
time and so we looked at mountains and
you go to a larger mountain like
Blackcomb and from the very so somebody
gets hurt with let's say a femur
fracture the bottom maybe quarter of the
mountain or less depending on the size
of the mountain gets you can get
advanced life support in and ambulances
we're talking about where a person can
drive to anywhere above where you can
drive to and often helicopters are
impossible you get basic life support so
these are people that don't really
aren't trained in anything about
defibrillation or Airways or anything
like that so if you're stuffed you're
stuffed and so what we wanted to do is
be able to bring advanced life support
higher up because it takes up to three
hours to get somebody from the summit of
Blackcomb to the bottom it's so
according to looking at the statistics
from their ski patrol and interviewing
them directly and so um the if anyone
who knows anything about emergency
medicine knows you have one hour it's
the golden hour to keep somebody alive
or not so this needed a solution we
looked at all different kinds of
incidents here zuz actually we got
season passes donated to us and did a
lot of skiing during this class which is
really fun and so we actually did all
these mock injuries and brought patients
down the hill and time to ourselves and
looked at different scenarios where we
wanted to have different touch points
available to us during the process and
in the end we ended up with I think a
pretty nice solution it heats the drugs
it keeps the batteries warm so the
defibrillator last longer it charges
while it's being stowed with solar
panels and as I think one of the biggest
things that we innovated here was
thinking about how all the tools and
drugs are sorted and how they're grouped
into processes on pages that you tear
off with Velcro as you go through a
process or
how instead of keeping basic life
support separate from advanced life
support we came up with new categories
like ortho and soft tissue injuries and
airway more in the way that medics are
trained and so lastly Tellarite does a
lot of a lot of service design a lot of
products that are tied to services and
I'm sure this looks pretty familiar
these are personas going through
different software applications and
sometimes their physical their people
and buildings and mobile and and all
different kinds of interconnections
between tangible and intangible touch
points so making things visible is very
important just like making things
tangible is and so we actually have
watched surgical procedures and reduce
the number of screens on a touchscreen
device that's a surgical instrument by
watching how the the workflow back and
forth between the patient and the device
and how many times you're taking off and
putting on gloves and where the sterile
situations are and we're just clean
situations are and I think this kind of
visualizations been helpful for us
sometimes we need to tell these stories
to a larger audience we have to make our
graphics not just clear but compelling
this is a presentation about three
months of research so I led the summer
about the nursing home of the future and
then back to tangible this is a project
we did for nokia that they wanted their
graphic designers to be able to imagine
new mobile interfaces and rather than
having to constantly rely in tax the
engineering team we made it we hacked
some HP handhelds we made it so we used
a piece of software called side window
so the desktop resolution was extended
over to the handheld which is just
something you use with your PDA anyway
and that way they could take flash
movies stuff them off the corner of
their display and have them appear to be
running on the handheld they inherited
the touch screen without us bothering to
make a single-board computer I mean this
was delivered in three weeks and we took
one of our analog-digital converter
boards slapped it to the back and
enabled them to have up to nine analog
sensors and a bunch of PWM outputs two
LEDs and motors and vibrating stuff that
they could then have a
quick API and flash for so they could
say if somebody touches this thing or
some event happens in flash on the
screen now turn on this LED or if
somebody rubs their hand up and down on
the side of the device on a you know
linear touch potentiometer something
changed this in the Flash movie on the
screen so they're able to literally make
gooeys tied to new fit as
conservationists many times a day here's
those actually trying to solder onto the
little Jack's on the bottom of the
handouts but so that's just to get
started while they were playing with
that we were working on something that
more closely suit their needs they
needed 16 by 9 touch screen this is pre
iPhone they wanted to explore pre gphone
iPhone they want to experiment with
touch devices and so you know we
searched China we found the displays we
made a single board computer that runs
linux and then there it is and so on
this now they can have the flash player
and do all the things they could do on
that hacked HP handheld the idea is to
work iteratively so that they're always
busy they don't wait for us to do it
right the first time or wrong the first
time and then just to show how sometimes
things go through many iterations and
end up pretty close to the final thing
this is a power supply we designed for
nokia that's the zero power adapter so
it stops drawing power when your phone
is charged unlike the majority of
chargers in the world as part of a eco
initiative that they have called a
homegrown power adapter and so we did
all the eagle cad like electrical
engineering from scratch with this and
now there's now they're being tested in
homes and just to show you some apps
tied two buildings this is a real things
we faked at first and then we made it
work this is for Otis Elevator and you
can use an iphone application to
actually call elevators in a building
they know where you are in the building
and they come and get they tell you
which elevator to go to to maximize
efficiency and it actually works I can't
tell you how we faked it although i wish
i could buy promised i wouldn't but it
not faked it but you know a couple of
electrical engineers and a couple of
industrial designers made this actually
work in a safe way and about maybe a
month and a half so to some degree we
didn't bother going in and
re-engineering their elevator hardware
and software
we hijacked it but it actually works
it's in Connecticut and there's a quick
little video just some touchscreen stuff
go through this kind of quickly can't
talk too much about this stuff i'll show
you just a couple of images the idea of
we really try to work in web mobile and
embedded products and services we really
especially like it when we can connect
the web to mobile or mobile to embed it
or all three of them together this is
this is all I can really show
unfortunately of connecting elevator
cars to the web and two peoples
corporate badges and creating a
customized experience when you ride in
elevators and then lastly i descend with
a couple of funny ones we got invited to
go to conference in amsterdam huge
conference like 2,000 people and while
amsterdam pretty lively situation for a
conference and we were asked to create a
social RFID experience so everyone at
rfid tags tied to a pretty detailed
profile on the web you know where not
only were you from but what you like
what you don't like favorite books a
picture of you all this stuff so we went
to the pharmacy and bought a
breathalyzer on our way to the airport
and we hacked the breathalyzer into an
Arduino and plugged it into a computer
and then built an installation about
social breathalyzer maybe so there was a
lot of drinking going on at this
conference and base you could come up
and we dealt with the hygiene issue even
even though as a particle board box that
we built the night before you take a one
of a bowl of George our of drinking
straws and you stick it into a hole in
the top of a box and it tells you okay
blow and you blow and it says okay we're
reading your blood alcohol level which I
mean we did by just taking power off of
the buzzer that was the beeper on the
things we just knew whether it was high
or low we didn't bother trying to get
the percentage blood alcohol because it
didn't matter and then it tells you on
the screen okay you're you're drunk or
you're not drunk but the surprising
funny part is it shows you your picture
and it says you chw are now drunk and
you're among these people who are drunk
and these people are not
drunk and don't take rides home from
these people by picture faces and it was
really pretty absurd and as the week
went on we built this in four days as a
week went on we kept trying to add some
functionality to it some visuals like a
buoy that would float more sink more
depending on how many people were drunk
at the conference at that time and you
can see how it works people really did
trick it too they figured out that they
could skip ahead just a bit they figured
out that they could take a swish of
alcohol in their mouth and blow right
away and that they push it off the
charts and this would actually right
back to your personal profile to so on
the web it was keeping a log of what
your blood out whether you're drunk or
not at different times so here's a woman
using it for the first time she blows in
the straw she gets impatient she thinks
it thinks it's not done but the hearts
are the symbol of the conference that's
why the pink hearts everywhere so now it
says her name shows her photo and says
you're not drunk yet and this is an
early one and we tested some 650 people
I was pretty pretty funny this was a it
was a really interesting to try to make
something that in three days from hacked
Chinese electronics that would deal with
the abuse of 650 drunk people and it did
we left it for hours at a time and went
and watched talks and it never broke
which was amazing and give you an idea
we didn't have a piece of hose tubing so
I took a vga cable and cut the ends off
it and pulled all the wire out and used
that as the hose to go from the straw to
the breathalyzer that kind of working is
what I think we're most excited about so
there you go and then at the end here
that's yeah there's the chart of people
who are drunk and not drunk at one time
during the conference kind of a bar
chart of names and so to wrap it up into
tie all the stuff together we we do a
lot of we figured well we want to mate
we want to test new mobile device ideas
and we would love to have multitouch and
all this stuff what is it going to take
for us to make one of these things like
we made for nokia to do that and we
realized or why do that why don't we
just
and hijack the iphone take advantage of
its GPS text messaging calling all of
its high resolution video abilities and
everything but be able to attach as many
sensors and outputs to it as we want and
so we did it in a couple of different
ways and we've open sourced all of this
stuff because we don't sell it we get
more out of making relationships with
with people who want to innovate this
kind of stuff so you press on the force
sensor it changes the size of a ball
it's so little wireless board that we
created and stuck inside the protective
case on the back of the phone that ties
to these sensors and then communicates
wirelessly to the phone so you can then
we created a software environment that
inside of inside of dash code instead of
having to write objective-c to create an
iphone app we wanted designers to be
able to do it so we made a piece of
software that lets people like me just
use JavaScript and CSS to make to tie
these sensors to everything going on in
the phone and then of course we had to
make it into a breathalyzer right away
so it this actually works you blow in it
and if you blow above the legal limit it
offers to call you a cab in your area
code and our next invention is going to
be to black out the names of people you
shouldn't be calling depending on your
level and the last thing and this is a
thing that we just announced this week
at etech and made open source again it's
all on google code and documentation
source code everything and it doesn't
require a jailbroken phone you can you
can use it a couple of different ways
but instead of having this wireless
backpack on the phone and everything we
decided to make it simpler we tried to
make it simpler we took the headphone
jack we created a carrier tone the sound
goes out the headphone cable through a
resistive sensor like a force sensor
potentiometer a light sensor comes back
to the phone and into the microphone
jack this is just using the eighth inch
jack on the top of the phone and then
tie that to the entire interface and
accelerometer and GPS and calling and
everything else on the phone with our
dash code environments so I've got a
couple of the cables with me it's just
so nice to be so non-invasive so now
we're just dealing with how to
distribute it and get it out
people and it's free for non-commercial
use and it's under the GPL and so that's
it I just uh if I do I have a couple
more minutes ten minutes okay I'll show
you one more to show the power I think
of sketching in hardware we got asked by
humanness really close client of ours um
for a couple of years now to think about
childhood obesity what is it what can we
do to fight childhood obesity and so we
went to radio shack and bought a
pedometer and took it apart here it is
and put it on our own little project
board and hooked it up to our little
Arduino thing and made a quick little
flash game there in Kentucky so we made
a horse race and we went down there and
instead of telling the kind of boardroom
of vice presidents we'd like to use
wireless pedometers in an online game
for kids to you know compete against
each other running or walking and have
this fight obesity we were able to hand
these pedometers and this literally the
day before and the day after hand them
to people and have them race in the
meeting against each other I think you
can see some of it here I think that the
power of of getting them laughing like
that was really has really been a good
strategy for us again just using flash
and are not a software to pedometer is
hacked into an Arduino and a quick
little flash game of course I let the VP
win and then afterwards they said great
let's do it so we went and we worked
with the people who made the guts of the
nike+ pedometer rather than starting
from scratch and making a pedometer
ourselves which didn't make sense at the
time and we created game in Kentucky
there 150 kids in five schools we
decided the schools should compete
against each other and the kids should
compete against each other so this is
weird but the schools are represented by
school buses the kids are represented by
little kid horses on the buses and they
race around the world past major
monuments so when they're going past the
Great Wall of China we worked with the
teachers to give them curriculum little
lesson plans about the Great Wall of
China and tie that try to we're always
trying to tie the curriculum into these
physical activities we're hoping to do
more and more
we're on a version now that is going to
handle up to 50,000 users and has this
whole social networking ad hoc create
your own game I never would but I could
race against Charles I know he's
marathon runners I wouldn't start with
that but you know we could create an ad
hoc game against each other living on
opposite sides of the country and it
would text me and say Charles just
passed you so I'd go out for a walk at
lunchtime and try to pass him again and
so you get game currency and you can
kind of fix up your avatar so you can
buy a mask and snorkel for your horse if
you want and the teachers depending on
how the school is doing can soup up
their bus so they can put you know
chrome headers or whatever on the on the
bus and we did a little unscientific
testing with this too from watching the
activity levels of the kids when we ran
the game with just the output of how
many steps they were taking compared to
when we had the online game the activity
level went up a minimum of two hundred
percent which is pretty amazing and so
now we're running this in the UK and
we're going to come back and do a much
broader one in the in the u.s. we had an
award ceremony at the Kentucky Derby has
a jockey giving away the trophy to the
winning school so we're doing lots more
of that stuff this one I'm just gonna
because I can't pause it I'm going to
turn up the volume here this this
project I can't really let me do this
this is the last thing literally show we
taught a class called service design
last semester and the thing we really
tried to emphasize was using this these
physical computing tools and filmmaking
to fake it till you make it as much as
you possibly can but make us much of an
immersive compelling case for what
you're doing is you possibly can and so
here's a student project by adam meyer
molly rosenberg and maya growl and i
taught this and this is just a 3-minute
video final presentation for a concept
that they had and this student happened
to have a tiny bit of javascript
experience so he made a couple of little
bits but not any more than what is
demonstrated here so just let you watch
this one
I'm student I'm Chloe Doyle and I am
Simon urgent and i'm xavier dolan the
stockbroker hi my name is Debbie
Thompson and I'm a homemaker with two
small boys ages six and eight I like
eating at home obviously it's a little
bit cheaper it takes a little bit more
time but I think it's worth it in the
long run we used to be so creative in
the kitchen we used to make all kinds of
fun did we go to the enjoyment now with
the new diet we just can't scan ethos
anymore my boys are very picky eaters
and they can meet the same thing all day
long I'm getting tired of it um I do
love the option that foodie gives me to
choose between local organic budget or
otherwise I like supporting my local
businesses whenever I can and what I
can't do that booty does give me that
option ah booty is great because it
doesn't even feel like we're on a diet
anymore I mean I feel like we have such
great choices that we can eat whatever
we want yeah it allows us to plan our
meals in advance and you know just mix
their lives of lovin after a while
foodie knew my boys eating habits better
than I did foodie is a service design
concept that designs a week's worth of
meals specifically for the user and then
offers to have them delivered what makes
pretty so compatible with so many
different people is the signup process
during sign up the user would define how
many days a week they'd like to cook at
home the average price per meal they'd
like to spend how much time they have to
prepare each meal on average their skill
as a cook and the variety of food that
they'd like to have offered the user can
also define dietary restrictions such as
allergies diets and lifestyle choices
budi takes in all of this information
and consideration when designing the
meals for the user in our research we
found that while users may not be very
passionate about the types of food they
like they are very passionate about the
foods they do not like foodie looks for
patterns and the foods to try and
understand what it is about the foods
that I don't want the reasons a user may
not like spinach
or clams for instance may not be due to
the taste but actual texture instead
foodie looks these types of things when
trying to design the meals for each day
the user can the client's house idea to
be eating decided to be giving a
semester call us to cancel or domains so
finishing with the configuration let's
see what's for dinner if the user
doesn't like the selections they can
read choose if the user likes the meals
offered but doesn't like the days are
offered on they can move them around a
better fit than me if the user needs to
adjust the time or skill for an
individual day that can be done as well
once the mules are said the user is
presented with a grocery list of items
that will be ordered a total is
displayed in the bottom right-hand
corner and the user can select the items
they already have selecting an item
results in an instant reduction in total
price so the user has an instant
feedback as to what's going on the user
can also select the type of priority
they've liked for their food including
organic local premium or bargain the
price feedback is instant as well now
that the user is done they can select
check out and choose a day to have the
groceries delivered booties service
doesn't it also make a lot of fiscal our
groceries also have some couples truck
so there's leper soil rather already
here stamp is already Stamkos
mixologists or you're hard to manage
meal cost per person when the week is
throughout and the user is just a few
more features here but you do that's the
idea where ya did a workshop about this
at e-tech this week and something we're
especially excited about and doing with
more people as just how do you bring
screenwriting and filmmaking together
with these kind of low to medium
fidelity props through school computing
making things work just enough to create
these kind of compelling envisionment of
the future so that's it that's all I
have for you and I appreciate your time
and it's been a great pleasure to to
come here today to Mountain View so
thank you
gladly take questions if anyone has it
okay are there any questions somebody
who's already eaten lunch as give me a
question well um I think do I have one
for myself okay New York you guys hear
me um so I just have sort of a general
question so you work at RISD which is an
art school but your president is from
MIT and like a lot of these projects are
very sort of functional you know like
it's something you get actually sort of
market here in New York we have ITP
which has an art show every year and
like half the stuff is like you know
totally sir you know wild sort of art
stuff and and the other half of the
stuff people are like handing out
business cards and like trying to
actually sell it so I just was wondering
like what you think about you know I
think from a sort of from the sort of
observers point of view it can be very
confusing how to sort of digest these
these various projects that are some of
which are sort of very useful and some
of which are meant to be more sore
provocative and you know sort of morons
I serve our end of the spectrum how do
you sort of how do you what do you think
about that sort of tension do you think
it's okay for it to be like that or you
know just you think it's something you
should try to like help people with yeah
I think that's actually a really perfect
question um at I was with Tom I go this
week actually he's down at the tech
conference with us and we talk about
this stuff a lot and we have an annual
conference called sketching and hardware
where we come together and really talk
about these ideas with educators and
people doing this sort of stuff in
industry and I I do i think i agree with
you or i would say i do think that it's
good to have both of those things at
RISD we have a digital media graduate
program which is within the division of
fine arts so they really have a mission
to not have kin
strengths or design constraints or have
to worry about users and things like
that they'll use five projectors to make
a you know wearable keyboard or
something and not have to deal with any
of the kind of limitations that that
trying to market something or
efficiently manufacture something would
bring and I think that's good I think
you see things that are they the other
day I heard the head of the department
get asked the question how do you stay
current she says I don't stay current I
have to stay 10 years in the future and
so she's constantly thinking these are
dealing with these really really far out
art ideas whereas in our department I
find that the students really get most
excited and do their best work when they
have the most constraints when they're
told you can only work with wood you can
only have two switches it can only weigh
one pound and you know it has to be done
by Thursday and asked to work they are
most creative they don't feel that as a
limitation they take that as inspiration
so I'm glad that both of those things
exist and it's interesting that Tom at
the ITP program that you mentioned deals
with both of those things in one
classroom sometimes I have some rogue
factions that have to make art but we
have a sign that says no art in the shop
so I hope that answers your question
yeah thank you okay well thanks again
very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
