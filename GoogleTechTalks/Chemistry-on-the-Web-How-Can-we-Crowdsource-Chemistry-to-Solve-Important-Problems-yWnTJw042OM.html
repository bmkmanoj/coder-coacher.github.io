who's here with the University of Sydney
to talk about crowdsourcing chemistry
and the tropical disease initiative so
please welcome Matthew Todd okay alright
so first I should say thanks Carol for
introducing me and hosting the visit
thanks also to Chris DiBona who also
ultimately set up the visit and yeah I'm
an organic chemist so hopefully I'm
going to do a bit of bit of chem 101 to
make everyone familiar with what I'm
talking about but also going to be
talking a little bit about open science
and the purpose of my visit today really
is to preach that we need tools and
applications so one of reasons coming to
Google is that your apps are very
intuitive and so on and we need things
for conducting science in the open which
we currently don't have and one of the
reasons we don't have them is because
people haven't designed very intuitive
user interfaces for things to be used by
scientists to record their work in the
lab the the other real reason becoming
to Google today is because I recently
bought a Nexus One phone I lost the
little black sleeve that comes with
having to get a new one okay um so
there's gonna be a little bit of
chemistry and a little bit of stuff
about science and and how we do it and
maybe how we should do it so it's quite
a wide range of things and obviously if
you have any questions please just stick
up your hand and okay so a little bit of
I think I've still got an animation a
little bit of chemistry at the start
okay so I'm an organic chemist I teach
in research organic chemistry in
University of Sydney in Australia and
what does that mean well we we make
molecules so I have graduate students
and postdocs and undergrads who make
molecules so we put atoms together in
specific ways and one of the interesting
things about this is that as you do
chemistry for a long time and you learn
a lot about organic chemistry you learn
about how to do this and you
proficient at doing this both in your
mind and also with your hands so you
become good at putting things together
bringing out and atoms together in
specific ways to make complicated
molecules and this can be done in
several different ways what we do is we
we buy things come from commercial
catalogs and then we use chemistry in a
rational way to put things together and
we make important molecules that may be
a useful pharmaceuticals or agro
chemicals or fragrances and so on and to
do that sometimes you want to make a
really complex molecule which has
certain properties and you have to know
how to do that how to put an atom here
an atom there in specific ways and it
can be quite complicated in some ways as
it's shown on the top here the molecule
they might be going from the top left
might be obviously related to to the
thing you that you can buy so on the
right hand side there you've got things
in the box which you can easily buy and
put these things together in a kind of
like a lego manner and build up a
complex molecule which maybe have some
some nice property in other ways there
may be something available from nature
like the molecule in the middle on the
right which you can easily transform it
to something you might want so you can
buy that in large quantities from some
natural source and you can convert it
into something that you might want to
use so these are kind of ways of using
nature initially to make things which
are kind of complicated but in many
cases the molecule you might want for
example a thing on the bottom right here
is very it's structurally unrelated to
anything that you can buy or find and in
order to make that you might have to
think in a very lateral way about how
you can buy things and combine those
things to make a complicated molecule
and frequently we find this some
molecule that we that has some potent
biological property is not simply made
by a logical combination of starting
materials and this is a very creative
process so a lot of people say that
there's a lot of art in organic
synthesis to make a complex molecule you
have to have a deep appreciation for the
subject and think about it a lot and
perceive hidden patterns now the reason
why this is interesting for me was
because this struck a chord as the
parallels between this and a chess game
of who made before a chess game also has
certain rules that you follow and in
order to get to some final point some
complicated position or some winning
winning position you you have to follow
a certain path and the number of paths
diverged from the starting point
combinatory
so the number of possible games of chess
obviously is a huge number the number of
different ways of combining small
molecules to get larger molecules is
also colossal so the question that came
to me was well can we analyze how to
make a big molecule with a computer and
what the answer is obviously yes but no
one's done it what people have tried but
but the progress is quite slow
the contrast that struck me is that deep
blue obviously the computer program
beat Garry Kasparov at chess this is a
defining moment for AI I guess for
computer power and also soft development
something as complicated as chess could
be mastered by computer and beat the
current reigning world champion well
this hasn't happened in organic
chemistry so far for some reason people
have not designed software yet people
have made inroads certainly but haven't
designed software yet that can really
take on the Masters the big professors
at various universities around the world
who put organic molecules together so
this this stuff that I read this article
about this appealing for maybe some
progress and the application of modern
computational techniques to making
organic molecules and so far this hasn't
happened now the talk I'm the thing I'm
talking about today is related to this
why haven't we not me why having people
develop tools that help scientists to do
science online and in the open that is
the that is I guess the message why
can't we do that yet okay away from
chemistry to for a second I have a
product in my lab at one of them is
working in an area of neglected tropical
diseases now there are various diseases
in the world cancer aids big diseases
and malaria too there are some which are
neglected which means purely that the
amount of money being spent on them and
the amount of time being spent on them
is relatively small compared to their
impact socially and there are several
examples here's a graph from a website
that lists several and they usually have
rather complicated names to say but the
one that I'm interested in is this thing
called schistosomiasis which used to be
called bilharzia it's a parasitic
disease occurring primarily in the
regions shown on this map so it's mainly
a sub-saharan problem and it's a
particularly nasty disease it's a
parasitic disease and a parasite infects
you and lays eggs on you and these
or excreted into fresh water and then
these can be taken up the parasite
Metchosin is taken up by snail and
freshwater and then the snail the
parasite which was again in the snail
and that excreted into freshwater and
then you pick it up again there's a
cycle rather like malaria with a
mosquito is the intermediate host but
instead now you have a snail in fresh
water and it's unpleasant for several
reasons one is that the egg born in you
in your main major internal organs can
become very bad and you begin to get
very sick
you don't necessarily die from this
disease but it it affects it affects you
by morbidity so it makes you very sick
and it means is that children for
example you get the disease and not come
develop properly there you can't have
stunted growth and they they're very
tired then I go to school and this kind
of thing so neglected tropical diseases
like this often are measured by
something called that daily a
disability-adjusted life year which
doesn't take into account the number of
people who die but it tries to quantify
the impact of a disease on society and
by that measure of schistosomiasis is
actually a big problem affects more than
200 million people have the disease and
under 200 million people are at risk but
it colossal numbers actually now this
this is unpleasant but but thankfully
there is a good drug for it as with many
tropical diseases actually there are
drugs available to treat these things
they're not tremendously good drugs
necessarily but they're inexpensive
small easy to make and a few people
around the world have been suggesting
that we really need to focus on this
that that maybe the drugs aren't
fantastic but at least they're there and
we can use them and we can distribute
them for a low price so for example in a
Sisto some Isis the Gates Foundation way
back 2002 I think but uh maybe I'll be
corrected on that funded something
called the schistosomiasis control
initiative which operates out of
Imperial College in London the guy who
heads that up
Alan fennec now his idea was that we
have one drug available to treat
schistosomiasis and I'll come to that in
a minute and what we really need to do
is is distribute this drug enormously
widely to reduce the morbidity of the
infected populations so we take the drug
and we just distribute it to whole
populations of countries and this is now
happening in select countries in Africa
and other countries in Africa are also
the gun their own national control
programs so there's an article here in
public library of Sciences and the
collective disease as a whole journal
devoted to the neglect of diseases
called Africa's $0.32 solution for
hiv/aids it turns out also that this
drug use for schistosomiasis can also be
used to try and slow the transmission of
hiv/aids in Africa so there's a renewed
interest in the drive also from the
position of HIV so in general the idea
is that we try and use things we already
have so here is the drug that's used for
schistosomiasis now this is a very small
molecule these for those of you who
dropped out of chemistry organic
chemistry the lines of bonds rights are
where the line changes directions a
carbon atom and whether whether it
seemed to be double lines it means
there's two bonds between the couple of
the carbons the oxygen is obviously oh
and the nitrogen zem they have double
and single bonds there are rings there
but this is a small molecule this is a
very small molecule and this drug was
found through a screen it's not a
naturally occurring compound it was
franceour a screen of similar compounds
initially actually for a similar disease
in cattle and I don't know the story of
how it was worked out that it helps
people I don't necessarily want to know
that story but it was found out and the
drug was developed now this is a very
small molecule and can be made cheaply
so this drug through market force
actually is now made by a company called
Shin Puma out of South Korea who supply
the schistosomiasis control initiative
with their supply of praziquantel this
drug and it's got so cheap that this
drug is now available for around 12 or
11 US cents per gram which is absolutely
remarkable if you look up most starting
materials you you might want to buy to
try and make this molecule they will be
available for more than that so really
the it has been optimized and Optima is
off patent obviously the drug has been
optimized and optimizing is now -
available for a very low price so this
is great news
sadly the news maybe is actually too
good when a drug is this cheap and it's
being distributed to this many people
and killing this many parasites you have
a problem if you evolution tells us if
you try and kill something it's going to
do something to try and stop being
killed right
so the parasite presumably is going to
become resistant
to this or developed tolerance and this
is a big issue for schistosomiasis
because there are no other drugs
available to treat this disease so we're
in a very dangerous situation we're
using a drug to treat literally millions
of people sometimes whole whole
countries and villages and cities are
being treated with this drug and there
are no backups for when this drug fails
now there will be some people who will
say that resistance will not appear and
others who say will appear and there's
this debate going on my take on this is
better to be safe than sorry so a lot of
the research that we're doing in my lab
to do is just assume Isis is to for
example develop new analogs of this drug
before they're needed so drugs with a
slight modification it turns out in
medicinal chemistry if you have a drug
like this and suddenly it becomes
ineffective through the development of
resistance you can change a little bit
of it you can introduce a little group
on the left or a little group on the
right and you might be able to regain
pregnancy so we we're trying to look at
thinking about simple modifications to
the structure which is because that's
what we do we make molecules another
thing we might want to do is try and
find out how the drug works and still
after more than 30 years of use the
mechanism of action of this compound
isn't known which is quite extraordinary
apparently quite a common situation in
parasite medicine however there's one
thing that we can do right now and we
were in touch with the World Health
Organization to to try and discuss how
we can keep this drug good for as long
as possible and the World Health
Organization's perspective is that we
need to try and use this drug maximally
while it's still good
and there's a simple thing we can do to
try and postpone the development of
resistance and what you do is you
increase the dose of the drug right so
you give more the drug to try and kill
off partially resistant parasites one of
my students was giving a talk about this
and accidentally said that what you
should do is give more of the drug to
kill off the partially resistant people
and really get the wrong message the
point is the parasites become resistant
and you don't want that to happen so you
want to if there are some parasites
which are partially resistant we're
trying to kill those off by increasing
the dose 15-20 percent unfortunately the
amount of drug you have to take is is
large this is 600 milligram pill and the
field workers who have come to
conferences which I mean tell me
compliance is a real issue if you're
trying to give literally tens of
millions people that a drug sometimes in
very remote areas if the drug is too big
or tastes bad it won't be taken people
maybe an actually suspicious of
artificial compounds brightly colored
pills it also turns out the privacy
quantal tastes terrible
so there's another compliance issue so
you can't necessarily make the pill
bigger but you wanna increase the dose
so how do you do that well we as
chemists we we see a way of doing this
okay this some just a little bit more
chem 101 something this is this is an
issue in organic chemistry let's take a
few minutes here this is an issue in
organic chemistry that I wish the public
understood it's one of the most profound
and beautiful aspects of the universe
and this is not known generally by the
public a fundamental feature of organic
molecules okay
so organic molecules are their
three-dimensional unlike some of the the
drawings which I put up of
two-dimensional things the
three-dimensional things the real things
with with depth and structure and the
larger the molecule is like proteins are
DNA this structure becomes very large
but they're three-dimensional objects it
turns out that three-dimensional objects
can have this property called chirality
and this is all about a mirror image so
if you mentioned some object let's take
a symmetrical object like a ball if you
take a mirror image of that object that
the ball that you generate in the mirror
looks just like the first thing you
started with so the two mirror images
are superimposable they're the same
thing basically other objects familiar
objects to us on don't have this
property the mirror image is not
superimposable back on itself
actually the majority of things you see
in nature an array symmetric like this
your hands are a good example your hands
ostensibly look the same but if you try
to put them back on each other you can't
they're not superimposable which is why
your right hand doesn't fit in your left
hand wireframe this is very important in
nature because it turns out that the
molecules in nature almost all molecules
in nature bar from water and ions and
things I have this property that they
have a certain three-dimensional
orientation in space and almost all the
molecules nature have one orientation
and not the other one so if you imagine
just for a second that you're walking
along the street and you meet someone
you know and you want to shake their
hand that works one way around so if I
give my right hand to someone and they
use their right hand we
have a good hand-shaker if one arm uses
a left hand then the hand shakes all
wrong and and this is an important thing
when two molecules like this meet you
can have different kinds of interactions
and it's very important we get it right
so all of these drugs that we now take
which are now approved by the FDA you
have to define exactly the
three-dimensional arrangement of atoms
in space and it can't be a mixture the
two this was made tragically obvious by
the Navajo a familiar for the lid amide
story Follette amide has shown those two
structures on the right of the screen
and the difference only really is in the
structure is that in one case see where
that nitrogen is you've got the kind of
hash line that implies that that atom is
behind the rest of the molecule and on
the right-hand molecule the the nitrogen
has a kind of sick watch going through
it that applies to about half the
molecule is in front of the rest of the
molecule these two things are mirror
images they're not superimposable and if
you take one it has a very different
effect from the other so it turns out
the one acts as a sedative it's thankful
for a morning sickness I think but the
one of these other molecules inhibits
the formation of limbs on fetuses and so
this was a tragically realized when
these babies were born deformed through
through this drug and since then it's
been definitely required that we have to
specify exactly what would give people
when when they take drugs if Jones said
actually this molecule into converts the
to when it's in the body so it's not
that easy but but the principle remains
the same that one of them is very bad
for you and one of them isn't and this
has rather nicer implications in the
case of the molecules on the bottom left
here this is limonene and the reason I
put this picture my wife up there
holding lemons and oranges is one is the
picture of her want a mirror image and
as lemons and oranges in both hands one
of these molecules is responsible for
the smell of lemons and one is
responsible for oranges so they're two
mirror image molecules if you smell one
you get lemons if you smell the mirror
image molecule you get lemon so it's
very important that we have molecules
that specify exactly the
three-dimensional arrangement in space
now why am I telling you this
well partly because I think it's the
most beautiful thing one of the most
beautiful things about the scene that
this is a very profound thing about the
way the world is I'd love to explain
this more widely but unfortunately a job
however this is relevant to praziquantel
the drug that I'm talking about so the
structure I gave you before didn't have
that little Wiggly H on the top now that
little that carbon in the middle there
where the H is attached
especially it's got four different
things attached to it and that means of
that that makes a small if you're chiral
it means that in one case if you
mentioned that the hydrogen that's
that's on the Left were the kind of
wedge and it's coming towards you and
then on the right side you've got the
hydrogen going away from there these two
molecules are mirror images you don't
really see that because I've turned it
round but they're mirror images the one
on the left is the drug that works and
the one on the right doesn't do anything
in fact it has mild side effects and in
fact the one on the right that doesn't
do anything is the one that tastes bad
so we just want the one on the left
that's it how easy is that to do now why
don't we just
instead of making both and giving both
to people so it tastes bad and there's
too much drug why don't we just give the
one on on the Left which has the right
orientation well that's actually quite
difficult so these molecules are
difficult to make when you have to
specify exactly the orientation in three
dimensions of where all the atoms are
and to give you a sense of that I guess
if you think about the bowl here on the
bottom left it's a symmetrical structure
it's very easy to make something like
this because you can have like a
spinning wheel and and it's simple to
make something it's symmetrical and
round right in the middle plugging plus
one I'm on the lju on the border plus
one disclaimer the this is a more
difficult thing to make because it's not
sorry it's still symmetric but it's it's
less symmetric than the bowl something
you've got you've got to make that the
round part which is quite easy but bring
the handle on you can to do that by hand
this is a more complicated structure
when you get to a symmetric structure is
like this Rodin sculpture that's
actually very difficult to make right
because you've got a with your hands put
things in various different places so
the the less symmetric something is the
more difficult it is to make I guess and
a lot of molecules in nature are
extremely on asymmetric they have little
bits here in there that you have to
install by not while kind of by hand
except of course the molecules are very
small it's how do we do this well of
course we have to design other molecules
that because our hands and install
things in certain places it's very
demanding it's an area called asymmetric
synthesis in organic chemistry and
hopefully people throughout the whole
careers like me to to this area how do
we make molecules in three dimensions so
it's very demanding and so unfortunately
praziquantel has this feature and if you
want to make one rather than the other
it's difficult making both at the same
time very straightforward easy but maybe
one rather than the other is difficult
so this is where we were a few years ago
we thought well the World Health
Organization wants just the one active
form of the drug it's called an
enantiomer the active in antemer of the
drug they don't want the inactive one
they want that because then they can
reduce the pill size by half and the
pill doesn't taste bad it's smaller and
you can increase the dose even a little
bit so it's a much more effective pill
the problem is that as soon as you try
and make one and antemer rather than the
other it becomes an expensive thing
people like me have to get involved
maybe think about ways of doing there
how do you install that hydrogen on one
face the molecule rather than the other
when a molecule is so small you can't
put it there with your an end so we were
thinking about this an unfortunate rogue
is already very cheap so how can I
justify assigning academic resources to
reducing the price of something I will
be fine if I did that right that's not
academic work to try and gradually
reduce the price of something iterative
it'll be over several years this is not
a problem that is solvable by academia
by any means we would we we are
obviously in the business of trying to
get out high-impact research in new
frontiers and we're not in the business
of reducing the cost of anything on the
other hand if we turned to industry they
would not be interested at all in this
problem because there's no money to be
made in tropical diseases there's no
money to be made in taking an already
cheap drug and trying to modify a little
bit so there's no real market value for
that this is already a very very cheap
process to make the the combination of
the two enantiomers so we were left with
this problem a few years ago of thinking
well this is an important public health
problem that the World Health
Organization would like to solve we
can't solve it with academia and we
can't solve with industry and this is
seems like a non pass right what do we
do if I try to this graph is meant to
indicate that if I try to assign people
to to increase the EE this got the
enantiomeric excess which is a measure
of how much of one of those molecules
you have rather than the other and you
try and increase that and by piling
dollars on the program
it doesn't really you get to this point
where you can't anymore assign any more
resources to this problem you've got
reach a breaking point we say I simply
can't justify this anymore
and simply as you assign more people to
this problem you think well is this
really worth our while how do we do this
in traditional models we can't do that
so in the case of of this we thought
well I was actually on my honeymoon at
the time and I was thinking how do we
how do we solve this problem what I need
to do is try and collaborate with as
many people as I can
so this is new to me a few years ago it
turns out that of course well you guys
know all about this you guys know all
about open source of things the idea of
open source is being somehow illustrated
by this comparison between the cathedral
and the bazaar
so in academia in academic research in
chemistry by and large we operate on the
cathedral model I am the professor in
charge of students and any of my
resources my grants and we work usually
pretty much in isolation
using the suppose of intelligence of me
and my students to try and solve
problems where this autonomous unit that
does collaborate occasionally would
select people but we are closed Union
and we were thinking about how to try to
solve this problem and we couldn't the
contrast between a cathedral is the
bazaar where anyone can contribute and
everyone's opinion is valid and you
listen to many people as possible to
Bonnie trying solution to a problem now
you guys will know a lot more about this
than I do so this is new to me and I
haven't read the records at literature
about this but this was the essential
contrast that we were seeing and
basically we don't operate in science on
a bazaar model we use the Cathedral so
we don't tend to discuss problems openly
with strangers and a large number of
people we don't know and try and get a
solution through the community just
doesn't really happen you tend to
publish papers in academic journals and
people don't respond to that but it's a
very slow process as them direct
discussion between people unless you
actively collaborate these are very
different models and as I understand it
things have gone very well for the
bazaar model in open source so from my
naive non could be a science perspective
it seems as if projects like Firefox
Chrome Wikipedia these things have gone
extremely well between any powerful
programs they're developed really
quality products I think a lot of people
tend to associate outside the movement
people tend to associate open source
with
endeavors which are which are purely
done by volunteers and which are not
funded and of course this is this is
wrong what I hear a lot of projects that
are open-source
have involved they funded Colonel of
activity to which people then respond
and help out the example that maybe
that's relevant here is as I understand
it the Chrome browser was developed by
guys here but is open source that people
beyond these walls can help change
modify and updated that's my
understanding
right on so schematically I put these
together this is um two again rather
naive ideas about how you you do things
in the two different ways it's been
pointed out I should have put some women
rather than the men icon sorry I just I
was in a bit of a rush so on the left
here you have the traditional way of
doing a doing science which involves
people working in labs submitting
articles to peer-reviewed journals
waiting a few months and then they were
viewers of that article who are
anonymous usually maybe one or two
people say yes or no the article gets
published and then people read that in a
literature and then people design their
own response to it to their own research
published an article again that the
timescale is quite lengthy here involves
months of waiting around while the
review process happens and in some cases
peer review is of course flawed I don't
to get in that discussion right now but
peer review is an excellent system but
it does have these big flaws that
sometimes you can get referees who maybe
are not impartial maybe they're a vested
interest maybe sometimes there's only
like one referee on an article and then
that appears in print and it's then
sanctioned is being valid typically
articles published in academic
literature don't have feedback on them
if you want to criticize an article you
have to publish a substantial paper that
refers back to the original it's not a
very interactive process it's also
fairly slow so the calendar icon has
been indicate that it's a slow process
and cost a lot of money we apply for a
lot of money to do this and in some
cases we're competing with people who
are doing similar research to us so in
many cases we may be duplicating effort
on the right the idea is that instead of
doing that why don't we post a problem
to the community have as many people as
we can reach helping us out with a
scientific problem and publish our
results in real time which are then peer
reviewed after they appeared so after
publication
this is not a model that operates in
science at the moment this is not how we
do things at all science operates pretty
much on the basis of peer review before
publication not after publication so
Wikipedia is an anthem at a lot of
scientists because corrections happen
after something is made public notice
that so open science is the thing on the
right there that data would then be
published in real time as its acquired
and people would be able to respond as
they see fit
and collaborate with you in real time
even though you may not know who these
people are this very important
qualification is this is not the same
thing as open open access in journals
open access is where of course you can
read things for free but the research
may have been done in a very traditional
way open access is a very worthwhile
pursuit journals is very important that
journals are open access but it's not
the same thing as open source or open
science where community participants can
actually have an input into the project
itself so if for example I design an
organic synthesis of a molecule anyone
and I posted that as an open science
project anybody in the world could then
come along and say now I don't need to
do there you should try this and in fact
I'm going to try it in my lab and I'll
get back to you with what's gonna with
the result of that at that synthesis so
anyone can change the project and we
post it for further community input it's
a very different way of doing things
okay so I should mention that a lot of
people are doing this already
some people they know they are up on the
top left there for example is
jean-claude Bradley who's at Drexel
University in this country who have
something called useful can project that
useful can project which is its aim is
to do open science where he's trying to
make molecules that will eventually be
used to treat malaria jean-claude
actually practices something as a
proponent of something we'll open
notebook signs the extreme form I guess
of
I've opened open science were your lab
book is on the web completely for
everything everybody to see so every
single datum is published on the web
there's a picture those Steve Koch who
has a biophysics lab in university
Arizona who also has everything he's
doing is on the web and a bunch of other
people even build a garden camera
Nayland daniel mentioned who are among
several zealots of the of the open
science movement and they're very
frequent commentators are on on how we
should do this so
there's a very passionate community lots
of people I haven't mentioned passionate
community about this that is still
incredibly small and we tend to have
meetings where we all get together and
talk about this thing and the outside
world the larger scientific a bit
doesn't tend to pick up on what we're
doing unfortunately however there are
examples on the web of lots of projects
which have used open methods this is a
smorgasbord of all these things and they
vary a lot so for example on the top
right the GenBank initiative that's not
really open science it's um it's a
depository of information where people
can deposit genetic information and can
be retrieved free this isn't really open
science because you're not really
changing things and collaborating on the
site but it's open data a very important
massive open data resource the folder
program is an interesting one if you
haven't seen it it's a game which the
public can play to try and help people
to work out how proteins fold so in a
very ingenious bit of software
development suddenly made a computer
program to allow the public to get
involved and it turns out the public are
very intuitive about this and have
really good ideas about how proteins
default amazingly the open dinosaur
project is is is something where the
public are being involved in in
measuring bones of dinosaurs from from
from the literature and collecting data
galaxies there is something similar in
astrophysics where people are
classifying galaxies these are what
these are projects where public input is
required and used very effectively on
the other hand there's something called
a tropical disease initiative which was
started by several people including a
guy who gave a talk here called Mark
Marty Burnham which is a sister site to
the site that I'm involved with there's
also a big movement for trying to find
drugs for example for tea bean called
the open source drug discovery project
which is an Indian project which was
started fairly recently and then on the
bottom left here you have some VOC
chemspider which is which is a community
centered resource for chemistry very
unusual chemistry has an unusual history
we have a lot of very powerful very
wealthy organizations who have become
involved in collecting and and curating
chemical data and these things are
usually
these applications are usually quite
expensive and universities tend to buy
subscriptions to these things to gain
access to information if you're not in a
university which has that kind of
resource that has those resources then
it can be quite difficult to get your
hands on that kind of information but
chemspider is something which is on the
web and anyone can upload chemical data
to to chemspider so it becomes a
community centered resource and was
recently purchased by the Royal Society
of Chemistry who is keen to promote this
so this is a selection of different
things where open projects are involved
or open data are involved and some of
them like the Galaxy Zoo and open
dinosaur project are actually web
web-cam this community input so public
input to the project openwetware the
last thing I want to mention is a site
where anyone can have a lab book online
free and post data of any kind that they
wish it's it's a very impressive
initiative operates on on the basis of a
wiki so in order to have a page on this
you do have to be a little bit sadly
with with how to write wiki pages but it
is completely free and open and anyone
can have a lab and a lab book on the
site so it's very impressive
we started out a few years ago with this
website called it's a big leap so if you
would like to see more about it please
just google it and have a look at it the
idea is it's a basic with blog
functionality and we posted our problems
with schistosomiasis on this website the
intention of the site is actually to be
an open sign site for anyone to conduct
any projects they want in anything to do
with biomedical research we started with
the schistosomiasis project because
there's a philanthropic angle I guess
the the idea of spending some of your
spare time helping us out when this
project is to do with a neglected
tropical disease gives participants you
know good karma right so if people feel
good about contributing to this but
really it's the aim of it is to have
something which is wider so you can you
can do any kind of collaborative
biomedical research on the site so up on
that up on the top there this is just
the research community and on the bottom
there's an example of something that my
postdoc recently did which is a chemical
reaction which we did in the lab and
beneath that diagram there's all the
data about how that worked and what
including the Ross spectral data of what
we did now I just want to mention
something about this this is a limited
functionality it still operates as a
block it's built on Drupal and I don't
know about you but whenever I see a blog
post which is interesting and for which
there are several comments maybe ten or
so comments by the time the comments get
to about ten or so I bite um I'd can't
be bothered reading them a blog
functionality is really quite limiting
this you can't do a huge amount with
this and in terms of community input
it's actually quite limited in what
people can do what we really want is to
have this but much more intuitive and
functional at the moment it's very
linear and very flat we're doing our
best with this but I think we need
something that's much more intuitive and
that's really what I'm trying to get at
here because before I get on to the
Nitty Gritty of they're just a couple of
other advantages of open science more
generally the idea of doing this on the
web so the project we're posting here of
course is asking the community to help
us devise a synthesis for this molecule
for a very very low price the other
advantages of doing science like this on
the Left is transparency you may have
heard about the the the controversy
surrounding the climate change emails in
in the UK the University of East Anglia
this idea that the public thought that
there was science that was being hidden
from public view where perhaps some
research allegedly was being suppressed
because it didn't agree with the idea of
climate change this doesn't do science
any good to have this kind of public
perception of what we're doing and it
there's a real advantage in doing open
science is that everything is
transparent and you can see what's going
on and nothing is hidden and I think in
terms of a public science that's going
to be very important in the middle as
this picture of a starfish again this is
apparently an IT analogy the starfish
and the spider open projects don't have
leaders the project that we're doing at
the moment I don't have to be the
project is the important thing and if I
decide to do something else or if I am
cool the way to do something else then
somebody else will take over it's a
leaderless organization which is a big
advantage for open projects somebody can
take care of anybody can take over and
anyone can take on side projects and
lead things the third picture is meant
to imply speed to me one of the big
advantages are open sciences is speed of
progress I my theory is that one of the
thing that we're trying to test out in
the next few years is an open science
project where anybody can contribute and
experts identified themselves will
operate faster than a closed lab project
that's the hypothesis and we are hoping
to try and test that in the near future
but we're starting with our synaptically
project for this drug the picture of the
plankton here is meant to remind me that
the one important lesson we've learned
it would open science over the the free
spirit that we've been doing it is
something which i think is very well
known to IT professionals who have been
working in open source which is that
it's not enough to post a problem and
have the community input you have to
post data first you have to those
results to which people respond and this
was very clear to us with the synaptic
leap which for the first couple of years
of its existence was very quiet because
we had no funds and their resources to
put people on the project we then went
the long route and asked the Australian
government for funding for this project
with the World Health Organization as
our sponsoring partner and we secured a
grant for this project in mid-2008 which
took a while to get signed off but is
now active now we have somebody working
in the lab who's posting real research
data as it's going on and that means
that people have a lot more to get that
T stuck into we've just started but it
means that people can now respond to us
it's crucial I think in any open science
endeavor or any open source endeavor to
have sometimes a funded kernel of
activity which people can respond to
that's our important lesson ok so I want
to say something about experimental
science and then I want to do my appeal
for applications so this is the real
nitty-gritty
being an experimental chemist being an
organic chemist is very like being a
chef you
you have things your resources you buy
things in you combine them with various
apparatus which you have in the lab
other other things in a chemistry lab
have a corollary that's in the kitchen
it's amazing you have you know a gas
flame in a kitchen we have a Bunsen
burner you you tend to boil things off
maybe you want to reduce something and
take take water off something we have
something with that in the lab lots of
things that we we use in the lab were
very similar to kitchen at a kitchen
kind of chemistry this is a picture of
one of my students a hammock Minea who
his bench is is right to the left there
and he has all the stuff laid out and
his team cupboard which is the thing he
uses for toxic stuff is behind him a
bench chemist will come in early in the
morning 8 o'clock in the morning will
think about what they're going to do
they'll design an experiment they'll get
their chemicals together and use glass
and glassware and metal things and a
bunch of different things to view their
chemistry they'll run a reaction they'll
effectively taste it as you do in your
chef by sitting a spoon in and and
looking at in the chemistry lab you
never do that but you there are ways of
testing what's happening in your
reaction and then you you isolate the
thing you've tried to make you analyze
it with some instruments and then you
write up what you've done this is what a
chemist does in their life the analysis
is kind of complicated as a chef you
taste things because your tongue is a
pretty sophisticated thing in the lab
you have to take the molecule that you
think you've made and put it into some
very large expensive instrument which
then analyzes if that's the right thing
there's a lot of data here for example
the instrument we use the most
we take our molecules and we put it into
this large superconducting magnet and we
spin this molecule very very quickly and
we blast it with electromagnetic
radiation and rather like when you hit a
bell you listen to what comes off the
molecule after you've done that so when
you strike you're barely going to listen
to the turn and of course what you get
off the bell is all the sort of
vibrational data which is very
complicated and your ear transforms that
into one note similarly with something
called NMR spectroscopy in the lab we we
take molecules and we we blast with this
radiation we get this very complicated
signature that comes off we use
something called a Fourier transform and
get these lines on a piece of paper and
that the sing
John those are those lines and how they
appear allows me to say yes that's the
molecule we thought it was or no it
isn't lots of big instruments get
everything lots of data but in a typical
day a student will use all of these
different things if that student is
meant to tell another student how they
did something how do they do that well
they can write up something in a
traditional paper that often hi instead
all things that you might have done
which are special in the same way that a
recipe book
often the recipes don't work you don't
quite follow the instructions right off
something we just missed out or the
decimal point wrong someone if you want
to capture the research process you need
you need ways of doing that that are
really quite data rich so you want to be
able to capture things with audio and
video you'd like to be able to post raw
data to a website rather than the
interpreted lines that we tend to get so
to maximize the amount of data that you
publish and really you want something
which is quite intuitive and rich if you
want somebody to follow what you've done
for example also in the lab that's me
talking to one of my students else here
we have these these fume covers with
kind of perspex covers and often we
write on them like you write on white
boards at the back here if you're going
to collaborate with someone you want to
be able to easily collaborate with them
as if you were sitting next to them with
a coffee talking about science and
really at the moment we can't do that
outside my lab we can't collaborate with
people who are outside of sitting
outside my lab if we've got a problem we
go down the corridor and talk to a
colleague but if we want to throw this
project open to the world we need a
really intuitive way of collaborating as
we would in a normal lab how do we do
that and how do we how do we maximize
the input that people are going to give
us well
something which I think maybe some of
you will know as IT professionals is
something called stack overflow maybe
some of you heard of that which is a
site where you can post code and ask
people to help you out solving certain
problems with code that works really
well because you can cut and paste code
and stick it on the web page and people
can rapidly respond it's also very nice
idea because you can have medals awarded
to you for valor of service right and
your reputation increases so it's a good
way of trying to develop a reputation
for yourself as someone who can help
people solve problems of course that's
good for text but for experimental
science this just doesn't really exist
something has been has been started can
Pedialyte by
by a guy in San Diego resharper dhoka
who has taken the basic functionality
and tried to use it the chemistry at the
moment it's quite text-heavy but it's a
very good idea to try and use the same
idea in in experimental science because
what we need is something again it's
still very much more intuitive and
allows data rich things to be posted
allows links to online pages where all
your data are posted allows links to
online lab books for science so
basically the structure we need is
something which is an intuitive lab book
on online where all the data are linked
with your experiment and which can
easily be analyzed by somebody else as
part of a collaboration and
collaborators can post to your webpage
you
you
you
we type text and that's fine and even
post something like that but there is no
chemical content in this their words and
they're not understood by a machine to
be referring to molecules or chemicals
so the text is quite dead and if
anything was going to you wouldn't
really have a lot of input from the
computer about what is chemical
information and what isn't to be able to
take text and convert that to something
which is chemically rich so where wood
is associated with a molecule and can be
searched and analyzed and indexed would
be tremendous for HTML XML and a guy
called Peter Marie Russ developed a
language called CML which is chemically
rich markup language and has worked with
Microsoft and it has a root word here
whereas it worked with Microsoft the
developer cam were a word ad in a Word
document can be searched by a machine
and the chemical information can be
annotated and extract it automatically
so when you hover over a word you get a
structure and you can change the
structure that changes throw in a PhD
thesis for example this becomes a very
rich document where all the chemicals
are part of the actual fabric of the
text and are not simply woods another
example it's just recently brought to my
attention with something called
chemicalize org this takes any given web
page and extracts chemical information
and you can see what's happened here is
that in the usual latin text you're
going to pages it's spotted b2 carotene
which is the molecule and if you hover
your mouse over that you get the
structure of the molecule if you click
on that you get taken to a page where
there's a bunch of chemical information
about the molecule this is very useful
and makes for example HTML pages very
rich for a chemist it means it can be
searched very effectively we could do
with something like this actually for
drupal so given the drupal is open
source what we really need is an extra
button on this menu up here which says
ok take the text that I've just entered
here scan it for chemical information
and please annotate these individual
words so that the the page when it's
published it's clear that these
molecules are in there so if I write the
word benzene and I it's what the other
molecule and then on the HTML page it's
published that becomes an active wood
that can then be searched effectively
and can be annotated in this way that
would be a very nice project that we
could do
which would enhance Drupal a great deal
for chemists and make the resulting
webpages that we make much more
functional okay so the last just just
summary the summary of where we are this
is my my son hobbies playing with his
first molecule which is great start him
early you know but this is this is how I
feel with this with open science I have
absolutely no idea where we are going to
be definitely going and how we're going
to get there
but it feels right it feels as though
science that is thrown open where
anybody can help us out and nothing is
kept secret is the real spirit of
science it's it's it's fast and it's
transparent and it's generous of spirit
this project that we're doing where we
are trying to get the price down of this
drug with the World Health Organization
we've got another 2 and 3/4 years to
solve that problem it needs to work we
have to be able to show that by
massively distributing a collaboration
like this where everything is in the
open we need to show that we we can do
that and we need input from chemists all
around the world
fickle early process chemists to work in
industry to help us with this problem
the price constraint is extremely severe
and it's a it's a real challenge run
again at chemistry of course what we'd
like to do eventually with open sciences
is to move beyond philanthropy we are
doing a project which is organic
chemistry but which so it's it's hard
for physical science but it does have a
philanthropic element where people might
contribute boost they feel good what
would be nice is to try and move into an
area which is academically hot where
there's a lot of activity at the moment
and people are competing with each other
to show that an open science project
could actually generate papers and
results faster than traditional close
collaborations that were quite exciting
but it's not something that we're doing
right there generally that the dollar
sign there indicates that countries want
maybe thought by many people about open
open source open science also may well
need funded kernels of activity where
projects are small projects are funded
and lots of the scientific community can
respond to us now that to me would be
extremely attractive if I was a funding
agency who wanted to fund scientific
projects if I was a government agency I
wanted a front scientific projects
what I would do is try and fund a kernel
of an activity and then have a wider
group of people help me out they
leveraged more activity from my funding
dollars there's an advantage there of
course that I've covered before is that
once the funding runs out the project
doesn't have to stop it's this
leaderless organization the project can
continue and I guess the last thing is a
more general point that open data are
very important
the idea that open science of course
shares data as many people as possible
and this is always going to be a good
thing that if we have data in labs which
the public have funded through taxes
those data should be available for
anybody to see and open science
obviously necessitates open data as part
of its its reason for being so my main
appeal of course there is is just to
close is that at the moment we do not
have really good intuitive tools for
scientists to collaborate over large
distances effectively we have tools that
are that require tutorials to use my
students are very busy the very busy
making molecules in the lab and they I
know what's going to happen if I ask
them to try and learn how to write a
wiki page or sit through a tutorial
about how to use something they are
going to say they're just too busy
those are my students some of the most
receptive to this that I know of track
trying to ask a an experimental science
student to to learn something before
they can post their data online to me is
like asking Gordon Ramsay to learn
Arabic right this is silly he wants to
do is cooking and generate a product he
doesn't have to learn a language to be
able to do that and with canvas with
experimental science students we need
applications with applications which do
not have tutorials in them so that
scientists can rapidly gain and comment
on each other's work and share data
effectively so given that I've never
needed to look at a tutorial for a
Google app I came here right so I used
Gmail and Google Docs and Picasa about
reading early I just started using it
because it was intuitive if we could
develop that for a lab book for an open
shared electronic lab book that would be
fantastic
we my lab is collaborating with a guy
called Jeremy Frei the University of
Southampton to try and link online
electronic lab books to machines in a
chemistry school so data
meshed with with an experimental
technique if we could expand this to
have a front-end that was incredibly
intuitive to use
I think we'd go places I think a lot of
scientists would love to do to share
what they're doing if they had an
effective intuitive tool to do that and
that's really my appeal is for something
I had to to to happen a dialogue between
IT guys and experimental guys PhD
students in the lab we know what they
need to try and develop a real killer
app for an online shared electronic
notebook okay well so with that I went
to get more your time I just want to
thank Carol again and Chris and thank
you guys for coming along and listening
to this idea yeah okay so the idea that
if you open everything up to the world
you're gonna commit professional suicide
yeah I mean I that's at the moment I
think that that's that's certainly the
perception there are some brave souls
who are who are doing it anyway a couple
of people I just mentioned
it's interesting the there is this sense
there is a sorry there's this prejudice
that if you publish data online you
can't then put it into an academic
journal and actually for some of the of
the high-impact chemistry journals
that's true so I can't publish in
certain big journals if I've already
released data in many cases that's not
true so I if I have published everything
on the web and I decided summarize down
in a paper and a submit in nature
they'll take that paper so there are
lots of journals which are happy to do
that but this is a test case how many
journals will take that those kinds of
papers and how effective are they I
think that if you can do that if you can
still publish your work in journals
which are traditional journals then I
think you'll be okay
the question about whether you get
screwed is in other things they have a
great idea and you then put it on the
web what are you gonna do of course if
something is commercially sensitive and
you want to patent it then of course you
can't do that that's that's off limits
where something is not and and it's
something which you don't foresee to
have commercial interests my my theory
is that by opening it up by recruiting
more collaborators your science would
like to go faster that's my theory
but I no one's done that yet I don't
know if it's going to work there was a
nice example last year I think a guy
called Sean Cutler who's a biologist UC
Riverside I think who had a nice result
that he found he's a plant biologist but
a nice result that he found and rather
than publishing his nice result he went
out actively to recruit his competitors
and then together they published a much
larger piece of work in the journal
Science which is an incredibly high
impact paper and amazingly well cited
the idea is that you can go out and
actively get people to help you out is
an anthem to a lot of scientists who
maybe don't necessarily want to crush
their competitors with what they've done
but I think this is this is the next
exciting frontier to me is whether it
accelerates your science if it does then
I think Kenya committees will be rather
excited about alright thanks thanks guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
