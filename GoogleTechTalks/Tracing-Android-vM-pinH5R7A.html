Nexus team today I want to talk to you a
little bit about tracing the various
layers of Android and particularly i
want to show you how to analyze a trace
that captures information both from the
application level various parts of the
framework and the colonel and having
that all be in one trace so this is an
overview of what i kind of want to talk
about is compare tracing and sampling
when we talk about profiling show you
how to capture a trace and how to
analyze it how we trace or instrument
Java C++ and kernel code which is all C
and then i'll show you a quick anecdote
from one bug that we were taking a look
at in perfect triage so to start with to
kind of quotes that i think are really
inspirational for doing kind of tracing
stuff the first one is kind of a
reminder that everything happens for a
reason i'm sure you've all seen bugs
where you know how could this possibly
ever happen there's no way that this
could happen right we we've seen things
all the way down to like memory
corruptions do to like ddr failures and
like random bit flips and memory
corruption and like even those have
explanations so like tracing i think
really helps give you a better view into
your code especially the second coke
here is more along the lines of whenever
you have a very complex system there's a
lot of moving parts and a lot of moving
pieces and simply that can sometimes
simply be too much source code for you
to analyze and to read right someone
might say oh just view the source that's
the ultimate source of truth and while
it's correct when there's so much source
code you don't know where to start it's
difficult to see how the pieces fit
together and in my opinion it's easier
to do a trace and understand what code
is actually live code that's running and
what runs for longer durations than
another code helps you kind of pinpoint
what's important and kind of spot when
you're doing things that are maybe
redundant or could be optimized there
could use a better algorithm so when we
talk about profiling this is a form of
debugging tailored towards finding
performance related issues there's kind
of two categories one sampling and one's
tracing so sampling is usually a good
place to start sampling usually is is
fairly automated it just has to do with
sampling call stacks and unwinding those
call stacks that's fairly low overhead
relative to tracing and that's usually a
good starting point so today's talk is
definitely putting the cart before the
horse because I'm going to focus on
tracing which is the which is usually
what you want to do to follow up is once
you've identified something in a sample
that's taking a long time tracing is
usually more manual as you have to go in
and instrument your code before you can
kind of start to analyze the data so
tracing tends to be higher overhead then
sampling I guess everything's relative
so usually you don't want to trace
multiple items at once and we'll see in
a little bit how we kind of filter those
results but usually you want to start
with sampling and Gabon and I are
actually working on cool stuff for
sampling so maybe in a follow-up talk
we'll show some cool sampling stuff for
the frameworks but today we're going to
take a look at various sampling
utilities in particular systrace so the
first thing that we want to acquaint
ourselves with is this notion of trace
tags so because tracing adds overhead to
what we're doing we don't want to
analyze multiple things that we don't
need to sew in Android we have a this
notion called trace tags which is a way
of kind of specifying I just want to
analyze the graphic stack show me what's
going on in graphics or I just want to
analyze binder show me what's going on
in binder or networking or there's a
couple various trace tags so there's a
list on
this on this link on the slides here you
can see what the what the full list of
trace tags are I think if you invoke
systrace it will also print out what
some of the tags are and it's possible
to add your own tags as well but usually
you can get away with using either the
existing ones that we have so far or
using something that's called app level
tracing that we'll see in a little bit
so here's how you invoke systrace so
assuming that your current working
directory is the top of an Android
source check out with an external
chromium trace there's a python utility
called systrace you give it a list of
different tags that you want it to
activate in a sense so the all these
tags that you enable all the
instrumentation is going to be active in
the captured trace that you'll see so
for instance here I'm saying any binder
related tag I want to instrument all the
binder calls binder is how we do IPC and
RPC across processes in android I want
to instrument graphics I want to have
information about the scheduler I want
to see what was running on which core of
the CPU when dash a is used for
application level tracing so system UI
it's all written in Java it has tags
that are not specific to binder graphics
or scheduler so you can say turn on the
generic app level tracing ones and then
finally I want to output the file as an
HTML file so this HTML file has
everything that you need in it you can
either go to chrome / tracing and click
load and pull in the file or simply open
it itself and it has everything the the
framework that's used for drawing this
resulting chart is the style of charts
called a flame graph which we'll get to
in a little bit but this utility is
actually open source it's on github it's
called catapult so if you ever want to
hack on it or read the source code
figure out how it works it's all get a
can anyone does anyone here recognize
this gentleman show of hands can anyone
does anyone want to try and summarize
what on those laws hey so uh um Dale's
law focuses mostly is referring to speed
up but kind of the key takeaway from it
is if you're going to invest your time
on making something faster you first
want to measure and figure out where
you're spending most of your time so in
this really good example that I like
taking Sheamus Lee from Wikimedia if you
have two processes an A and a B and you
spend an awful lot of time and you make
be five times faster the 5x looks great
compared to maybe a 2x performance
improvement you could have gotten in the
same amount of time optimizing a so
while that number looks better on paper
the overall measurement actually doesn't
change as drastically compared to if you
had focused on which process takes the
most amount of time right so kind of the
idea behind sampling and then tracing is
this notion of measurement so we want to
be able to measure and figure out where
are we spending our time right when we
talk about optimization we want to be
focusing our optimization efforts where
we've measured that things are taking
longer than others so the flame graph
that we saw kind of a zoomed-out photo
but we'll see some more insist race is
an interesting graph that makes it
really easy in my opinion to understand
call stacks so the ones you'll see in
this trace are inverted from this one
here but essentially you have a the
first stack frame in the function is
function a a calls be when bees done the
next statement is invoke H right we can
see be called see which calls d which
calls en F and F calls G so when you
have a flame graph you might
tempted to look at a function like a
because a is the biggest right we were
just our previous diagram we just showed
showed that we're looking for whatever
was taking the longest amount of time
right well it turns out for a flame
graph we're actually interested in the
outermost edge the topmost edge and
essentially who has the largest profile
as far as the edge is concerned so
actually the function that we would be
most interested in looking at in this
example is actually function G and so I
tried to highlight here in pink what I
look for is kind of that the length of
the the outermost edge so let's say you
have some Java that code that you want
to trace so what you'll do is you'll
import android OS and then you can
either use trace begin and trace end and
you give it the tag that you want the
tag that you want to have to invoke
through systrace and then you give it a
string literal you can give this string
literal whatever you want my preferred
way is to simply put the class and a
hash hash and symbol and then the method
name so this makes it easier for someone
to then if they see your trace in a
trace that they captured it makes it
easier for them to go grep back in the
code base and know exactly what was
going on here versus if you put some
string that means something to you today
and you leave that trace in the code
base it's probably not going to mean
anything to the next person who reads it
unless it's very meaningful you can also
use trace begin section and end section
for app level tracing when you don't
really care about a particular trace tag
so maybe you you might have some kind of
trace that's important to you as maybe
the system UI developer but it's not
really important to the graphics team or
to binder or whichever maybe you'd
prefer begin section and end section to
trace beginning tres bien tres end now
there's also additional methods for
checking
whether or not a trace tag is enabled so
let's say the string that you wanted to
print for some reason is very expensive
to compute at runtime you can check and
see as well is a trace tag enabled and
if so generate this expensive string and
then call trace begun so that's an
option you can do as well for c++
there's two two different functions
there's two different header libraries
one's an ndk and one's not I forget
which I think the first is in ndk and
the second is not but you want to
include see utils tray set H and then
you call trace begin a trace begin in
capital or there's also the lowercase
version so i'm not sure i don't remember
off the top of my head what the
difference is between these two but
because we're dealing with c++ and we
have the preprocessor we can use double
underscore funk double underscore which
the preprocessor will replace with the
function name this could just as well be
a string literal I like in utilises tray
set H because there's a trace that call
is essentially an RA are AII wrapper
around the same trace begin with double
underscore funk so anytime you enter a
scope you can just invoke this macro and
it basically does the heavy lifting for
you and you don't have to close out or
watch multiple return statements but
we'll get to that and then little bit
later and finally in the colonel so this
is a little hacky and i hope there's a
better way to do this but what i've done
is i published it jist here that kind of
shows essentially getting a kernel trace
to show up in systrace is a lot more
work maybe this is something that we can
improve in the future but essentially
what what i do is reuse the colonel has
functionality called trace events and so
in order to get trace information you
need to create a new trace event so this
is a patch ice take a look at frame
buffer code
on marlin sailfish so there was no
existing trace event for the frame
buffer so I created one so there's
actually there's an lwn article that
talks about tres tres events essentially
a lot of boilerplate here but
essentially you kind of have to define
via macros at a really not fun debug
when they don't work a fast copy method
for any kind of struct that you're
debugging and then when you pull this in
you can you would invoke your your trace
event so this is something that that you
can add throughout the rest of the
kernel code you kind of pull in this
header and you have a define and then i
define to macros here that you don't
really need to define but we basically
need to log the current thread ID and
name is actually just a string here and
whether or not we want to actually
enable the trace or disable the trees so
on trace entry and trace exit
essentially now once you have this in
the colonel the colonel has a wholesome
subsystem for dynamically enable
dynamically enabling tracing and
disabling tracing so on an android
device you need to once you have patched
your kernel like this you need to
recompile your kernel and reflash it on
device and then you need to enable
tracing of that subsystem so you through
sisyphus you just essentially enable it
and then finally when we capture the
trace if you actually take a look at the
HTML file that's generated by sis trees
it actually will have tons of colonel
tracing information as well but catapult
is not set up to graph that information
because it's assuming that you're using
a trace or application level trace and
not any of the colonel tracing
information so a quick hacky thing is
just to run the output of the systray
HTML through said and do a replace of
the tag of the trace event that you just
defined
with this tracing mark right which is
what a trace where label traces ass so
it's definitely a lot more work to get
Colonel tracing into to show up in a
systrace definitely worthwhile I'll show
you in a little bit how we can kind of
tell these calls apart Colonel subsystem
already has that race event so the first
step is is essentially to figure out
does this Colonel subsystem have its own
trace event which kind of defines this
fast copy of whatever internal structure
and if it is like things are relatively
easy right because then you just need to
invoke your your trace tag one of the
most important things about tracing is
to clean up properly after yourself
right so one of the issues when you
instrument blocks of code is you have to
be wary of the of the control flow of
any block of code so if you think of
programming style of either having
multiple return statements or one return
statement if you have a function of code
that you want to instrument and there's
one return statement like that's really
easy to do right like there's there's
one should be obvious where entry to
that function is you can add your trace
begin as a first statement and then
trace end as the last but there's some
caveats depending on which language
you're tracing right so Java trace begin
can go outside of a try finally block
but your trace and call what you should
be put in a finally block and that this
is because Java has exceptions right and
so even though not not only to get this
a trace n before every return statement
but you need to wrap all statements in
this tri finally block because if any of
those statements throws an exception you
could return execution from there and if
you if you miss a trace and due to an
exception you'll just see like a really
long trace is if like it started and
then it never stopped and it turns out
an exception was thrown in there
c++ makes it super easy because it has
are aii that's essentially for those of
you who don't read a lot of C++ is
essentially having destructor functions
where the compiler will add a call to
the destructor implicitly on every
possible exit of scope of an
automatically allocated veritable or
dynamically allocated ones too but C is
is fairly straightforward you just look
for multiple return statements the only
thing that's not good is that there can
be a lot of macro magic especially in
kernel code you need to watch out for
any code that makes use of go to and set
jump long jump I haven't really seen too
many issues with set set jump long jump
being used but that's just one thing to
watch out for as well so now I want to
show you some traces why it's okay took
a look at so not a super exciting bug
but kind of breaking down what we're
looking at when we look at his histories
so here's a systrace that I captured I
think the bug was we were seeing really
slow screen on times with marlin
sailfish so you touch a fingerprint
sensor and device takes anywhere from
half a second to six seconds in this
case to unblock the screen right so on
the top here we can see some existing
trace information saying that the screen
on was blocked and it's possible to
measure the duration of these things and
so here you can see it took six seconds
in this trace I was captured and I think
one of the things that I added was I
said I wanted to trace binder
transactions and graphics and like a
whole bunch of tags I'd sprinkled on
here and working with fill the perf team
fills kind of pointing me in the right
direction to get started with kind of
saying hey there's this way clock here
so wait clocks are used to drought and
Roy
to keep the device from powering off
when you're doing some kind of critical
operation and so we can see a wakelock
gets taken here in this light blue very
early on and released and that's kind of
a starting point so when you want to
start tracing code and you have lots of
code in a really complex system and you
don't know where to start getting
started can be one of the hardest things
of figuring out what you want to trace
frames so that's usually why you want to
start with sampling before you move into
tracing that way you kind of get a heads
up for what's going on in what's taking
long so given a sample then it gets
easier to start otherwise you're kind of
playing guessing games trying to figure
out what part of the system should I be
starting with first and then a lot of
instrumenting and tracing is when you
find something that looks interesting
and you instrument it and you want to
learn more about what's going on you
typically run through another debug
compile trace loop again and again again
where you sprinkle additional
instrumentation you're a trace begin
trace on calls on either parent
functions or child functions depending
on if you want to find out okay who's
calling me or what am i calling where am
i spending my time right so the first
thing I thought when looking at this
trace is oh my god there's a lot of
stuff going on here what what is
definitely overwhelming definitely
presents a lot of information but okay
system UI that sounds somewhat related
right to to the screen unlock process
and we can see some binder transactions
that are taking up a large duration of
time right so what's kind of unfortunate
here is we don't have too much
information about who which method
triggered a binder RPC call there there
actually is UI for that will draw arrows
for binder transactions between
processes one of the issues is you can
only turn it all on or all off and if
you turn it on it essentially looks like
a big ink smear because there's so many
binder transactions going on at any
given moment that that the trail of
lines becomes very difficult to follow
so after doing some more digging I found
some some key guard code right so again
I didn't write any of this stuff don't
really know how it works how it fits
together so we go in and just sprinkle
ton of instrumentation on everything
figure out how it works so we'd see this
this way clock that we're interested in
before we zoom in a little bit more we
can actually see so I'd instrumented the
fingerprint and lock controller trying
to figure out oh maybe the issue is
something to do with the fingerprint
sensor so we can see here that the
fingerprint unlock controller it
differentiates between when a
fingerprint is acquired which it refers
to as detecting a touch and when the
fingerprint is authenticated so there it
takes a little bit of time for the
fingerprint to iterate through all the
fingerprints that you've added to its
database and try and match what was read
from the sensor to a valid fingerprint
to authenticate it and then later on the
phone status bar will invoke a method
called hide key guard so turns out
there's a whole key guard class thats
related to the the lock screen on the
device so when you wake up the device by
pressing the power button or touching
the fingerprint sensor you'll you'll see
kind of the the keyguard appears which
will prompt you for password if one set
so so this kind of starts to give us a
clearer picture but you can see here
there's still this very large binder
transaction which I couldn't catch so
things get very complicated it's very
easy for you for any given method to
grab food what are all my call sites so
you can kind of instrument and see who
called me who called me who called me to
go kind of go up the call stack or it's
very easy to then go to the all the
statements within that function all the
child functions and instrument them see
who did I call who did I call who did I
call but essentially you can only go so
far up until certain processes have
multiple threads and it you kind of get
stopped when you get to thread
invocation or thread creation
so the the scheduler actually kind of
hides a lot of things so this is a
binary transaction nine extra never
actually found out what this binder
transaction is right which is
unfortunate I could do some more digging
but taking a look in instrumenting some
more code so now this is instrumenting
some c++ code so I staking a look at
system server so system server is we
make use of a monolithic kernel in
Android but then a lot of the system
services with an Android have a very
microkernel esque feel to them where we
have multiple servers and then lots of
apps are communicating to these servers
via via binder RPC calls so there's a
class called photonic modulator is it
happens to be a thread of system server
system server responds multiple threads
for all these different servers in we
can see here that almost for the whole
duration of screen unblocked we see
something that's requesting display
state and its trying to set some display
power mode and it triggers a binder
transaction so without turning on all of
the binder transactions if you click on
a given bar at the bottom you'll get a
listing of incoming and outgoing edges
for binder transactions if you click on
one you'll get a highlight of the narrow
so that's that's what this red line is
here is basically saying we invoked a
binder RPC call so you'll see binder
transactions either be usually be either
the bottom edge or the top edge and that
depends if they're the the client or the
server or the requester or they're the
server I guess so here we're making a
call that triggers a binder transaction
and then someone else will service the
binder transaction and metal show up as
the the top bar right so following where
it goes we get a binder reply here in
surface flinger okay so I need to either
enable trace tags for surface flinger or
analyze surface flinger or instrument
surface flinger and we can see here I
leave that this is this view is multiple
threads of the same process so I think I
don't have definitive proof but I
believe that these two threads are
synchronized in surface flinger and one
of the things like that caught my eye
here looking at this it's very difficult
to kind of see this even when looking at
at assists race like blown up big but if
you can see this hardware device power
on call which is C++ code at service
slinger trying to turn on the screen
there's this top edge of it is colored
and you get that when you add sched to
the command line when you invoke
systrace and that shows you what the
thread state is right so P threads has
state machine you can go look it up red
means the thread is put to sleep
interrupt uninterruptible sleep usually
it's doing some kind of i/o or
communicating with someone else or
blocking within the colonel for instance
but then the rest of the leading edge is
green and actually percentage-wise sorry
green means that it's running it's doing
busy work could be spinning in a spin
lock you know straight so if if we just
take a look at percentage-wise it's
eighty eight percent is spent in this
running category and twelve percent is
spent in a sleep state so that's kind of
going back to that um dolls law example
let's try and figure out like what busy
work we're doing here for eighty eight
percent of our time that's blocking
screen on so this is with after adding
the colonel tracing to get more
information suddenly now we have more
information about what's going on in the
colonel so it starts off in surface
flinger we C C++ code with this hardware
device power on call but eventually
invokes in I octal which is kind of a
messy syscall that's like a catch-all
that a lot of drivers and fortunately
implement so you can see here that we're
invoking some kind of I octal related to
the frame buffer that the type of it is
a FBI
blank so we're asking the screen to
blank is terminology for either to
unblock the screen is essentially to
turn the screen on versus blank the
screen is to turn the screen off and
there's multiple calls within the
colonel here which so a lot of this code
looks relevant like it's doing actual
work that we expect but then we get this
we find out that all the busy work we're
doing is spent entirely in one function
which is this council on unlock function
and whenever you add sked to collect
scheduler information in a trace you'll
get this at the very top of your sis
trace this area so this shows you for
the four cores on marlin sailfish what
was running at any given time that that
we had instrumented so here we can see
surface flinger is actually running full
bore on one core essentially saturating
one core and that you can see kind of
the width of this maroon line of when it
was scheduled lines up pretty well with
this green duration right so we can see
hardware device power on was saturating
a whole core eighty eight percent of its
time was spent within the kernel and a
function called console unlock once we
spotted this this was essentially a
known issue has to do with having cereal
debugging enabled on your kernel so
whenever we're debugging kernel code you
may not have adb working so we actually
use the headphone jack as a serial
counsel and usually I use screen or
something to connect to the device and
because i had this debug feature on
which is something that we can toggle on
and off essentially the colonel ring
buffer was getting was it printing out
until this I actual finished and then as
content got buffered and buffered and
buffered it would actually take longer
and longer and longer to right over the
cereal council at its really slow baud
rate to kind of DQ all the messages that
came into this buffer so we're actually
seeing
if you had a device I was overloaded
where it was doing a lot of work and all
the other cores were saturated it was
possible that a lot of different
applications could be adding a lot more
to the council to the Colonel's ring
buffer it's d message output which would
make counsel unlock take longer and
longer and longer and longer so known
issue real simple fix disabling seal
debugging when you don't need it speeds
up on locking the screen quite a bit
right so this is what a healthy trace
looks like after it's been fixed right
so before we can see how hardware device
powering on you can see the time
measurement up here I took ticks and
this one it took half a second so the
trace earlier I showed you six seconds
was from different points in time fifty
taking half 500 milliseconds to unlock
the screen was still way above expected
we're expecting something close to like
100 to 200 milliseconds so a healthy
trace here we can see now screen unblock
takes 130 milliseconds which is much
better and hardware device power on is
now spending its entire entirety in the
eye octal call as expected in no time in
council unlock so if we wanted to we can
go and try and calculate the speed up
here right think of dolls login and if
we really wanted to improve this number
again then we could go and maybe spend
some time in this flush kick off and try
and figure out what's it what is it
doing here on this exposed leading edge
or maybe dsi panel on but I think we're
kind of at a state now where we're good
enough and we're happy so so give you a
quick trace a quick run through of how I
can work with with systrace so once you
have a trace open I really like the
controls so scroll scrolling vertical
and then it's got this WASD for zooming
in and out so W zooms in and as soons
out and then a and D for panning left
and right so usually we all go through
and do is collapse a bunch of processes
that
care about so if there was any kind of
application running like wallpapers GMS
core I don't care what it's doing I
don't think it's in the critical unlock
path so I'll just collapse those let's
say I want to I just added some
instrumentation to keyguard you hit / to
jump into the search box so typing
keyguard you'll see all the all the
color fade out of all the bars assuming
your search has a valid match so let's
say for instance i typed a bunch of
stuff that doesn't match anything all
the color comes back so that's really
helpful when you're trying to find your
your instrumentation you can see there's
a little bit of light coloring here for
everything that matches keyguard so far
if i hit enter it will go to the first
result and if i keep hitting enter it
will jump to the next result so you
might be able to see the colored bars
getting lit up and so then you can dive
in and find more information to if you
hit it let's say you have a big trace a
lot of information and you want to find
where's your new where's the latest
instrument that you just added you can
do a search things stay grey that shows
me that my my instrumentation did show
up in this key in this trace somewhere i
hit enter to find them maybe the one I'm
interested in then I'll hit escape to
get out of the search box and I'll hit
em to mark it so this is what gives us
the time you can see up top that it now
shows us 17 milliseconds for whatever I
searched for and then you can hit f2
zoom in on that item and then you'll
have to scroll and find here it is right
so and then it can hit / again to enter
and go to the next one hit escape market
fill it so that that's how I work with
systrace and
so my call to action everyone is if you
have a code that you that is performance
critical please help out your fellow
folks interested in perf and instrument
any code that you think is worthwhile
anything that could be a problem down
the line if it ever slows down more than
expected the thing that I really like to
see that I tend to do a lot is
instrument both sides of a binder call
so i think binders really neat but it
can be difficult to debug who is
invoking binder and who is on the
receiving end of a binder call so if
you're making use of anything that
invokes binder that could potentially
take a long time like please wrap that
in some instrumentation so it shows up
in a trace and it makes it a lot easier
to prove that you've improved something
if you can measure it so thanks everyone
for your time I appreciate it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
