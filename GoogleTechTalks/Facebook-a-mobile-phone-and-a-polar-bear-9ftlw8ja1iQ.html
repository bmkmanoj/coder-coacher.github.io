Jeffries and i'm here to introduce jenn
mann cuff for a talk called facebook and
a polar bear may persuade people to pare
down their energy use all right it's
changed slightly that's good big well
that's okay it's still about Facebook
and a polar bear and I think that's
probably what got people here so jen is
an assistant professor at Carnegie
Mellon in the human-computer interaction
Institute she got her BA from Oberlin
and her PhD in computer science from
Georgia Tech and she's very interested
as you will see from this talk in
finding ways to address critical social
technical problems through internet
interactive technologies so she's
looking at mobile desktop and social web
technologies and all of this and she in
addition to the sustainability work that
you're gonna hear about today she's also
done some really interesting work with
people with disabilities and other way
other types of social problems she's
having to read here she's a member of
ACM assets ACM chi and whist and has
been on a lot of conference committees
she founded the sustainable chi google
group and her research is supported by
groups like google which is one of the
reason she's here until hewlett-packard
Microsoft and the National Science
Foundation so and I've also been asked
to make sure that please ask your
questions at the microphone there
because we are video conferencing and
videotaping this talk so go Jim okay
thank you for the introduction may I ask
since I'm talking to remote people as
well where the camera is oh there okay
good I was seeing that one up there and
I wasn't sure who I was looking at so hi
everyone remote and local ok em so this
talk is motivated by the fact that our
planets environment is beginning to show
signs of change due to global warming
and of different kinds and not only due
to changes in our climate but also do
two things
that are caused by humans so this is
actually a photograph that was taken by
Chris Jordan he's an environmental
artist who likes to take photos of large
volumes of things like cell phones and
garbage and all sorts of different
things that convey the scale on which we
have an impact on environment and these
are cell phone chargers so the waste we
produce and the actions we take have an
impact on the environment and the
question that's at the heart of a lot of
the research I want to talk about today
is whether individuals can have an
impact on that and how we can support
them if they want to have an impact on
that so what kinds of things do
individuals do that relate to their
footprint on the environment consumption
is one big one and in fact if you look
at the data about a third of their
impact has to do with consumption so
fourteen percent recreation five percent
food and drink and other four percent
goes to clothes but it's not just about
consumption transportation is another
big area so ten percent of their impact
has to do with private transportation
six percent it's just on holiday flights
of individuals and this particular data
set looks at indirect impacts as well so
car manufacturer is a seven percent of
the impact of an individual on average
and this is us-centric data and the last
thing that individuals have a lot of
control over that they have an impact on
the environment with it has to do with
home heating and cooling which is
fifteen percent of their impact
electricity is another twelve percent
and the materials refers to things like
the furnishings in the home represent
additional impact there is of course
another category which includes things
like public services &amp;amp; financial
services but there's a lot here that
people who have a HCI approach to things
as I do could have an impact on so the
question we asked ourselves then is how
to approach this problem and my work the
work on presenting today is not just my
own work but it's the work that results
from a collaboration between people from
several several different disciplines
including in particular
civil and environmental engineers who
bring an environmental science
perspective to the work that we're doing
human-computer interaction and here I've
split into two groups technologists who
are building technology sensors web
pages and so on and then also behavioral
scientists who are study studying how
people react to the interventions that
we create and what kinds of things might
be most effective involving people so
that's um that's the kind of triangulate
approach that we're taking to this
question of how can we help people
change their impact on the environment
and then we're throwing into that mix
the internet if you look at past work in
environmental science that has to do
with human behavior it's typically been
done on a very small scale and and
offline that's changing in the last few
years but we think there's a lot more to
be done and the internet it's reached
seventy-three percent of US adults now I
don't really need to be telling Google
this you know but interestingly it's
reached a larger percentage of
households with higher incomes which are
households that have a higher footprint
social networks are letting us reach
younger users in households that may not
be committed to issues of
environmentalism yet younger people tend
to be more environmental so there's
specific interesting ways in which
leveraging the internet can get us at at
communities that are of interest from
the perspective of environmental science
and then throw into that mix mobile
phones which are reaching billions of
people and represent a kind of sensing
platform that can let us potentially
start to get at information that's just
not available in the kinds of studies
have been done in the past in
environmental science and also
potentially represent an interesting
deployment platform so that's the kind
of trend that we as a research group are
trying to take advantage of in the work
that we're doing so let me talk about
one other set of information that's
guided our work which is how we can
motivate individual change not
everything we're doing is about
persuasion but there has been a lot of
work that's been looking at what
it is that causes individuals to take
environmentally friendly actions and the
literature on this ranges from work in
the social movement theory that looks at
like what caused people to join a social
movement all the way to specific things
like the value of making a public
commitment or provided providing
comparative feedback versus non
comparative feedback on commitments to
take action and follow through so
there's some great survey articles that
look at this literature which is
extensive and has gone on for many
decades but again it hasn't really
happened online and it hasn't taken
advantage of some of the trends I was
just highlighting so what are we looking
at I'm going to talk about three
projects today and they sort of follow
from each other so I'm just going to
start going through them in order the
first one is trying to look at whether
we could leverage emotional attachment
and the fact that in the past it's been
shown that attachment to animals can
potentially translate into
environmentalism to engage people in
this problem and this is work that was
done collaboratively with my PhD student
wanted dillahunt and Bob crowd at CMU so
we asked ourselves how can we leverage
interest in saving the polar bear in
getting people to follow through on
environmental behaviors and we just did
a small study where we created a polar
bear that would actually react and its
ecosystem would react to what you did in
terms of environmental actions and what
we did in the study was we had a group
of about 20 users they were either in a
control or an attachment group in the
attachment group they were given a sob
story about polar bears they were asked
to name their polar bear and they were
asked to write a short description of
how they felt about the whole thing in
the control group they were given a much
less emotionally Laden story about
what's going on with polar bears and we
had pre-tested these stories to make
sure that there was a difference in how
much attachment evoked then we called
them up a few days later and asked them
if they would like to donate to the
zoo's polar bear exhibit and finally we
called them up a few days after that to
ask them of the actions that they had
committed to when they were in the lab
which one said they followed through on
and we saw a small but significant
difference in what they claim to have
done now of course we don't know for
sure that they did it but even the fact
that they wanted to lie to us if that's
what they were doing more so in the
attachment condition tells us that there
was an impact of that attachment
condition and that there's some promise
here that we should be following through
on so so that was the one of the early
pieces of work that we did on this
project that was starting to try and
look at how the message affects how the
medium through which we convey the
message you know this iconic reactive
kind of polar bear affects people's
response to what we're trying to do so
what we're trying to do next and i'm
referring to stuff i'm actually still to
talk about is we want to compare this to
a much less laden representation it's
simply a bar chart of behavior we want
to start integrating it with a website
that I'm going to talk about shortly and
put this up on facebook we want to
explore the effects of other iconic
symbols besides polar bears and see
whether it is something about the polar
bear that special or not whether it has
to be an animal things like that and we
want to look at viral effects so that
ecosystem produces babies when you get a
baby we encourage you maybe to give it
to your friend and see if that helps
support spread of an application for
example and finally we're interested in
what happens when they start to take
that bear with you and I'm calling that
the Tamagotchi effect because the
traditional Tamagotchi is a Japanese toy
that's a portable toy that shows an
animal that you interact with to keep it
alive and happy and so similarly if you
can imagine moving this onto mobile
phone for example and it starts to be
with you you may feel a different kind
of responsibility towards that there to
take actions that will help it respond
so those are some of the kinds of things
we want to look at as follow on to this
work so that's an example of an almost
purely behavioral project but most of
the work that we're doing is much more
multidisciplinary and and as an example
I'm now going to talk about step green
org which is a website that we're hoping
to use and this is a project that has
like six faculty members on and several
PhD students it's it's sort of that a
rello project for a lot of the other
things
doing so I'm not going to try and
introduce everyone but what the goal of
the website is is to leverage popular
places or places that people go
frequently to try to create a community
of change around issues of taking green
actions and our approach is to try to
piggyback on existing social networks
because we don't have you know the
number of users that a site like Google
has and we don't want to try to create a
social network of people that says
extensive is Facebook we want to do
instead is try to piggyback on those
existing places so that even if we just
have one or two users from a given group
of social group we can still leverage
the fact that that social group exists
to help induce more participation in our
site so this project allows us to then
bring in issues of sensing and self
reporting to look at how we can tie in
the polar bear to look at how we can tie
in a lot of other projects as well as we
increase our deployment so let me talk
about specifically what we've done so
far with steph green the image that you
see on the page here is a Facebook page
it's showing our polar bear ecosystem
and a suggested action it goes on the
profile page we can also easily send
information to a person's newsfeed or
mini feed that in another form of public
participation and then we can do
different things in terms of what we
feed back to you to encourage you to
then come back to our main site which
I'm showing now on this slide and the
main site is the place where we actually
have actions we have about 60 actions
filled out right now for each action we
have a title we have information about
its impact in terms of dollars in co2 we
have information about how we calculated
those impacts that you can get to and
then you can commit to it and then at
later times you can come back and say
whether or not you've actually fulfilled
those commitments and we used extensive
HDI techniques to develop that list of
actions including a card sorting
exercise and interviews and other things
to try to come up with the right list of
actions you might notice that the
website doesn't explicitly talk about
environmentalism in fact we made an
effort to make it ambiguous so that we
can at later times explore different
possible messaging schemes
the name step green talks about at some
level about money about exercise as well
as about environmentalism the tagline is
enriched your life the graphs tend to
focus on dollar savings and things like
that so we've been trying to keep that
as neutral as we can for now so we did a
pilot study with this website we
deployed it for three weeks in the fall
of 2007 we had 32 participants with
active myspace accounts and we conducted
pre and post surveys with the
participants to look at environmental
attitudes and other things like that and
then interviews at the end we tracked
their actions on the site and then we
were also really interested in how the
fact that this application was present
on their myspace page affected
participation inside in other ways so we
looked at friend views we looked at sign
ups and other things like that so we
also did not turn off the site at the
end of the study so we had four
participants who continued to use the
site for some time after the study ended
and we didn't explicitly recruit people
that were already in a social network
with each other but we had different
groups of participants who joined as
groups kind of who visited each other's
pages at times and things like that in
general however this was a pilot study
so it was limited in terms of how much
data we have about the impact of this on
the social network we didn't have a lot
of requests for signups the site wasn't
open so even if you asked to sign up you
couldn't then go through and get an
account so we weren't able to track BIOS
fed in the same way that we were
planning to do this summer and in
particular as of last week we have now
opened the site up to any user so if any
of you would like to try it out it's at
step green org and we're looking for
users so what did we find well first of
all we have information about what
actions were popular and here you can
see the top 10 actions the top five were
all equally popular among our users and
here popularity is defined by whether or
not a user committed to that action so
21 of the 32 users fulfilled this action
that's why they were equally popular
slightly more users committed to some
actions and others that we cared about
whether they follow through and these
are actions that are all very easy to do
they're also low impact
but there is research that shows that
simply getting people to take green
actions helps them begin to
self-identify as green so as a process
as a process / tie and this is a good
starting place for bringing people into
this there were also some interesting
things that happened relating to the
predictions of how well actions would do
from our formative work for example you
can see that using public transit to
commute was predicted to be very
unpopular but actually made it into the
top 10 list and we had people reporting
that they actually took action so
although we were not tracking behavior
change we had some evidence that some of
that happened so on average people
committed to about 16 actions and
fulfilled about 14 of them over that
three-week period and again we're not
counting every single instance of
something that you could do daily we're
trying to get an overall picture of how
many different things people did we
didn't want to just look at that high
level data we're also really interested
in starting to uncover temporal and
sequential patterns and the field data
that we're starting to getting out of
the site to open for real I think will
really start to feed into this the idea
is to gain a deeper understanding about
users behavioral trajectories so that we
can understand how successful users move
through the site in terms of the order
in which they commit to actions and what
they do and then use that as a basis for
making recommendations so this just
shows the red is commitments Green is
fulfillment and so this gives you a
sense of how a lot of commitments
happened upfront and then those are
spread out over time at a lower
frequency war whereas the fifth of
elements happened pretty regularly some
of this is an artifact of our study
design we did require people to visit
their myspace page once a day or twice a
day I think during the study so we were
looking for active myspace users but
some of the people who join the study
were just really thinking that they
weren't active myspace users but instead
that they were just supposed to visit
our site twice a day so that's still it
tells us that you know they were moving
from committing to fulfilling and that
was a good thing to do and we did not
require that they participate in the
site at all but more interesting is how
they got to the site and what actions
followed other actions so for example we
were able to be
looking at whether they tended to go to
step green directly or through myspace
and even though they weren't required to
use a site at all we did see seventeen
percent of the time people were going
straight to step green without even
visiting myspace so there were people
who began to get engaged in okay I want
to go visit a site and do things with it
and one of the things that we're hoping
to do in the summer and going forward is
have a much wider set of ways that
people can get to step green and start
to understand the differences in how
those possibilities affect participation
in the site so if you have an iGoogle
page we have a Google module we're going
to put on the next week or two or you're
using your facebook page or you have an
RSS feed which of those are actually
bringing people to the site which of
those are supporting viral marketing are
there differences and how likely someone
is to follow through on actions or how
frequently they visit site according to
which of these they're using I think
there's a lot of interesting data that
will be getting and be able to start
looking at we also are interested in
what actions follow other actions so for
example the prior the probability that
someone will will commit to recycling
plastic after they commit to recycling
aluminum is twenty-two percent and
that's much higher than the chance that
they'll just commit to recycling plastic
without that prior probability in place
it's like one percent of people actually
committed to recycling plastic so that's
a really big difference and that tells
us something about that there's a
relationship between those two things we
also for example can look at the fact
that twenty one percent of people you
know who say they're going to turn off
lights at home we're also going to do it
in the office but nine percent of the
people who said they were going to turn
off lights at home are interested in
using a manual toothbrush so this is
really preliminary data it's a pilot
study but this kind of analysis has its
showing some promise from that pile of
data and we're really interested next in
seeing what happens when we take this
into the field yeah
so we calculated the prior probability
it's a hidden Markov model i believe so
basically we calculated session
boundaries and then we looked at the
order in which actions were committed to
on the page so if you click on an action
and then you click on the next action
that's the relationship that we're
tracking and so one of the issues of
course is what order are things
presented on the page and that's
something that we did not include in
this analysis but we're planning on
gathering the data to correctly include
that in future analyses but this stuff
didn't exactly always match the order of
presentation oh I see what you're asking
yeah those are the base rates yeah so it
was that's just a private probability
that they would commit to doing that
action right I mean so we had duplicates
of some actions there were some issues
with that that may have affected which
actions someone was likely to commit to
the head to do with lights for example
so we were trying to get a sense of
which presentation of the action
affected participation so some of our
actions weren't exactly identical and
that hasn't all been addressed in this
analysis yet so there could be more than
one way to commit to doing the same
thing kind of but we're we're not trying
to claim that this data should be a
basis for deciding that like that's an
action no one wants to do we're just
trying to show that these relationships
are a value to explore further does that
distinction make sense I'm this is
preliminary work that's only been in
process for about a year so we're in a
small group so weird there's definitely
a lot more to be done in terms of making
this data useful to generalize out of
and take action on but it's it's setting
the scene for how we're going to
approach this problem in the field right
now
ok so the live deployment I think is the
opportunity to start really looking at
how this stuff works and we want to look
at or we've redesigned a site slightly
on the basis of the usability data we
got from the pilot deployment we've
started to look at adding to and
changing some of the actions we want to
do that reanalysis of the common use
patterns and start to develop support
for recommendations off of the field
data but we also want to start looking
at what happens when we can integrate
sensed data into the site so can we get
information automatically about your
utility usage about your transportation
usage shopping and food even and how do
we visualize the MU ities in that sense
data how do we deal with the ambiguities
and inaccuracies in self reporting and
how do we allow people to reason about
the relationship between what they
report to us and what we can sense in
those cases particularly where the
census data gives us a high level
picture of whether their footprint is
changing but the self-reporting is about
specific actions so there's a lot of
interesting challenges coming up for us
I think as we begin to integrate some of
that data and of course we're trying to
do it in a way that can scale up because
that's a big underlying theme in this
project is trying to support this stuff
not on the level of a study with one or
two or ten people but to get it out
there on the web site on the web and
start to see what happens when a lot of
people participate we also are starting
as of the summer to do small behavioral
manipulations on the site and start to
see how that affects people's response
their likelihood to commit or follow
through on an action and things like
that so what I was going to do at this
moment was then move on to discussing
another piece of work that's
collaborative with the University of
Washington that's looking specifically
at tracking automatically sentencing
transportation behavior and feeding that
back to people but maybe I should pause
for a second and see if there's any
further questions about this project
I can also keep going and take questions
at the end yes
so how long do you expect this I mean
are you going to sample every so often
or do you expect this to go on for six
months or I mean how much data you're
going to have I guess is what I mean um
weird we have structured our IRB so that
this isn't something that we're paying
people for and it's not something that
ends so the goal is to have this site
out there and have it grow in terms of
its usage and we're actually trying to
compete with other websites out there
that support these kinds of things so
that we can get a nice large user base
in place and then I mean we'll never
have the kind of user base that you guys
can use when you try out different
interventions to see how they have an
impact but we want to be able to do that
kind of work with this user base okay so
you'll be just sort of sampling every so
often to just see things yet okay all
right so in in some sites you serve have
a universe a uniformity of the level of
contribution by users and some other
sites like Wikipedia is the canonical
example you have this vast disparity
between like a small group of people who
contribute a lot and all these other
people who just sort of hang out and
watch you have any thoughts about you
know your site and whether it's more of
a style of everybody is participating at
the same level or whether there's like
super participants and what those might
be doing yeah among our 32 participants
in the fall and there was definitely a
huge disparity and extent to which
people chose to participate on the site
and we had everything from someone who
committed to no actions at all to you
know people who continue to use the site
for a month afterwards and really we're
using it to try and track things and I
expect it as we scale this up we're
going to continue to see that kind of
disparity one of the reasons why we
think it's valuable to leverage the
social web for this work is that you can
use social mechanisms as a way of trying
to increase the participation in people
who are not doing as much but there's a
lot of different leverage points that we
can potentially use for that that we're
hoping to explore
I add question of the polar bear a
couple oh I had a question with the
polar bear haha so do you think well do
you have any hypothesis or you're going
to further look at what actually sort of
people were thinking when they wanted to
commit more was it a guilt thing like
you said the condition was attachment
but it could have been related to guilt
or what their friends might think if
they kill the polar bear they may
actually feel good about the polar bear
and those those are very different
functions in someone's mind so I was
wondering if you explored that at all
like what the people actually were
thinking when they were in that
condition right I don't think that the
that study got into that is in as much
depth as it should but I can tell you
for sure that there was no social
component to that study and also we
structured it so that the polar bear
started out swimming in water with no
ice berg and as you committed to actions
it became more and more stable so it was
a there was definite guilt and negative
reinforcement built into it in terms of
people's feedback about whether they
were doing enough to save the polar bear
so that I think that the structure of
the study played off of that more than
anything
so I the reason I through and all that
stuff about the recommendations and
starting to try and look at those kinds
of trends that was a big part of what
was part of the proposal that Google
funded and I wanted to give you guys
some information about what we'd begun
to do on that right now I'm going to
switch to talking about our project
that's currently unfunded but i think
it's an exciting piece and next step of
what we're trying to do and this is work
with james land a at UW dub and then
also some people at intel right now
Beverly Harrison and Sonny Consalvo and
a bunch of students and here we're
trying to look at moving off the desktop
so we're trying to take advantage of
that trend I mentioned at the beginning
of the talk relating to cell phones and
in particular you know these cell phones
are ubiquitous they can give us access
not only to inflate sensing but also in
place feedback and the background of a
cell phone can function as a kind of
ambient display because people look at
it so frequently through which we can
get feedback to people frequently so
that's complementary to the value of
putting something up on your facebook
profile page if you visit facebook
frequently that you get one kind of
frequent feedback the cell phone
provides a different kind of access to a
different group of users so what we
leverage to do this work was automatic
capture of common transportation actions
and the sensing was done by the mobile
sensing platform out of Intel called the
MSP which can differentiate between
walking bicycling or riding in a vehicle
we then had a survey that was triggered
that would help differentiate in the
vehicle case between bus carpool and
train and this was designed sort of as a
follow-on to some of the work that Sonny
consalvo had done regarding to fitness
but focus more on energy and there are
some really interesting differences of
course between energy and fitness
including the fact that the benefits
don't necessarily accrue to one
personally so we wanted to see if this
was a viable concept and this is the
design right here you can see a tree we
also had a polar bear version and the
tree would respond and display rewards
by growing leaves and eventually flowers
and then apples to green actions we also
showed feedback about the currently
sensed
action the most recently sense to action
and here we would show feedback about
the personal benefits of the action so
we have would highlight that it could
save you money or give you exercise give
you time to read or what's relaxing
things like that so we also sensed
walking we have an icon for the bus an
icon for public transportation and then
of course the polar bear version and
here's an example of the kind of
sequence that was present in each case
the tree gets leaves and apples as I
said that a polar bear ecosystem grows
and becomes more productive in terms of
food and ice space and family and all of
that and then there's northern lights at
the end as an extra Kudo if you get all
the way to the end so this was
implemented using work by James land a
and yang Lee which was the activity
server work and then also the ESM work
that came out of Intel and we basically
could deploy to about 12 participants
due to the number of msps available so
we did that and we deployed to them for
a couple of weeks and we also had the
research team using the system and this
shows a web page that we created that
would show the current status of each
research team member and each
participant that we could use to track
what was going on we also interviewed
our participants at the end but this was
a classic case of early-stage you become
deployment so there were a lot of bugs
we actually ended up paying people extra
for all the time they spent with us
debugging the system and we were we to
get it out as quick as possible so that
we could get early-stage feedback about
these design concepts and the overall
application design and that's exactly
what we got one of the things we had not
really expected was that application you
just became a game and people wanted to
know what that end state was they were
curious anticipation and in fact we came
out of it thinking that a good model
would be allowing people to design these
sequences and swap them out so that just
like skins are available for a blog or
something so people could just sort of
pick the next one they wanted to see and
work their way through there was some
self-reported behavior changes with the
other study and we also asked
participants about the social aspects of
this application we did not design
social stuff into this any more directly
than we did in to the website deployment
but we wanted to find out about what
happened so that we could get the input
we need to actually design a social side
of this appropriately and we did find
that we had a couple of husband wife
couples and things who would compete
around this but we also found that
people were showing it to their friends
and the interesting thing that came out
of that was sort of an interest in
social recommendation so recommendations
in general where something people wanted
more of they wanted to see numbers about
how much they saved but they also wanted
to see something that would tell them
you know this trip you just took you
could have taken it by bus it would have
taken five minutes longer and maybe
saved you this much money or you could
have taken it by bike it would have
taken you this much longer and saved you
that much money things like that or you
know everyone else who does this
community thirty percent of them are
doing it with the bus now join the crowd
you know those kinds of recommendation
seems like they would be really valuable
in the context of this system so we want
to also combine this with step green
orgs so that what we track about your
transportation behavior can be fed into
the social website and can also be fed
into those actions that you've committed
to and this will be a first opportunity
for us to start looking at the issues of
sensed inaccurate sensed reporting
versus to inaccurate human reporting and
how to display both appropriately in the
visualization and we also want to start
increasing the scale of the deployment
of both systems and we've actually been
looking for like nonprofit partners that
want to run competitions around these
kinds of things we also want to look at
engaging neighborhoods and cities may be
working with a apartment building owner
to get a whole building of people
engaged in the set Korean website and
see what happens with that and start
doing behavioral manipulations in the
field so I've sort of moved outside of
just you be green and the mobile tool
now to talk about the overall movement
of the project but those are some of the
things that we're moving towards doing
so
that's the conclusion of the talk and
I'll take more questions
Oh
you mentioned the game part but you
didn't say specifically if you were
going to play that up by like making
actually more game-like not just images
you capture yeah I have been talking we
have a entertained entertainment
technology program at Carnegie Mellon
it's a master's program and they have a
competitive opportunity to actually
submit game ideas and the students do
projects every year so I've been talking
with the person who runs that program
about submitting this as a potential
game into that program to see what the
students do with it and I'm definitely
thinking that that would be of interest
it brings up a lot of really interesting
issues to do with sensing and self
reporting because depending on how you
structure the game people of course can
lie and that was something that our
users brought up even in the UB green
setting that hadn't been presented as a
game sensors may or may not lie more or
less than users so how you how you
structure a game that has points and
competition around something that's
inherently potentially inherently
untrustworthy I think brings interesting
problems into the space that we're
looking at
it seems a lot of the activities that
you're trying to support here are
individuals working individually but
sharing knowledge and information what
about individuals working together as
groups you know scheduling a weekend
event to go and clean up some you know
creeks or cutting the grass right so
this kind of thing of you know I guess
you know the style of people working
together community right yeah so um it's
funny giving this talk it's hard to draw
the line between talking about
everything I would like to do with step
green as a project assuming we get you
know all the funding and resources in
the Royal and what's next steps so the
next step answer your question is that
it's very likely that we're soon going
to add discussion groups to the site and
that's a form of collaboration that's
limited but will allow people to we want
to start looking at issues like is it
make more sense to have discussion
groups tied to a neighborhood so that
people can start talking about who's the
best contractor to do this action for me
or what's the best way to accomplish it
right here where I live versus having
them be sort of broader across the site
and then you might see different kinds
of discussions and arguments come up so
I think that's one way that we're maybe
going to look soon at the question
you're asking more broadly you know I
estimated a proposal that long ago
unfortunately it wasn't funded to look
at how we could engage whole
neighborhoods and these issues and I
think there's tons of really interesting
stuff to be done in that we don't have
an immediate plan to do it yeah the
place I've been actually thinking about
doing that has to do with the sensing
because I well we've been torn the
original vision of this project was to
let users suggest actions and there's
some issues with that both in terms of
whether those actions are going to be
accurate so how we met them and to what
extent we have to vet them affects how
many we can manage and and also it
affects our visualizations and other
things if they're not correctly
calculated or if they don't have all of
the factors we need to know about so we
haven't allowed that kind of user input
the discussion groups represent
wiki but it a kind of user input around
actions but the thing that I'm
interested in maybe pushing further on
with this has to do with sensing so I
want to create a sort of a DIY section
of the site where we can put up
potential software or hardware solutions
that will let you track in action and
start to see whether people add that and
how they pick up on that and whether
that allows us to more easily get some
of that out to our user population and I
think that there hasn't been a lot of
work yet looking at DIY I mean Kristen
Tory did some with this but but there's
some interesting things to be learned
about how that functions in the process
someone I hear you talk about these
things they seem like things that would
that you have done and would obviously
work in the US have you given any
thought about how this changes if you
try to do this I don't know when Europe
or Asia or in in any any different
culture of some sort yeah that's a
really good question I mean even within
the US there's like there's so many
differences from place to place even
about what actions apply like do you
have an air conditioner do you live in a
place that needs one there's so many
differences that it's a daunting problem
to internationalize something like this
I'm personally very interested in
looking at issues of sustainability in
the developing world I have not yet come
up with an answer about whether or not
step green itself is the right platform
or even a platform that can support that
effort but i think that i think that
internationalizing this in developed
countries would be a lot more
straightforward than trying to directly
apply it to the developing world
I thought the cell phone project was
particularly interesting because you
added a layer of accountability or as I
think some of the larger issues around
these types of like green projects or
that it's the energy savings is largely
demonstrated by kind of self reporting
what are some of the larger issues that
you've had to deal with and if you find
any other kind of like innovate
innovative or creative solutions to that
so the question had to do with finding
creative solutions to deal with the
issues in self reporting and i think
that the sensing is going to be a really
key piece of that and if you look at the
literature on footprints a lot of it
right now is either at a macro scale so
we know how many miles everyone in the
city wrote because they report it to the
city and we can start to look at
footprint at that level or its
self-reported like an individual's
footprint is something that they just
they can maybe say what my utility bill
said and how many miles I drove but a
lot of it is self-reported stuff and I
think that outside of even whether I'm
trying to get people to change what they
do if we can start to track important
aspects of individual footprints and we
can do that across many people many
individuals that will get a picture at
the micro level about things that
influence footprint that we might not
really understand yet and so I think
that that going the sensing route is a
really key piece of this not necessarily
just for persuasion but for actually
understanding what's actually going on
does that answer your question so I have
an answer for this question also which
is I noticed this on New York
Consolidated Edison has a website where
you can go and look at your energy bill
so it might be a nice feature to try and
link you know your site to these sites
that have you know the users energy so
and since you're delegating the sensing
yeah to the company say yeah yeah that's
a really good point and a lot of the big
impacts are things that you know you can
get through a utility company you don't
still don't get the micro scale data
necessarily although that varies with
the particular hardware that you have
access to there's been a really big
impact shown in the literature of
something as simple as like putting an
ambient orbit shows pricing not even
what you're actually doing but just
pricing in the home you can see up to
like a twenty percent
sometimes in energy use in some of these
examples so so the self-reporting is
problematic not only because of its
accuracy because it also because of the
impact it's likely to have a human
behavior in comparison to having hard
data out there in the home and I think
that that we need to include some of
that in this project for sure hi when
you were talking about step green you
were talking about leveraging social
networks to disseminate the product that
was wondering if you given any thought
to how you would disseminate a product
like you but green so right okay yeah
well we were trying to make a version of
it that does not depend on the MSP so
you have to either decrease the fidelity
or accuracy of the reporting or you need
to increase the amount of human input
that you need in order to get the data
in that case I think that you can also
my thesis work actually looked at
ambiguity in sense data in part and one
of the things you can do is design
interfaces that depend less on having
accurate data so for example imagine if
every time I took a trip my cellphone
popped up the screen it's very easy
using even just gsm power data to figure
out where i went approximately right so
my cell phone could then pop up a screen
saying what are the bus lines what's the
you know the bus line that traveled this
distance at the time closest to the time
you did how long would it take to bike
this distance how you know what what are
the other options without even knowing
whether I took the bus or not it
immediately affords me the opportunity
to compare which might then actually
allow me to make different decisions so
I think that the answer to this problem
requires a combination of good interface
design so that you can minimize the
impact of losing some of that fidelity
combined with clever kinds of sensing
that's that can leverage off the shelf
devices if you want to deploy them
lightly and that's what we're planning
on doing
do we have any questions from the remote
sides I believe there's somebody out
there yeah can you hear me I have a
question yes we can hear you hi there
it's David San Francisco you mentioned
briefly the idea that by getting people
to take small actions you can lead them
down the path toward supporting
environmental causes and moving on from
there I'm curious as to your thoughts on
that because of course the counter
argument is that if you have someone
commits a very small action like not
using an electric toothbrush that you
actually haven't really made much
progress but you might fool someone into
feeling like they've done their part
yeah i think that there's good arguments
on both sides of that issue and the
thing that influenced me in the
direction i went was really looking at
the social movement theory literature
which has involved ethnographies mostly
of that of different movements there's a
really interesting series of
ethnographies that we're done in
switzerland and there's obviously a lot
of work that's looked at you know the
civil rights movement and stuff like
that and there are definitely a variety
of factors that get people engaged in
change and why social movements because
I think that you know it's clear that
part of this problem has to do with laws
with policy with things outside of
individual action and getting people
socialized to the issues may change
their contribution to some of those
other things like what they vote for
even though that's not a direct action
of the site so that's getting outside of
the realm of what we as behaviorists can
easily measure and prove but the
literature shows that socializing people
did an issue is one piece of what gets
them to engage in a social movement
having a good leader having a co-located
place to meet having it be part of their
daily life or other factors that are
also important we can't do all of those
but I think there's value in
experimenting with this and it's not
necessarily the only or the best answer
but it's a start
any more remote questions or people here
with more questions so well I want to
thank Jim for a really interesting talk
and thank you all for coming so early in
the morning</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
