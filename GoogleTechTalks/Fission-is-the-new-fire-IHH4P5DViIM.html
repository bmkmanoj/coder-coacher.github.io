this is rod Adams and I I've been here
google since June of last year and I
guess this is a public video so I won't
talk about what I do but um so I met rod
online he's running a blog about Tomic
energy and he's fairly regular poster
and he's he's interesting to read and so
he's working on this company atomic
engines for quite some time and he's
here to give a talk about some of the
justifications for the company what
they're trying to do and atomic energy
in general and so i'll let you take it
away right all right thank you I came
here today to share of passion the
stimulus from my visit was finding a
presentation on google video by dr.
robert Bouchard titled should Google go
to nuclear I think dr. Broussard has the
right idea a fast growing company needs
to think hard about his future energy
sources but dr. Broussard is a scientist
who spent much of his career in fusion
research and when he came here he talked
about technology that might someday in
the distant future be available i'm here
today to talk to you about the other
nuclear power nuclear fission my plan is
to captivate you with a new perspective
about fission that will help you to see
it has the proven capabilities today to
eat as many immediate problems if you're
concerned about global climate change
urban air quality fossil fuel addiction
endemic poverty freshwater supplies and
soil erosion you might find new reasons
for optimism in the next few minutes I
plan to help you create a mental image
of fission that shows you that it's the
only technology available today that has
a prayer of reducing our dependence on
fire until humans harness fire we stated
mainly in tropical areas of the world
where there was little chance of frigid
temperatures we had no means of
preparing food
and we're limited to eating fruits and
meats that neat had no need for cooking
people were aware of fire but it must
have been a frightening phenomenon that
resulted only from stray lightning
strikes at some point in human history
people figured out how to control fire
but they had little ability to start
when it will the social position of fire
tenders became important as the eternal
flames of the village fire played a
central role in developing civilization
history is not clear but it probably
took several thousand years before many
humans had the ability to cause a spark
at will using Flint's and stones or
rubbing sticks now a long time ago I
tried to learn those skills and I can
tell you that the guys who learn the
neck probably were very valuable to
their civilization history of fire and
civilization continued their closely
associated past as people learned how to
start fires it will contain the fires
inside their residences direct the
deadly waste products out of their
residences and at the start of the
Industrial Revolution figure out how to
harness the heat from fire to do work as
people learn more about fire and its
power to improve their lives they also
learn about its limitations they got
burned they got cold when the fuel for
the fire ran out and they choked on the
smoke if it became too dense in some
places whole cultures died away as the
rate of fuel consumption exceeded the
rate at which fuel could be renewed by
natural processes at some point humans
figured out that supplying fire fuels
was a darn good business for most of
recorded history people who controlled
fire fuel sources achieved great
economic and social wealth when firewood
was a preeminent fuel the King's Own the
forest when people figured out how to
find and burn coal the mine owners
became incredibly well
the oil has been an even greater source
of wealth and power almost since the day
that Colonel Drake drilled his first
well in Pennsylvania by 1947 oil had
surpassed coal as the major fuel source
in United States the fuel supply
business started the process of
globalization when the British built
coaling stations to support their naval
power the very first multinational
corporations were petroleum
hunter-gatherers there are several
reasons why fuel became such a good
business it requires a constant input of
new material the materials have natural
limits on their abundance the power
produced makes life immensely better for
people because of the above there's
almost no need for salespeople when
moving massive quantities of material
bigger is better and controlling the
supply of a necessary commodity provides
you with profitable pricing power as is
the case in any business where
prosperity is based on scarcity fuel
customers have chafed under the control
the suppliers poor people were often
incarcerated as a result of scavenging
trips in the fort and the Kings forest
Londoners did not much like their
dependence on coal suppliers and the
words Big Oil has described a boogeyman
for my entire adult life for much of the
industrial age the relationship between
fuel buyer and seller is more like the
relation it's been rather uneven it's
been almost like the relationship
between an addict and a pusher in the
early part of the 20th century a small
band of physicists discovered a new
natural phenomena that offered the
potential to break the power of the fire
pushers at least one famous physicist
Ernest be the Rutherford dismissed the
idea of power from atomic nuclei as
moonshine but others realize the
difference in the
Tomic mass per nucleon for large atoms
and small atoms represented a huge
potential energy source although the
mass defect is small when you multiply
it by the speed of light squared you
come up with a very large number all the
physicists needed was a way to break
large nuclei and tournament two small
ones they needed a method there were a
number of key discoveries made in rapid
sequence to allow a small international
community of physicists to realize that
Rutherford was wrong when he made the
moonshine comin they learned that nature
had provided simple tools for breaking
large atoms once they figured out the
natural process they realized how easily
it could be replicated James Chadwick me
made one of the most important
discoveries when he found neutrons
particles that were at as massive as
protons but without any electric charge
he determined that neutrons represented
between fifty and seventy percent of the
mass of atomic nuclei with heavier
elements having a larger percentage of
neutrons in their nuclei since these
large particles neutrons didn't carry a
charge they could enter into other
nuclei without being deflected Enrico
Fermi performed a systematic series of
experiments on the elements in the
periodic table and he found that
neutrons were marvelous tools for
changing the property of atomic nuclei
he made stable elements into radioactive
isotopes and he even produced elements
that had never before been found in
nature the Philosopher's Stone that
alchemists had long sought had been
found there are ways to use neutrons to
create gold out of other elements after
more experimentation and exchanges of
ideas it became clear that neutrons with
the right amount of energy could
predictably break certain heavy isotopes
into two pieces of roughly equal size
lise meitner and otto frisch
name this new phenomenon fishing once
they decided it looked a lot like
biological cell division since the mass
of the two pieces was about Oh point one
percent less than the mass the original
heavy metal a tremendous amount of
energy was released 200 million electron
volts gram for gram the energy release
was about two million times more than
the most energetic chemical reaction
where only neutrons are exchanged in
molecule formation though the early
physicist may have a different mental
picture I like to compare the fuel
quantities like this a pound of uranium
which can be represented by the physical
size of three shooter marbles contains
as much energy as 30 tanker trucks full
of oil now I'm not a real strong guy but
I can actually hold more than three
marbles in my hand I can hold 10 okay so
I can hold the energy value of 100
tanker trucks in my hand okay the energy
release could have remained a laboratory
curiosity except for one more key
discovery remember heavy metals like
uranium have a higher neutron to proton
ratio than the lighter elements do when
heavy metal nuclei split there are extra
neutrons available on the product side
of the fission balanced equation those
free neutrons are born with enough
energy to cause additional fissions and
a scientist figured out if there were
enough of those extra neutrons they
could be used to create a
self-sustaining chain reaction to put
this incredible period of atomic
discovery in the historical perspective
I want to remind you what else was
happening at the same time james
chadwick discovered the neutron in 1934
Midler and frisch made their vision
analysis at this in the very early
stages of 1939 people around the world
had figured out that uranium and thorium
could fission and there were a number of
replications of the same
experiment okay if one of those they had
also figured out that there were more
than one Neutron released there was it
there was several more than two on
average released for proficient and the
reaction could continue and release
controllable heat okay Leo slurred a man
given it okay Leo Florida meant you've
been taken long bass and thinking a lot
while he's walking down the streets of
London filed a british patent on the
idea of an atomic chain reaction in 1934
as soon as he heard about neutrons ok
almost immediately after he heard about
uranium fission he kept came up with a
method he said that if you put graphite
in uranium together in the lattice
formation you could produce a workable
nuclear reactor that would have a
controllable chain reaction now we held
off on filing a patent for that device
until nineteen fifty-five Hitler and his
Nazis were over running Germany at the
same time they dominated of the people
involved in this chain of discoveries a
large portion of them were Jews who are
on the run from from the Germans
freshener for example had already were
already in exile from Germany many of
the key physicists were either Jewish
and married to Jews like Enrico Fermi
they realize that vision could happen
slowly enough to so the uranium could
replace other fuels but they also guess
that the reaction could be forced to
happen explosively they knew that the
labs they left behind had people
employed who knew most of the knowledge
required to make that explosive reaction
happen on December second 1942 Enrico
Fermi Leo's Lord and a small band of
scientists engineers and workers started
controlled and stopped the first chain
reaction in a simple arrangement of
graphite bricks and uranium spears they
were using slower
original idea that reaction took place
with well understood readily available
materials use student labor in the
construction force and occurred at room
temperature in an unheated building in
Chicago in December unlike the highly
publicized concept of cold fusion cold
fission is a reality that can be
repeated by anyone with a modern
education the right materials physics
use in the bomb came first only as an
accident of history if the physicists
were very interested in energy
production and would have taken that
path that they had not been more
concerned about the very survival of the
planet they were concerned they were
certain to scientists they left behind
in Nazi controlled Europe were just as
aware as they were of visions power for
both good and evil once they finished
the war many of these scientists were
ready to begin exploring the peaceful
applications of the new physical
phenomenon there was much to learn the
scientists and had done enough
foundational work that it was time for
the engineers to begin creating there
was an incredible level of excitement
about the possibility of crossing the
ocean using mere buckets full of fuel
instead of thousands of tons the coal or
oil there were thoughts about atomic
trains planes and even a few out there
dreamers that talked about atomic
automobiles unfortunately the US
government had different ideas from 1941
to 1953 a near-total veil of secrecy
cloaked the American atomic Enterprise
patents were nationalized ownership of
all of the key materials was restricted
to the government there was little room
left for creative tinkering with a newly
discovered energy source people like
Leo's Lord left the field and found
other opportunities of course the
important physical facts were
discoverable and the secrecy ever did
little to stop other nations from
developing the possibilities and even
developing their own weapons by December
1953 President Eisenhower one of the two
heroes in the 20th century made his
famous atoms for peace speech and opened
up the world of atomic fission research
and development in America we had given
certain companies a head start in atomic
knowledge acquisition we invited them
into the cone of silence through the
participation in the Manhattan Project
and in certain government-funded reactor
power projects during the 1940s and
early 50s the majority the companies cut
into the game were large established
corporations with a lot of equity in
maintaining their enterprise many were
already in the energy business as fuel
suppliers equipment manufacturers or
electricity suppliers they had ways of
doing things that led them to certain
key decisions one of their design
choices was that the best path for
development was to make the reactors as
big as possible this idea made sense
them as engineers indoctrinated in the
equations that support the concept of
the economy of scale and as
industrialists who know that they need
to protect their domain by raising the
barriers to entry to potential
competitors these large American
companies had a pretty good run with the
technology they learned in government
projects they captured growing shares of
some key markets sometimes they require
the assistance of the US government for
some of their marketing ones but during
that period there was also some great
projects that took advantage of the
unique characteristics of fission
compared to its combustion competition
we built zero emission vessels z V's
that could spend months underwater
without any outside air or need to dump
their exhaust gases like the one that
was my home for about three years we
built a beautiful but kind of
impractical cargo ship / luxury liner
called the NS Savannah that brought the
hope of atoms for peace to the world for
about a decade now notice how
beautifully the lines merged with the
cranes the cranes were designed not for
loading cargo but for
pretty okay this bow doesn't really
represent a way to carry a whole lot of
cargo but that's where the cargo holds
were so it was hard to load okay
Savannah did a bunch of Tours and
brought atoms for peace to the world
before she was laid up as being an
economical to operate oh by the way back
here in this section there was a
swimming pool a hundred luxury
staterooms and a dance floor not real
useful for operations of cargo ship when
Savannah was laid up as being an
economical it was nineteen seventy two
one year before the price of oil for its
competitors jumped by a factor of four
we built power plants for the most
remote and hard to supply areas in the
world PM 3a which is actually in this
building here power the mcmurdo station
in Antarctica for about a decade nr1 was
designed to reach the bottom of the
ocean and stay on station and whether it
sends everybody else into safe harbor
nr1 helped explore the Britannic the
Andrea Doria the USS Monitor she was
instrumental investigation of Egypt air
flight 990 and she recovered pieces from
Challenger and our one is still doing
valuable research 28 years after being
launched now notice NR 1 is only 400
tons displacement for the entire ship
for cruise 11 yet she's powered by a
nuclear reactor that provides all of the
electricity necessary not only for
proposing but for all of her very
sophisticated side scanning sonar
though there were some costly learning
experiences we also built a number of
large central station power plants had
captured market share from coal oil and
natural gas a little understood fact is
that nuclear power today supplies
twenty-eight percent more electricity in
the United States then all sources
together did in nineteen sixty okay
nuclear power surpassed all sources
together by 1991 less than fifty years
after the basic physical phenomenon had
been proven in a laboratory nuclear
fission replaced fires the energy source
for one hundred percent of us submarines
and aircraft carriers made inroads into
the surface ship market captured about
80% of new electric plant orders in the
u.s. from nineteen sixty three to
nineteen seventy three replaced oil in
France's electrical power system and
made inroads against coal and oil in a
number of other markets including the UK
Germany Italy Spain Taiwan South Korea
and Japan in 1970 nuclear fission market
share was essentially zero it's a dotted
line down here okay and it's going up
there
okay and by 1990 it was seven percent of
the energy supply and sixteen percent of
the world's electrical power supply that
portions remained essentially constant
since then the historical picture of us
energy production shows how fission
began to muscle into a market that was
previously dominated by fire fuels okay
here's total fuel consumption by energy
source from 1635 to 2005 would start
staking a making a large share we
started burning wood for things like
railroads and few other things like that
so it was start to become a commercial
fuel coal of course became very
important petroleum which includes both
which lots of different liquids with
petroleum in general the natural gas to
get share in here about 1970 nuclear
powered started ramping up okay the
green line is hydroelectric power and
you can see that in 1930s it jumped up
and then it pretty much stayed constant
ok
in the US between 1970 in 1995 nuclear
electric power was ramping up
fortunately we had no clue electric
power because this is what our crude oil
production in the US was doing at the
same time peaked at in about nineteen
seventy almost exactly the same time as
nuclear power begin to ramp up for a
variety of interesting reason to be the
subject of numerous debates the first
fission Atomic Age and it's slowly
between 1973 in 1986 most of the
operating plants kept running but the
rate of construction slowed dramatically
even in those places were never quite
stopped one reason that it's not often
mentioned is that fire fuel sellers
cannot enjoy losing market share to
fission though they talk a lot about a
alternative energy they rarely if ever
mentioned nuclear power you know you're
threatening when your competitions
reaction is to ignore your very presence
a critical thinker can also recognize
the difference between words and actions
for example BP change its logo to that
green starburst it makes an intellectual
linked to its role as a solar energy
supplier this is bp's profit that's not
revenue that's profit in 2004 17 billion
dollars this is their investment that
little blue line down there in solar
energy okay 25 million in the same year
the first atomic age was also similar
nature to the first part of the computer
era with few exceptions the machines
were large capital intensive and
available only to the few remember the
economy of scale was a driver the uppers
became members of privileged priesthood
were protecting the secrets of their
special knowledge was a key part of
their prosperity limiting commercial
fission development to the Central
Station electric power plant reduced
options when electric power companies in
the 1990s decided they had enough
capacity there was no other markets for
nuclear fission to
look at if I did not mention the
by-products I am sure that people would
ask what about the waste my honest and
sometimes exasperated answer is what
waste are you talking about the reason I
say exasperate is because so many people
throw out that phrase what about the
waste as a rhetorical trump card they
really don't want to hear the answer
they think they have the argument one as
soon as they bring it out all the
material that remains after fissionable
fuel is consumed has potential uses the
fuel manufacturing process along with
the operating design limits that we
impose make sure that all of the fuel
remains locked up inside the fuel rods
all the byproducts that last more than a
few decades are still useful as fuel
with the with the second generation
technology we are using today only five
percent of the initial potential energy
is released before we take the fuel out
and store it the short of the fission
elements have multiple potential uses
many of them are rare even unique
materials with useful physical
properties and nadir a pen name for one
of the frequent Diaries on the daily
causes of chemist and he and I have
shared a lot of information over the
last few years but he's pointed me to a
lot of research reports that talk about
methods to extract rhodium ruthenium and
platinum group metals from used fission
fuels those are some very valuable
metals that have a lot of commercial
uses so some described fission waste
products is deadly there has not been a
single instance that I can find anywhere
in the world and I've been searching for
a long time using some great search
tools by the way for a story where
someone has been killed by exposure to
the waste products from commercial power
I've been unsuccessful unless your real
goal is to kill the fission goose you
can see that use fit and fuels are a
tremendous resource and part of the good
news when compared to the combustion
fuels competition the next next
visionaries will be different
I predicted a move along the same path
the democratization of the technology
has happened in so many other tea
industry's most recently in computing
key contributors to this disruptive new
age will be fission devices that make
control in the process as simple as
controlling a charcoal fire perhaps
you've heard of pebble bed reactors
maybe from the wired article in
September 2004 titled let a thousand
reactors bloom or maybe even from 60
minutes last week where antique a deck
was on and talked about a melt proof
reactor Farrington Daniels the US
scientists first proposed the idea in
1947 the concept is similar to
self-lighting charcoal if you put the
fuel and a moderator and simple shapes
you could pile those shapes into
containers and control it to provide the
desired amount of heat there were a
couple of materials technologies that
were not quite ready in 1947 but the
idea was good enough to gain at least
some elect intellectual traction okay I
like pebble power rudolph's Hilton
turned Daniels idea into reality with a
30-year project to design build test and
operate a reactor called the AVR and a
follow-on called the thorium high
temperature reactor in Germany I'm
passing around a pebble for your
enjoyment and it is an inert pebble so
the smallest unit of the system is a
triple coated half a millimeter diameter
uranium dioxide fuel particle it's
coated with four layers a porous carbon
buffer an inner pyrolytic carbon a
silicon graphite carbide Barry words
which prevents any gases from being
released and then a pyrolytic carbon
outside it protects it again you take
about ten thousand and twenty thousand
of those little particles they're about
the size of a grain of sand and you put
them inside a a six centimeter diameter
graphite sphere okay and then you have a
the fuel spheres look like balls and the
one that I'm passing around tower
pebbles combined fuel containment
moderate or single unit to be matched
produced and used in many different
configurations many different sizes
reactors Sultan has team developed
coating processes and tested a wide
range of feed materials and so the
concept could handle various chemistry's
of uranium plutonium and thorium Chinese
researchers at Tsinghua University are
keeping the concept moving forward with
their operating ten megawatt thermal HTR
ten there are commercial pebble bed
units in construction in china dutch
researchers have looked at the concept
for cogeneration plant and there's a
company in South Africa called the pmr
company which is looking to develop what
they call small but I still consider
large reactors about 160 megawatts
pebble bed modular reactors it should be
ready for full scale deployment by about
20 20 atoms atomic engines Inc it's my
company has a slightly different concept
in a potentially more aggressive
timeline we also believe that a thousand
reactors is just an intermediate goal
there are many simple many simplifying
aspects of pebble beds they can be
easily produced and have a repeatable
fuel shape if you put enough spheres own
container you can build a heat producing
reactor shielding reflectors and control
rods give you the ability to control and
establish the temperature of the reactor
the graphite / heavy metal matrix
provided by pebbles gives the reactors
two key characteristics a negative
temperature coefficient of reactivity
and a very high maximum temperature
limit the negative temperature
coefficient of reactivity gives pebble
bed reactors a natural negative feedback
loop that provides stability if the
demand for power increases the rate of
fission increases if the demand drops
the fission rate drops to match the
demand if all flow through the reactor
stops the reactor heats up to a steady
state temperature limit below the
maximum temperature limit for the fuel
and doesn't get any hotter eventually it
starts cooling down as a natural process
of convection and conduction give you
some heat trend
to the environment visions very
responsive and allows a single power
plant to provide a variety of needs that
changes rapidly is desired submarines
icebreakers aircraft carriers
demonstrate the responsiveness of
fission everyday graphite and heavy
metal oxide don't melt to you get to be
about 300 degrees c and that maximum
temperature limit where there's no
damage at all no release of fission
products is about 1,600 see the maximum
temperature in a transient is someone
the order of 1,400 see it's been proven
through actual testing not just
simulations that these reactors hit a
steady state temperature limit if you're
looking for a proof you can find a video
of a recent test of the HTR 10 in China
it was done by ABC that's Australia
Broadcasting Corporation catalyst
program look look for nuclear China it's
about minute 14 or so in the video
you'll see the test of the HTR 10 where
they simply stopped all cooling flow
spheres provide large flow paths for a
gas coolant leading to a natural
marriage between these systems and
Brayton cycle gas turbines brain cycles
the heat engine it's a basis for jet
engines turboprop aircraft commercial
ship engines and even some of those
natural gas-fired electric power plants
that were such the rage during the 1990s
Brayton cycles are simple just remember
suck bang blow go and get your minds out
of the gutter compress the gas heat the
gas expand the gas through a turban to
produce power then you have two choices
in an open cycle like a jet engine you
exhaust aghast and bring a new cool gas
in a closed cycle take the gas from the
exit to the turban go through a cooler
oops
go through the cooler and you go back
into the compressor for another round
most pebble bed projects in the world
use high-pressure helium as the coolant
was specially designed machinery and
piping system to contain and move the
healing around helium is a gas has
special characteristics it's very light
monoatomic as a high speed of sound as a
high heat transfer rate it's completely
different than most other gases that are
used in industrial production and AE
atoms atomic engines we will use low
pressure nitrogen is our working fluid
this choice enables us to use turbo
machinery that is currently being
manufactured for air breeding operations
our computation so the simplicity of the
design allows economical sizes that are
much smaller than almost any other
proposed nuclear machine with room for
further shrinkage as we learn more we
can take advantage of the economies of
scale and mass production to serve
markets that cannot be economically
served by other nuclear heaton's and
concepts we've been doing our homework
for more than a decade actually I've
been doing this since about nineteen
ninety one and we believe that there are
huge market opportunities that have been
ignored we're engaged with some
interested parties if never before been
able to consider using fission as a
solution to pressing energy problems
there are villages in rural Alaska that
currently depend on a large on large
diesel engines that burn a smelly
expensive fuel that has to be delivered
during the summer time on a river that's
frozen most of the year there's a
Pacific island nation where the monthly
fuel bill reached 70 million dollars per
month during the immediate aftermath of
Hurricane Katrina that was a doubling in
about a two month period one of our more
surprising potential custom partners is
a company that wants to use the heat and
electricity from Adams engines to help
convert coal and water into a clean
burning
diesel fuel that can be transported by
pipelines instead of open container coal
cars another wants to use Adams engines
to propel LNG tankers and then when you
get into port to use the heat from the
engines to gasify the product and put it
into pipelines there's even a serial
entrepreneur in texas and i just spent
the last weekend with he and his team
who wants to build an Adam's engine in
his own backyard and he's got a pretty
good-sized backyard okay as a
demonstration and atomic power can be
safe and clean enough to run in the
basement of any large building atoms
atomic engines plans to store this is
his his house he's got six homes along
the lake in a Texas about a maybe two
hours outside of Austin we're going to
store our engine byproduct material and
carefully designed licensed containers
until enough of them in accumulating a
single space to allow economical
recycling the pebble bed fuels have
already demonstrated it can achieve burn
up some between eight and twenty percent
vice the five percent it's available for
the second generation light water
reactors that are currently operating
the increased fuel consumption fuel
efficiency will reduce the amount of
fuel that will need to be recycled okay
we like the phrase reduce reuse and
recycle as a way to handle the byproduct
materials when I put my dinner and
leftovers into a Tupperware container
and put them in the fridge for the next
day's lunch I've created leftovers are
valuable to me if I take those same
products and toss them in the trash I've
created what will be the next morning
potentially deadly waste materials they
have to be hauled away in the energy
business our firebase competition
doesn't have a choice they produce such
massive quantities of waste materials
that they have to push them into the
environment
through smoke stacks or exhaust pipes
almost immediately I've talked long
enough you can find more information on
the web you guys are real good at
finding things ok suggested search terms
or atomic engines rod Adams the atomic
show on the podcast network atomic
insights Adams engines pebble bed
reactors I'm ready for your questions
and I've got a whole list of references
here if anybody's interested yes okay
well you know it to me it's great that
people can always remember the accidents
that happen in the nuclear industry
because that's almost like the man bites
dog story okay if accidents happened all
the time in nuclear nobody would
remember the accident but since we can
name Chernobyl and Three Mile Island we
remember him now John will happen over
20 years ago through my line I have been
almost 30 years ago since then we've
been operating a large portion of our
electric power system using nuclear
reactor we have 440 operating in the
world and we haven't had anything else
like that okay how many people here
remember what happened in December 23rd
2003 in a small area in China when a
hundred and ninety people died and nine
thousand people went to the hospital
because of a leak in a natural gas well
how many people remember the last time a
coal mine collapsed how many people
remember the last time a power a
coal-fired power plant blew up and
killed a few of its operators how many
people remember the last time an
apartment building blew up because the
natural gas we don't remember those
things because they happen with
depressing regularity yes
okay the graphite in the reactor is used
as a moderator and what that means is
that there's a little bit higher
probability of neutrons that are slow
causing a reaction in uranium okay when
the graphite heats up it expands a bit
and is the less effective moderator okay
so if the graphite heats up it becomes
less effective as a moderator meaning
that more neutrons will leak out of the
core instead of running into other
uranium causing fission so that
temperature negative temperature
coefficient works by the way in light
water reactors also okay as long as the
light water reactors designed properly
because water has the ability of being
both a moderator and a poison so you
have to balance us by the way Chernobyl
had the problem of being having graphite
moderation and water cooling okay and
what happened at Chernobyl was the
moderator stayed there but the water
which was cooling and a poison
evaporated which made the reactor have a
positive reinforcement and most of you
are systems engineers and probably
understand the hazards of having
positive feedback yes sure right now
France and the UK have large recycling
operations in progress in Japan is just
about finished their recycling all of
the commercial fuel in France gets
recycled atla hog and gets put back into
other reactors god and in the UK the
same thing happens they use what's
called mixed oxide fuels now Japan and
Russia and a few other place in Germany
have looked at some of the other
products besides the spent fuel the
stuff that still uranium and that's
where they're looking at things like
rhodium and platinum and ruthenium
extract out of the fission products it's
another couple of useful fission
products that have been used in the u.s.
strontium-90
which people get scared about is a great
heat source for a radioisotope thermal
can be used in batteries at last 15-20
years and cesium 137 can be used as a
source of irradiation for sterilizing
medical products or food okay yes
well right now there's a constraint in
the availability of fizz and fuel as its
quote traded on the market but one of
the things s we remember it is fission I
mean uranium is not really traded on any
open market right now it is exchanged in
trade and the quoted price for uranium
has jumped up dramatically in the last
five years the quoted price for uranium
in 2000 was under ten dollars a pound
and right now it's flirting with about
ninety five dollars a pound but the vast
majority of uranium that's actually
moved in the world today is already
locked up in long-term contracts and the
average price the utilities are paying
for uranium is on the order of
twenty-five or thirty dollars a pound
okay so there's a lot of talk about hey
there's not enough uranium there's not
enough uranium in the free market right
now but there's a lot of places in the
world particularly place like New Mexico
Colorado Australia Canada where there's
huge known deposits but we're not we
weren't mining it because it eight
dollars a pound it wasn't profitable had
ninety dollars per pound it's real
profitable twenty dollars a pound is
good enough really so there's a lot of
uranium in the world it is communist in
and if your enemy gets to be a problem
which I don't see that ever happening
you can also use thorium which is three
times as common as uranium
well actually mining is very easy for
uranium in the u.s. most of our uranium
is mine using it's an in situ mining
which is a process that if you go it
looks really boring okay what they do is
they drill holes into a limestone
deposit that has uranium in it and they
fill the limestone holes with a solution
that will dissolve the uranium and it
brings it up to this to the surface and
they take the uranium out very low
energy use and the solution is really
really dangerous stuff its carbon
dioxide and water okay it's basically
soda water because all you need is
slightly acidic water to dissolve your
aim and around this institute mine they
have monitoring wells so they know that
none of the the you know dissolved
uranium leeches out so mining is a very
low energy use operation enrichment
takes some energy use but most of the
studies that people talk about and say
that there's a lot of energy used in
enriching uranium they always look at
the old sensor for you I mean I gases to
fusion plants that were built in the
1940s when we didn't know anything else
they never compare with sense reviews
production when it comes to using modern
technology and centrifuge production the
energy needed to produce finished
fission fuels is less than 1% of what
you get out ok and in some case it is
far less than 1% because for example in
Canada they have minds where the mine is
twenty percent or content uranium mean
it it's really concentrated doesn't
require much effort at all to get it out
except you have to do it with remote
mining machines and then they use
natural uranium reactors they don't do
enrichment at all yeah
there's there's huge changes in politics
since the atomic since the energy policy
act of 2005 2005 august of two thousand
five if you talk to people in the
nuclear industry they figured there
might be two or three new plants built
before 2020 okay energy policy act of
2005 was passed which offered some
incentives for early use gave nuclear
power plants rightfully so a production
tax credit because they're also
emission-free power sources just like
wind and solar but only for a couple of
plants by the way and then the
government administration is stood up a
couple of times several times and say
hey we want nuclear power as a way of
response to fossil fuel addiction and
global climate change so now today 34
plants are being planned and that's
large central station light water
reactors nobody's counting atoms engine
jet because we haven't told the NRC or
we haven't got docketed yet we've taught
the NRC but as soon as you get docketed
and and officially start applying for a
license the government starts the ticker
and the ticker is 240 dollars per
bureaucrat hour for every hour spent
talking to you reviewing your license
whatever the NRC is a bunch of lawyers
and engineers but they count every time
you talk to them on the phone they have
a little you know charge card that keeps
going so we're waiting till we're really
ready before we start paying those fees
yes
um there's a couple things you have to
happen in a regulatory environment first
of all there has to be some proof and we
can do that but some some demonstrations
of what happens when the worst-case
accident happens not modeling but real
demonstration and so that it's a really
boring event because right now the
regulations require setbacks okay they
require exclusion areas and evacuation
zones and all that but the regulations
were written assuming and all the power
plants are light water reactors where
you have steam and and high-pressure
water and a bunch of other things that
can cause hate and discontent not that I
think that they're dangerous they just
have to have a lot of effort to keep
them safe the the other piece that we're
struggling with right now is that the
government has made the assumption that
all reactors should be treated equally
which means that the licence fee for a
ten megawatt Adams engine is exactly the
same as the licence fee for a seventeen
hundred megawatt mitsubishi heavy
industries reactor that's going to be
built in Amarillo Texas that license fee
right now is about four million dollars
a year okay now there's a lot of
complexities in a seventeen hundred
megawatt electric plant that are not in
a one of ten megawatt electric Adams
engine there's not much to it we
basically have four components and
impressed or a turban a heat exchanger
and a reactor okay highest pressure in
the system is only about a hundred and
twenty psi that's only in the portion
where the reactor is the rest of the
systems operating at basically
atmospheric pressure so yes
that's a great question okay um small
reactors some people say well jeez it
will be able to steal the single I'm not
talking about something that's small
enough to really be able to lift it up
okay it's going to be inside a vault
probably about the early ones will be in
about a 30 x 30 building the guy in
Texas wants to build it he's his
property is on a granite dome and he's
actually one of his cereal
entrepreneurial odd jobs in the past was
he ran a company called Texas crushed
stone which is a courting operation so
he understands how to dig in granite he
wants to put the reactor inside a 50 x
30 x 20 granite dome on his property ok
with a lid on top of it well there's
nothing we can do nothing we can do to
stop knowledge of nuclear fission ok
nuclear fission exists it wasn't
something invented by humans it was
discovered by humans ok many of the
countries that you're talking about we
actually spent quite a bit of time and
you know I remember I'm I'm a child of
the 19 well i was born in nineteen
fifty-nine but i went to school in the
1970s and al awful lot of students in
the u.s. engineering were people from
iran iran had an awful lot of
technicians here in the US engineers
they understand how to do this stuff
okay we don't think that this technology
is dangerous or hazardous or anything
else as long as it's done properly okay
we don't understand why anybody will
want to bother building a bomb when you
can build power plants that make the
world a better place to live okay i also
believe when a country that has been in
the energy business for most of its
existence
it says we recognize that we need more
sources of energy we think this has got
a lot of legs we're going to develop
nuclear technologies because oh by the
way we operate oil wells we know that
they run out yes
um not a whole lot I mean that we move
commercial fuel all the time all around
the country I mean there's only two
plants in the u.s. to actually make
commercial nuclear fuel and we got
reactors in about 30 states so there's
already existing regulations for how you
move few of what you have to do to move
the fresh fuel all that stuff the waist
or the not the waist the byproduct
materials I got to keep changing my own
language but the byproduct materials
right now are all stored on site because
they can it doesn't take up much space
okay we only have to put it aside one
tenth of a cent per kilowatt-hour of
electric power produced to pay for the
cost of storing the material okay moving
it to a single location or some regional
locations is also within current
regulations there are containers that
have already been designed licensed and
tested the transport containers for used
nuclear fuel or some pretty amazing
devices it very simple their concrete
steel lead structures but they're
designed so that you can crash them into
into a solid concrete wall at 80 miles
an hour then you take the same container
and you run it into the side with a with
a rail railroad locomotive then you have
you drop the container on a spike then
after you do all that you douse it with
with petroleum and you burn it for 30
minutes and you see if it if it leaks ok
I've got there's videos on you guys can
find videos like this on the web ok they
show these tests it's pretty amazing ok
now to me I'm pretty satisfied with that
especially when I think about what would
happen if instead of moving some vision
fuel around I had to ride on a highway
behind these guys
okay those guys scare the heck out of me
on the highway yes um graphite in
certain configurations is flammable okay
this graphite ball you'd have a very
hard time lighting that on fire okay but
also remember that these reactors are
filled with inert gases okay we use
nitrogen as our gas okay but even if the
nitrogen was to go away the most of it
happen would be to get some oxygen in
there and the amount of oxygen and
burning that would be available as
almost nothing okay again the the outer
coating is very difficult to burn
remember graphite is exactly the same
chemical composition as diamonds there's
a scale of flammability in graphite and
certain kinds of graphite don't burn it
all yes
new technology when it took us 150 years
to decide the possibility well who said
fossil fuels don't work I think 100
years penalba think their mistake well I
would hate to live in a world where we
never used fossil fuels I mean I'm not
going to I'm not going to stand here and
tell you that I think that
industrialized civilization is a bad
thing I mean I've lived in areas and I
visited areas where they don't have
commercial fuel sources it's not a fun
place to be you can't drink the water
you can't have fresh water unless you
care it on your head women spend their
whole days carrying twigs and in some
place to de new ting the entire area
because there's that's the only thing
they can do is find little twigs to heat
their food so I don't think that fossil
fuels are a bad thing my challenge
though is how can we extend some of the
benefits of civilization to people in a
time when we are in fact getting to the
point where we can't produce some fossil
fuels as fast as we're running them okay
Peak Oil doesn't mean that the fossil
fuels are gone it means that you have
produced half of what there is to
produce and from then on the rate of
production will go down every year even
as the demand goes up yes
terrorist war hysteria that
well the US government is pretty
satisfied with the protection that US
nuclear plants have now there there are
definitely some folks that are against
vision who are never going to be
satisfied okay and there's lots of
reasons why those people never be
satisfied I do believe that some of them
are motivated by money and some of them
are motivated by money to keep trying to
make people afraid of a competitor the
US government said is that our existing
reactors are pretty safe against
terrorists and quite frankly I've been
to a few recently most Americans can't
go there I happen to have the right you
know checks in the block and whatnot but
I think that we've overstepped the
security the point where it's it's bad
for overall safety in that we don't even
let the visitor centers where kids used
to go and learn more about this
technology we didn't let them stay open
we've moved them so far away from the
plant they don't mean anything two kids
anymore you know the idea that a
commercial airliner can crash into a
containment dome and do anything other
than go splat like a bug is it is it's
amazing to me I've seen the way those
buildings are constructed rebar is big
around as my forearm concrete that I can
almost not reach them you know this this
thick of concrete a steel container
inside of that okay I know what
commercial airlines are really light
they look like big monstrosities right
but they're just an aluminum can okay
this is an aluminum ass and airline is
so is the engines at the end of the
wings okay I happen to have seen the
residue of a of an airplane hitting a
large concrete building
I work in Washington DC I don't have any
any concern that they would do much
damage to the business end of a nuclear
power plant though they can certainly do
something to the Transformers outside no
doubt about that yes
the interesting thing about and a
nuclear reactor is that in order to be
safe in order for it to be something
that I want to be next to it has to be
surrounded by a vault known as a shield
okay it has to have a large amount of
lead steel concrete layered in a way to
protect you from radiation and what that
means is that they can take a real heavy
blow and keep on ticking okay so if I
was in a place where aid an airplane
powered by an atom's engine fell on my
head I die okay but if I was very far
away and it missed me I wouldn't get hit
by the flames at all and I probably
wouldn't see any radiation exposure I
don't know if you all remember but not
too long ago a u.s. submarine going it
fairly high rates of speed and ran into
a mountain you know and nothing happened
to the power plant you know pretty cool
not something i want to recommend to you
by the way can ruin your whole day and
your career and everything else yes
well large is a relative term I I
believe that that our engines will have
a building around them a vapor type
pressure boundary a vault if you if you
will that protects the plant protects
the people who work around the plant and
ensures that nobody can get into it okay
it it's going to be probably you know
for a 10 megawatt reactor be about a 30
x 30 building 30 x 30 x 30 which is
three stories tall and you know not too
much bigger than your average living
room by the way that's big enough to
supply a town of about 10,000 people not
bad what can also put your ship around
yes so with a lot of the waste if it
takes hundreds of years to become safe
how do you store something like that
even the containers you talked about
like water table changes and these
containers are sitting in water for
hundreds of years why would they be
seeing in water I'm not going to put my
containers anywhere but above ground and
have a monitor by people hundreds of
years what what the environment is going
to look like especially with global
climate change if it starts they're
really easy for or something like water
table to shift
right I understand it but a bell crown
and you actively have to maintain that
building this started I had to actively
maintained yes doesn't the price of
maintaining that building over hundreds
of years I mean you filled this you fill
these buildings of waste you create
today to maintain with the ways for
hundreds of years depends I don't let
you in Delhi investment with up front
but it's never gonna make a lot of money
it generates plenty for us right if you
take a big enough lot of money okay
yeah I mean right now again with just a
sliver of money one tenth of a cent per
kilowatt-hour generated okay at a time
when the average electric power price in
the u.s. is eight and a half cents a
kilowatt hour okay one tenth of a cent
that generates almost a billion dollars
a year okay the nuclear waste disposal
fund in the US has a total endowment
right now of about twenty eight billion
dollars the interest on 28 billion
dollars can pay for an awful lot of
security guards forever okay yes
well I hope that the status and
repository Yucca Mountain is exactly
what Senator Reid says it is which is
dead I don't think that yucca mountain
is necessary I think Yucca Mountain is
this is a a waste of money that's being
used as a distraction and a way to to
slow the nuclear industry from
development the nuclear industry is
finally beginning to recognize it is far
better to talk about recycling the fuel
to plan for recycling the fuel and
capturing the used material I mean we're
not talking about storing it forever we
have to put enough materials in one
place to make it economical to run a
recycling plant you can't build a
recycling plant because you have a can
you know one you know small store of
aluminum cans because you know one day's
worth of production okay what I do
tomorrow okay you need to have some of
that fuel stores side so i think the
Yucca Mountain particularly now is not
going to happen Harry Reid is the
senator from Nevada he is the senate
majority leader and he has said that he
doesn't want Yucca Mountain to happen as
sentencer diminish she told us that
american nuclear society gathering not
too long ago he says you know i don't
think that harry reid after fighting you
come out for the last ten years woke up
the day he became Senate Majority Leader
and said now that i have more power i'm
going to give in
secondary waves I mean everything that
surrounds her actor because parted with
your eyes and stuff like that correct so
it's not just the fuel itself as you can
probably recycle more efficiently what
about well of course one of the things
that's interesting to me is that many of
those secondary systems can be recycled
also you know you're right you don't
want to have the pressure vessel mÃ©tier
the pressure vessel which is you know
hit and being hit by neutrons that metal
going out into the open market but if we
were in a situation where we are
actually building new reactors you know
we're going to have to have sources of
metal for the new reactors old reactors
would be a great source of metal for new
reactors particularly after they've been
sitting around for a while and the other
good thing is that we don't have to
replace that particular part very often
the pressure vessels the part that
actually gets bombarded with neutrons is
something that looks like it's going to
last for at least 60 years and maybe
even longer that the existing power
plants in the u.s. many of them about 43
have been extended from a 40 year
license to a 60 year license but the NRC
is already talking about how they're
going to check them for the next 20 year
extension after that all the rest of the
power plant materials don't really get
bombarded by neutrons they get exposed
to some radioactive materials through
the circulation of the water one of the
things that's nice about gas cooled
reactors is are circulating working
fluids in earth very little corrosion
products exist we have operated some gas
cooled reactors in the world and after a
period of time it looks like those
reactors have about one-tenth the amount
of corrosion product type activation in
their secondary and their primary
systems so it's a pretty neat thing yes
um we haven't got to that kind of
detailed design for our reactors
commercial power plants today have a
getting down to about between 20 and 30
days every 18 months for refueling they
refuel about they take about one third
of the core and replace it and so the
the average element in the core actually
stays in the court about four and a half
to five years the AVR that was built in
germany was actually designed for
continuous online refueling and the
pebble bed modular reactors is being
built in south africa and the one that's
operating in china is actually designed
for online refueling for the markets
that we want to serve that's too
complicated we're going to do batch
replacements and so we think we're going
to get the refueling time in down at
least less than 30 days it's a small
reactor not going to take a whole lot of
power or con and we think we're going to
go about six to ten years before we need
to refuel rather than every 18 months
one of the neat things today and we've
got submarines out there just being
launched the virginia-class submarines
they're designed to go for 33 years
without new fuel pretty cool yeah
uranium as usage rates that would be
applied by the Legion of other
but I can't handle numbers that far to
the future I'm being a little facetious
but they really are way out there as
long as you don't think about using just
the point seven percent of uranium is
u-235 as long as you plan on a smart
conversion breeding recycling system
where you're using more and more of the
heavy metal materials and at that point
you talk about millennia before you
start running out of uranium even if it
was supplying all of our current power
needs there's a lot of it out there yes
go ahead
11 respect my mind for a while is any
time about other ways what you have a
considers the altar right now we're
pumping billions of tons of carbon
dioxide in the atmosphere
on the environment talk about global
warming global warming is caused by
waves so I think what a lot of people
are starting to faces is a choice
between different ways
or alternative energy
well if alternative energy suddenly
springs July
okay I guess we're not back on I was
going to show you reminds of the graph
okay if you go and look at the do e they
have a distinct called the energy
information administration it's a great
source of all kinds of real facts about
energy usage I always give their
predictions a huge grain of salt but
they're pretty good at recording what
has happened in the past and what is
happening today and right now the only
way that that anything other than
nuclear coal wood oil and gas and
hydroelectricity shows up on the charts
as if they start combining wind and
solar with with wood waste in municipal
solid waste and all that stuff in their
charts otherwise it didn't show up on
the graph it doesn't make a bump okay
and we've been looking at that stuff for
a long time humans have known the Sun
has energy as long as humans have been
around humans have known that the
windows energy I mean we've been sailing
ships around the ocean forever we built
windmills I just saw one milk while I
was in Texas you know one of those
old-fashioned windmills we've noticed
there if it was such a great source of
energy either all of the people before
us have been really stupid or maybe they
weren't I don't think they were I don't
think that that all the billions of
people live before me are that ignorant
I just don't
anybody else I appreciate your time and
your questions and thanks for inviting
me and I also want to tell you I'm not
smacking up to you guys and that's
that's a Navy term but I really want to
thank you for what you guys do because
what you do makes it possible for me to
do all kinds of really neat stuff i've
been using your systems for a long time
