first met Matt about ten years ago when
we both joined a group that plays board
games every Wednesday night and I
quickly discovered that Matt not only
likes to play games he also likes to
design them because he was asking me to
help play test some of his designs in
February of this year
Matt released pandemic which is a board
game where players cooperate to save the
world from deadly diseases that
threatened to wipe out humanity the game
has been enthusiastically received and
its first printing sold out in less than
a month in his day job Matt is a
principal designer at Yahoo and I think
in this talk to try to pull together
these two areas of interest Matt's going
to discuss how being an interaction
designer affected the game design
process as well as how cooperative games
like pandemic can point to new models
for engagement in online systems so
without further delay
here's Matt I want to thank Dave for
having me out it's mentioned I'm Matt
Leacock I'm a I want to point out first
and foremost I'm a hobbyist game
designer I don't actually design games
for a living that they just don't pay
the bills maybe if you're doing computer
games you can get away with it but I'm
as you mentioned an interaction designer
night I draw a lot from my hobby and
from my profession although designing
board games doesn't pay the bills I get
a lot of inspiration from it that I can
apply to interaction design and I learn
a lot in the interaction design process
that I use at work that I can apply them
to board game design so when Dave
invited me out I thought maybe I could
dig a little bit into that because it
might be of interest to you guys let's
see if I can get my own there we go so
this is what I have kind of laid out I
thought I'd give a little brief overview
of pandemic for people who have never
played the game or seen it and then go
through the development history a bit
and talk about some of the lessons I
learned from the game and then very
briefly kind of compare that to software
design and then I'll leave some time at
the end for Q&amp;amp;A is that sound workable
so first of all it has anybody out there
played the game okay we got it maybe a
third oh and someone brought one great
so I try not to bore you guys but give
the the rest of the audience some sort
of idea of how the game works in about
two minutes if I can so first of all as
they've mentioned pandemics of
cooperative game unlike most games when
you're you're fighting head-to-head with
the other players in the game and
pandemic you're all working together as
a team and you're working as a team
essentially to try to beat the game
either everybody all wins together or
they all lose together and this is a
shot of the game in play or maybe right
after the game is finished and so the
idea is you're moving your pawns around
and you're trying to contain disease
that's out breaking across the planet
and you're trying to contain them so
that you can buy enough time to research
for cures there's four diseases they're
red blue yellow and black and you need
to get those cures before the world
erupts and disease essentially so on
your turn you've got four actions you
can spend and most of your time is spent
just basically moving around the board
trying to contain things but one of the
more important actions there is
discovering a cure so once you've done
that discover action four times and
discover the four cures you save the
world and everybody everybody feels
great if however you don't then other
things happen so after you take your
four actions you actually draw two cards
and then it's your job to infect the
world some more and you do that by
drawing these cards this is a infection
card so at the end of your turn you draw
an infection card this one's for Algiers
you'd play this card and then you take a
black cube representing an infected
population you put that in Algiers and
you draw another card and you put some
more cubes on and so on and then from
time to time so basically the play
proceeds you take some actions you
infect the board you take some actions
you infect the board from time to time
you're going to draw one of these and
this is a the nasty card in the game an
epidemic card when you draw one of these
lots of bad things happen amongst them
you end up taking all these disease
cards that you were pulling you take the
discard pile all the
different places that have been infected
you take that and you shuffle it up and
then you put it back on top of the draw
pile and that has this horrible side
effect that means that as you're
infecting the world again when you draw
new infections the cities that were
previously infected get increasingly
more infected and after a while you
might end up in a situation like this
where you can see Europe is overrun with
the case of the Blue Meanies or whatever
you want to call the blue disease and
it's really bad because the cities
actually can only hold a certain amount
of infection after they if they get so
saturated if they if you have any more
infected people that it outbreaks into
the neighboring regions so in this case
if we're to add another cube to Paris
rather than adding a fourth cube you
would outbreak to all of its neighbors
and you would have to add a cube in each
one of those cities and if those had
three cubes in them they would outbreak
and you can kind of see how you get
these vicious chain reactions and things
get out of hand and if you get too many
of those than the basically humanity's
wiped out and it's your fault
basically however if you're able to
collect five cards of the same color in
this case blue and turn them in you're
able to find the Cure in this case for
blue and you mark it on the board and
should you and your team be able to
discover the four different cures you
win and the world is saved and there's
high-fives all around one last thing I
want to point out about the game is that
each player has a specific role that
they play something unique that they
bring to the team and you can be a
dispatcher ops expert medic researcher
that sort of thing and that allows you
to sort of bring your own unique
contribution although you're all
cooperating each player has sort of an
opportunity to shine so that's sort of a
pandemic in a nutshell so I thought I'd
look a little bit at the the history you
know what with the process I went to to
design the game and some of the things I
picked up as I went so I want to touch
very briefly on idea generation semi ask
always asked you know where did the idea
for the game come from and for the
longest time I had to kind of say I
really don't know it just kind of sprang
forth and honestly that's really not
true after thinking about it or maybe
rationalizing it for a while I
remembered that um when I was a teenager
I came up with one of my
earlier games and it was a kind of a
goofy concept where you're represented
in the game by a subatomic particle and
you played another opponent who is
another particle and your goal was to
smash yourself as much as possible so
that you started out basically with a
chip and you want to smash herself so
you became two chips and then you could
smash those and you have four and then
eight and sixteen you could kind of get
the idea that things would get rapidly
out of control and so the game had this
horrible name it so you get the idea you
get you subatomic particles fission
right and all the pieces were chips so
the of course that the name of the game
was fish and chips I'll let you anyway
so I had that kind of in the back of my
head and I also wanted to do a
cooperative game and in when you're
doing a cooperative game you need to
kind of embody an opponent and viruses
seemed like a natural and also so trying
to think what else what else kind of
piled into that but I guess all the news
you know all the news all the different
pandemics SARS and and such happening so
I was out on a walk with my daughter and
I think a lot of this stuff was floating
around in my head you think of all sorts
of things when you walk in the
two-year-old and came back and quick
quickly sketched out what is essentially
an undirected graph I guess and labeled
each of the vertices with a number or
Jack Queen King as you can see here
basically what I wanted to do is test
out the core kernel of an idea that I
had for how I could make a game of chain
reactions on the on the earth due to
viruses happen and so I sketched this
together and maybe I don't know 15
minutes
grab some cubes grab some ponds and a
standard deck of cards and played it a
couple times myself I brought my wife in
and we played a couple and it's kind of
hard to convince your wife to play
something on something else like this
but she was actually willing to spend
disbelief and right away I came up with
kind of accidentally discovered that
mechanic that I mentioned where you'd
shuffle the discard and put it back on
top and had kind of a core of an idea
here and kind of a hook that I thought
was solid and it's interesting it when I
look back at this sketch a lot of the
rules that are written on the margins
are actually made
all the way to the publish game so after
getting that sort of core I moved it
into illustrator and quickly grab some
some map and threw an overlay on it and
I want to point out that you know just
still trying to keep it rough one of the
things I've learned is that if you if
you try to polish a prototype too early
you become married to it and you don't
want to make changes so there's no city
names on here these cities really could
be anywhere but I threw them on and
again you've got Queen and King on there
I didn't want to produce a special deck
for the for the game so the takeaways I
guess I got from this are that it's
important to keep things really simple
in raw when you're starting out and it
might actually be better to explain this
by providing some counter examples I
designed a racing game I think ten years
ago and it took me ten years of
iteration before I was happy with it and
the reason was I was so happy with this
concept that I made this this complete
set was right out of the gate before
even playing it refined it really you
know I add this polished prototype and
would play it and then it would be like
yeah that's kind of fun and you do some
incremental changes but you really don't
know the core of the game is and you end
up iterating forever kind of aimlessly
so I've got a number of games under my
belt like that where you know you just
don't know when to stop because you
don't necessarily have a goal you don't
know where the core that is the second
thing to touch on is just how important
it is so I started with this simple game
came up with a simple version of an
illustrator and then as I played it once
or twice it would end up with additional
iterations I think I had like 20 of
these boards maybe about a half dozen
different decks of cards as I was trying
to refine the rule set before finally
coming up with the you know working with
a publisher on the final edition so this
is a process of about four years sort of
you know the occasional weekend or night
and I guess just to reinforce what I
said before you really need to have a
goal I think the the big learning here
was that when I designed pandemic I
really had a crisp goal I wanted a game
that could be played in about 45 minutes
and I wanted a game that I could play
with my wife that was the thing you play
with I play with my spouse you end up in
these these contentious situations where
you
I don't know some of you are nodding
yeah end up in you you don't feel good
at the end of the game right so I
basically had a muse I had a game that I
wanted to play quickly it had some chain
reactions in it and at the end of the
day at the end of the game I would feel
good after playing it and without
something like that you end up just
helpless Lee iterating the next one is
actually pretty straightforward around
accessibility and trying to reduce the
amount of friction that your game has in
it
in early showed you an early prototype
where I've got red and green well
surprise surprise I played such - this
was with a co-worker and it turned out
you know he just basically said I can't
play this you know I'm color blind and
this is just kind of a non-starter and I
guess in retrospect this is obvious you
want to avoid these sorts of things but
when you think about mass-market games
and the four colors that are inevitably
in any set you got your blue you got
your yellow you got your red you got
your green and there the publishers are
just cutting out up to ten percent of
their population from the get-go so that
was an important lesson
so one iteration here shows that you
know I've taken taken that an account
the colors here are safe for colorblind
and they're they're also double coded so
you've got red plus a symbol and black
plus a symbol so if you can't even make
up the color you can you can at least
make sense of it and you can see here
that the red drops out but it's still
playable another thing is also to try to
reduce friction and make the game
playable by the widest audience you know
try to have components that can be
internationalized there's no language
really required on here you just do
label matching they look the local names
are used for the locations and like I
mentioned the cities are double coded
there's a city finder on the map so you
don't have to feel completely stupid if
you don't know where one of the cities
is in the world and the cars are
reversible basically trying to lay in as
much I could into the components so this
is the prototype version and then the
final version in the set but it's
important to know and again back to
iteration and finding the core that you
don't want to do all those enhancements
too early if I were to work up this card
immediately I would be completely
married to it and if any
if any of the rules changed you know it
would have been difficult to reproduce
another whole deck that or eliminate
that completely right if I find it was
obsolete so you know basically you get
sort of the spark stage you've got a
wireframe stage and then the final stage
and if you want to make any changes in
that last stage it's really expensive so
you know the takeaway here is pretty
obvious right it's not a great game if
you can't play it this was kind of a fun
learning for me in pandemic
I brought the game a couple years ago
today's a wonder I don't know if you
guys know of Days and wonders so they
bunch of great guys over in Los Altos
and I pitched it to him and it was bad
timing because they just come out with
shadows of a Camelot which is their
co-op game they're like well we can
already have a co-op game but they were
they humored me and played the thing
because they wanted to see what kind of
engine it had in it and one of the big
takeaways I got was that I really wasn't
doing a very good job of quote embodying
the players they talked about how
important it is for you to be able to
feel like you're in the game and at the
time the prototype had three gray ponds
it didn't matter how many players were
in the game it could be one two three
four five didn't matter you all
collectively shared three like pseudo
people and you really couldn't identify
with a component and they're there their
suggestion was to you know find some way
to embody and body folks and I could you
know I thought that was good advice but
I also said well you've got this great
you know hit game Ticket to Ride and you
know what are you telling me that the
players are these little train lines and
they acknowledge that I had a point but
they also said we continue to try to do
everything we can to embody the players
and they showed their packaging and
pointed out that you know even on the
packaging they're basically saying if
you're the yellow person you got this
umbrella right you know I didn't peeling
two women here - right this is good and
I think they kind of over time maybe
they abandon this idea the Eskimo there
really doesn't map to anybody but point
well-taken here and what I ended up
doing was introducing the roles there so
not only are the pawns not just just
gray but you have your own pond which
mean meant I had to
be defined a lot of the mechanics of the
game and then now that you can identify
with someone you could layer in special
abilities which were one of the key
things in the game for for adding
variety I just want to point out this
isn't a new idea right this isn't rocket
science Lord of the Rings cooperative
games got different hobbits with
different role abilities cosmic did this
back in 1977 dooms a classic that has
this concept in it I just you know I
didn't think to put it in my game
probably just too much work at the time
I thought so again takeaway here as
people are really going to enjoy
themselves a lot more if they feel like
they're actually in the in the game this
is just obvious design advice right you
want to keep it as simple as you can I
wanted to give one example of this and
how the game developed and some of the
things I did simplify it at one point in
the game you had to deal with
quarantines and there wasn't this idea
that you're treating people you're just
quarantine in cities and so yet ad they
you had ad cubes to the board yet to
manage cards you had actions actions
cards cubes abandon your turn yet to
decide how many cubes or cards you need
to pick up and there was different
exchange rates and it was it was really
pretty complex and what I did was I
realized that I had a different kind of
commodity which was an action and it was
like an opportunity cost and basically
took all the stuff on the left there and
ran it through a funnel and try to
figure out what's the simplest possible
way to make something happen
so afterward I ended up with a model
where everything in the game takes an
action and at the end of your turn you
just simply draw two cards and this made
it much easier to learn the game but I
also want to say that the corollary you
know that is Einstein said as simple as
possible but no simpler I was kind of on
the simplicity kick I was I was hooked I
was going to try to see how many rules I
could reduce how many components I could
throw out you know this would be a great
game and it wouldn't have any components
it would be really cheap to the point
where you know I had everything mapped
on the single deck of cards used your
cards for movement three different kinds
of flights you could do you could you
turn him in to cure the diseases as I
mentioned earlier and then use that same
deck of cards to infect the cities
bored and I thought this was genius
right you only got one deck of cards
just everything and I've played tested
with people and occasionally they would
make a mistake but you know I was there
I could I could tell them what they were
doing wrong I did didn't really see the
problem and I was testing this on some
co-workers and one of them happened to
be a design researcher and she's like
why are you playing you know you keep
correcting us like well you know I want
you to play the right way so I know if
it's working or not she basically said
just shut up and sit in the corner and
watch and I did and it was it was
excruciating just it was is really
painful to watch people because they
were you know my mind they were just
making mistakes left and right and it
would have been something if they were
making a consistent error right if their
model of how the game worked Matt it was
slightly different than the game model
and they were consistently making the
same error because then I could just map
to that but it was more troubling than
that they were making every kind of
righty there you could you could think
of when it came to the cards they were
drawing for the wrong deck their
discount reading the wrong deck they
were shuffling the wrong things
and I just had to scratch my head and so
I had all this data that you know
something was really broken and people
couldn't learn it and her advice was to
introduce an entire new deck of cards
and you know to me this was a NASA you
know this is you want me to introduce 48
new cards into this game cards are
actually pretty expensive to produce but
as it turned out the the top four things
all mapped to player actions in the
bottom one maps to infection and the
simplest answer to the the problem that
I had was just to split the deck and
have two special-purpose decks and so
again you know the players confuse the
single deck split into piles the idea
was to create two special-purpose decks
and what that did was it unlocked all
sorts of opportunities now that now that
there's a clear mental model or a
mapping between players and deck a and
infection and deck B I could really
enhance those things I added two
epidemic cards I had special action
cards and it really had a lot of
richness to the game despite the fact
that I had to add more pieces so on the
left you see a player card and on the
right you see an infection card I kind
of went add as many
differences to the cards so the
orientation is different the patterns
different you see a disease overlay ones
reversible ones not that the card backs
are different and after playing this
with the new rules things smell things a
sales much smoothly it's much more
smoothly so again the takeaway there
it's great to have a gel of an idea and
have a goal but unless you kind of
observe and shut up and watch people
play the thing you're going to meander
around and just by observing you're
going to get so much richer data so now
that you've got this gel of an idea and
everybody can play it and they feel like
they're in the game does it mean that
it's fun and I think the short answer is
no that it's pretty easy to come up with
a set of tasks or a routine that players
you can put people through and why would
I want to play that game so I want to
mention a little bit on fun because you
can you could you could go through that
whole process I described and really
have a stinker of a game my favorite
definition of fun comes from raft
coasters book theory of fun and where he
basically equates fun with learning and
he says here that a fun from games
arises out of mastery it arises out of
comprehension it's the act of solving
puzzles that makes games fun and he says
the reason that this this is true is
that when you solve a problem your brain
basically kicks off some endorphins and
they make you feel good and basically
could summarize this by saying that good
games give you good drugs and sort of a
good design center there and I wanted to
equate that to flow an idea popularized
by bear with me here me Haley
Csikszentmihalyi
in his book flow the psychology of
optimal experience and I read some of
that and it was also picked up by Karen
sailin and Eric Zimmerman in there
they're a really great book if you've
seen this but the rules of play they
talk about optimal experience in flow
and then they talk about applying that
in the game design and trying to come up
with optimal game experiences
so rather than sort of reiterate what
they said I thought it would take the
model of flow that they described and
applied to pandemic to kind of show you
how it works so basically the idea is
that you can map the game's challenge
here on the on the vertical axis here
you got really hard game up in the top
really easy game on the bottom and then
you got players skill that you can
compare it against sort of newbies on
the left and hardcore gamers on the
right and the idea is you want to keep
the player in this flow channel where
the games challenge meets the player
skill at all times so that they're
always kind of pushing themselves to go
forward because if you don't you know
you start out here you're you're not
very skilled and the game may not offer
much challenge but over time if the game
doesn't respond or your opponent doesn't
respond you end up and you're quickly
bored you're out of the you're out of
the channel your skill exceeds the game
and you know why play
so like the chess grandmaster playing
you know the newbie there's just nothing
there the the reverse is also a problem
where if the game is too complex it
creates a lot of anxiety if any of you
are real diehard gamers you understand
this if you bring out this great great
game that you just love and you try to
share with your family and you show them
the 16 20 page rulebook it's like ah I
don't want to play that it creates a lot
of anxiety it's just too challenging for
their for their level of interest so if
you map this into the the basic game of
pandemic by the way of pandemic ships
with three different levels of
difficulty there's basic there's normal
and advanced and so the idea is when you
when you buy the game you try out you
try it out at the basic level and it
comes the basic level comes with four of
those really nasty epidemic cards and so
as you're playing your skill is low the
challenge is low but as these cards
arise the challenge in the game actually
shoots up a bit and then you've got a
period of time sort of a semi random
interval where you can kind of cope with
the outbreaks on the board and then you
get another kick of problems and so
you're kind of getting a crisis you're
dealing with it you're getting another
crisis you're dealing with it getting in
the crisis and dealing with it then
after you've mastered this you can go
into the normal game and the assumption
there is that you're
levels increase so you're over to the
right which means that the game needs to
compensate with more problems and so you
get the five epidemic cards there and
again you stay in that channel because
there's enough crisis to keep you
anxious enough so I mean the whole game
is really about creating enough
narrative tension that you're engaged
but not too much and then again just
into the heroic game your to the right
and you just keep carrying this on so
that the one worry I had initially was
that you could get some really
experienced players and they could play
the game and their skill level would be
on the far right and they'd play the
basic game and there's a completely
bored you end up with a situation like
that that seemed like a fair trade-off
because they could then you know they
could ramp up the difficulty and try the
game again there's a replayability
option this seemed much better than for
example having a really difficult game
that you throw at new players where
their anxiety goes off the charge they
lose immediately there's no way to win
they play over and over again they keep
losing and they put the game away or
they throw it out or they they trash her
to their friends so that was the theory
behind that so flow really isn't enough
though I mean you could you could play a
game over and over again and it could
offer a lot of challenge but if there
isn't enough variety eventually it's
going to get stale you're going to put
it away so one of the things that you
really need to pay attention to is the
variety of encounter basically is the
game does it feel different each time
and some of the things that were baked
into pandemic were like I mentioned
there's there's five different roles
that can come into play three different
difficulty levels can have a different
mix of players and you always get a
different mix of cards and that helps
help somewhat that the game doesn't feel
stale but again even this isn't
necessarily enough one of the other
opportunities you can do is build in
extensibility into your game there's
some good examples of this one that
comes immediately in mind is a I don't
know if you guys have heard of apples to
apples if you go to the site you can
download apples to apples cards and you
print them out you can make your own you
make your own cards to add your game
well I didn't really design for that I
could have been added like empty role
cards or something like that that the
players could use but to my delight
actually the players actually did that
for me if you go onto BoardGameGeek you
can see people are just having a field
day with this there's a US only board
the UK board there's last kind of some
like 24 different special roles that
people have invented it's really really
kind of fun to to check that stuff out
and really this just adds to the variety
of encounter each game isn't necessarily
stale so I just wanted to end a to say a
couple words about cooperative games one
of the things that I really like about
them is that they offer different kinds
of fun and these different kinds of fun
are actually more appealing to certain
people than others I don't want to
appear sexist but my muse for the game
was my wife Donna
and when I go on the BoardGameGeek it's
just so fun to read all the different
posts by people saying this game is
spouse friendly or this is this is a
game you can play with your kids and how
exciting that is for people they've got
something now that they can connect with
their of their wife with right and I
think that came from really having a
design Center for it and I think it's
it's fun because different folks get to
practice different skills it's not just
about survival and being the caveman and
beating up what's for dinner that night
it's it's about a you know interpersonal
communication and teamwork and those you
get a chance to exercise those skills
one of the challenges for designing a
game and I put this together and I
started to think you know I'm talking at
Google I don't know this is a challenge
or an opportunity you're putting
together a game where the opponent is
actually an algorithm and so if you're
really good at designing algorithms
maybe this is a this is the thing for
you so you know the challenge is trying
to keep the game fresh while you're
basically playing a computer opponent
that is made out of cardboard on the
upside though that those types of games
can be much easier to play test I could
play many iterations of pandemic without
necessarily trying to draw in friends to
play and if your game designer this is a
real issue you know people don't
necessarily want to play your game 30
times and you don't want to alienate
your friends so co-op's give you this
this opportunity to iterate much more
often without necessarily wearing out
your play testers so very very briefly I
just want to kind of look at what I've
just talked about in kind of
reflected back to software design and
interaction design something I practice
one of the things I observed over and
over again is that there's a lot of
shared techniques one of them around
product design is I think this is a key
thing to learn is I rather than starting
with this really robust feature set that
you want to focus on the core what is
the essential thing your product really
needs to do and nail that as well as you
can and then start moving outward and
adding on other features otherwise again
you end up meandering about tyrus
tireless iteration toward a toward a
measurable goal you know you just can't
iterate enough you're out you're always
trying to take all the friction out of
the system and then as a you IDI or user
experience designer
observation is just key how does how do
how do people react to your design and
getting that sort of feedback and lastly
a lot of these are just obvious right
making it accessible so you have the
widest audience while these are shared
and and you know interesting to note I
think the the more interesting stuff is
when you're looking at more
inspirationally the more effective side
of games if you look at fun and flow and
you compare that back to interaction
design you begin to ask how can you use
some of those principles to slowly
interact introduce complexity over time
how can you have a really delightful me
use your experience of the product so
that you don't overwhelm essentially
that the user that software with a
16-page rulebook right you just give
them enough so that the brain can lock
onto it and then over time slowly
release that so I do a lot of work and
user experience and been doing a lot of
thinking around you know how to I don't
lock those principles also how you drive
engagement how do you get people coming
back over and over again through variety
of encounter if you will and this also
relates to adaptive interfaces you know
how does the interface learn over time
embodiment I work on social platforms so
when you think of embodiment in the game
you're basically coming up with a token
that represents a person in a game or a
mediated environment and when you're
looking at a social networks or the like
you're basically doing the same thing
you're trying to figure out how do you
reflect or represent a participant in a
social space but in this case a profile
and so some interplay between those two
as well what do you think of
extensibility of games you know allowing
other players to add on hooks I
immediately think of application
platforms so you think of fate or
OpenSocial different ways that third
parties can add components on to add
variety and extend what you have and
make it more valuable for a longer
period of time
and lastly looking at co-op games I've
had some interesting feedback that well
people like the game they often say wow
it feels kind of like a meeting oh god
you know it's not what I want to hear
they're like get out with a really good
meeting so I started thinking that how
can I make my meetings more effective
it's like oh we got to come with the
solution or the world's gonna end you
know I don't know if that's the answer
but I think there's there's a lot of
overlap between co-op games and maybe
it's just understanding all the above
and then applying that to collaborative
software because there's there's a lot
of overlap there as well and really
that's all I had to say thanks so
there's actually a mic up there if
anybody wants to answer to ask a
question hi there my name is Ben you've
really taken the best of Lord of the
Rings and Arkham Horror and kind of put
them together here and it's really
impressive one of the best parts of
cooperative games like those those that
you really get to roleplay
you know for me like being Samwise or
being you know the nun on the Harley
with a shotgun in Arkham Horror it
really really helps me get into the game
have you thought about incorporating
some of those to make it less like a
meeting that's a good question
how much theme is appropriate for a game
I think if I wanted to have a more
narrative aspect to the game I could be
I could layer in we could have more rich
roles right right now your role is
basically two bullet points you can do a
and you can do B but you could have
backstory you could develop all sorts of
things like that to add sort of a more
immersive feeling to it I do think that
would add to the play length though so
it's sort of a trade-off between - a
little bit more euro-style than a merit
rash if you will it's sort of a
continuum and I'm always
comfortable in the raw our mechanic side
thanks hi I noticed that along with your
box of pandemic you've got a box of
something called outbreak that is that
another game somebody else did entirely
was an inspiration or is that your
earlier version yeah global outbreak is
a prototype I worked up and this is this
is actually the set here I'll grab it
this is the set that I pitched to the
publishers last April and I it was named
pandemic through the whole development
history until I showed it to some
publishers and they're like I don't know
how we sell that I mean it's a game of
disease you know who's gonna want to buy
that for their kid so I thought well
okay maybe pandemic is too harsh a title
I'll change to global outbreak when I
found the publishers like global
outbreak yeah you got a name that
pandemic and say I guess you can't win
um but I liked it I liked the title
pandemic quite a bit more I do have to
put it up here if anybody wants to take
a look at it uh hey first of all I love
the game and all my friends have loved
it and my dad has lifted and my wife's
aunt and so on and so forth it's a big
success we're we're responsible for
killing off the whole human race several
times sorry about that
and and for saving the whole human race
but no one ever thinks is my question is
a so I think we all know about the term
the long tail as it applies to music and
movies and books and things like that
and your game as much as it is a great
success among enthusiasts of gaming it's
it's officially in the longtail you
cannot find it on the shelves at Target
for instance the it seems to me that the
only though in the areas of music you
know peer to peer sharing came along and
sort of saved the day for the long tail
and the long tail is pretty healthy and
with books you can go to Amazon you can
find absolutely anything and we get
recommendations and people are
reasonably able to find the long tail of
books and Netflix for movies and so
forth but with games like the situation
seems kind of dire to me because if you
look at all of the games like if you
talk to all the people who really love
games and they play games a lot and you
look at what are their you know 200
favorite games you
and hardly find a single one of them you
know at any of your local retailers
well yeah but you know like normal
mom-and-pop you know we're not going to
go to ebay right they're going to go to
Target if you can't find it on the
shelves at Target most people think that
it doesn't exist so the question is just
like this really broad ones like how
could we fix this problem because
there's this chicken-and-egg positive
feedback loop where until it's on the
shelves at Target no one will spend
millions of dollars on a ad campaign and
until there's an ad campaign they won't
have it on the shelves at Target will
will like high quality wholesome family
entertainment like this ever be able to
break into the mainstream and comment on
that yeah I could give it a shot
I'm not sure there's a problem I think
that different games played a different
playstyles
and that people that really enjoy the
the games that require more investment
upfront maybe a smaller market then then
say a party game where the the ramp-up
time is about a minute right I mean out
of the box does this wonderful job of
putting all the rules on the components
you can pull it out and you know how to
play just because you're looking at the
components you're like oh I pull a card
I read that I read the card and I can
play there's less social cost involved
in trying to get people over and saying
let me teach you this great game it's
only going to take 15 minutes to learn
and those 15 minutes are it's a pretty
big investment it may lead to a lot of
anxiety so I think what I would almost
describe where we're in right now is
this golden age there's so many
different so many different titles out
there you look out there and you can't
keep up they're not all high quality but
there's a lot of variety so I don't know
my opinion it's really about it's a
marketing problem and if if these games
with this level of complexity were as
good as they are I I think they would
almost begin to sell themselves I don't
know because the players that they
appeal to are going to pick them up not
sure that's like a very complete or
satisfying answer but that's sort of
where my head isn't with that I would
I'd love to see more games in different
distribution channels I mean I think
it's great that Starbucks is picking up
cranium but they're picking up cranium
it's a party game it's easy to learn
it's easy to share with your friends
there's less investment so I don't know
take that for what it's worth
um so I was I was doing a I was creating
a card game at one point I realized well
some of these things would have been so
much easier if I did it online and I was
wondering what are some of the you know
you're talking about friction things
like that
was the differences between creating a
tangible object game as opposed to like
a something that you just play on the
computer game sure what are some of
those what have you learned well one of
the key ones the differences between
online and like cardboard or atom based
if you will is that I'm in complete
control over the whole production
process of these things and I can
iterate break very quickly as soon as
you bring something online there's all
sorts of overhead involved in you know
I'm not a programmer so I can't I don't
have control over the whole process so I
can I can put one of these things out
and iterate on it much much faster
because I have full control over the
whole range of production the other
thing is that there's there's a whole
social factor and we just face-to-face
brings so much more value to it I mean I
play games because they're social to it
to a large extent I don't play very many
online games although I have to admit
that the a lot of these things have
really mastered flow and they really
sucky in and and that kind of leads to
anxiety of a different sort that I'm
gonna lose my you know I I'm not gonna
I'm not gonna have a life anymore so you
know I'm playing games for a reason and
part of it is just to be more social and
I don't think that technology is quite
there yet where you can really mediate
or you can really have an experience
that feels as closer as close enough to
real life so those are the two answers I
guess
yeah tangibility the faculty can pick it
up and feel it I mean I you know if you
think about Settlers of Catan the
difference between picking up a wooden
piece and picking up a cheap plastic
piece there's something there that that
matters
you know it's related sure so I
understand that authors will go through
a phase where they really get sick of
the work they're creating have you ever
had that problem with pandemic or any of
your other games I was lucky with
pandemic the the core engine I got like
right away and most of it was refinement
and once
observing the things snap together so
pretty lucky for this one it only took
me four years other games though I had a
game limit exclu car racing game you get
tired of it you put it on the shelf and
you pull it out again once you have a
new idea and then you iterate another
game that I've been working on just
tentatively called ants I'm just sick to
death of I don't want to look at the
thing it's been on the shelf for a
couple years I have a lot of interest in
the game but I just I can't get myself
to pull it off the shelf none of my
friends will play it it's a it's a cute
game and then you know there's some
people really big fans of it I just
can't get myself to do it so yeah
absolutely there are times when you just
kind of hate the product you're working
on okay oh I like ants by the way I
think so I had questions about how
pandemic solves two kind of fundamental
problems that cooperative games face one
of them is the issue of whether and how
much players can communicate outside of
their actions taken in strictly in terms
of game mechanics and the other is the
question of the victory conditions that
is whether it's an all-or-nothing
victory for the whole group or whether
there's shades of victory where maybe
the whole group can lose or maybe the
group wins but there's actually also an
individual or several individual winners
within that so I was wondering how
pandemic deals with those sure yeah
communication ones pretty key I a rift
off of Lord of the Rings rule where you
could tell your your fellow players
anything you want about your hand but
you can't show them the cards and that
seems like a really weird rule but in
practice it's pretty good it means that
one player doesn't dominate the whole
game if you get a new if you get an
experienced player playing with a lot of
newbies and they look at the whole set
up they're actually able to calculate
and optimize for the whole group and
then the other players really don't have
a much of a say and you have the problem
of sort of the alpha male kind of taking
over and directing people what to do
you can mitigate to the that to some
effect but I don't think you can
completely eliminate at least I haven't
seen a cooperative game that can
that has completely eliminated it and
the second part of your question was
around a partial victory and certain
players winning while the team wins I
thought about that actually thought
about introducing a well as designed
that the the players all work together
as a team and you're playing against the
the game well you could also have a
situation where you got three players
that are working together and you got
one player which actually plays the
disease and I thought that might be fun
shadows over Camelot has that other the
co-op's had that and I abandoned it
right away I just I like the feeling
that just the positive buzz that you get
from all working together the opponent
was was hard enough that I didn't need
to introduce opponents and and using the
the same thinking eye again that the
partial victory for individuals just
seemed like glad-handing to people who
actually want to do the the competitive
thing so I kind of just did a pure co-op
and it felt good about that it was just
pure I also thought of a character role
who's like the egotistical researcher
who still helps everybody but collects
like glory points every time he cures a
disease and you know can can sort of had
some tension there but I haven't tried
that question is do you have new games
that are coming out soon anything you
can tell us yeah I just signed on a new
game last week so thanks
hopefully well hopefully you'll see it
in the fall it's a dice game and that
one took me two months so it's called to
be named yet hahaha we'll see yeah you
mentioned some of the mutations that
pandemic has seen and BoardGameGeek the
the new rolls and the alternate boards
is that something that you're interested
in are you interested in mutating the
game further or you content where it's
sitting there has been some interest in
potentially doing an expansion I'm not
one who is real excited about expansions
I think it's probably because I only
have so much space to save games and
they eat up a lot of room but I have
given it some thought and I think
basically my criteria is that I'll
considering expansion if I get
time to play test it where I'm really
really happy with the additional roles
or whatever else we'd want to package in
because I think it would be fun that it
could bring some new life into the game
so if you played it quite a few times if
you get a pack of five or six or ten new
roles I mean that just opens up all
sorts of new doors for replayability
Sally I'm open to it yeah I had a
temptation with my children of painting
a set of the research stations a
different color and having two different
teams competing to save the world now
that's interesting but so okay keep
going
a couple more minutes this is my
favorite subject so I'll stay my other
question was going to be uh Oh somebody
saved me because I forgot what are your
other favorite games thank you ah other
favorites I'm really partial to Tiger
some euphrates I think it's got a really
great tight set of rules fairly tight
set of rules but I just haven't haven't
worn it out yet every time I play it I
see all sorts of new possibilities and
combinations I I used to be a huge fan
of settlers and starting to kind of
trail off on that it's a great gateway
game great way to introduce your family
the games but now when I have that
opportunity I usually pull out pandemic
those are two that just come spring
friend of mine right away I remembered
my question okay uh so what was the
whole experience like of trying to hit
pound the pavement talking to all the
publishers and convinced one of them to
take your game and then when z-man took
your game what was the whole process
like of working with them and and how
does that kind of work from the
designers perspective yeah I think that
the hardest part was kind of breaking in
and I think there's a temptation by a
lot of designers to just do it yourself
because you don't feel like you can find
someone to publish for you so in 2000
actually did that I published a
loonatics loop and I did 200 sets and it
was nightmarish trying to put that
together I don't know if you've seen
that game but it's got it's got a lot of
bits in it and so I was planning my
wedding and putting
looped together and it was just kind of
it was it was kind of crazy attacked on
a trip to Essen out of the end of the
honeymoon if that gives me any
communication there anyway probably says
too much about myself so that's really
not terribly effective but what it did
do is it allowed me to meet a lot of
people I met a lot of publishers and I
got invited to the gathering of friends
which was just wonderful
so last year I went back to the
gathering and had this fairly polished
prototype it was the second year that
appeared at the gathering and I done
refinements based on feedback from those
those folks that had given me feedback
and it was sort of a hit I had I think I
had five different publishers interested
so I don't know I think part of it was
just having access and the other part is
having a good product so once I decided
which publisher to go with things went
fairly straightforward z-man they didn't
request as Zevs really wonderful to work
with didn't request any rules changes we
talked about a few of them but I had
literally control over it was reviewing
the rules down to the the punctuation in
the rules so it was a really great
working relationship with dev most of it
you know just email communication back
and forth worked with a painter out of
France his last name's Mullen I think
and probably butchering the
pronunciation and he did the under
painting for the board and he did the
role artwork and I was able to approve
different versions of that the the
original the original boxtop need a lot
of refinement we ended up I tried to get
a nicer oeq figured sort of positive
imagery you didn't want burning bodies
on the cover because people you know I
got some burning bodies the first time
and got a big positive female role model
right on the front so that was sort of
one's looking for and then work with
Josh Capel who did a lot of the graphic
design really happy with that it's kind
of like Christmas every time I opened up
an email and getting a new version of
the visual design like I said I'm an
interaction designer right I'm actually
a visual designer by trade but you know
this just isn't going to
units he he did a good job on the
official design of it questions the
question was how large are sales so the
initial run was three thousand units and
we sold them out at distributors in like
four weeks my question is is there
another run
we're expecting games to be in stores in
two or three weeks so mid May question
was how do you how do you balance
difficulty modeling watching people were
playing myself right and I think the
answer is sort of yes a little bit less
on the modeling I mean you can build up
all these theoretical models for how it
should work and you need to do some of
that in order to get a prototype put
together you know that that's reasonable
but in practice it the proof is in the
play and you do need to do a mix I think
of observation implying yourself if
you're just observing you don't really
necessarily get a feel for you know this
is enjoyable or not okay great thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
