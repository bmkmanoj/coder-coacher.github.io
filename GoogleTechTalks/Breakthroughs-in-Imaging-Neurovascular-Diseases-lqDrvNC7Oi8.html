Hickey
from from Wayne State he mark Hickey is
a world-known
renowned MRI researcher at Wayne State
he won the gold medal in Kyoto for his
2004 work and susceptible aid imaging
and education he's the past president of
two MRI societies and just formed the
International Society for neurovascular
disease the last 30 years dr. Hickey has
focused on the physics and mathematics
associated with the technical
developments of new imaging methods and
the clinical applications dr. Hickey
literally wrote the book on MRI after
working behind the scenes sorry after
working behind the scenes for some 30
years dr. Hickey has recently become a
public figure as a result of applying
his expertise to the study of venous
anomalies and MS patients dr. Hickey has
testified before Canadian Parliament and
as MRI protocols for MS have become the
glue tying together the study and
treatment of CCSVI in North America of
the small thousands of MS patients
worldwide that have been treated for
CCSVI a growing number have been doing a
new dance the full Hickey which is
performed in an MRI tube of the course
of two hours it may be too early to tell
if we stand at the beginning of another
worldwide disease eradication but if we
are our keiki will certainly be one of
its girls we're very pleased to have our
keiki here today thanks
Bart thank you very much it's a pleasure
for me to be here and I'm going to try
to give you an overview today of some of
the things we're doing in magnetic
resonance imaging that relate to
neurodegenerative disease and at the end
of this I hope those of you who are more
from a technical bent from Google will
realize that there's a lot of challenges
that might relate some of the imaging
technologies you're looking at
everything from mapping interests to
signal processing algorithms and a lot
of other interesting mathematics
although I won't present the mathematics
today I will close with a an overview of
the types of problems that need to be
addressed in this area so although the
some of the things I'll show you today
cover a lot of different
neurodegenerative diseases in in their
capabilities I'm going to focus on
multiple sclerosis today so multiple
sclerosis is a disease that we really
don't know how it works yet we don't
know the ideology we have a good idea
that it's related to the immunological
system some people refer to MS as a
demyelinating inflammatory disease there
are a lot of drugs that have been
developed based on the in illogical
understanding of MS today and some of
them work to some degree and some of
them don't but as I show on this image
here in the side these an example of an
mr scan showing these bright regions in
the middle of the white matter and these
are examples of MS lesions if you have
symptoms of an MS patient and the
physician thinks you might have MS then
you'll get an MRI scan and if the mr
scans you have forth shows you have four
lesions or more then he's probably going
to say that you have multiple sclerosis
so there are many symptoms associated
with this and fatigue is one of the big
ones there are also optic neuritis there
are other effects motor effects where
the nerves get somehow modified by
multiple sclerosis and and so one of the
questions to keep in mind as we look at
the data I'm going to show you is it
possible in fact that the disruption of
the
your system can lead to most of these
symptoms I show you a slide from Canada
even though we're in the United States
and I happen to be Canadian although I'm
also an American citizen but I know the
numbers better for Canada so there's
something like 55,000 to 75,000 MS
patients in Canada in a website that we
put online about nine months ago within
the matter of weeks we had about 30,000
canadians which is half that population
access the website to try to see what's
going on in chronic cerebrospinal venous
insufficiency now in the United States
we have roughly eight to ten times you
know the population here so you can
imagine eight to ten times the number of
MS patients so probably 400,000 or so
maybe more have multiple sclerosis and
of course around the world there's
probably two and a half million people
that have MS MS was first described back
in 1868 by shark hole he looks for those
of you who know South LaFonte he looks a
lot like Sal I think Sal has been
reincarnated in him and he noticed that
there was scarring and hardening of the
sheath around the nerves he didn't
really pay attention to the vascular
part too much but as we'll see in the
history of this a lot of people began
looking at the vascular component not
long after that and in fact in 1903 a
fellow by the name of Boris already
recognized that there were peri vascular
hemorrhages associated with ms a lot of
people today actually quote the work by
Adams in the 1980s where he shows that
30% of lesions have hemorrhagic
constituents in them 1916 Dawson further
explained what type of damage took place
in ms in 1935 Tracy Putnam and this is
interesting because then bony wasn't
really aware of this work initially he
he was already sure that the venous
component was very important so he did a
dog study 14 dogs and he obstructed the
small veins in the brain of the dogs and
all of them developed sclerotic lesions
now if he'd had an MRI scanner back in
1935 I'm sure he
discover the Zamboni hypothesis in 1958
it was confirmed that there was strong
linkages to the immune system and then
in 1972 mr imaging came along and really
revolutionized the ability to take
pictures of our body without cutting us
open as I'll show you in a little bit in
1987
the concept of imaging the vessels in
the brain became clinical practice in
1997 we further develop something called
susceptibility weighted imaging which
focuses on imaging very tiny veins and
also the iron in the brain so it's a
form of endogenous contrast agent where
we can actually see iron changing the
signal and then in 2009 bony came up
with CCSVI hypothesis so he had noticed
after doing this for 65 people that
there were a lot of stenosis of the
vessels a lot of obstructed flow to the
vessels and so this was a very new and
important finding that basically
complemented the last hundred years of
work that I only alluded to alright well
that's just a brief introduction and I
apologize if I if I go quickly through
some of these because I'm not sure how
many of you are technical but I'd like
to give you a brief introduction to
magnetic resonance imaging because it
might give you a flavor for what's
really going on
so in MRI you get into a magnet and when
you're in the magnet this magnetic field
polarizes the proton spins in your body
and and this is how we basically listen
to the music that your body plays when
you're inside that magnet this concept
or some of the concepts I'm going to
talk to you about in just four or five
slides were initially considered by Paul
Lauterbur and Sir Peter Mansfield and
both both of these gentlemen won the
Nobel Prize for this and was certainly
well deserved
so protons have our spin 1/2 particle
they have a charge associated with them
and if a charge is spinning it generates
a magnetic moment and this magnetic
moment basically is such that these
protons if the main magnetic field
points up these protons are spinning or
precessing like a top does in the
Earth's gravitational field these spins
procesor
the main magnetic feel and that
information that concept was developed
by larmor there's an equation called the
larmor equation it's very simple it says
that that processional frequency is
directly proportional to the strength of
the main magnetic field multiplied by a
constant called the gyromagnetic
constant and I tried our magnetic
constant by the way is 42.6 megahertz
per Tesla so at 2 Tesla
you're at eighty five point two
megahertz and guess what we're listening
to to the music you play on the FM dial
because you're getting right up there
into that right frequency right Yes No
the constant changes if you're looking
at proton versus sodium versus
phosphorus that it's different for all
of them and luckily for us nature was
very kind and made that constant for
protons fairly big big enough that we
can actually then measure this effect so
when you look at an mr image although I
won't talk about the quantum mechanics
today you are actually looking at a
quantum phenomena so when I see when I
show you this picture this is really
representative of what we're picking up
from the spins the quantum information
so if I put you in a magnet you develop
this magnetization inside your body it's
ok it's it's not going to pull you
around or do anything although at very
high fields it actually levitated tiny
frogs based on that magnetic moment that
develops there so a little science
fiction but it's actually true and and
so what happens when you get in the
magnet I can't tell you're in there yet
because this magnetization just points
parallel to the main field so somehow I
need a little bit of physics in here to
help me measure the presence of that
magnetization and so what block and
Purcell did back in 1946 and they both
won the Nobel Prize for this also was
they got this aha and they said let's
take that magnetization and let's make
it precess around a second magnetic
field so what they did is they put in an
antenna so they put in an RF coil that
RF coil was set up so that they
generated a new magnetic field that's
perpendicular we called be effective in
that picture so that's this okay this is
not working but briefly tried to bring
this to life that's the magnetic field
here and of course now these spins they
precess
that magnetic field so you just turn
that RF antenna on for a few
milliseconds and then you turn it off
and when you turn it off the
magnetization is now sitting
perpendicular to the main field and now
what does it do it now precesses around
the main field like this just like it
was before but you couldn't notice it
and so you take well we call the
transmit sorry they receive coil and the
received coil picks up this changing
flux and of course that changes the
voltage it induces a current and lo and
behold block and Purcell were able to
pick up signal from something inside
that magnet and that's what we do we try
to tell if you're there or not
but this still doesn't create an image
and it took 25 more years for a pall
outer bird to come along and say well
you know you've been imaging in a
perfectly homogeneous field for for a
long time now and you can tell
something's there and for people doing
chemistry and spectroscopy that's all
they cared about however the people who
want to image humans or any other
substance need to do something a little
bit different in order to create this
image and so what we do is we purposely
modify the main magnetic field so let's
say on my left eye the field is a little
bit lower and on my right eye the field
is a little bit higher so this creates
what we call field gradient across space
in this case say the X direction and so
when we turn that gradient on we encode
those spins and they all rotate at
different frequencies then what I do is
I turn the gradient or I can keep the
gradient on in this case and I can read
out that data and as I read out that
data it's going to beat with all these
different frequencies it creates a
spectral response for me it actually
sums over all these different spectral
components so what I need to do is sorry
about that I'm going to go back here I
took out the formal equation I had here
what I need to do is something called a
Fourier transform the Fourier transform
takes all this information that's mixed
together and separates it out into its
frequency components and it gives a
weight associated with its frequency
component and that weight creates the
image that we see in magnetic resonance
imaging now there are a lot of other
features in M R that that I can't cover
today
but relate to relaxation times how
quickly each of those tissues relaxes
back to the
magnetic field and there are many other
properties such as flow diffusion and
things like that that we can't talk
about today either wonderful thing about
this is that unlike the anatomy lesson
of doctor told from Rembrandt in 1632
where in those days we had to study
cadavers by cutting them from the
outside today we can look at your body
from the inside out and we don't really
have to cut you although we still caught
talked about cut planes and cutting
through the body in different
orientations yes you have a question for
for solids you're gonna be looking at
microseconds milliseconds things like
this but for soft tissue at something
like 1 Tesla 3 Tesla for example we're
looking at hundreds of milliseconds for
the t1 relaxation times all the way up
to 4 seconds for water which relaxes
very slowly and then there are t2
relaxation times which is the transverse
component that shrinks back down towards
zero when it reaches equilibrium these
are normally on the order of say 10 to
100 milliseconds they're much shorter so
we usually sat we usually create the
data and sample it within 10
milliseconds or 100 milliseconds so what
can we do with this data we can create
three-dimensional information from this
as I'm showing you here and if we
collect this as isotropic information it
means that I can cut the data this way
sagittal II this way coronal II this way
transverse at the moment we're imaging
with isotropic resolution of a cubic
millimeter we can do this now in about
five minutes
when I first started mr twenty-five
years ago it took me about five minutes
to collect a single set of
two-dimensional images with ten times
worse resolution than this yes you had a
question
I'm sorry I can't hear you can speak up
no that could it's a good question what
we do is we encode in this case we can
encode 2d but in what I'm showing you
here we encode the full 3d volume at the
same time that takes three different
gradients in XY and Z to do that but
it's possible to do that and there was
one other question yes that's correct
the magnitude component of that spectral
information is in fact representative of
the brightness of the image that I'm
looking at here
well we don't get it all in one go we
actually have to do the encoding step at
a time so what we do is we rotate the
magnetization we do one phase encoding
we let it relax you rotate the
magnetization again do the second phase
encoding so if I have to if I have two
hundred millimeters here and I want to
get one millimeter resolution I have to
repeat that scan 200 times so if I can
use a repeat I'm of five milliseconds
that takes me one second to do that if I
do that again in this direction 200
times that takes me three minutes and 20
seconds to do that so we can also design
the mr sequence to be focused just on
something like blood in this case this
is called an mr angiogram and here we
can actually collect three-dimensional
information throughout the whole brain
on just the arteries this has become a
very powerful tool and is used
clinically all the time and and the
focus for the last hundred years in
medicine has been on the arterial side
and people have tended to forget that
the other 50% of our of our function and
and body is on the venous side and so
why are the veins important well the
veins are important because if we are
using up oxygen in the delivery of blood
to the tissue and I can tell from its
magnetic properties or other in other
ways what the remnant oxygen saturation
is in the veins I can tell you how well
your tissue is functioning and so this
is very important information and so
I've been spending the last 10 years
trying to convince people that imaging
the veins is a very important thing so
when we get this signal we get actually
complex information so the Fourier
transform even though we have only real
spin density because of the way this
system works it gives me a complex
component which is directly related to
the main magnetic field and we call this
the phase component and the phase is in
this case also very simple it's just the
same constant gamma times Delta B which
represents the change in magnetic field
across a voxel times the time that I
image this and so what we did is we
tried to take a look at what these
images would would look like in an EM
our scanner and this is the complex
information this is the phase
information and it's a mess and so for
20 years nobody used it but what we did
is we developed a special homodyne
filter or high-pass filter that we took
and applied to this at different levels
of that filter and slowly removed all of
this unwanted information and then you
can see here
we now start seeing something behind
this and this information it's going to
turn out to be extremely important the
fact that I can differentiate these
tissues means that there's an increased
local iron concentration in there and
we're finding out right now that this
level of iron is on the order of
micrograms per gram tissue which is nano
molars of iron that we've become
sensitive to in this imaging so here's
an example on a volunteer at 3 Tesla
here you can see the iron content very
well in the primary motor cortex which
is known to have more iron in it than
other parts of the brain so this is
becoming very convincing that we're now
able to map out the different parts of
iron but iron doesn't appear just in the
form of ferritin or hemosiderin in the
brain it also appears in the form of
deoxyhemoglobin so the hemoglobin has
shielded iron so it doesn't show any
Delta B effect but when you take the
oxygen away from it it's not shielded
anymore it becomes slightly paramagnetic
just enough that the sensitivity of this
mr scanner can pick it up and so what
I'm looking at here in this dark the
dark represents high iron content it's
actually the deoxyhemoglobin in the
venous blood and so now I can start
mapping out pictures of the veins with
the same type of detail that I was
showing you in the Mr angiogram before
now this is a very important part of the
brain for the multiple sclerosis
patients because this is the thalamus
try eight area and here we have the
basal ganglia which you can't see too
well on this picture but you have the
caudate nucleus here and you can see the
vessels coming out of the caudate
nucleus draining into the thalamus try a
vessel now this is an image taken at
seven Tesla by the way with 200 micron
by 200 micron in plain resolution so we
can do this amazingly well this is going
to be done in five or ten minutes now
and in the living subject so what
happens in an MS patient you see these
same areas where the veins were draining
now look very dark that's because I'm
not looking anymore at just the
deoxyhemoglobin
I'm looking at an increase in the iron
content at least that's what it is that
may be representative of iron buildup in
the vessel wall itself it may be extra
visited iron we don't know yet we
haven't really you know gone in and done
the cadaver studies to validate this yet
but this same person person was image 18
months later and here you can see that
there's an increase in iron content
after 18 months and it's a building
backwards along the vena system so this
is why we are in concurrence with some
of Zamboni's conclusions that iron does
play a major role here now something
else we've discovered recently is that
in other tissues there's also iron
buildup this is a small part of the
thalamus called the pulvinar thalamus
and we find that about half of the
people especially young people who have
severe MS have this high iron content
now normally neurologists for years have
used that very first image I showed you
with the bright lesions to say that
person has MS but this is almost now a
biomarker for multiple sclerosis it
remains to be proven but this is our
hypothesis at the moment with this new
imaging capability this is an example of
a normal 32 year old showing iron in the
substantia nigra and this is an MS
patient with iron in the substantia
nigra in fact this is so high that it
looks like a Parkinson's case and a
fellow named Marion simcha in Europe I
believe back in February told us at a
conference that he had an MS patient
that had parkinson's-like symptoms and
apparently treated him with l-dopa and
and the patient responded but why did
this patient of parkinson's-like
symptoms well maybe because they had
such huge iron deposition in the
substantia nigra that that caused that
problem so we're really starting to
discover a lot of very new things so to
show you a little bit of quantification
all of these little colorful dots here
represent normal people between 20 and
70 years old and measuring the iron
content here along the vertical axis and
for very young people you can see
there's not much iron content and as
Burton Dreier from New York says
unfortunately we all rust as we get
older so because of that we get more and
more iron building up in our brain and
and you can see that out here if I had
these type of high iron content I
wouldn't say that's abnormal but if
you're 20 or 30 years old I would say
that's abnormal and all of the X's and
triangles represent the iron content in
multiple sclerosis cases so you can see
that there is a dramatic difference
between them we can even measure iron in
the lesions we don't see iron in every
lesion our data is on the order of maybe
20 to 30 percent which is in excellent
agreement with atoms results but how can
you believe me so let's get to something
closer to home for you
going to Stanford to slack and let's use
x-ray fluorescence imaging and what we
did here is we did an MRI at 1.5 tesla
and saskatoon in canada and we have the
magnitude image we have this phase image
I've been showing you so far and on the
right you'll have the x-ray fluorescence
iron image so the K shell the energy of
the synchrotron radiation is set up to
be just that of absorption for the K
shell and it's absorbed this is 50
micron resolution and you have really
excellent agreement between what I
showed you and what we can see
studying cadaver brain so I think we can
have some pretty high confidence that if
I tell you we're looking at iron we
probably are looking at iron so
susceptibility weighted imaging this is
something that takes that phase
information and marries it with
magnitude information so without going
into too much detail here I'm going to
have to skip through some of these
because I have too many slides and I
enjoy talking too much so that sometimes
lengthens my presentation this is an
example at for Tesla where we take these
images and we combine the face with
magnitude to show those vessels better
and you can see here very clearly that
same thalamus try it area I was showing
you and on the right hand side you have
results from a cadaver brain from George
Solomon also down here at UCLA and he
injects a dye and then takes a
radiographic image of this and these
vessels are about one millimeter in
diameter these are about 500 microns and
these are about 200 microns so now
within a few minutes we can actually do
this evaluation instead of having to do
it on cadavers we can do it in living
people and we've tried to apply this to
a number of different areas one of them
is to traumatic brain injury and
although ms is very important and there
are two and a half million people
affected by MS there are one and a half
million people with traumatic brain
injury every year in the United States
and that doesn't count then all the rest
of the people in the world half of those
people we cannot tell what's wrong with
them when we image them now we're
starting to tell what's wrong with them
because this new technique is so
sensitive to iron that it starts picking
up microbleeds that were not seen before
in conventional imaging I think I have
an example to show you that later so
here all of these dark holes are
representing small bleeds that have
taken place in the brain and our hope is
to
correlate this with cognitive changes of
these people and and other types of
problems they might have motor problems
speech problems on the right hand side
and I don't have too much time to talk
about this today is a new technique
where we actually are doing an inverse
Fourier transform multiplying by a
weighting factor and then forward
transforming to actually create a
susceptibility map itself this is some
very nice mathematics applied to
Maxwell's equations that have direct
implications here for imaging and this
image is basically the same as this
except if I put my cursor here and this
this gives me a number now that tells me
how much iron is in that box all this is
an example of the same technology
applied to somebody with dementia in
this case the the person was having
cognitive problems they brought him down
to scan him they did an MRA and it came
out very nicely no real problems here we
did the SWI scan on him and you see
these micro bleeds these are
representative cerebral amyloid
angiopathy it may be that roughly 3/8 of
all what people call Alzheimer's which
is really a misnomer because dementia is
the correct term dementia can be made up
of vascular dementia and Alzheimer's and
both may be very different from each
other however we're picking up this
amyloid angiopathy very nicely and we
did a study here at loma linda also not
far from you we did five years we
studied 75 elderly people and we mapped
out these micro bleeds in this iron
content and we found that 6 out of those
6 out of 16 people who eventually
developed dementia 6 of these people
showed microbleeds at the beginning and
you have to forgive my facetious comment
here about time to go sailing because if
I have 8 micro bleeds in my brain you
scan me I'm going to go sailing for two
years because in the next 2 or 3 years
I'm probably going to have dementia so
this is what we found in that cohort and
so this becomes a predictive mechanism
for the breakdown the angiographic
breakdown that's taking place in
dementia now we can also use this
technology in stroke ray of course also
have bleeding and this is a very nice
example where you can see conventional
technology has some hint here with
there's a very subtle brightness in the
area of the Globus pallidus and internal
capsule that suggests there might have
been a bleed there
nothing on this beautiful t1-weighted
scan there's not even anything on this
magnitude component of the SWI scan but
the phase image shows it very clearly so
in that particular case if we now create
the SWI image you can see where the
bleed is very nicely so this is a third
application of that technology now you
know I haven't had enough of my coffee
so you'll know in roughly about twenty
minutes from now what I'm going to show
you is going to happen here so like this
is not decaf I hope itself it's
caffeinated oh good good okay that's
great I don't know maybe I'll speed up
and you can go faster so the thing about
caffeine is it's a basal constrictive
agent so what does that mean well take a
careful look here now that you've become
good imagers and take a look at the
image on the left hand side it shows
these veins very nicely but take a
careful look at my brain on caffeine
with two shots okay so here okay use
this fellow I guess you can see it by
the arrows at least in the one do so you
see the white arrow here shows you can
barely see this sort of the wings of the
seagull there and on the right hand side
you can see those wings very clearly
what happened well because the blood
flow slowed down to my brain and my
brain is still eating up at least as
much oxygen and maybe more when you get
this hyper that you're going to see an
increase in local levels of
deoxyhemoglobin and so we are at what
we're looking at is a functional change
in the deoxyhemoglobin in the entire
brain with this technology now people
also do something called functional mr
which is a totally separate talk where
we can actually you know watch what's
happening in your brain as you move your
hands and as you speak and as you think
and you do math we can actually monitor
that type of effect with these
technologies so I'm gonna skip the
susceptibility mapping part here and go
on now to what pollo Zamboni and his
team were really talking about so what
they thought they saw and they were
literally looking outside the box right
because the neurologists have lived in
the box of the brain for a hundred years
so they said let's look outside the box
let's see what's happening in the veins
because if you can't get the blood out
you can't get the blood
neither so if you've got problems on the
venous side it's going to affect the
arterial side and it's going to affect
perfusion in the brain and this is the
type of result he found a narrowing of
the internal jugular vein so I want to
give a quote and stop here for a minute
of the work of Tracy Putnam and and this
is something I just enjoy reading and
that is after he had seen this effect of
blocking the these dogs the last part of
his paper in 1935 read the similarity
between such lesions and many of these
seen in cases of multiple sclerosis in
men is so striking that the conclusion
appears almost inevitable that venya
leur obstruction is the essential
immediate antecedent to the formation of
typical sclerotic plaques so you can
only ask yourself how could the
neurologists avoid this for 75 years
well actually many of them didn't there
were other people who also studied the
vascular effects and about every 10
years someone else came along and
studied Kadabra brains and and and
studied other forms of The Venus effect
and they found evidence supporting this
concept so today in modern times what
zamboni
does is he's uses ultrasound and I'm not
going to focus on ultrasound but his
conditions were that reflux meaning in
this case the blood flow doesn't always
flow down towards the heart sometimes it
goes backwards this way and if it goes
straight backwards we call it reflux you
can see refluxing the internal jugular
veins reflux in the deep cerebral veins
if you see stenosis like the one I
showed you that's a very bad sign if
there's no flow at all in the vessel
that's a very bad sign and finally if he
had another interesting condition that I
can't do an mr and that is when you're
lying down the jugulars take over but
when you're sitting up then the
vertebral vessels take over and the
jugular doesn't play such an important
role anymore and what he found in ms
people that wasn't the case that ms
people when they would go from sitting
up to lying down that the jugular system
was not responding as it should respond
so I want to show you an example here of
an image you can see the carotid artery
here and you can see an internal jugular
vein here and this is about a centimeter
across and you see it's not
uniform normal jugular vein and this is
an example of a technology that we use
where we inject a contrast agent into
the blood and we take a picture
somewhere between every eight seconds or
every 15 seconds depending on whose
equipment you're using and so it's so
fast in three dimensions I can catch the
blood when it goes into the arterial
phase up the neck and that's the left
hand image that shows just the carotid
arteries and this is being used for 25
years in M R to study people with
carotid atherosclerosis but they never
really paid attention to the veins and
most of those people probably didn't
have MS anyways on the right hand side
we see one of the first cases that was
done by a in a small town llena in
germany and you can see here that both
of these vessels have a little bit of
narrowing associated with them I
wouldn't call this severe it's not
always the anatomy that tells the story
here now although I'm going to show you
a lot of pictures before I get to some
of the technical questions I want those
of you who are technical to think about
this for a minute you have
three-dimensional information I've
talked about quantifying iron I've
talked about quantifying blood flow and
and you're going to see all sorts of
different shapes if you will things that
could be characterized by the right
algorithms to recognize abnormalities in
3-dimensional datasets these are the
types of questions where we need a big
focus we need that focus to take place
quickly and we could solve some of these
problems in my opinion in the next year
or two if we took all the skills that
people have in places like Google or
other locations so in this particular
case I'm the person on the left hand
side this is actually a very rare
example where the jugular vein comes
down gets very narrow and you can see
here there's a stump that's what Zamboni
calls a trunk your venous malformation
basically when this person was
developing they didn't develop that vein
correctly it was you know it was growing
and it didn't connect to the other part
so it's just like a tree trunk basically
this in this individual the jugular vein
veers off and joins into the external
jugular vein very abnormal situation so
if you want to go in and treat this
person you would go in with the catheter
so an interventional radiologist would
go in here and he would find nothing
there's no way he can connect back up
I'll show you an example in
minute where in fact it would have been
easy for him to do that so that the mr
scans the 3d mr information that's
available for if you're an MS patient I
would always have an mr scan first I
don't care what the interventional
radiologist says and it's of course I
think I'm being taped here you need it
the neurologist will tell you you need
it you need it for treatment planning
because if you don't use this for
treatment planning and the surgery
doesn't work for you what are you going
to do next you won't know what your
baseline was you'll have nothing to
compare to so if you get that done first
and then you get scanned again after
you've been treated you have that
information available to you to follow
what's happening now things are very
subtle here Sal's clef on e kindly lent
me this one this was a patient that had
a normal with internal jugular and the
first time he did this patient he
couldn't find anything wrong so he went
back in and injected to die and here he
could see that the dye stopped and
that's because some people also have
these flaps inside the vein and these
flaps can open up like this and block
the blood flow if you stick a wire or
catheter up through that you're gonna
open it up so of course you're gonna
thank all this levels normal so things
are pretty subtle and this was very
observant of Sal too to find that so
here's an example of somebody who has a
beautiful arterial and venous system
lots of arteries lots of veins coming
down here and in the vertebral plexus
and and often if the vertebral plexus is
highlighted or if it's highlighted on
one side only that's the development of
collateral so the brain is smart if
there happened to be an obstruction here
it would develop these vessels to be
very large in order to carry out the
blood that couldn't go out the internal
jugular vein so even though this may
look normal we have to look at the flow
so this is a technique in M R where we
can actually quantify the flow every 40
or 50 milliseconds throughout the
heartbeat so here we make a plot of the
flow the average flow about 10
centimeters per second and you can see
it doesn't go to 0 and it doesn't go
negative but on the person who had
normal looking vessels here's what
happens for him the flow goes up and it
stops for a good fraction of the cardiac
cycle sometimes it even goes negative
and in order to get all that blood out
the flow wasn't moving for half that
cardiac cycle instead of having an
average speed of 10 centimeters per
second he's going to double that speed
in order to get that blood out on the
way back so we find that a lot of these
people have much higher flow as their
peak flows because they still have to
get the blood out of the brain so what
we've begun doing here this is in
collaboration with David Hubbard and
sent in San Diego as we've started to
make some plots of things like this and
this is just one example of the
quantification that could be done with
flow there's probably a dozen vial
markers that can be used for flow and in
this case we take the ratio of the
internal jugular vein flow divided by
the total venous flow that we can
measure and in most people we see that's
around 80 percent and and here you can
see some people have very very low
values for this and so we wonder if this
is representative of an arterial venous
mismatch are we getting a lot of the
venous blood going out the vertebral
plexus and are these people ones that
have maybe more severe MS I can't give
you the answer to that question yet
because we're we're just doing this
these slides are literally hot off the
press I got them yesterday from one of
my postdocs this is another example of
plotting again the percent reflux here
and in fact I think yes the total flow
here so you can see that you tend to
have this higher reflux at lower flows
and not so high reflux at higher flows
what I need to put on these plots that I
don't have yet and this is the weakness
of what I'm showing you is I don't have
50 normals to add on to this yet we are
collecting normals at this point but
this technology needs to be done on not
dozens not hundreds but on thousands of
people and as I'll show you at the end
of this talk I think we have the
potential to do tens of thousands to
hundreds of thousands of people creating
international databases for diseases
like multiple sclerosis so I'm only very
briefly going to show you something here
why it's important to deal with this
vascular problem I think it's going to
be very hard for you to see this but
when people get acute lesions in MS
these lesions tend to enhance in the
presence of a contrast agent and that's
shown here with some of the new
technology called perfusion weighted
imaging and some of the analysis that's
being done to measure cerebral blood
volume we find out that the cerebral
vol for these people is increased in the
acute lesions so the body is trying to
deal with this problem the problem is if
you've had that nation for a long time
you can see here it's just completely
dark in this circle that means that the
local cerebral blood volume is almost
zero that's bad news if you don't have
blood flowing to the tissue that tissue
will become ischemic and it will die so
you don't want to have have those
lesions for too long and again I'm going
to throw this out as more of a challenge
to the technical Google people so this
is a new technology we developed where
we take the temporal information we get
we collect basically an image roughly
every second and we take that data as a
function of time maybe over 50 time
points and as that contrast agent goes
into the tissue it has a constant signal
first and then it drops the signal and
then the signal recovers if I take that
signal from one point and let me say I'm
going to take the signal from an MS
lesion I'm now going to do some type of
cross correlation or mean squared error
estimate of the similarity between that
pixel and all the surrounding pixels
then what happens is here I can see in
the red red means the biggest difference
I can see that that single pixel light
rose in the MS lesion now allows me to
pick out all the lesions in the entire
3d volume of the brain that means they
all have the same vascular behavior so
you can see that all of these dark red
match here with the bright white but
look at something else there's a pattern
here of green that's not as different as
the red that in my mind may be an
indication that that's the next tissue
at risk that that's all tissue that
probably is beginning to develop the
same vascular problem and it may be that
if a new lesion develops this is the
region it will develop in so this is a
very new technology but something that
has a lot of promise so I think we
better move on here since I have just 20
minutes left the venous system is a very
complicated system if you think of it
simply you have such rapid flow in the
arteries you know somewhere between 20
centimeters a second in a minute sorry
Han a meter per second in for the common
carotid artery but the veins they're
much bigger why because the flow there
maybe ten centimeters per second so to
have a balance of input-output you need
to have a much higher volume of veins
than you do arteries because the blood
flow out of them is much slower so
roughly speaking there might be three
times the volume of veins in the brain
then there are arteries and soul the
body creates a very complicated system
to drain that blood and it's very smart
if the blood is stopped from draining
out this region here which is the
thalamus striate region we were talking
about this is the straight sinus then
the body says okay if I can't get out
there there's a whole bunch of tiny
little plexuses in here these are small
networks of vessels that I can't even
measure directly and and it sends them
down these plexuses and it sends them
down the spine so many people with MS
they have this extra outlet they can
develop and enlarge the veins in the
spine to take that blood away where they
couldn't get out the normal pathways so
let's take a quick look at this this is
a projection over many slices through
that same technology which we called
contrast-enhanced MRA and it's very
complicated in fact it's so complicated
I can't really tell what's going on here
well the nice thing about having 3d data
is I can narrow that window I'm looking
at down to a smaller number of slices
like this or I can narrow it down even
further just to look at maybe five or
ten slices and lo and behold now you can
see very clearly that there is a
stenosis here and in this particular
instance the interventional radiologist
could go up through here and open that
up because there's a connecting pathway
between the two so it's very nice to
have that information available to you
now again by proper processing of that
data we can go in and strip away the
tissue strip rate strip away the
arteries and we can get an image that
contains predominantly veins only and
this is really a gorgeous example of
somebody who has developed tremendous
collaterals in the vertebral plexus you
can see the external jugular here the
internal jugular this is that same
person who has this this internal
jugular veer off into the external like
this and because of that they've
developed these collaterals to get that
blood flow out so this three dimensional
information is very important for
treatment planning
there are many manifestations of these
types of things some people have just a
thin
the jugular all the way down it's not
necessarily blocked but it's gonna be
tough to get a lot of blood flow out so
what does the body do here it takes
these external jugulars and makes them
very fat so they can carry more of the
blood out for you and it may be that
even normal people have this I don't
know yet because we haven't done enough
normals and it may be that the that this
is just a natural protective mechanism
and they don't get MS we can't say that
that CCSVI is the cause of MS and I'm
not trying to say that but it's part of
MS and it may be there are other
exacerbating factors for example though
levels of vitamin D other types of
things that may have caused this problem
maybe you had trauma sometime in your
life there could be a variety of reasons
for this nevertheless we cannot ignore
the fact that so many MS patients have
these types of problems
some people have multiple stenosis in
their jugulars some people have
bilateral stenosis as shown here this
particular individual is a very
complicated case similar to that one
person the the jugular is very thin and
then loops back over and joins in to the
external and you can see that the
external loops back up here like this so
even just in this short presentation
you're going to see there are many many
manifestations of this in order to do a
proper job to do with the neurologists
one double-blinded study you cannot
design a double blinded study until we
do what we're doing today
so in fact follow the neurologists own
advice we need this pre information to
do a good job in a double blinded study
and we need probably thousands because
if we have 25 different types of CCSVI
and I want 20 cases per type then I'm at
at least 500 and if I have more types
than that then I'm going to be in much
larger numbers so here's an example of
someone who has a drunk Euler venous
malformation that jugular comes up and
it just stops so what are you going to
do for this you need this information
here's the opposite someone who has the
vessel coming down and it just stops it
doesn't go anywhere notice the contrast
agent gets in here but there's no flow
past this point there's no vessel past
that point so again the body here
develops the vertebral plexus to handle
that type of problem now sometimes you
will find pinching ZUP in this area
for normal people so again it's very
important we do a lot of normal people
and this will be the next stage of doing
this we've done more MS patients today
than we've done normal so we need to
change that we can also in
three-dimensions do something else to
validate our understanding so this
coronal picture is nice but how do I
know really the level of stenosis what
I'd like to do is quantify that level so
we can go and look at the transverse
data and we can see that this vessel got
very thin okay we call that as stenosis
or a narrowing
we'd like to quantify it and say that's
80% stenotic so those are some things
that also will need to be done the as I
guess I only briefly mentioned we're
making progress on imaging the as igus
it's a little bit harder to do that but
I know the MS patients would be
interested in that so I have a slightly
different proposal than Zamboni from an
mr point of view what are the criteria
we can use we can look for clear
stenosis we can look for the trunk your
venous malformations we can look at lack
of flow we can look for dilated internal
jugular veins near the confluence we can
look for stuck valves we can look for
circulatory flow what we're finding in
some cases is that as the jugular comes
down it dilates like this as it's
joining in with the brachiocephalic and
it's there's a circulatory flow that's
created like in the carotid bulb now
that can't be good for that vessel
because it's probably constantly putting
pressure on that wall and that's
probably continuing to dilate so the
system exacerbates it gets worse over
time not better reflux is important and
very high flow rates are important so
what are some of the future directions
we need to look at combining ultrasound
and mr to get better flow information we
need to continue to characterize these
venous problems we need to map out the
dynamics associated with this and the
next topic is we need to create an
international imaging protocol with this
so what we have proposed is the nice
protocol stands for a neuro vascular
imaging center of excellence we'd like
to see a number of these centers of
excellence around the country around the
world I proposed this actually in
January to the Canadian federal
government in Ottawa this is the type of
approach that's quite novel very
different than NIH funding very
different than conventional industrial
funding
right now we use when we write NIH
grants we can pay up to $50,000 a
patient because you have to pay for
their doctors time the research was time
the imaging time and everything else
associated with it
so a recent Adney study it was roughly
sixty million dollars to study eight
hundred cases that's a lot that's the
$64,000 question is why does it cost
sixty-four thousand dollars to image one
person so what we need to do is we need
to do this ten times cheaper and ten
times faster we don't want to wait
another ten years to try to understand
this problem and I believe by properly
integrating the efforts that are going
on across the country anyways at a level
of not just academic environments but
clinical environments we can do that and
this is what I'd like to show you here
so in March we started to process data
for different sites we did about a
hundred cases in four months and then
the last three months 200 cases and I
imagine we'll do 400 by Christmas maybe
more and this was just with three sites
now you can imagine that this is
starting to become exponential and
remember there are 400,000 people in the
US with with this problem right so
what's what's going to happen here is
this keeps doubling every three months
that number is going to become very big
very fast and so within two years we'll
be doing tens of thousands if not a
hundred thousand cases I can't handle
that I'm just an academic person I have
a few people working with me to deal
with this I have three sites that are
working with me right now I think
there's a tidal wave about to happen and
I think people in Facebook and Google
they understand the viral concept once
you get one piece of information out
there and you want to enhance it with a
second piece which feeds back to the
first this becomes exponential very fast
and and it's not just an issue of
handling the data it's an issue of
processing that data properly in data
mining that data properly so you need
enough people focused on this to do a
coherent job not in 25 different centers
across the United States in one Center
who can focus this together and I do
want to just acknowledge mark oddly at
Falls Creek in Vancouver who's been very
helpful at working with us David Hubbard
in San Diego who's helped establish that
international IRB meal and terrianne and
jean-luc gary PA and IRM in Quebec City
they've just started
do this as well as I said that's just
three sites what's happened in the last
week alone excuse me in the last week
alone David Hubbard has now got approval
for this IRB so on the first day we had
three responses second day twenty the
third day forty okay that's going to
really mushroom if we get hundreds of
sites willing to do this we will be
inundated with this so we have to start
thinking ahead how can we handle this if
I wrote an NIH grant today to say okay
help me do this that's great I'm sure I
can do it and I will submit a grant for
this it will be at least a year before I
hear back from them and get funding so I
can't wait a year we have to do this
today so what are some of the things we
need to do we need to look at 3d
automatic processing things like vessel
tracking vessel identification
functioning quantification to Venus
anomalies this is really pattern
recognition problem can we see all the
different types of patterns that are
associated with this we need to quantify
the iron content we need to quantify the
lesion types where they are how they
associate and we need to basically
correlate the sub characterization of
these venous anomalies with flow iron
Anatomy patient symptoms and treatment
outcomes for the patients this is a big
job this is a center job to take a
hundred people to handle that so the
conclusions are can neurodegenerative
disease be vascular in origin do they
contain perhaps instead just major
connections to the vascular system we
can answer these questions if we do this
in the way that I've proposed by using
Centers of Excellence this nice database
and the establishment of a national
registry is in my opinion the way to go
we need to be doing tens of thousands to
hundreds of thousands of cases and we
need to be doing it quickly and so my
final note to Google is perhaps Google
can help establish the next level of
integrated national and international
research by supporting the nice centers
of excellence concept thank you very
much
these microphones works solving this out
well first this is stunning work and
thank you for describing it to us I I
think we're very lucky to be able to
witness this I'm a very simple question
can you offer opinion or does the
research thus far allow you to offer
opinion on whether or not people that
have a truncated jugular say by by means
of surgery like a radical neck
dissection if those people are at
greater risk for CSV I as you've
described it or if you just don't know
yet know we don't know yet and part of
the reason is this is a really novel I
mean my opinion Paolo Zamboni will
probably get a Nobel Prize for this in a
few years so you're witnessing something
that you only witness maybe every 25
years or so where there's a breakthrough
a medical breakthrough the problem is
people have run out there and they've
got imaged about a thousand of them and
they've got they've got the treatment
about a thousand of them but they're not
being followed up in many cases or if
they are being followed up like in
Dake's
case their image 2 year later the
numbers aren't there to correlate the
types of disease with the final outcome
there are a lot of people now who are
finding that they had good recovery for
some point after the treatment but maybe
they're going back a little bit and then
the question would be why what's
happening you won't know unless you do
the imaging and try to understand this
problem so maybe maybe in a year I can
answer your question maybe six months
depending on on how viral this really
becomes so on one of the earlier slides
you mentioned like in 1935 they
demonstrated the the vascular
correlation whatever and then later on
they demonstrated the immune system
correlation so how does the the vascular
theory affect that the immune system
theory like our are we throwing out the
demyelination thing or is is there a
tie-in with both is one causing the
other like what's the story that so
that's an excellent question I think
that the neurologists today should be
very excited about this because I don't
think this rules out the importance of
the immunological study is the very
opposite I think we should be studying
something we could call vascular immuno
and that would be the study of how
changing wall shear stress for example
which is well known in carotid
atherosclerosis to help enhance that
problem that that this change in shear
stress may end up leading to an
immunological response in fact the work
of John Bergen actually demonstrates in
animals that if you change the flow
there's almost an immediate response
from the body and so that could help
generate this immunological reaction
that leads to T cells that leads to the
tight junctions loosening up that opens
up the possibility of escape into the
the tissue so I think these things are
probably very closely related to each
other that is an area of important study
oh I have a question about imaging as I
guess I don't understand why why did the
advocacy images come out so badly
imaging the as igus is partly dependent
on whether or not the contrast agent is
there in enough concentration and so in
the spine by the time it gets to
equilibrium in the spine the the effect
of the contrast agent has diminished now
there are some new contrast agents out
there one called ms 325 which is about
five times more powerful than the
current contrast agents and that would
be very interesting to to try to do that
with with that particular agent however
we have other technologies where we can
image without relying on the presence of
the contrast agent and that's what we do
right now for the as igus it's a 2d
time-of-flight technique that's because
what we do it takes a few seconds each
time we image and if you're breathing
during that process which you are and
we're not going to ask you to hold your
breath for two-and-a-half minutes then
what happens is you just get this offset
and and in fact one of the the next
things have just been too busy to do
this it's just to go in and develop a
single rip simple registration algorithm
that can go and put those back together
again and then the next time I show
these pictures it won't look like it has
this little boxy
artifact associated with it for the face
reconstructed images the images
reconstruct by the face images face
informations you are all all using the
seven
his lyricism or like though most of the
data I showed here is either from 1.52
year 3t their clinical systems okay okay
how about the I remember you showed 150
micron image actually they they weren't
fifty microns that was a conventional
1.5 tesla scan that showed the presence
of bleeds in a 50 micron arterial and
because the iron effect is so strong it
can affect something a million times the
volume that's that's the source of the
iron itself and so that makes em are
very sensitive to the presence of iron
in its highly paramagnetic forms
simplistic all the hot patients that are
imaged for the arterial is their
possibility since you need hundreds of
thousands of cases to have the venous
flow be done at the same time so you
have a data base of a huge proportion of
the population that's a very good
question in fact I just spoke with the
head of radiology at Wayne State a few
weeks ago about looking back through
some of the CTA data where people do
study the arterial system and that is in
fact our goal to go back and look at a
few hundred cases and get out the
anatomic information not the flow
information and that could be done at
many different sites to validate that in
fact normal people don't have these type
of truncated venous malformations or
they don't have these type of stenosis
that I've been showing you here and so
this is a great way to do it without
having to go in image normal people but
to really compare with the flow that
I've been showing you to quantify that
flow we're still going to need to do a
few hundred or normals we in normals we
don't need to do ten thousand of them I
think I think it's the MS cases for
characterization we need to be doing ten
thousand hundred thousand but we do need
a few hundred or even a few thousand
normals to validate where they sit in
these different types of plots that I
showed you related to flow and iron and
other characteristics
and I have a second question in terms of
the optical no Rytas were people who
were roses who have patients who have
undergone the stent had they have they
have improvements in their vision as
well I don't know the answer to that
question and I'm afraid we need to again
follow patients after treatment and
there is an international registry
that's being set up by the way by Paulo
Zamboni to try and in fact track this
information that's present and we just a
few weeks ago we formed a new society
it's called the International Society
for neural vascular disease that it's
basically to give us our own political
voice to study things like CCSVI and we
will have our first meeting of this
society in Italy in the spring of next
year that will hopefully start bringing
together things like a white paper for
interventional radiologists to say this
is how you should be doing the
treatments this is what you should be
following that we can do the same thing
for the imaging so that we have some
national international standard by which
people are doing this it's only for of
course for the protection and benefit of
the patient all right thank you your
question from New York oh okay yes sorry
as again a non-medical person with no
experience looking at the images you
present and trying to think about the
prospect of doing some sort of visual
image parsing are these images of a
class where different radiologists don't
even agree on what they mean
you think you could train a high school
student to do it when you think you
could train a pigeon to do it okay
that's a very good question I'm glad you
asked that when we first started
processing this data it took us about
eight hours a case there are are dozens
of gigabytes of data and in fact
depending on how you collect this data
you could end up with a half a terabyte
of data so this was a long processing I
usually had masters students do this
they needed to get trained a little bit
in anatomy and other things like this
since then though since I have a lot of
computer science students and people
like this who also work with me and for
me we've now cut that processing time
down to around two and a half three
hours we are looking at automatic
registration and pattern recognition
type of programs to do this but of
course you know it you really need a lot
of expertise to do this properly the
radiologists they can tell you if it's a
stenotic vessel or not but they don't
know if a person has reduced flow in the
vertebral system for example or the
inability to create collaterals they
don't know yet if that's a bad thing or
not so it's pretty hard for them to make
a diagnosis until we can really
categorize the relationship of the flow
and the vascular Anatomy with the actual
patient symptoms and patient outcome
post treatment so this is a pretty
complicated process that you know you
could imagine with tens of thousands or
a hundred thousand cases you could go
and run some automatic routine that
would then try to pull out similarities
between different types of patterns and
say that person who can't develop
collaterals is that far greater risk
than another person and will benefit the
most from the treatment I'm not sure
that answers all your questions about I
hope it gives you science with flavor
but which was simply how difficult does
it seem to be to look at these pictures
and conclude there's a blockage here
there's reduced flow there but but I
think that was a great talk and I thank
you and I'm actually going to talk to
you in a few hours thank you
well it's percutaneous transluminal
angioplasty known as PTA basically they
go in with the catheter and they can
take a balloon and they can expand the
balloon to try to open up the narrowing
in the vein I know that's not a stent
it's literally like a balloon a balloon
is inflated it pushes open the vessel
wall and if you're lucky it will stay
open and what Zamboni found was about
50% of the people that did stay open and
other people that rika lapsed if it
continues to wreak elapsed they might
need to have a stent put in but most
people today are trying to avoid Stan's
unless absolutely necessary so that they
can try the angioplasty the balloon
angioplasty first well this is basically
an outpatient procedure so you can go in
one day you can have this procedure done
it might take 45 minutes it could take
several hours depending how complicated
it is you will then be followed after
this for a number of hours and I suppose
if it's more severe you might even have
to stay in overnight but I believe most
of the time it's considered outpatient
treatment and there is a paper coming
out by Mari and simcha who studied 284
cases to demonstrate in fact that this
is a very safe procedure
don't forget they've been doing this
procedure in other parts of the body
particularly with people around a out
dialysis for example in the peripheral
vascular system for many decades so they
have a lot of experience in this area
they just don't have experience yet in
the internal jugular veins per se</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
