the author of missions global global
economic trend analysis it's one of the
most read blogs on the economics on the
internet and it was ranked by Tom calm
as one as a number one economics blog on
the internet and so I think it'll be
very interesting talk to here mish top
today about the state of the economy but
then also how he started with blogging
and and what the Google products like
blogger has has meant to into his career
so welcome mission hello I'm mish it's a
pleasure and an honor to be invited here
to speak at Google I'm a registered
investment advisor for Sitka Pacific
Capital Management i have a blog called
global economic analysis blogspot com
that's a mouthful to remember so the
easy way to find my blog is just just do
a google search for mish mi sh every day
i write about topics on interest rates
gold inflation deflation housing the
economy primarily from a macro point of
view i'm very passionate about what i
write my general advice to everyone in
this difficult economy is to find
something you like to do do it well
because life's too short to do something
you dislike to do I have fun when I'm
riding in fact often I'm laughing my
head off as I'm writing so I hope it
comes across that way and hope others
are laughing too when they're reading
what I right I'm here not only for
Google's world-famous free lunch but
because of Google's free lunch here's my
story my backgrounds not economics where
Wall Street or finance but rather
computer programming I worked as a
mainframe computer programmer analyst
for over 20 years for some of the
largest banks in the country Bank of
Montreal Harris First National Bank of
Chicago first USA chase and others the
last four years of that run I was an
independent consultant I lost a
consulting contract
after 911 and never got another one I
was out of work for three years had no
income and when I tell people to be
prepared to lose their job began to have
cash sade up if they do I'm actually
speaking from personal experience for
those out of work being short on cash is
no fun yet every day I for years people
were telling me that cash is trash after
nine eleven I spent a lot of time on
stock message boards learning everything
I could about the stock market the
economy I had some great teachers but no
income somewhere along the line a hedge
fund manager offered me a temporary job
but I knew that slot was going to end in
less than a year so i had to find
something else to do as luck would have
it in early 2005 a person on a stock
message board that i run on silicon
investor posted something the effective
hey look at this google has these things
called blocks we can post our thoughts
on them they're really cool because I
just started my blog if anyone needs
help starting there's I'll help you he
went on to cite and best of all blogs
are completely free completely free
those are magic words when you're out of
work with no income completely freeze
not just a good thing it's actually a
requirement I took my friends offer he
created the first template for my block
in 2005 I started my blog hoping that
someone would discover me as a writer
given there's 10 million blogs out there
that say that might be the best business
plan in the whole world but it happened
a few months after my blog was up and
running a company hired me to write a
stock newsletter I did that for a while
about 18 months however I'm not fond of
the page paid newsletter model there's
simply too much good information out
there for free at your fingertips just
by doing a Google search for things to
break away from the newsletter model I
took and passed a series 65 exam and
then became a licensed registered
investment advisor for Sitka Pacific
Capital Management by the way many
people recognize the name of the person
who created my initial block it's
calculated risk
heey now has the number one economic
bloc in the country by page counts and
I'm number three my traffic's roughly
1.5 million page hits a month and my
current business model is ad revenue off
of my blog to supplicate as a percentage
of assets under management at Sitka
Pacific Capital Management most of my
clients found out about the investment
opportunities at Sitka from simply from
linking on a link on my blog I actually
seldom discussed Sitka on my blog I
don't have to i return speak for
themselves with everything going on
keeping my blog up and running is now
very high priority it's painful when my
blog is down RSS stops working as has
happened on several occasions I'm
grateful for Google's free blogs and
indeed I might not even be here today
without them however my viewpoint
regarding free has changed because of
the necessity as opposed to the desire
to keep my blog up and running I can't
afford for my site to be down or to have
our SS stopped working or many other
things that have actually happened to my
blog over the past couple of years
bloggers help is non-existent there's no
one to call for help and the bloggers
help forms are essentially worthless so
please consider some kind of teared
support for those people bringing in
significant ad revenue to Google I'm
asking for a support number I'm even
willing to pay for it now there's
something if a deflation estly is
willing to pay for something there's got
to be a ton of other people out there
willing to pay for google support as
well moving on to the economy well free
blogs are a good idea at least to get
started free money is not and we're in
this mess because Greenspan threw money
at every problem he faced no matter what
the problem real or imagined Greenspan
cut interest rates to stimulate the
economy in 2002 he cut rates to one
percent to bail out his banking buddies
who would then were in hock to deepen
loans to Latin America they were under
not performing and also to loans to
dot-com companies that we're never going
to be paid back the feds actions fueled
the biggest credit expansion in history
in Florida people stay
camping out overnight entering lotteries
to buy a standing in line to buy
condominiums in the summer of two
thousand five the cover of Time magazine
is why were gaga over real estate I
looked at that Wow gaga cinema does not
get much more stream extreme than Time
magazine going gaga over real estate I
looked at that and I wrote a post a blog
post that summer and I said the housing
peak was in indeed it was however
sentiment persisted for a full year that
there was no housing bubble the real
estate manager was all real estate was
his local even after state after state
after state started blowing up sentiment
then morphed into a don't worry it's
just a subprime problem and that
mentality lasted another year even after
Bear Stearns blew up Ben Bernanke Fed
Chairman came out and said the problem
was well contained well contain the
short while later the Fed embarked on
the biggest rate cutting campaign in
history Lehman went bankrupt AIG went
into receivership and had it not been
for massive government bailouts with
taxpayer money Citigroup and bank of
america would have gone under as well
yet you still have the claim no one saw
this coming well they weren't reading
calculated risk naked capitalism the big
picture nouriel roubini or my blog or
for that matter any number of hundreds
of other blocks who all called this
crisis better than all the economic
experts now instead of listening to the
people who called this in advance the
Obama administration like the Bush
administration before it is taking
advice from three groups of people those
who caused the problem those who didn't
see it coming and those who believe
throwing money at the problem is going
to fix it Japan proved without a doubt
that throwing money at the economy to
jumpstart it does not work all it does
is sink a country deeper into debt
unfortunately that is the path that
we've embarked on thanks to Geithner
what I find interesting is the average
eighth grader can understand that if
reckless lending and easy money created
this mess and reckless lending and easy
money cannot possibly be the cure
meanwhile we've got Nobel prize-winning
economist they can't
to figure this out actually I can ran
about this for hours but I think your
time might be better spent addressing
what's on your mind not mine so with
that I'll take any questions anyone has
the question is it looks like the stock
market's heading back up where is the
economy heading is this a false
temporary blip well here's the way I
look at it all they've done is attempt
to recapitalize banks at the expense of
taxpayers they've still not done any
problem anything to help out people who
are out of job people who are
underemployed I have people emailing me
that they're working part time now for
10 hours and they used to be working 40
hours all of that is still putting
pressure on real estate prices real
estate prices I don't think are going to
come back until a 2012 at the very
minimum and I see no source of driver
for jobs housing was a huge driver for
jobs looking back a few years ago and I
think Greenspan actually created a
bubble on purpose like I said to bail
out his banking bunnies who were at hawk
to dot-com companies that were going
under so and look at all the jobs that
housing cratered you know the trucking
of stuff in from China appliances
carpentry work roofing home building
granite countertops even grass seed and
plants for the one and then you know
trucking all of that stuff around the
trucker's ate at restaurant truck stops
I don't see any source of jobs that can
possibly fill that void so you know yes
at some point the economy is going to
bottom but without a driver for jobs and
the green Greenspan was very lucky he
had an Internet boom and a housing boom
I don't see where Bernanke's going to
have any such luck under him because I
don't see what the next wave of
technology is that's going to create the
jobs that that either the internet did
or that the housing did
so at some point we're going to smooth
out here as in stop declining but but I
don't see that the economy is is going
to come roaring back anytime soon and
with that in mind the stock market is is
still very richly priced now we don't
know no one knows where the stock market
goes people ask me all the time you know
minish where's the stock market going
where as gold going where interest rates
going the it's funny everyone has an
opinion on that but the real answer is
they don't know and I don't know either
but what we can say is is these
conditions still aren't very good
economically my own idea is kind of that
the stock market's going to go nowhere
in an interesting way we've had this
rally from 666 on the sp500 all the way
up to well we're over 900 today and but
you know I look at that and saying well
at some point we're likely to retest
that bottom go back down there and just
at 666 level maybe it holds maybe it
doesn't but given that there's no source
of jobs real wages are falling for most
people and so I think the stocks are
still richly priced I think something
like this is going to happen maybe the
stock racket rallies another 100 points
to a thousand falls back down to 700
rallies to 900 falls back to 800 rallies
to 850 I think the markets going to do
something like that over the next four
or five years actually and that's my
good scenario my bad scenario is we fall
back into a double-dip reception which
is I think actually going to happen in
this one ends we're going to slip back
into it and my bad scenario would have
the SP fall to maybe 500 and then bounce
between 500 and a thousand over the next
five years so but we don't really know
it's important to take your cues from
what the market is doing not what you
think it ought to be doing I certainly
saw this this bubble coming from a long
ways off calling the housing bubble at
the top of in the summer of two thousand
five but it took 24 years more before
the stock
market started going back down so
started heading down in an ernst way
then it just crashed so you know we can
see some sort of recovery here I think
it's a false recovery just because
there's no source of driver for jobs so
but it's important to take your kids
from what the market is doing because
people that have that have seen this and
have the same viewpoint have been
shorting the market lately and they've
been getting their heads handed them
blown out of the water so we try and
follow what the markets doing and invest
accordingly doing something positive do
I see any markets or countries that are
doing anything positive actually there's
only one New Zealand the prime minister
of New Zealand came out and said you
don't fix problems by throwing money at
them but everywhere else in the world
they're trying to fix problems by
throwing money at them in the United
States in the UK UK is arguably much
worse off than the United States even
Canada Australia everyone's cutting
interest rates trying to stimulate the
economy our own Congress is upset that
banks aren't lending and I keep asking
myself why should banks lend what is it
we need more of do we need more pizza
hut's do we need more Walmart's doing no
more Home Depot's lows do we need more
targets what is it we need nail salons
what what is it we need and I don't come
up with the answer to that yet Congress
wants banks to lend the irony here is
that banks are acting responsibly for
the first time in a decade by not
lending and Congress is trying to force
them to lend at a time when businesses
have no real need to expand and
consumers don't have a job and can't
spend so all forcing banks to lend will
do is is cause more write-offs down the
line you've argued a number of times on
your vlog that we're in a deflationary
regime persuasively I might add because
the I think what you said was the money
that's being
the banks is just staying there and not
being met I guess the question for those
of us who are long on daughters right
now is when when do those under what
circumstances does that money start to
come out from inflation again okay the
the the question is the the feds been
pumping a lot of money into the economy
my view is has been actually that we're
in a period of deflation and then the
question is what happens to those
dollars that that the Fed is trying to
do I have an analogy and let's say that
I invented the perfect printing press
and the printing press was so good that
I produced dollar bills hundred dollar
bills that the Treasury itself could not
tell from the real thing and let's say I
went out and printed two trillion
dollars worth of these things certainly
if I went out and started buying things
prices of goods would which would start
rising because of this money injected
into the economy but if I printed
trillion dollars and bury those dollars
in my backyard what happens the answer
is nothing happens that money doesn't
make its way into the economy and so
prices of goods and services aren't bit
up we've got a situation now where the
Fed is printed tremendous amounts of
money but it's just sitting there at
banks banks don't want to lend it as we
just talked about so as long as that
money sitting there it's not going to
affect prices of goods and services the
feds desperate to have banks line but
banks simply aren't lending because
there's no reason to now at some point
along the line the Fed is going to have
a huge problem I don't know when that
Perry it is but you know that money does
start to filter its way into the economy
and the feds going to have to slam on
the brakes that in and of itself might
cause a second recession when they do
that when they try and react to what's
coming down the line but right now we're
in this environment where boomers are
heading into retirement with who thought
that their home was going to be the
retirement then they'd stop thought the
stock market was going to be the
requirement
and now they're finding they're heading
into retirement with their underwater in
their home or it's not worth as much as
they thought it was and they don't have
enough money in their savings excuse me
in their stock plans to meet what they
plan to do during retirement so we're
going to see boomers heading into
retirement traveling less than they
thought buying fewer toys than they
thought cars boats and the like so and
in fact some of them are so
cash-strapped they're actually competing
against their kids and grandkids for
jobs got these people that thought they
had money saved up they don't they want
they need to supplement their income so
they're looking for a job so where they
go and just look at the age of some of
the people at at Target or in
particularly at walmart to greeters it's
these people sixty-two years and older
they're competing against their kids and
grandkids for jobs and the reason why
Walmart hires them is is is for medical
reasons people over 60 to have Medicaid
so the government were rather high that
hire them then someone is 25 or 30 years
old with kids and I have to be able to
manage their health care so you know
we've got this competition for jobs
we've got boomers that are going to
start saving and already we're seeing
the savings rates start to go up and but
the biggest thing is consumer attitudes
towards debt have changed its now cool
to be frugal to save money to not spend
people aren't flaunting their wealth
like they used to they're trying to
downplay it all of that you know brings
about a completely different attitude
and and that's what the Fed is fighting
here it's attitudes and attitudes are
like super tankers they don't turn
around very easily at all and and we've
seen the consumers go from the most
reckless over buying willing to go into
debt over anything to an environment
where they're going to have to save in
this kind of environment it's it's it's
very unlikely for the Fed to be able to
spark serious inflation
so you know at some point we're going to
see it again but I don't think it's
going to come rousing back and certainly
all the hyperinflation bed and I believe
they're still going to be wrong because
even when inflation does come back it's
it's not going to be this big massive
inflation that everyone's expecting the
the question is what would I do if it
was if it was up to me because what I
would do is I would bring the troops
home from Iraq I'd bring the troops home
from Afghanistan the US can no longer
afford to be the world's policeman we're
spending a lot of money overseas it's
just totally wasted bombs don't add to
GDP they subtract to it even though it
looks like we're adding to it blowing up
Iraq did nothing but you know cause us
to go in back in there and now we're
trying to fix it that's costing us money
we've got troops stationed in Japan
Europe literally all over the world at
tremendous expense so I would bring
those troops home I would offer them
first crack at any infrastructure jobs
that we create I don't have a problem
with repairing bridges or fixing
potholes that's something that needs to
be done so I would bring the troops home
from Iraq I would offer them first crack
at any of those jobs and I would just
let a lot of the rest of it just play
out the Fed has a history of making
problems worse Greenspan made this
problem worse by trying to bail out his
banking buddies so we can't do the same
thing there's a we're going through a
period of adjustment and there's things
that we can do like I said stop wasting
money fixed at fix potholes repair
bridges maybe do some other things I
think the best thing to do is actually
just let it play out
the question is how would I compare the
banking system today to that of the 90s
and Japan actually I think we're
following the same path of Japan and
which is one of the reasons why I don't
have hope for a very strong recovery
Japan started building bridges to
nowhere not just fixing them but
actually building bridges that weren't
needed when you do things that when you
spend money in ways where it's not
needed there's no economic result
long-term lasting economic result as as
a result the interest on the national
debt is going up that's going to be have
to be paid for now either we pay for
that we pay for that by a cheeping
dollar or our kids or grandkids start
paying for that down the road so this
situation is very much like what Japan
went through and anyone that thinks that
the US stock market is is going to come
roaring back ought to look at at how
Japan stock market reacted we're 20
years into this thing twenty years ago
roughly Japanese stock market was at
40,000 it's a it's at nine or ten
thousand today so uh people in the
United States you know you might not
think that that's going to happen and
maybe it doesn't but I'm saying that
that can happen and that would be along
the lines actually of what i expect for
the next certainly five years I don't
think the stock market's going to go
anywhere I could be wrong but for those
people that are heavily invested
expecting returns out of the stock
market I would say those returns are
likely not coming here's question in the
past you stated you see if for
deflationary recession in the US unless
Congress does something crazy do the
recent actions and bailouts qualify well
they certainly qualify as crazy but I
don't think that they qualify as being
enough to cause hyperinflation as people
think and the reason is you know we've
destroyed trillions ten twenty trillion
dollars worth of wealth real and
imagined actually in the housing
environment
and for the reasons that I outlined
earlier people aren't going to be
spending heading into the retirement
they're going to be saving and even what
they do spend on is is not going to
stimulate the economy much already we're
seeing taxes go up take a look at
California there's fees for everything
now they're putting in these traffic
light things to catch people you know
right trying to raise money by finding
people well you know all that just takes
money out of consumers pockets and and
puts it into the hands of the
bureaucrats which is the last place you
want it so you know none of that is is
going to you know cause any sort of
productive you know capacity or anything
that's going to get us out of this funk
and I think the stock market's
eventually going to to reflect that
which is why I don't think it's going to
go anywhere so yes although Congress has
done something you know really crazy
here they've wasted a lot of money so
far anyway it pales in comparison to the
destruction of of wealth and credit and
the destruction of credit that's yet to
come the we're losing 600,000 jobs a
month we have for the last four months I
expect we're going to lose 600,000 jobs
a month Oh for the next four and then
keep losing jobs after that for quite
some time well people out of work are
going to there's going to be more
pressure on home prices less spending
that people are going to do so all these
reasons i don't i don't think that that
we're heading for this hyperinflation
that everyone thinks how did you get
introduced to Austrian economics
actually I got introduced to Austrian
economics back when I and when I was out
of work looking at things trying to
figure out how the economy really worked
versus what all the talking heads and
Congress and and then Treasury secretary
Paulson was saying about how these
things work so Austrian economics is
sound money hands off uh let the economy
work its way out and certainly I would
would agree to all of those things we
don't need a Fed the right now they're
talking of having this super regulator
we're giving the Fed even more powers
Bernanke two years ago didn't he thought
this was contained and was not going to
spread beyond subprime so you know how
is it the people who didn't see this
coming and how is it that that Greenspan
who created the biggest housing bubble
the world has ever seen how is it that
giving these guys more power is a good
thing to do I would be a favor of
abolishing the Fed and fractional
reserve lending take your question here
I didn't understand the question try
again Oh will the will the Chinese
economy start to recover well China has
has one advantage if you consider this
an advantage they are in a lot of ways
less free market than we are they still
have a centralized command economy that
if the government tells banks to lend
guess what those banks and China are
going to go out let so so you're seeing
some some seeds of false hope now I
think in in China where you know they're
doing all these infrastructure products
but but think about what China is really
doing here they're adding to capacity
when we've got were awash in capacity we
don't need any more cars we don't need
any more manufacturing the toy business
in China is devastated the the average
doctor in China makes twenty thousand
dollars a year a doctor would be a
relatively high class person in China
meanwhile the condos
building in Shanghai all the big cities
things are going for 600 700 thousand
dollars who can afford them we got a lot
of empty condos sitting there in China
you've got a lot of stores all stuff
with the same merchandise you walk into
a store in in some of these places and
there's there's 10 people you know you
walk into a home depot you can hardly
who we got the mic back walk into a home
depot here in the United States you can
you can't find someone to help you you
walk into a store in in China and you
might have 10 people all trying to help
you so it's a big difference and so
anyway so yeah china is trying to
stimulate your economy but the whole
world is but stimulate it for what
because I keep coming back you know at
some point at some point I think you
know China is going to be the dominant
force in the world just as the UK passed
the torch to the United States I think
somewhere down the line just on the
basis of population I think the u.s.
might pass the torch to China but that's
not anything that's going to happen in
the next 10 years or even 20 or even 30
but China unlike the u.s. thinks in
terms of decades so you know they're
willing to go through some of this
they're willing to do some of the things
that they are doing with an eye down the
road and in the United States said we
have a hard time looking down the road
but anyway I think all these green
shoots that people are talking about
whether it's China or the United States
or Europe is is really just more mal
investments by government throwing money
at problems and one has to ask what
happens when they stop throwing money at
problems we slide back into recession
that's what it's an artificial boom
that's being created right now and
that's all we're saying worldwide on
anything recoveries were saying whether
it's China or the United States this
green shoots in my opinion are mirage
savings is always the driver of growth
in our economy you can't spend what you
don't have and in Austrian economic
terms savings is is what's left over
after production well you-you-you an
apple grower produces 40 bushels of
apples and consumes two or three you
know the rest of that is savings now he
can lend that to or use those apples to
perhaps buy shoes or other things and
and we need to get back to that somehow
we've got this this this idea that we
can just you know print money out of
thin air and that's going to stimulate
anything it doesn't the the only way you
can really get money to lend is by
people saving it's the excess savings
from production that that fuels the
economy so they've got it ass-backwards
anyone that says well we need to spend
money to get the economy going no we
need to actually save money have money
saved up use that money for investment
purposes so all the mainstream
economists including Krugman are just
completely wrong in this point the
question is when will China stop buying
us treasuries that's an interesting
question and most people don't really
understand the situation the answer is
China must buy US Treasuries and the
reason is the United States is running a
deficit by definition if the United
States is running a deficit some other
country in the world must be running a
surplus so what are they doing with
those they're getting dollars in return
some people said well you know why
doesn't china by why doesn't try to buy
oil with those dollars okay so trying to
buys oil with the dollars and what is
Saudi Arabia do with the dollars those
dollars are out there circulating around
those dollars eventually have to come
home and the way does the way those
dollars come home is China buys us
assets right now it's US Treasuries now
we've seen Dubai try a port to try to
buy ports and they were they were turned
down for security reasons but of
eventually you know China is going to be
buying US businesses that's how those
dollars are going to return but as long
as there's a deficit out there people
say oh my god China's going to dump
Treasurys by definition they can't and
mathematically China or someone must be
accumulating US dollars per US dollar
assets by the very nature of the fact
that we are running trade deficits with
most of the rest of the world you are
correct that it was spending in World
War two that's that's more or less ended
the Great Depression but was it really
the spending I think people are looking
at correlation and correlation and
causation are not the same thing wars
are never a good thing whores are very
destructive what happened after World
War two is the world's productivity
productive capacity was thoroughly
trashed we countries Europe was
obliterated the US had the had the only
production capacity left in the world
after world Japan was obliterated
Germany was obliterated the UK was
bombed so we had our productive economy
so so from our point of view the economy
boomed but look at what Japan went
through look at what Germany went
through look at what the UK went through
and ask yourself if we're was a good
thing to them it wasn't so looking at
that government spending is only looking
at things from the point of view of the
United States without ignoring what
happened to the productive capacity of
the entire rest of the world so um but
then you know boomers came home they
started raising families more kids more
growth wanted toys the world economy
eventually recovered and I think that's
the lesson here actually that economies
will recover on their own accord if the
government just gets out of the way the
by trying to stimulate the economy we
create false booms we have this
never-ending cycle of boom bust
and i think the housing bubble actually
was the bubble of last resort i'm
hard-pressed to think of another bubble
that can come by it would be a bigger
than that housing bubble that we just
created so and you see government
spending and you say oh my god you know
look at this the economy is humming no
it only looks like the economy's humming
look at all the mal investments we
created we created mal investments and
housing we created mal investments all
across the line when when when
government spends money it creates a
false economic signal that that
everything is well that businesses go
out there and expand and then eventually
these things blow up under Austrian
economics where um we would have sound
money these boom-bust cycles like this
wouldn't occur now we've we've never had
an environment where we've had a true
free market we'vewe've with no
fractional reserve lending so in fact I
wrote a blog on that today so you might
want to read that blog and it's called
the case against the Fed in fractional
reserve lending it's a lengthy piece so
go out there and read that but a history
is actually replete with examples of how
government makes nearly every problem
worse okay
okay I'll do this one another question
here on the computer you've written gold
does well in deflation because gold is
money but gold hasn't been a medium
exchange for decades why do you think
gold will continue to do well in this
deflation well I think gold is money
because it acts like money we look at
gold in comparison to all the rest of
the commodities during this last crash
copper crashed oil crashed corn
everything across the board the only one
that didn't crash is gold I don't think
that government decree alone can stop
gold from being money throughout history
people have kept gold gold as money and
we're seeing that again here right now
and in deflation the value of currencies
the senior currency or the value of gold
should be expected to go up and
certainly it has if you look at the
price of gold actually compared to
copper ore compared to this stock market
so you know gold is sword from from 200
250 excuse me too over 900 where it's
sitting now and in the meanwhile housing
prices have have crashed oil which was
soaring outperforming gold when we had
an inflationary kind of environment
until everything crashed about a year
ago now the amount of gold in almost any
other terms gold in terms of oil called
in terms of copper gold in terms of the
house gold in terms of stock market gold
has done very well which is what it
normally does in deflation in the Great
Depression gold and gold miners were
about the only winners in the stock
market and while it's not the only
winner today it's it's certainly held up
and inflationary periods gold does well
in real terms not nominal terms
and by real terms I mean in comparison
to what gold can buy like I said goal vs
copper gold versus housing gold versus
the stock market so gold doesn't
necessarily have to sort a 5,000 or
anything like that did you know some
people are claiming I you know I I just
think it's a good investment in this
environment gold does well at times of
credit stress gold is not an inflation
hedge at all in my opinion the certainly
had inflation from 1980 all the way to
2000 and gold fell from from over 800
down to 250 and we had inflation the
entire length of time so people that say
well you know gold you know does well in
inflation and gold does well in
deflation actually our misstating the
what's actually happens gold does well
at times of credit stress and when
there's a boom on there's we got the
opposite of a credit stress and and
that's actually why gold collapsed in
spite of having inflation all the way
from 1982 2000
okay so the question about the
fractional reserve frb basically and
it's actually not specific to ever be an
apology that haven't read your post this
morning but I did read most of their
posts in the last few years so just to
actually kind of quite a clarifier where
I'm coming from we actually agree on a
lot of things but i still have very
specific question about their fur be so
i'm trying to send the objection is the
objection something that is common to
any sort of government involvement or if
for example FRB would be something that
is completely clear meaning a depositor
will have two options going to what I
guess people refer to as money warehouse
where you know your money store there
and they're just you may actually have
to pay for for that storage because it
cannot be lent to somebody else and some
other people can go in and put their
money in you know what's currently
existing bank there's no FDIC or if
there is FDIC it's more of a trade group
than a government-backed insurance it's
just like any other insurance and and
would you would you be okay with it
because it's one of the issues that I
find really difficult a lot of dogmatic
Austrian economist and I would even just
take it to the next level the my problem
with banning frb is by extension you
have to ban any form of securitization
you have to ban any form of what people
refer to as you know the innovation
happen in financial engineering and my
last question I'm sorry just making it
complicated is did anybody consider the
cost of banning any of these things
because to me the issue is what is the
actual cost of boring or what kind of
imbalance it would create between the
people that have money and the people
who don't have money and not everybody
who doesn't have money is actually a
credit risk a lot of people you know
want to buy a house assuming they're
going to make that money for the next 20
years and not wait 20 years when they
saved all that money up to buy a house
and what does prevention of SF RB and
any financial engineering does for that
balance wow there's a lot of questions
there first off let me say that
fractional reserve lending
is fraudulent in and of itself and one
of the reasons why prices keep going up
to the point where people can't afford
to buy things is because of fractional
reserve lending rational reserve lending
allows banks to lend out more money than
they've got and not only that Greenspan
in 1994 authorized sweeps sweeps of
checking accounts unbeknownst to
probably almost everyone money is swept
out of checking accounts nightly the
money you think is in your checking
account isn't there it's been swept out
into a savings deposit savings account
you don't see that but it's happening
the savings accounts have no reserve
requirements on them at all so Greenspan
allowed these sweeps to happen banks
lend out that money that money isn't
there all that money you know goes into
to fuel the price of assets until we
have a crash like we just did so the
money fueled housing the money fueled
stock market money fueled all sorts of
other things people thought that it was
wealthy and in contrast the the question
was saying you know well there's you
know not enough you know they need to do
this no by lending money that they don't
have the the the Fed guarantees until we
have a crash like we did now that
there's constant inflation inflation is
is theft actually inflation is theft
against savers it makes money that
people are saving become increasingly
become worth less and less over time the
if ice if I started a bank not a bank of
if I started a corporate company that
that let's say I took in gold and
started lending out gold and I lent out
more gold than i had on on deposit by
offering people receipts that they
considered to be good for gold and I
lent out 10 times more gold than I had I
think the government would probably
crack down on me but somehow it's okay
if banks do that very same thing the we
had banks you know lehman bear
Sterns that blew up they were leveraged
40 to 1 now while that leverage is going
out there the it's helping to fuel asset
prices we see the reverse when sa prices
start having one asset prices start
falling we see back banks that are
undercapitalized they have to raise
capital and right now they're they're
putting that burden on taxpayers right
now which is also wrong but fractional
reserve lending does not mean no lending
fractional reserve lending it's fine you
know I if banks want to lend I have no
problem with with banks you know lending
out the money that they don deposit I
have a problem with the banks lending
out 40 times more money that's on
deposit that fuels asset prices that
fuels these boom-bust cycles that we
went into
the question is how am i using the
popularity of my blog to influence well
actually you know I don't have a lot of
say either unfortunately but
collectively I think we all do and I
think to change is is going to have to
come from all of us collectively when
they were trying to pass that first tarp
plan last year I organized a phone in
facts and Colin write-in campaign
perhaps some of you here participated in
it but one weekend we filled up the
voicemail box of every legislative
representative in the entire Congress
their voicemail boxes were filled up I I
think the president bush and Paulson
were actually shocked when when Congress
actually did not pass that bill the
first time of course then Paulson comes
out and promises financial Armageddon if
people don't pass it so it did pass two
days later and the stock market promptly
crashed anyway but i'm i'm hoping to in
fact I plan not hoping to to start
something up again I've actually
promised to do that but I wanted to wait
until some of the Obama glow has has
worn off when the the first hundred days
you know everyone was willing to you
know almost bow to the administration it
was going to be very hard to you know
step in and come in and say you're doing
this and this wrong you know no one's
going to want to listen to that I think
the time is right now we're starting to
see some some people you know question
what authority the Fed should have both
Republicans and Democrats it's going to
be a long slug but we're going to have
to start somewhere and we're going to
ever we're all going to have to get
involved if we want to fix this problem
so look for you know some things on my
blog
about more you know contacting the fed
members of Congress legislative
representatives and I think what would
be really important is we could just get
you know everyone interested in this
kind of thing to meet with their
legislative representative one-on-one
you know present the case against the
Fed and try and get them interested we
need to abolish the Fed that's one of
the first things we need to do and
certainly that's going to take a massive
effort to get that to happen but I think
it's actually doable I think we're
almost out of time we have won a few
minutes for one more question and let's
take a question from the internet and
then if anyone would like to join us
after after this talk for lunch then
feel free to I don't see another
question on here I'll take one from the
audience okay have you considered using
your prodigious voicemail bombing power
for House Resolution 1207 the Federal
Reserve transparency Act is is that
brawn Paulson's bill yeah I think it's
that congressman Paul's bill okay yes
actually I wanted to do that I mean
that's just a small step in the right
direction I think my fear on on passing
that are you talking about the audit of
the is that the bill required the
question is do I support the the bill to
audit the Fed certainly that needs to be
done but the Fed really doesn't need to
be audited it needs to be eliminated
I've got a stack of business cards over
here on the table over here anyone has a
card anyone wants a business card of
mine please pick it up my blog is not on
there but reference to Sitka Pacific
Capital Management and a way to get
ahold of me by emails on the card
