I'd like to introduce Bambi dersen who
will talk about their work on
translation is a collaborative process
we're using with the help of two
monolingual speakers tries to translate
between two languages and this is joint
work with Peter Bresnik from biomedicine
is a professor at North of Mahlon to he
interaction mobile interface devices he
is known for his zoomable interfaces
thanks very much
pleasure to be here so right gave all
the intro stuff that I needed to say so
let's just dive right in um the need for
this need for the research is fairly
obvious which is that we all know
there's a lot of stuff out there in
languages that we don't all speak that's
sort of that obvious part that I have
another personal motivation which is
just sort of hinted at is I've been
working for a number of years on a
project called the international
children's digital library which is a
website of children's books I want to
show you a little bit a little help to
motivate why I'm interested in
monolingual translation so this is the
website children's library org in which
I should say is actually a Google
partner we are why think the only non
print library partner of Google Books
Ramzi our contact liaison is here so on
we have books in sixty plus languages
and key characteristic is that it's a
very child-friendly content and
interface we worked very closely with
children and the design of the interface
you can see there's sort of an unusual
search mechanism you can click on these
facets and
there we have actually a couple hundred
facets this interface is the sort of the
children's interface so it has a select
number of facets we can look for say
books that are blue and are sad there's
a visual representation of the search
you can actually do keyword search also
but that's sort of demoted sort of very
unruly these there are books in 8
languages that meet those
characteristics notice you can't do a
zero hits query because we grab the
facets and then we can go and get a book
get a the metadata we have well for us a
lot of volunteers we've got about to
thin out 2,000 volunteers that are
translating our metadata so this book
has metadata translated languages and
then you can go and see the book one of
the things we learned about how children
select books is they like to do it they
like to have a feel of the book not only
its physical characteristics but how
colorful it is I mean pictures they're
already picture books are just different
than textual books and it's kind of a
motivation for a lot of the stuff we do
that you'll see runs through this so we
provide an overview visual overview of
the book if there's a lot of pages here
on a small screen and then finally get
to read the book and again there's some
differences with picture books because
you can't just show the text me but you
guys also show the skin of the book but
for us you even need to show two page
views of the book so so we do that but
the books are often not very readable
ability we pre-process the books find
where the text is and then pop out text
where we have an image of the of each
text box that we serve separately and
it's particularly useful for books where
there are artistic or special kinds of
text boxes and the last thing I wanted
to show you is that this is great for
maintaining artistic intent but not
great for accessibility and translation
so because those are images so this our
volunteers are now starting to translate
our books so this book has been
translated into languages we can look at
Romanian so in order to do that and
still keep the context of text and image
we've now go one more bit of image
processing removed the text from the
image and then rendered the text with
the browser on top of the under language
okay so now I get now this gives us the
potential for translation and
accessibility so that's sort of our
context for saying you know where are we
we we if you go back to our simple
search reset this you'll also see we
have books and 60 odd languages and a
lot of them are fairly uncommon and we
don't have volunteers that can translate
between these 60 squared languages
that's a problem
let's also mention passing we also have
done some mobile work we have a mobile
reader and also a mobile writer for kids
creating a storybook stick out boom and
iPhone
check out stories
human translation the biggest problem is
actually the lack of availability all
the other stuff is problem - I just
called them a commercial company to try
and get our website updated version of
the website translate into Mongolia and
they say no problem
you know you said you know it's only you
know whatever a few thousand words they
said we can do that for you and um just
over a month really well we were kind of
thinking tomorrow right or maybe next
week and it would be a few dollars so it
and this is from English to Mongolian
that's not even that uncommon so the
reality is human services as you know it
just doesn't work um machine translation
is great but we want to do children's
books we want high quality and we're
just not there and even when you guys
get there for you know English and
Chinese and French that's great but what
about you know Mongolian tour is will
always find language Paris for which MT
is not going to all right so all right
so let's take a different tack let's
take advantage of human computation
right we know the world is now letting
humans solve our heart problems forests
the problem is of our tons and tons of
human volunteers the number of humans
that actually have the skills that we
need are tiny and so it's great you know
we actually have you know anyone how
much they do one or two thousand
volunteers for our children's digital
library but that's not very much in the
realities of course most of those one or
two thousand people the number of people
are actually actively translating is
relatively small percentage of that and
the number of language pairs that covers
is even smaller so what we need to do is
figure out how to take advantage of the
resources that are really available
which are the people that speak one
language and there's plenty of those
okay so if we look at this some very
rough chart of how translation happens
in the world now we've got our machine
translation which is a relatively low
quality or a professional translation
which is highest quality and
this kind of wiki translation or
Mechanical Turk translation which is
somewhere in the middle and what we are
hoping is that we can do this magic and
somehow get these masses of people to
speak one language to get us better
quality and reasonable affordability so
that's nice that's my goal is to try and
convince you that it might be possible
to do this so let's jump right in and
I'm going to show you the solution fill
in the details there has been a long
plenty of work thinking about how a
human on the destination end on the
target side can take the result of
machine translation and fix it up that's
called post editing so if we had some
some source language speaker say French
go through translation channel and have
the target speaker say English fix it up
you would get something that was better
than just the empty upper right and so
what we are proposing to do is to go a
step further and to say well that's not
good enough so maybe we can now use the
source speaker use our source speakers
to actually help to income in concert
with the target speakers and have some
kind of communication support let you go
back and forth and have a multipass
process to try and improve the target
and in addition to just relying on going
having these humans go back and forth
across this translation channel we're in
visiting this enrichment channel where
you have can have not only pure text but
also take advantage of what other other
resources whatever other resources you
have whether they're pointing to images
on the web links or perhaps even support
some kind of structured Q&amp;amp;A where you're
not relying on pure natural language
because it may be that the kind of
questions that people asked to support
translations stereotyped enough that you
don't need
so so it's only this nexus perfectly
them to a little bit of a metadata I
wanted to say so where we are with this
is where this is a very early part of
the project we actually just got a
little bit of funding from Google's
support themself thank you no commas our
sponsor for this but we and so today's
talk is really kind of a model and a
very early prototype it's actually one
of the things I want to do is leave
plenty of time for your suggestions
about how to make this move forward we
currently have our current prototype is
a real-time community
not quite real-time communication
between two people I think that this
concept of this protocol could envision
having several different modalities one
could be sort of with some I am with the
translation channel in the middle one is
offline between two people and one is
sort of bag of tasks where you go out
and use Mechanical Turk or some resource
like that to get people to do tiny
little bits and I think one of the
interesting questions is which is the
right balance between throughput and
quality oh yes all right so let's go
through an example this is an actual
example from some people that
participated in the pilot study that
were this was done before prototype I
don't really speak French so I hesitate
to say this but I will so source side
you might say I'll general Han tambien
Toledo and it comes out with Google
Translate is in general it means well
both and so now the person the English
speaker on the target side might try and
fix that up and say well I think that
sounds a little bit awkward let me
change that in general it's about both
of us
it goes back through MT to the source
side and now it's a zone around
ilianna knew the source speaker
recognizes there is a little bit of a
potential problem here so they replace
this verb with a reflexive verb and then
adds this enrichment channel data so
they take
this part on Generale and say this thing
this part of the sentence seems to be
translated well so we're going to mark
this as being correct and this part
seems to be having a bit of a problem so
we're going to attach the picture to
that clause that shows two friends and
so when it comes across the target
speaker sees this information they leave
this alone and say maybe this is a hint
of that I'm there's something wrong with
the way this is being translated so I'll
turn this into friends we say in general
we are good friends I guess translated
back and now finally they have there's
some extra there's some interface that
lets the participants propose that it's
done and so one of the challenges here
is to understand when you are done you
know there's actually an I've got an
email from about five different people
in the last two days pointing me to
translation party and so write one of
our challenges is to recognize its to
avoid these these recursive recursive
decorations and so this is it's an
interesting challenge because right this
is we're trying to do something that
seems sort of fundamentally impossible
which is get to people that don't speak
a word of the same language to result to
do something or something the high
quality translation alright so let's
take a step back in order to do this
kind of translation we have to think
about what kind of errors were likely to
see and we're motivated very loosely by
information theory where we think of
translation as communication across the
noisy Channel where the idea is that if
there is redundancy in your source data
then you will have a chance of actually
recognizing that there are errors and
your resultant communication and even
fixing so there's roughly speaking three
kinds of errors those that you can
detect and correct because you can
detect them not correct and things that
you don't even recognize that there's a
problem in the first place of course
those are really tough
so let's just look at these three cases
in this context of monolingual
translation see how it works
so the first easy kind you've got a
sentence to Lamond well entendre le soir
sisindri on it comes across as everybody
has hear story about Cinderella
you reckon with a native speaker
recognizes that that's not quite right
there's some kind of conflict in tents
and so they turned this into everybody
past heard and it works so along the way
we've done a few different pilot studies
to try and tease out how each of the
elements that we're trying to work these
were really small pilot studies we had
25 sentences and Chinese random
sentences which I can Wikipedia used
some empty systems to bring them into
English and then you post editor that if
you had wondered I think to humans post
editor we've put through two different
machine translation systems and sure
enough you can see that post editing
seems to result in does result in a
pretty big improvement based on te or
translation metric for closeness of the
results to the ground truth 9 out of 10
words correct because so te arse is this
I did not
HDR it's it's TR okay so it's both not
done by a human but corrected so right
this means that it may have been - the
translation was okay but it wasn't the
one that was close to the ground truth
make sense okay so the bottom line is
this makes us think that there is enough
redundancy that you can give some get
some value out of it which is just
consistent with that with literature so
that's right alright so a little bit
more interesting is those errors that
are detectable but not correctable so
you recognize something's wrong we don't
quite know how to fix it so it's the
same source sentence and it comes across
you see everybody has heard the business
by Cinderella
so maybe that's okay but maybe it just
seems a little bit weird so here you're
just how about no raises a flag and say
I'd like to ask about the business well
so the problem is of course you were
hesitant to just ask them a question
because you can't communicate right
directly and if you ask them through the
MT system your question might be a
problem so if we can't use this naive
solution what do we do and this brings
up this general question of how to
communicate through unreliable MT
systems as I mentioned earlier one
approach is to use what we call it
enrichment channel or metadata of other
kinds other kinds of information that
are less likely to be problematic but we
still have to be able to connect the
relevant parts of the language on both
sides unfortunately we know how to do
that we just stole from his dissertation
at Maryland and the idea is we can use
alignment which is right the connection
between words across languages to
project and from project other kinds of
information so the this picture is
showing that down on the top if these
words are aligned blue and blue house
and Maison and so on then if blue is an
adjective modifying house and we know
that in English we can infer that blue
is an adjective modifying right so we
can do the same kind of the same kind of
thing where now what we want to do is
just take this phrase on the right
business buy and add some metadata which
is saying you know I'm I'm just confused
can you help me out on this I've seen a
single bit of information is helpful and
then it comes across on the destination
side right on the matching a bit of text
and now they can attach an image since
the star and Friends can mean something
like story ish or something like
business they get an image that means
story and so now this comes across
back to the target speaker side within
pictures of a story and that gives them
a better chance of figuring out what was
going on so we did a second pilot where
we this was still a this was a wizard
this was a Wizard of Oz simulation at
this point where we use those same
sentences but now we let them go back
and forth and ask questions where the
questions themselves went through empty
so this was a case where we kind of shot
ourselves in the foot right where we
knew that the questions are going to be
translated and the answers would be
translated badly but we figured if there
was any improvement here then we could
certainly do better than this and so
what this is showing is t0 was the
original MT t1 was the result of post
editing they went back to the source
speaker and came back this was a result
of it going a roundtrip actually got
slightly improved and then post editing
a second second round with whatever
metadata they had added to gave us
another few percent so was not a huge
improvement but it's in the right
direction and as I said this was a not
best solution that we might have the
data both post editable ie met could be
associated with some metadata like I
wouldn't mind it not that the thing you
can attach pictures to it right right so
I don't have any data to answer your
question I will tell that our we've done
sniffs you'll see if we've done several
experiments I'll show you as we go along
one of the things that we've learned is
that unfortunately the kinds of things
that pictures work best for are the
things not surprisingly that are least
likely to have problems but nevertheless
there are still ambiguities where
pictures can help and and we're not
really not only limited only to pictures
actually there's the richer the world
becomes the better off this approach
works right you just even find a
Wikipedia page that's been translated
you can just point to know your version
of the Wikipedia page hope that somebody
else does translate
that will keep heating page relatively
correctly and that will give you some
information that might help so this kind
of it's there's a lot of randomness in
there as I said this is very early in
our prototype so absolutely of course we
assume they'll be an online dictionary
and so it could be the view of any
question rather than just saying I have
a question you have an online the online
dictionary might even be more clever
could go back to the source get all of
the definitions and then translate each
of those definitions and say which I'm
confused it says this but you sure this
is the right one and they can go back on
the source side if they actually it's
this definition so yeah there's all
kinds of places where we're expecting
the interface design a dynamic interface
design you're driven by the underlying
data as much as there is will be helpful
which is why I should mention I should
have mentioned this up front for those
of you don't know that my collaborator
Philip Resnick is a longtime you know
computational linguist and I'm a long
time HCI person neither of us having
really done much in the other so this is
spread I'm Way out of my league here so
I'm sure it's gonna become apparent as
we talk about these details but the
interesting thing is I think the ways
and the way this can work is precisely
when you do marry all of the underlying
linguistic understanding with the best
possible you know rich interactive user
experience
okay so the impossible kind you get a
sentence that looks just great it's
grammatically correct it's you know
somewhat reasonable within the context
and there's no reason to think that
there's any error at all so what can you
possibly do about that
and this is a tricky one at first glance
the answer is nothing and when we
started thinking about this way we were
like you know this is bad this whole
research idea is a bad thing we should
not be doing this right then we realized
actually there are some things we can do
right if our general feeling is that
redundancy or feeling we know that
having redundancy helps let's just think
about where can we get more redundancy
from so a simple kind of redundancy is
just to have different machine
translation systems right you could
certainly is different I mean there's
lots of different machine translation
systems in the world and they have
different underlying processes and
different underlying data that's built
them and they're likely to have some
different kinds of data so there's a
chance you'll get different results that
might help you out and if you do that
might bring you down to level 2 where
you least recognize that there's an
error and then you can go back to using
your communication mechanism so try to
fix it so we did our third pilot and
used we'd already used Google and Babel
Fish separately and now what we did is
we gave we use them together so
strangely enough even the automatic
system did better than either one and
that is just by looking taking the best
results of either Google or Babel Fish
basically what this means is every once
in a while that will fish did better
than Google well so that's not quite
anyway there's there's the point is that
there's more information even by
combining these two things but the
really interesting thing is that we just
get a we're using a human well human is
an Oracle right so that's legitimate
when we gave both translations to a
human and just had them select I use
both of them to construct the best thing
then
had a pretty significant improvement so
more parallel channels is better turns
out there's other things oh the humans
here do they always just see one
sentence and make the decision on one
sentence or do they see whatever they
see in context and so in this pilot they
only saw one sentence which thank you
obviously this is a constrained task by
sort of the nature of these doing these
experiments but trying to get something
that you can pin a number on but it
doesn't mean that these are the worst
you could you can always do better than
them so there's lots of other ways to
get redundant information one is show
context so very least so the sentences
around that sentence are trying to
translate in the context of a picture
book by all means show the text in the
context of the picture right the picture
probably contains you know many picture
many children's books it'll contain half
the information and there's something
you can do this even stranger which is
this goes against I think that natural
way of thinking of things is we normally
try and do things inexpensively but our
goal here is is I will say that our
first goal is to do things with high
quality and our second goal is we're
trying to just get to a place where we
can use these translations so what you
could do is you can have the source
language speaker paraphrase or just
write say the same thing in a different
way every single time right and then
translate that paraphrase and that seems
outrageously expensive to take all of
your material and get a human to say it
again but on the other hand right we
have hundreds of thousands of
participants where they're monolingual
speakers and you can engage them and I'm
not asking haven't yet asked the
question of how we can engage them right
that's another important question but if
we make this either fun or we make this
useful to them or we and build this into
their normal activities I don't think
it's actually that unreasonable that
we're gonna be able to get this kind of
participation in one form
another loose in some contexts and
that's probably going to be the best
kind of redundant information that will
help us convert these undetectable
errors into detectable errors
okay
all right so this more or less makes
that point
all right so we did a couple more
experiments first we did what we've done
all those pilot experiments I've looked
at each of these individual sort of
elements and then we wanted to put it
together and say okay if we had this
whole system what it worked so we did a
Wizard of Oz experiment before we built
any technology we had a kind of a
structural challenge because we didn't
want bias by this participants to be
able to have a common language because
they might be able to infer something
about it important within that within
the experiment so we participant that
spoke French in English and another
participant is both Turkish and English
and we had a Wizard of Oz in the middle
that spoke all three languages and this
participants never used English in the
task so we just did a very small amount
of this it took an hour to do five
sentences in which they finished - and
so this made us nervous because we're
thinking okay well we should sort of
conceptually that this might work but in
practice it's a complete loser because
it was gonna take so long and what
happened is so we got nervous at first
but as we started to think about and
look at what happened we realized that a
lot of the time spent was avoidable
first of all we had people in different
rooms and the Wizard of Oz was running
back and forth and like typing stuff
into Google Translate so there was a lot
of overhead that we could avoid and the
other thing is that people a lot of the
result will depend on the instructions
that you give to people we had given
people the instructions of trying to
make excellent high quality translation
and so as a result they would sometimes
spend five minutes on a single side
scratching their head and wondering
whether they should use this or you know
and really trying to make it exactly
perfect and going back and forth and I
think that with a fine tuning this sort
of quality speed trade-off based on how
we motivate people and instruct them we
can get that speed way way way down and
still get reasonable results
so we built a prototype which I warned
you was very very rough but to show you
what it looks like I am going to attempt
with my graduate student Sean who was
and hopefully sitting in his computer in
Maryland to try and translate something
all right so we're going to I actually
want to do this scripted just so I've
got a fighting chance of making this
work okay so this is a book that
actually the same book I showed you but
we're gonna actually start from Chinese
we have so we're in this case we're
going from Chinese to English and just
ignore the fact that this book was
originally written in English so you
start off by seeing in the current view
of the page the current best translation
of the English and if you read through
this you'll see that some of this looks
good and some of this looks slightly
funky you can when you mouse over edit
you'll see what is the which sentences
are ready for you should do some work so
all of these green ones are ready for me
that is right because they go back and
forth so this is not ready for me on the
English side so I'm gonna pick
this sentence everyone read the story of
Cinderella and then what we'll get is
slowly
okay this is the last the last edit of
this sentence from Chinese to English
okay
confused alright normally you see an
image of the section of the book with
that sentence so you can see the image
but because this that's not here because
this book was actually translated into
Chinese for this experiment will be
there and now here's my interface we
kind of do this night like our snake
shaped curve back and forth source is
always on the Left translation is always
on the right and so now I can take this
and either tag any portion of it or edit
it so I'll go over here and change
everyone has read the story of
Cinderella I can now say that because
translation is finished I give up before
a sent to partner I'm gonna send this to
partner
I just
all right so now this is the current
best sentence right it's not green right
now because it's not available for me to
do anything with but as soon as my
partner has that we can and this also
brings up the challenge of the real-time
nature of this right I said in the
experiment people it's been five minutes
but even if this is working well it
takes one minute but you're gonna even
if you're working with somebody even if
you know them you're not going to want
to be doing this in real time back and
forth so I think we need to design this
interface much better for having much
less waiting and let you yeah you
actually can go through and do any other
sentence and then come back to that one
but our workflow right now is a little
bit funky I can do all the green to do
that this is such a little girl story so
maybe I go edit this to say this is this
is a story and just to show you how this
works maybe we want to tag
right I can select some some text it's
using the Google research Translate API
to give me alignment across the language
and now the moment all we can do is do
an image or text but I can do an image
search
well
normally you can do I think it'll
eventually come up unless your
Westminster alright now you can do an
image search
do we have an embedded search take the
image and its associated with that text
and then the Edit image will show up on
both sites all right I think you get the
idea looks like we did a slightly more
real evaluation on this prototype
finally without a Wizard of Oz going
between Russian and Chinese and in this
case they were able to work about six
pages forty four sentences as an hour so
still slow but on the right trajectory
so I think we can get you know five
times faster again then we would be in a
reasonable shape but what's interesting
is the results so we had a bilingual
translator judge the resultant sentence
both the resulting sentences of our
protocol and just the original MT output
for both fluency and accuracy so the
light green is the MT output and you can
see that there's kind of a hump down low
which is bad and for the prototype the
hump is towards right in fact we had a
good chunk things on the right it's
actually a little surprising that this
there was so much that wasn't completely
fluent and I haven't looked at the data
close enough to know exactly why but I'm
just guessing that it's dismissed
inconsistent judgments among our
participants and our expert speakers
still I wouldn't expect it to be that so
high so
but what's really was really positive
and encouraging is that the the accuracy
we started off with accuracy sort of
being in the middle and a little bit all
over the map and after the result of
running through this prototype it went
way to the right okay so that's good in
fact if you look at these results of
twenty eight sentences that were
translated the number of sentences that
were bad say one or two dropped from
twelve to four a number that are good
rated four or five jumped from the seven
to nineteen so with all kinds of caveats
and our our system clearly having a lot
of room for improvement it seems like
there's the potential for this to give
us certainly higher quality and so it's
going to come down to is how
consistently how fast can this work how
painful is that for humans to
participate and how to right make this
so it's how do we come up with a way of
making this fun or engaging or part of
their activities something you just wrap
up I tell you where we're going but I
think we've learned enough about this
interface and see why that will throw it
away and rebuild it become a recent
convert of GWT so I think I'm making all
my students use GWT mail we need to get
more languages we're currently using the
research API which only gives us
alignment and best of a few languages so
I don't know if there's any way to give
us access to it should work if it
doesn't work maybe only says it works
for some but it's a huge bit of
information but you think the intention
is to have it don't be discouraged by
the documentation there's no reason it
shouldn't support and as you can see
right we were able to integrate this
into our app
well to the school we're using alignment
we're not yet using the invest
I think people I mean I'd actually don't
I don't know exactly what we're seeing
find out I don't know
and the I can't find out the we just
wrote this up as a paper that we
submitted to Kyle last week so we kind
of did the experiment on Wednesday
afternoon and finished writing it on
Thursday
actually he's online so we of course one
of the side goals of this is our
principal goal but a natural part of
this is if this model starts to get used
with any volume we then start to build
really good new sets of matched data
which of course naturally feeds into
empty systems right and this is always
of course a second best to having good
quality empty so right I think I might
my vision for the world is that there's
gonna be some version of this I some
present of human participation to
improve quality in some way to improve
empty systems where you need high
quality and then as you get more and
more of these things but empty will get
good enough the human participation will
decrease and you'll just switch to more
and more language nares
and there's enough language pairs that
we can just keep out this for a long
time so just sort of taking off step
back to close we think about this work
as being a bit of a investigating a new
space in this quality affordability
trade off by using human participation
it begs the question of okay well it
might work for translation but where
else can humans help you to how to solve
our problems and of course there's a
whole field of what's sometimes called
human computation or I call distributed
human computation we actually just
submit the second paper to Kai trying to
look at this field more broadly and
wrote a taxonomy sort of summarizing how
we see the field of human computation
going and identified several dimensions
in these columns that you have to
consider whenever you're building a
distributed human computation system
such as what motivates the people to
participate what kind of quality can you
expect to get and how can you design
your system to result in better quality
and avoid or I can make money from you
how do you aggregate the results what
kind of human skills do you require
what's the minimum amount of time does
it take to participate because that's
crucial right if it's very long you're
gonna have much smaller participation
and how much effort does it take you
know certain kinds of tasks that really
take you to require you to focus are
probably going to be harder to get
participation and then there's all these
different categories of THC you know the
most obvious one which of course you
guys know well is games with the purpose
is we've gone on and that's super
important and valuable but it's really
only one kind of way that people are
harnessing humans to do hard stuff
so the mono translation that I'm talking
about now is really as sort of a form of
crowdsourcing as I mentioned we're
envisioning repackaging it as MacKinnon
mechanized labour in the future and I
think there's even a potential of
repackaging in its dual purpose work
which is the idea that you integrate it
into people's existing workflows so you
do something right there you get exactly
the people that you want to do what
they're already doing show you just a
motivational demo that's really more for
me than for you guys but this is a
beginnings of my sort of explorations of
using wave not surprising my first app
is a icy DL Reader it's my first half of
everything so here's a wave with a with
a with a icy DL gadget which is
that's an unusual behavior I'm gonna
call us a wait no that's good but you're
good I'm definitely not showing you a
movie all right
so actually you saw came back to the
same state so I'm showing the page
number I'm using the page number as a
shared state which is kind of
interesting because now that lets me log
on with a different account in fact with
a different
okay um right so now I can use the
shared state to have a a social social
reader and then I can even do something
like say okay well I'm sort of envision
this being used in a class participation
where maybe even up thirty kids that
maybe you're in the same group setting
or maybe they're not in the same setting
and so one group decides or one kid gets
a look behind so they want to back up
but they know if they back up he's gonna
drive everybody backwards so he just
says I want to unsink and now they can
back up right or you know explore look
wherever they want meanwhile the rest of
the class might be the rest of the class
might be continuing to move forward and
so when this one comes back and says I
want to resync with the class then it
comes back to where everybody else is
right so it's actually pretty cool and
I'm pursuing wave but the reason it's
interesting in this context is that's
the only part of the plan that's the
only part of implemented but the second
part of the plan is to have another set
of gadgets underneath which are your
activity gadgets right and the activity
gadgets might be sort of teaching
gadgets such as like a vocabulary list
for this page or maybe a specialized
discussion or maybe a game maybe there's
a word find or maybe this is in the
context of a linguistics class and so
you want to maybe take a translation
class and so you're teaching translation
and let the kids do those translation
activities right right integrated into
the reading activity and so you know
teachers are looking for all kinds of
interesting activities and we have we
actually have people that are using ICT
l in classrooms around the world for all
of the kinds of things some for
translating so we've had this teacher in
Romania that has decided to start using
her kit use the ICD L to teach their
kids English by letting them translate
the books into English they split the
class into half have one half translated
the other half check in the other one
all right do that in two different books
but so they could she could use this
kind of tool within her context but even
more interesting teachers also always
love to have
cultural penpal a kind of collaborations
so let's build tools where we have
monolingual kids across the world
participate in the reading and
communicating and translating these
books and you know I the reason I want
to go through this depth to think about
this example is I know when I first
started thinking about this project I
said well okay this is all a theoretical
construct but you're never going to get
the hundreds of thousands of
participants who need to scale us up and
I agree it's a major challenge but I
also think that it is totally possible
if we do creative ways of integrating
these tasks and to things that people
are doing in education is a huge one and
if you look at sites like
like milk like milk I drink mocha so
like mochi is a language learning site
and they claim to have I think like 3
million participants for people to help
each other study language right let's
build tools like this to get those folks
to help us translate whatever it is
everyone translated ok so so to end just
have one last little thought experiment
which is if we think about distributed
human computation as being thinking
about ways to get humans and computers
to collaborate I would argue that almost
every single example that I've seen all
put humans in one lump but the
interesting one of the interesting
things about what we've done with this
mono translation is we've split the
humans into two lumps each with very
different skill sets and use the compute
the computer as a way to mediate those
skills and take advantage of them where
they wouldn't be able to participate by
themselves and this now just you know
like just makes the question of where
else can we take advantage of human
skills by recognizing that there's
different skills that can be harnessed
more effectively if we're even extra
more creative and that'll stop so thanks
very much
one of the things translating any kind
of story would be important to put the
tone of a paragraph for example maybe
Cinderella story where it's all like
happy or it can make it really dark is
there a way of the putting that in here
do you think that would make
translations support effect one of the
things I came up a lot while we started
as we started thinking about this
project is as you all know translating
is is an art right you can have the same
book that's been published at rent you
know translated get re translated
because somebody felt like it was a
perfectly fluent and accurate
translation but essentially without the
tone or the effect that I wanted it
wasn't so that's a really tough question
is how do you use we want to think about
integrating the richness of human
languages certainly including humans is
the way to do it
so that's it's real answers of course we
haven't thought about that at all but
maybe you could envision having
different paths so once you've gone down
with a translation you could then go
down just like they're sort of these new
wiki translations you could have
something where you could say explicitly
we're trying to translate this with a
certain with a certain vision a more
poetic vision there's something else
maybe you wants to keep the poetic style
or maybe you want to change the style or
maybe it has a political connotation
what you want to keep or avoid
so it sort of implies that you might
want to have some metadata in your
overall direction of what you're trying
to accomplish with that translation then
of course getting your participants to
agree and follow that is an additional
challenge so it's a really good question
but it's so hard I
for the children's book translation did
you also look at what's the quality of
the story then afterwards it because I
guess looking at fluency and adequacy is
one thing but just that story would you
really want to show that story then in
Turkish to children and is it is it
understandable over all right so we did
this study on Thursday I think that's
Monday's work no of course you're
absolutely right as crucial I think
again weird this is as I said this is
really the beginning of this project and
we're just not there yet I don't I do
not know and I fully suspect that the
way that we've set up this interface the
translations really even though you can
see those sentences that largely were
done sentence by sentence and so you're
likely to get some discontinuity and I
think one of the things we have to do is
we do have that overall page but I'm not
I don't think my feelings we're not
currently using the interface well to
support translation of this story and
there's a real trade-off in balancing
this translation of a story versus
turning these into small digestible
tasks so I guess the individual
sentences are not correctly translated
they would all all be rated rated not
really adequate or so but the story that
comes out by someone that just polishes
it then afterwards and makes it fit to
the picture might be a perfect children
story with slightly different events and
so I think we kind of just like we did
these I think we got to do those kinds
of experiments on old stories and then
there'll be quality of stories and then
there's going to be I guess accuracy
maybe there's a third one which is the
story quality which is totally separate
as for saying the accuracy compared to
you could also imagine the exact
opposite where this each individual
sentence is translated very literally so
it's very accurate but the story itself
is not particularly
in that direction
it's like translate is something with
the big bad wolf to Swahili wolf makes
sense so that happens all the time when
you have like that's the nature of this
sort of artistic characteristic of
translations where we even name
sometimes you will translate the name
and if there's a if there's a culturally
appropriate name one into John or
something right and other times they'll
want to keep that name how do you decide
whether to do that that's really all
that a creative decision
yeah poetry well I mean children's books
already are harder than wiki pages so I
mean because there is some that uh you
know poetry just in this style of that's
right actually we picked a particularly
hard book that blue sky actually I
highly recommend you reading it it's a
beautiful beautiful book about sad book
is physically beautiful obviously you
can get into more and more sources some
of you will join me for lunch to think
about how we should pursue this and how
it especially with them
I tried Picasso's
new face recognition
so have you continued chatting during
lunch</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
