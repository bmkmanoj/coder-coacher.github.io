too far away which is in Marina del Rey
today with me we have three graduate
student Mike Rubenstein and hair is true
and Jacob Everest and we all work
together in the same lab called the
polymorphic robotics lab so what I
wanted to entertain you during the lunch
time is something we've been doing from
many years I think it's now nine years
called self reconfigurable robots and
the software we the control software we
write to control such robots you can
summarize that by we caught a digital
hormones I tell you what it is okay so
on it first of all I want to dedicate
this talk I've been giving this talk of
many places to my advisor prefers
professor Herbert Simon I don't know how
many when of you know about him he's a
Nobel Prize winner for economics and
he's also the funding fighter or father
for artificial intelligence and he
passed unfortunately he passed away in
201 so he has been married a visor
things 83 289 and I learned tremendous
amount from him and he's basically the
model of my not only the scientific
research but also life in general okay
so what I wanted to tell you today we
have 50 minutes right supposedly n + 1
o'clock we can go do it over so because
we started ten minutes late so I'm
trying to make it in one hour then so
will tell you a little bit who we are
what do we do and then I tell you what
is exactly self reconfigurable robots
why is it interesting and then the
approach we take to build such
interesting robots and possibly if we
have time tell you a little bit about
applications and implications of such
system
first who we are okay we call ourself
polymorphic robotics lab meaning robots
that can become many different shape
moving shape ok and fact we have two
faculty members to computer scientists
and five PhD students and two masters at
the moment so the three guys sets here
then there are PhD students here our lab
the mission of our lab is to to build
self reconfigurable systems such systems
can be robots which we can talk about
today it can be also software system
agents and and even mechanical
structures or other structures and even
human organization and biological
organisms there are lots of phenomenas
about self reconfiguration in the nature
so we are trying to capture on to
research in this in this broad area in
the past we have done some interesting
stuff one of them if you see there's a
picture here the middle guy is a robot
we called you da that does indoor
navigation in 1996 showed up in Ellen
outers Scientific American frontier for
by winning the second place
international competition of robotics
this is a medium-sized one at the soccer
robot the autonomous systems that play
suckers against each other so in 1997
our team we call ourselves dream team
win the World Championship in Japan in
the garage of hand and I'm going to show
you a short movie of that and then these
little guys are the reconfigurable
modules early version and then we have a
bigger one and that's the one that you
see on the table
so first the soccer robot do we have a
phone oh okay I figure Google should
have everything here
yeah but that's one yeah thanks
yeah great
that's okay
oh I could play again
okay those are now robots by the way CNN
did this because after we in the world
champion that year we have eight
graduate students and five robots of
these five robots they all have cameras
all the decision making things and the
field is about about half of this size
of this room eight meters by five meters
and they're green go the two goals are
colored when yellow the other green the
floor is green and the war is wide and
the boys red so this robot you turn on
the power blow a whistle and they start
hitting each other and that year we
scored nine goals out of 12 goals of in
higher tournament unfortunately the to
go one of the nine days tools it 9 goes
against ourselves so you can see their
problems okay alright so that's 90 97 so
then after that we started working on
the self reconfigure robots so what do I
mean by self reconfigure robots these
are the robots that are eventually we're
able to change their shape and size by
themselves depends on the environment
the task you want them to do so you can
imagine such a robot sees a pipe or a
very narrow space and they can become a
snake go through it afterwards if they
need to climb stairs or obstacles or
slope they can grow legs I mean literary
grow legs and I use the terrains down
here they can simply become a ball and
roll and sometimes we joke with our
friends we're trying to build a baby
version of the t1000 robots in terminate
too okay of course we don't have the
liquid metal or we have the small
modules you see here they should be able
to look for each other and can
next to each other performing different
shape and the possible applications
could be space military application
under water and many other possibilities
so one possible application is for space
because right now NASA is building a lot
of robots for different purposes and you
gotta have a lover and you have and
robots that specially designed to climb
some very steep slope and you have this
arm stick on the moving things around
but even though they are successful in
the past we don't want it to continually
build too many special robots because
there's so many things to do up there on
the moon on the mass if you have too
many of them it would be too expensive
to ship them there so the goal here is
to build one robots with lots of modules
and ship them there and they can change
say today you want them dig the forming
a digging machine tomorrow you want them
to explore and then they all separate
and spread out in the area to certain
things and the day after you maybe you
want to do some construction so you
change it that's the deal so there's a
word key word there is retasking and
reusing because the modules you can use
them for different purpose recovering if
you encounter some unexpected failures
these robots can recover for example if
you step into some crack and you your
leg stuck there right normally if you if
you're no more robots you're going to
stuck there forever and this guy can
literally cut his leg and keep going
okay and also last one is reducing the
cost so because you can you can use the
same module to do many different purpose
so this super bot project is something
we call
modular multifunctional and self
reconfigurable and just in the last two
weeks the movies you about to see here
has been pop up in many many places on
the internet so you now you can type
super bots on google and you get a lot
of hits for that so it's something that
we will we're very happy about and it
was surprise to us too so here is a
picture of that vision for space you see
that on the left hand side there is a
robot trying to climb really steep slope
and there is a rover on the moon and
there is something fly inside Space
Shuttle and you can take one of this
module for the little jet there and then
they can fly in the microgravity
environment and also you can put this
all together with a long chain and then
they can acting like a long arm and you
can also put them into a human figure to
be a astronauts look and to do assist in
the astronauts our original goal this is
superb our project was started in 2004
sponsored by NASA the original goal is
to be able to build 100 of these modules
pack them into a very tight
configuration like you see on the left
side the cartoon there and I have you
fly over a desert and dropped this
package on the desert and then they wake
up and then they reconfigure into a
rolling track find a send you nearby and
roll to the send you at the bottom of
the send you it will reconfigure to
become a leg the position configuration
and climb the send it winds down this on
top of the send you and they will
reconfigure into a little structure you
see there to protect a group of seeds
with little water and soil inside and
sits there for a week or two until the
seeds sprout into
into some little plants that's our
original goal and there was how Super
Bowl started and NASA at that time will
say they will give us 28 million dollars
just do this now we cut the budget so we
suffer and now we're only building 20
modules not going to the desert so but I
thought it's interesting to to show you
the original implication so up to now we
have completed 20 modules we have done a
lot of multifunctional demos you will
see the movies i'm going to show you and
we have did some limited version of self
reconfiguration so so i'm going to show
you some of those little by little and
then please if you have a question while
you're not eating you can ask me and
okay so this is at the 20 modules all
together when fresh out of press and all
assembled so we took a picture before we
we we kind of a contaminate them all
dirty make them dirty so inside each
module this one for example it has three
degrees of freedom so you can do this is
a pitch you're never I never remember
which one's pitch which when you and
your the middle one you can roll the
middle rotation right now allows you
continue row but we can only control it
for like 270 degrees controlled movement
and the both of these side can be plus
minus 90 degree these modules also have
six connectors in a sense there's one
connecting there in the middle if you
later on you want to see in the middle
you have front connect back connector up
down left right so other modules can
talk
and connect forming different shape it
has two little micro controllers at
Omega 128 and runs the sea program a lot
of a lot of you are interested in your
other software here we are running a
small real-time operating system called
avrx and you'd be able to program real
time tasks multi threats and you can
have one task control motor one and the
other tasks can show the communication
each of the connectors have infrared
communications allow them to talk to
each other and also allow them to see
each other winning in some distance so
may all the six connectors all have this
capability so you can talk to six
neighbors up to six neighbors if you
want and also have internal sensors it
can sense a orientation that has 3d
accelerometers inside and also have
current sensor voltage sensor other
sensors in it okay so let me show you
some of the movies first first of all I
want to show you the movement of a
single module then I will show you the
movement of a different configuration
then i'll show you how do they
reconfigure okay so just step by step
with many movies so one module in some
sense it's already a complete robots
because they can move forward backward
left right upside down or any way you
want okay and they have their own
batteries and control and everything
sensor actuators and controls oh there
some gates are funny for example you can
even have these genetically algorithm
discovered a what we call a junking
movement and that looks like someone had
had too much drink and that was Jacob
kicking it yeah
so that just shows that single module
you can have programmed to do a lot of
different activities they also we use
onboard batteries oops sorry I didn't
realize that has a sound so that's just
a movie shows we one time we did it have
the modules running back and forth on
the hallway for about 700 meters on
battery and we're using ipod batteries
here for ipod batteries last about
little bit of more than two hours i'll
say and less than three probably okay
and i mentioned early you can have
sensors so in this case this is mike
trying to drink some coke you put a cup
on top of this module and they wrote a
program no matter how you tilted the
base and never spill that's great for
waiters when you deliver food in
restaurant but it's terrible when you're
trying to drink it because the cup
doesn't doesn't tilt so he has another
movie show that you when you're trying
to drink it is really difficult but this
is an example of feedback control in
single module okay and they also can
synchronize and they can collaborate
when you are if you let them communicate
to each other in this case four modules
are doing what we call synchronized
swimming just uh just have them doing
the same thing we might have a better
movie in the future and to show that
okay now those are the single modules
right imagine you connect them together
what kind of a configuration you can you
can come up with it basically in
principle it's endless you can first of
all you can chain them together with a
long snake if you like all you can have
them grow legs on the side
you can have a center p put as many as
legs you want and you can have trees
arbitrary trees okay and you can have
loops by connecting them into a loop and
then on top of the loop on the side of
the loop you can have legs if you wanted
to make a say octopus you make a loop in
the middle you get eight legs on the
side and you get an uptick octopus so
this is a picture that you see there
different configurations and the front
is a foreleg creature and then there is
a tool to kind of a branching thing and
then there's a snake with for module and
five module and there's the three
modules i standing up ok now if i
manually configure all this different
configuration you take one and say are
today I wanted to program a six legs you
basically grab maybe nine of these
modules connect right and then you load
your program each module we are running
the same program and then they will and
you have the remote control here and you
turn it on and they will move let me
just do it for you so this is a remote
control it has a little radio inside if
I turn them off after six seconds they
will wake up and doing different things
so this one will do a little ketchup row
one those two are communicating to each
other and then doing a synchronized
pettyfer oh ok then I can turn off the
motor and they stopped and I turn on the
motor they continue and I can turn off
the power
so later on if you want you can play a
little bit not too much so you see okay
this is our the longer one case is a
longer caterpillar this is a stronger
caterpillar with a larger wave this is
something that we did at the marina del
rey beach we get tired inside indoor
programming so we go out so maybe you
can think of a google think of something
then you go walk on beach I'll be nice
when people come in a says because I
showed these on the east coast and a
cold place they say wow you must spend a
lot of time on the beach yeah so you see
that it makes interesting footprints
along the way Mike also experienced when
he was doing this on the beach seagulls
come and they were curious about what is
this and it can they eat it so it was
funny that's the sound of the beach so
and also the wind so the black skiing is
actually to prevent the sand to get get
into the module okay and it's a very
high-tech thing it's actually just
ladies socks we put it on okay then
there are other local motions for chain
configuration or that if you have a tea
configuration you have a two legs in the
front with the tail I'll show you the
one thing about the chain is you can
move side away and also you can move
like a butterfly this is the key
configuration basically two legs in the
front with the little tail looks like a
scorpion and if you have a longer tail
tail can certainly stand up trying to do
something to you one thing we talked
about we never did it this can be used
by is a law enforcement if wanted to to
arrest some bad guys you let this robots
quickly the robot will surround your
body and tied it up and you kind of a
under the rest so what it and they can
also climb as i mentioned to climb steep
slope this is an indoor may be close to
45 degree angle and i'll cop it because
the center of gravity is so low and they
can climb really steep slope we also did
it in the LA what's the name of that
Creek I goes it ah flow okay florent
creek or whatever these are the LA River
sometimes they dry up there's a bank
it's about 45 degrees so we will put our
a robot there and have a client
all these are because we have a part of
the agreement with NASA we have to
demonstrate these modules be able to run
on battery for one kilometer able to
crack climb really steep slope and even
send dunes so we're working on that this
is a sand dune climb again it's on the
beach it's not too successful because
the leg would dig into the sand so it
doesn't move the body too much so we are
thinking all sorts of ways to improve it
so eventually can climb a send you
there's one nice sending park in mahadin
beach park I don't know if you know
about that place and eventually we're
going to able to climb that send you
there this is also using a caterpillar
trying to climb the send you and again
because the weight the weight and the
scent softness it doesn't make too much
progress okay and for faster movement
rolling track is an interesting one so
in this movie is a six module configure
into a loop stand up and low
it Harris is in charge of that and
they're working hard to make it better
to make it a smoother and run faster in
the future we should be taking these to
a maybe a running filled with 400 meters
have them run two and a half circles and
then we deliver what we promise to NASA
so interesting part of the rolling track
is they should be able to stand up if
the incase they fall down you look
carefully how it stands up and then then
they can turn along the way there's
another way to send up
let me keep going okay and also in order
to able to control their moving
direction you can put a to loading track
together okay for some reason i can only
click once
hmm
I don't know yeah let me see that later
this is another interesting behavior you
can have a rope between two buildings
and this robot be able to climb from one
end to the other okay Jacob has been
working on this too so this is a movie
that we did on the roof of our parking
lot you see that they have a little
grabbers right now just the two tubes
then they can twist hold on it and move
the other leg and let it go and twist
the other one let it go like this and
we're hoping that by having the Rope
vertical it can able to it will be able
to climb up to climb a building or go
down to do some other that's the traffic
you hear on the Lincoln Avenue ok for
tree-shaped robots you can certainly
have something like a human legs not
quite human leg our leg band this way
this leg band side away but the it's a
tough to have it a balance and then
moving along and you can have more leg
this is a six leg six leg the robot and
then move a little bit of similar to
that Star Trek not Star Trek Star War
things and it a big guy big robots okay
and I also mentioned they have internal
sensors you already see this movie and
these two movie shows that they will
able to stand up by themselves each
module can lift is powerful enough to
lift the other two modules if you have
them straight however it's not strong
enough to lift three four five
so in order to stand up with four or
five modules without falling down they
have to constantly use the center of
gravity information to allow them to
move in a funny way to stand up that's
the two movie shows that you can also
have an arbitrary tree with one root so
like you're standing on one leg every
module is reporting to each other the
center of gravity information and then
they compute where's the global center
of gravity and then be able to move and
standing on that one leg so these are
useful for future when you work on a
very tough terrain and be able to stand
on one leg and move in a certain way you
see they are very careful because it's
not easy to have them stand on one side
so if I put them like these if I don't
touch them it will fall down easily
because right now is they're not they're
not apply force they just but this is ok
but if you touch it it'll fall down ok
they can also do other interesting thing
like bury themselves into a pie of
peanuts for their packing packaging and
go through a rubble and then into a pipe
and then after the pipe climbing a
little slope we try that very thing on
the beach a dig and dig and didn't go
too deep because when you're coming this
way the sand is coming back so we have
to think more okay and then we also want
them to walk on soft objects this is a
gate that designed to be able to roll on
a net so it needs little help by
providing a little grippers
at the end of the thing so right now we
just use a little help and you will see
the kind of a one side at all the other
side law and the middle low keep loading
on the net and you can apply the same
gate on the net with a little help
by the way people download this movie
and someone even add on music really
nice music and synchronize all this
movement I don't know how to do that so
that just to give you a flavor how
eventually we'll be able to move on the
net and also carry sensors one
interesting feature of this robots is
suppose you have some special tools and
you wanted to be able to to have the
robot scary as long as that too has a
standard connector you can connect to it
so we have a pot that has a little
camera and a wireless communication you
can connect to them and then they will
talk to this module through the infrared
and they become a part of the robots
suppose you have a screwdriver or a
glove whatever and you can put it on
with the standard connector then it has
a special module then you can do things
with it so that is a that climbing
configuration you saw earlier and with
the pot at the back of the robots and
this is where this is what the robot
sees when they move and you can send the
command to the robots every turn left
and right in other words you can leave
the robot somewhere else and you're
sitting in this room and you see what
the robot seeing you can control it kind
of remote control thing
and you see Jacob sits there let's think
that's Mike right now you said Jacob sit
on sofa that two leg is who who's to leg
way yeah okay you can see sometimes we
abuse them
okay so
carrying a payload is also a challenge
task because this robot has a lot of
module lots of motors by itself one of
the challenges people always ask us is
how much weight can you carry so we
figure out a one possibility that can
carry a lot of weight so this is a way
you have put their payloads into a long
long thing cylinder maybe and use put on
the Super Bowl modules along that
cylinder and have them roll like that
and you see here
right now this configuration they're all
superval module in it but you can have
the cylinders in middle with the Palos
and then you connect the modules on the
side as many as you want and have them
low so that way they can at least we
hope to carry their own a weight that is
equivalent to their body weight
I cannot imagine what it is look like I
mean there's no creature that these
things
okay so and you can also use it as a
conveyor conveyor belt by transfer dirt
from one side to the other this we have
done it by a hand we're going to program
this and have them you know moving dirt
from one side to the other or some other
objects from one side to the other this
is just a demonstration that is possible
and you can easily program and to do
such a thing now the stuff I showed you
so far is what we call multifunctional
based on whatever configuration you gave
them and each configuration can do
different things and you know it can be
easily to do many tasks now the question
is how do they reconfigure here is a one
simulation configure from one long chain
to become a foreleg robots
they have to talk d duck Duck Duck and
do this kind of thing and you have to
plan them what is the best way to do
such thing you have an initial
configuration you have a target
configuration what are the minimum
number of actions you take to allow them
to change from one shape to the other ok
that's a simulation now in reality first
of all you have to find your buddies
right say you wanted to become a bigger
body and two guys wants to come together
they have should be able to find so
first of all you have they have to
search they use the infrared looking for
bodies for example this is a way one way
to to be able look around and two guys
together can use those gate one guy is
looking the other one is standing just
emitting the infrared signal say I'm
here I'm here come the other guy comes
towards you ok and then also if the if
you don't know who they are where they
are and you have to do a little search
so this movie shows when robots have to
module has two modules are turning
around sending signals trying to say is
anybody there is anybody there ok and if
someone received that signal you should
be able to reply says yes I'm here so
then it will go
you see it receive a signal say and then
adjust the direction and then move
towards it
I read somewhere on the internet there's
one guy specifically like this movie
saying they feel sympathetic for this
little guy trying to connect with their
buddies there oz there's still have a
lots of open questions for example the
connector right now we have on the
module is a manual connector you
requires humans to look at them and dog
and have a screw and the new version of
the connector coming soon you will be
automatic okay so first step to
reconfiguration is to be able to find
each other and coming and do things
together also when you have a bigger
robots if you wanted to separate them
cut that leg off cut the head off or
whatever can they still survive that's a
question so we call them as a relentless
Oh resilient to super shape changes in
this robots we deliberately cut the body
in half and the front part says boy I
used to have someone behind me but not
anymore it looks as the lone current
body says I only have two legs therefore
I should do a butterfly so it moves like
a butterfly now the later part also
wakes up when time out when is waiting
for the messages we return and look at
says huh I used to have someone someone
in front of me but not anymore my
current body has two legs therefore I do
a butterfly now you can put them back
again you can even swamp the upper body
with the lower body and they will stop
again says look our body change it again
what is the best way to move and then
you will switch back to the fore leg
movement so we often tell our kids don't
do that at home to yourself don't cut it
basically in this robots you can
literally
the head off and then is still able to
do things they will not die so another
illustration is it depends on how things
are connected they will do different
behaviors you saw it on the left hand
side in this movie we're trying to show
when the two modules are connected like
these okay then doing a butterfly when
is the time we make that movie we
haven't got a radio control than two
hours manually
take them apart
and then we'll go back to the original
individually figure this one this little
demonstration shows the margin I pulled
it on but at the same time they are ya
this elaborate come on himself it
so they're even more striking
capabilities say this is the early
version of a smaller module you can
start with a three small robots
dynamically connect them then we become
a single one this is starting with a
sidewinder if you take a piece from the
body connected to the side that peace
will become a leg immediately and then
you keep doing take a piece from the
body for another leg another language
sure there are four legs and now the
woman so this something we call the
light soldier then then you don't need
to shut them down
we arranged the body part we want
now you can pour like
the reason they will become an egg
because everybody is constantly
detecting how they connect to their
neighbors so therefore improve where
they are in the body it depends on for
location in the body they will decide
now in addition to use hand to configure
them they can also autonomously
configured by themselves in this case
and the top movie shows two modules
connect align and then in coming
together and this is an early version /
connector they will connect and become
one this movie shows that tail comes
over connects to the middle and
disconnect the loop and become a t-shape
and moving around this is a so-called we
caught a self reconfiguration so we are
still working on the bigger ones and
doing the same and capability okay now a
little bit technical this is only maybe
five to ten minutes i will show you a
glimpse of what it is inside the
software so naturally you for this kind
of a system you have to consider three
big areas mechanic systems how the
things are connected electronics and
then the distributor control okay for
you guys may be the distributor control
is a little more interesting because we
we said it could do shape dependent
behavior and body parts can reshuffling
reconfigure and also there is a not only
the change shape they can do mo more
where our movement and possibility in
the future manipulation so from software
control point of view here are the list
of challenges that you have to address
before you can write a good program for
these robots first of all I mentioned
there is no fixed bring module for this
robot
you can cut the head off and somewhere
else we'll take it over furthermore
there's no even global unique identifier
this is something very unique about
these robots and even you look at any PC
or any system you open it up every
components got to have the ID internet
everybody has to have an IP address
however in biological system the little
cells they come and go they they die
whatever I don't think they have name
yet they always come together managed to
do things great together that's why we
were pushing ourselves didn't even gave
them names no name furthermore task
negotiation means if one module says I
want to move forward the other says no I
want to move backwards what are going to
do so they have to negotiate among
themselves to settle down a reasonable
task behavior selection i mentioned is
every module needs to decide what to do
not only based on who they are but based
on where they are in the body that's
called a behavior selection and you can
also dynamic you can think of these
little guys with a lot of little
computers connect to each other forming
a small network or internet however the
topology of internet changes every time
you reconfigure the robots so it's a
dynamic topology you have to deal with
asynchronous means every module have
their own little clock but there is no
global clock so my watch could be like
12 55 and that watch is 12 56 and y'all
watch it could be 1252 yet when they
connect together they have to
synchronize in order to produce a
desired global behavior scalability and
you really don't know beforehand what
kind of shape
sighs this robot will eventually become
too in a certain environment so whatever
software you're right has to be able to
flat to be able to be flexible enough to
deal with many different shape and size
okay now of course eventually we want
them we don't have yet have themselves
decide what kind of shape to become too
for example suppose I want to grab that
drink right now because I'm a human I
have to walk around and then get it
right if I am a robot like them I can
take my left arm off connect to my right
arm and trying to reach it if it's not
enough I take my leg and put another one
and then we'll grab that so things like
these it's a very challenged and you can
imagine and what kind of job is it needs
to be done so people have been working
on these in a different area if you
imagine different area we have a
different solution but we're looking for
one solutions allow them to handle many
cases so this is something we call
finally we're now touch talking about
digital homo and home only inspire the
control this is idea borrowed from the
biological system imagine a system or a
biological system like myself if someone
scare me from behind there's a chemicals
flooded in my blood and causing
different body parts to do different
reaction so in this case a hormone
English system is nothing but a
content-based message it has no identify
no address it's just floating inside and
it has a lifetime and the key party is
this message will trigger different
actions at a different place really
depends on who you are so you have a
worm message flooding into your system
the legs will decide to jump your mouse
we decide to open your eyes will pop
they're all one signal okay and there
different from broadcasting because
along the way of propagating things get
changed there's no guarantee that
everybody get the same copy and there is
no external deposit like a firm own I
know I don't know if you're familiar
with multi-agent control some people use
formal trying to mimic the ends when the
ends go out searching for food they
deposit something along the way so the
other ends can follow in this case
everything is internal eventually we
wanted to be able to use this not only
program them but also dynamically change
their behavior on the fly we haven't
done that yet ok so then five minutes i
will show you some quick examples and
you can imagine how things that
communicate connected this ID a one
module to module 4 module and six module
each module inside they have a
orientation from the back left and right
and everybody is running the same
program and they depends on where they
are to decide the actions and you can
see use them for many different purpose
such as communication locomotion and
reconfiguration etc so i can give you
example of how this thing works a you
have six modules want to move in a
caterpillar and the easy way or
centralized way is to send a message to
every one of them and say now go to it
but if you use this approach you can
send one message to your neighbor just
say here's what i'm doing and you decide
what you do and then this message you
propagate everybody select their action
they start doing things by the time the
message goes to the very end that guy
says I don't have any neighbors anymore
so because the topology is different it
decides to send an synchronization
message back the synchronization message
when you receive such thing you look at
your own action see if you finish it or
not
if you haven't finished you hold on that
message until you finish and you
propagate so by the time this signal
backs to the first guy the guy says okay
everybody has done their job it's time
for another way something like that so
why bother to do this thing one other
advantage is you can cut the robots in
half using either change the program it
will work at the same way furthermore
you don't care how long the snake is ok
so these kind of things are interesting
and this is another example how things
are changing from one for leg the
creature to a snake what it does is the
tail comes over to connect one of the
foot then disconnect from the hip so a
leg become part of your tail then this
new tail come over connects to another
foot and disconnect the hip and become a
longer tail and you keep doing this
until there's no more leg left then you
become a snake ok and this is something
that you can do it distributed late
without any centralized to control I
will not have time to to tell you the
details and you can use this approach
for many other purposes of distributor
control other things you need to do and
I will skip this application wise you
have you can apply this principle to
real biological system if you're
interested in i'll tell you more about
that and also swarm of robots assembly
in space and underwater robots and also
self healing system so if you have a
system something goes wrong you can
literally take a human body cut it in
half not human body somebody's body and
then these two half will become a tool
little human what cause human cannot do
that but some creatures can do that and
we're working on it can you imagine that
would be good so let me conclude so it's
15 past one so it's ok
cell-free configuration is a very
fundamental research topic and we we
always say it's a code mind you keep
digging a lot of things come out and
they have also have many possible
applications for example search and
rescue when the building collapse and
you want to send a robot to be able to
change and go anywhere they want to and
fix the shape robots might not be able
to do that human Homeland Security and
the self-assembly in space smart
structures many other possibilities so
finally I wanted to to appreciate your
attention here's a little robot
alright so thank you very much that's it
yeah so by the way all the movies are
actually add the website show up at the
website
it's WWI site edu slash robots all you
just type a super bot in google and you
find it thank you very much yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
