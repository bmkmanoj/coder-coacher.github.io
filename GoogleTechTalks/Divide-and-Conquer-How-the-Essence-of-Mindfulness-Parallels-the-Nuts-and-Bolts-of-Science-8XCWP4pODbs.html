and those on YouTube my name is Ming and
welcome to another perfect day in
paradise
I'm delighted today to introduce
renowned meditation teacher
Sinjin yang I've been a huge fan of
Sinjin since discovering is classic
audio publication the science of
enlightenment which was edited by by the
guy over there Michael
Sinjin was able to give very clear
rational and understandable explanations
of meditation and enlightenment and I
think he handed the topic of
enlightenment better than anybody else I
know the science of enlightenment
remains one of my favorite audio books
of all time and I think I think he's I
think you just an amazing teacher thank
you another thing that impressed me
about Sinjin is that he he is learning
in all three major traditions of
Buddhism and he is one of very few
people I know who can expertly navigate
different schools of Buddhist
philosophies and practices and distill
the best of them and finally he is
comfortable with modern science and like
myself he wants to integrate meditation
and science in a way that is useful to
real people in in the real world and
after the talk today since then we'll
need meditation session downstairs and
this feel free to follow us after that
and with that please give a warm welcome
to sins and Jung
so my name is shenzhen Shi n zem and
that's not the name I was born with but
it's the name that I've had ever since
1970 Buddhist monk so that's how I got
the the Japanese Buddhist name for those
of you that read Chinese characters I'm
here at Google so I can actually do
something like this and have probably a
fourth of the audience be able to read
it it would be John Sean in Mandarin
pronunciation those are the two
characters but in sino-japanese is read
shins em so that's my name and my
favorite thing in the world is to do
what I am now doing which is to talk
about meditation to people that are
interested in this particularly to talk
to people that have a technical type or
science type background who would tend
to think in those terms about the world
because that's very much the way I think
and as Meng mentioned I'd like to sort
of bring together what I consider to be
the best of the East and the best of the
West the best of the East I see as the
internal science and internal technology
of systematic meditation the best of the
West is the combination of mathematics
and empirical observation and reasoning
that we call the scientific method and
oh good thirty years ago it occurred to
me if we look at the history of science
very often major breakthroughs occur
when two existing branches of science
are suddenly seen as having a relation
ship and they're able to complement each
other it's been off of each other for
example the melding of algebraic
thinking and geometrical thinking that
was necessary with Cartesian coordinates
and so forth for the development of
calculus we had like geometry and
arithmetic algebra coming together
suddenly seeing a new relationship
between them branching off into a whole
new type of mathematics well it occurred
to me that at a broader scale if we took
all of human history the most impressive
peaks that I see are the peak of Western
science and the peak of Eastern internal
science what if these two could find a
natural connection what kind of stunning
and interesting new developments might
happen in human history broadly that
might benefit large numbers of human
beings those are the kinds of questions
that I've sort of devoted my life to so
that's my area of interest what I'd like
to do this afternoon is give you just a
brief overview of meditation broadly
through the world and then I narrow in
on one type of meditation which is
mindfulness practice which is what I'm
most interested in try to show you some
parallels between that and the way that
science works broadly and what that
might mean for our future and then open
it up for questions my favorite thing in
the world is to address your questions
about meditation about practice and so
forth so that's sort of the agenda I'm
going to try to squeeze that into a very
short period of time so let's imagine
that you were to decide that you wanted
to do meditation practice so you're
gonna do meditation and your teacher has
told you
I want you to spend a half hour each
morning focusing on the sensation of
your breath when you're at the tip of
your nose as it goes in and out here and
when your attention wanders which it
will just bring it back also I'm going
to your teachers giving you that
exercise you start to do that what is
going to be the first thing that you're
likely to notice as you attempt to do
this each morning what do you think oh
by the way I like to take questions I
also like to ask active learning what
what do you think is gonna be some of
the first things you're going to notice
as you're attempting to do this
seemingly simple exercise you're going
to notice that it's maybe simple in
instruction but not so simple to carry
out and why is that what's gonna happen
you focused on your breath and then a
second later what's gonna happen you're
somewhere else one place you might be is
what you just mentioned your own
internal talk distracts you from the
physical sensation of the breath what
else might distract you other kinds of
physical sensations are the sensation of
the breath will be neutral perhaps
Pleasant but you could have itches and
AIDS and pressures and pains on other
kinds of physical discomforts that might
distract you what else might distract
you from your breath
what other category of sensory
experience you could have external
sounds it would distribute so you could
have the internal sound of your own
self-talk you could have the external
sound of the world you could have
physical type sensations other than your
breath anything else might come up we're
assuming or what if your eyes are open
we don't assume that you have to have
your eyes closed to meditate if your
eyes are open external sites going to
distract you
if your eyes are closed that takes out
external sight but there's still a
couple more sensory categories that
could come up to distract you from the
breath well taste although we might
consider that to be a physical type
sensation on the body well do we only
think an internal talk might there be
another modality of thought mind's eye
we hear the world externally but we also
hear ourselves as self-talk we see the
world externally but we also see ourself
the world as mental pictures in fact we
store the imago Mundi the image of the
world and all the parts of the world in
a subliminal processing area that I call
image space the surface of image space
may activate giving us mental pictures
so we could be distracted by external
visual experience of the world or we
could be distracted by internal visual
experience of visual thinking let's call
that image activity so talk could
distract you image could distract you
now sensations in the body most of them
are just physical in origin but how
about when you're having an emotional
experience when you have an emotional
experience if it's intense if you were
to subtract image activity and talk
activity follow I'm saying if you if you
subtract visual thinking and auditory
thinking from your emotional experience
what will you be left with will the
emotional experience completely vanish
or is there a component that will be
present a sensory component absolutely
you get body sensations associated with
emotion
it seems to me that
body sensations that are associated with
emotion are the real juice that drives
human emotions so it seems to me we
should have a word in English that means
the body component of an emotional
experience but actually we don't have a
word that means precisely that we only
have that phrase the body component of
an emotional experience but let's just
for convenience sake so that we can have
some technical vocabulary to describe
our subjective world let's arbitrarily
agree to use the English word feel to
mean the body component of emotional
experience so this is a much more narrow
sense of the word feel ordinarily feel
was anything in your body as feel but
let's just let's just call that feet
let's use that for the emotional part
and let's call any physical sensation
touch wherever it may be
this gives us a try modal model for
consciousness we've got somatic
experience visual experience auditory
experience and some of those visual some
visual experiences related to thinking
some auditory experiences related to
thinking and some somatic experience is
the juice of our emotions so the the
feel and the image and the talk sort of
are a way of analyzing our subjective
world on the other hand our objective
world external sites external sounds and
physical type sensations in the body
this gives us a little clasificado a
system trimodal bilateral if we want to
think of two sides of experience a
subjective side and an objective side we
sort of got somatic visual auditory and
the somewhat more subjective side is
mental image is emotional is feel image
talk okay and then we've got the touch
sight sounds of the world so when in
giving you that
meditation exercise of okay I want you
to focus on the sensation of your breath
and when things distract you come back
we're giving you a special kind of touch
a particular physical sensation to focus
on and what happens is all this other
stuff comes up and it's going to
distract you
particularly you will discover that feel
image talk will distract you you're you
have you start running fantasies you
have mental pictures you have you have
the art the video you have the audio you
have the pleasant feel sensation in the
body of being entertained etc and you're
off into what neuroscientists call the
default attentional Network you're off
into memory plan fantasy problem-solving
that's the feel image talk system
proactively going on its own on the
other hand moment by moment that same
system reacts to the touches sights and
sounds of the world interestingly so all
these distractions come up and you
follow your teachers instruction each
time you're pulled into mental picture
internal talk physical or emotional
sensation external sound external sight
you gently bring your attention back to
your breath now what do you think will
happen if you keep doing this over and
over again over a period of a number of
years do you think that at some point
it's going to be easier to maintain a
focus on the breath yeah it will with
practice you've developed a skill set or
a kind of strength by systematic
practice now do you think that that
taste of high concentration that you
develop during formal practice on the
breath do you think that that can be
generalized that you would have to learn
concentration for every other sensory
situation or that the skill that you
developed with that one object would
immediately generalize and the same
flavors of concentrate
could come on and be applied to other
objects well I'll give you the answer
many of you are shaking your head it's
immediately generalizable so it wouldn't
matter if we asked you initially to
focus on an external sound or an
internal mantra talk or some
visualization or a pleasant emotion we
could ask you anything we could take any
sensory experience ask you to focus on
it give you the simple instruction
attention wanders bring it back
attention wanders bring it back after a
period of time you would initially you
would be very frustrated you would have
what I call a sobering insight the
sobering insight would realise you would
realize how distracted you really are
but that's actually good that's good
because most people will never realize
that and they'll have to live their
entire lives in a scattered state
because they don't realize that they're
scattered so anybody here like TS Eliot
the poet my favorite of all the favorite
poets okay he's got a great line in the
four quartets describing the situation
of most human beings
he says distracted from distraction by
distraction okay most people are so
distracted that they don't even realize
that they're living their lives 24/7
until the perhaps just a few hours
before they die and they have no choice
and they finally become focused most
people will be half alive and half dead
because they'll never experience a
moment of hikent of high focus in their
life however if you did a meditation
practice and it wouldn't matter what
practice you did could be TM it could be
Christian centering prayer it could be
Sufi Zickuhr it could be Buddhist
mindfulness or just sitting zazen
whatever if you did a practice
your attention wander egregiously for a
while and then if you kept up with it it
wouldn't wander as much and you'd start
to get a taste of a highly concentrated
state that highly concentrated taste
would grow in two orthogonal dimensions
one dimension is depth the other is
breath or wideness so what do I mean by
def depth the concentrated state would
become more and more and more
concentrated deeper and deeper and
deeper more and more intense it would
begin to affect your physiology in a
radical way measurable changes in your
brain waves in your galvanic skin
response all if you go to mind and
life.org that's probably your one shop
stopping for the science of meditation
my eyes the name of the organization is
mind and life.org if you want to see the
kind of research that backs up what I'm
saying but one direction of growth is
it's going to get more and more and more
powerful and you will discover that any
ordinary activity done in a highly
concentrated state has two
characteristics it's more fulfilling
subjectively and you perform better
objectively ok I just laid a bombshell
on you ok that was very innocent
sounding I said any human activity done
in a highly concentrated state is going
to have two characteristics it's going
to be subjectively more fulfilling and
it's going you're going to objectively
be performing better if it's a
performance type situation now since I
also said that the concentrated state
would become deeper and deeper and
deeper that the implication here is that
your fulfilment even in ordinary type
activities is going to become more and
more and more
and as time goes on and also your
objective ability to perform is going to
improve simply as a function of
concentration power alone this was
discovered by the positive psychology
people many decades ago at Chicago at
the University of Chicago you can look
at the research of a man named Mike
Csikszentmihalyi it has Hungarian
spelling help me out see see see see I K
s si si que se ENT mi h AI ll e I think
it's how to spell his name anyway
something like that what he showed
through very careful testing is that
there's an intrinsic reward in a high
concentrated state just the
concentration alone you may wonder a
house Zen monks can live in what seems
to be a very bleak environment or
Christian monks and nuns okay typical
tasks you do in a Christian monastery
for nuns maybe stamp out communion
wafers for monks repetitive physical
labor
well it looks sort of hellish okay it's
like the same boring thing day after day
after day maybe you're in silence it
seems like a very bleak environment yet
they're very joyous extremely happy
why because everything is being done in
a state of high concentration by the way
people raised in the West when I asked
this question almost no one knows the
answer to it which is sad what is the
what is the traditional word used in
Christianity for the state of high
concentration that develops in
meditation
it's a related concept but they have
actually a specific word its
recollection meaning not to remember but
to collect the attention back Raquelle
College Aryan Latin the traditional
generic term in Buddhism and Hinduism is
Samadhi in Hebrew it's called qivana
which means to direct your attention
there's a Jewish meditative tradition
called Kabbalah they talk about Karma in
Arabic it's called Zickuhr which
literally means to remember but has a
specific meaning within the Sufi Islamic
Moslem meditation of being highly
concentrated so in all of the major
religions of the world there is a
meditating core and in each one of those
traditions there's a technical generic
term for the state of high concentration
in bringing about the effects that I
just mentioned now you remember I said
it will grow it meaning that the taste
of concentration will grow in two
dimensions one is it's going to get
deeper and deeper and deeper and affect
your physiology eventually the second
dimension is it's going to get broader
and broader what does that mean well
when you first learn to meditate you'll
barely taste a little bit of
concentration during a period of formal
sitting and then at the end of the
period of formal sitting that will
dissipate but then as the years go on
you will notice that it comes on in
daily life
without you having to try a momentum
from the formal practice starts to carry
over that's the dimension the horizontal
spreading of the concentrated state
until a figure-ground reversal takes
place when you begin to meditate you
have your day and within and that's the
ground and within that upon that ground
there is a thing called meditation that
you do and then there's your day at some
point a figure-ground reversal takes
place there is the meditative state and
that's going on 24/7 even in your dreams
if you're a meditator in waking life you
continue to meditate automatically in
your dreams because you're the same
person you are in your dreams
so all your waking or REM sleep hours
all your waking and dreaming hours every
place that's not just unconscious with
dreamless sleep you're in a meditative
state so it's now seeping out into daily
life and life is starting to occur
within the recollected state within the
state of Samadhi now you now will never
be bored again I remember my whole goal
in life when I was a kid is I never want
to waste a minute so I wanted to study
24/7 but if you because I thought well
that I'm always using my time
productively but then you discover that
there's more to life than just reading
books but I still never wanted to waste
any time well it was like such a
revelation after a few years of
meditation practice in Asia when I
realized I'll never be bored again I'll
never waste a minute of my life again
because I'm either doing something
intrinsically productive or I am just
sitting around doing something that
would ordinarily be boring but I'm in a
meditative state and I'm honing my
meditation skills and I'm getting high
off of just being in the zone so it's
like your entire life changes because
you now have this this sort of secret
way of hate to use the term because
people are in recovery it sort of has a
bad connotation but
the secret way of being high all the
time but it's not it's not a drug high
it's it's a being relevant high because
concentration is defined as the ability
to attend to what you deem relevant at a
given instant so you might first learn
it with something fairly irrelevant like
just ok I'm gonna focus on breath or a
mantra sound or something but then as a
general skill it allows you to be have a
complete experience of whatever you are
experiencing in life so if I were to say
I've got good news I can add 50 years to
your life you give me 20 minutes every
morning and I'll add 50 years to your
life do the math it sounds like a good
deal right well I can't actually I don't
have a process that's going to add
that's going to increase your life
additively by putting years on it but
what I do have what is feasible is I
have a process which will multiply the
scale at which you live each moment of
ordinary life it will literally stretch
the scale because if you're twice as
concentrated in a sense you're living
twice as big and if that's on autopilot
you're not having to effort it in other
words you've elevated your base level of
concentration you've doubled it or
tripled it by formal practice now you're
gonna get to live your life two or three
times as big as you would have otherwise
so you even if you only live 50 years
you will live as big as a living a
hundred years roughly speaking and that
is feasible that is absolutely feasible
through training so these are some of
the stages that you would pass through
if you were to undertake a meditation
practice and continue with it at first a
lot of frustration you'd have that
sobering insight oh my god my
mention is wandering all the time it's
it's like the proverbial wild monkey
that's been stunned by a bee it's just
like all over the place but then with
time during formal practice you start to
taste the little concentration and then
you start to taste a lot of
concentration and it starts to
automatically suffuse into daily life
and it's just there for you you have
elevated your base level of
concentration two or threefold that by
base level we mean when you're not
trying how focused are you and so now
you're getting to live life two or three
times as big you you've got this edge
that the average person doesn't have
that helps you be more fully alive and
also more objectively effective so
that's pretty good but there are other
dimensions to the learning process in
meditation as your concentration is
growing you start to be able to detect
things that you would not have detected
otherwise your sensory clarity is
increasing and as a result of that
clarity you start to get epiphanies you
start to get aha experiences that you
wouldn't get otherwise you could
investigate yourself you could
introspect with a scattered mind and get
some surface psychological insights but
when you introspect or investigate your
experience with a highly focused mind
that is equivalent to looking with a
microscope
so usually self investigation is done
with the naked eye that means that the
person does not have high concentration
skills the results that come from that
kind of self investigation are okay but
they tend to be superficial and personal
and psychological if you do an internal
investigation
with a high state of concentration the
insights that you get may be personal
and psychological but you'll also begin
to get deeper insights as you know in
science we're interested in things that
are deep and broad we like generality
and we like depth so insights that a
person gets when they look into
themselves the more important ones are
deeper they're hidden they're not
evident on the surface you need a high
laser-like concentration to look in
order to detect them they're deeper and
they're also broader you get insights
that relate not just to you as a person
but to any person or for that matter you
get insights that relate to any sentient
being at all and they're highly
non-trivial insights what do I mean well
let me give you some examples so another
thing that's going to happen to you when
you first sit there and meditate you
know somebody already mentioned it in
addition to your attention wandering
you're going to start to get physical
discomfort now true or false every
single person listening to this talk
sooner or later is going to have to deal
with significant physical discomfort
unless there's some very weird quirk
that you die quickly right after this
talk and you never had to okay
sooner or later we're going to have to
deal with physical discomfort in this
life and is it highly likely okay we've
got what 20 some people in this room
what's the probability maybe more what's
the probability that within the next
year at least one of you is going to
have physical discomfort be these the
salient issue of your life for a while
I'd say yeah it could happen all you
have to do is leave this talk slip on a
banana peel out there at the refreshment
counter hit the wrong place
in your back and you know what the next
30 years will be dominated by one theme
and one theme only which is my pain
that's the sword of Damocles under which
all human beings live their lives unless
you know something unless you know from
your own experience that the experience
of physical discomfort and the
experience of suffering due to physical
discomfort are not the same experience
okay remember I said that as you look
within yourself you'll begin to see
things that you couldn't see otherwise
because a certain clarity component is
entering in in addition to the
concentration what you'll you know most
people that have done an
industrial-strength meditation practice
will have the following insight you'll
be sitting there your legs will be
killing you your back will be killing
you you've got all sorts of physical
distress and it just grows and grows and
grows at some point it's just utterly
unbearable but you just continue to sit
through it and then you notice the
discomfort is one thing
your body's resistance to the discomfort
is something else and when those two
come together there is the experience of
suffering and when there's only the
discomfort and your body doesn't fight
moment by moment its own product then
there's only pain without suffering now
I know that the the phrase pain without
suffering seems oxymoronic it seems to
be a contradiction in terms what what do
you mean as soon as I have pain I have
suffering no as soon as you have pain
you have resistance to that pain and
those two are mixed together you don't
distinguish them and you call that
suffering but a meditator can
distinguish the two and as soon as you
start to notice that the pain is one
thing and the resistance is something
that immediately sets up a Canarian
reconditioning of your subconscious
circuits the primitive levels of your
body which are probably down in the
spinal cord where the resistance starts
they unlearned their habit because they
make a correlation all when we fight
with ourselves
he/she suffers that I mean they can't
think those thoughts but if they could
those deep circuits that's what they'd
say oh we've got an insight so the body
gets trained out of the habit of
fighting with its own physical
discomfort that it creates and so you
have the empowering experience of
physical pain without suffering and you
realize that it's does it hurt yes is it
a problem now will that be important to
every person in this room at some point
well if you're in physical discomfort
and we can't relieve the the source of
it through weather medicine and we
cannot palliate the symptoms through
drugs then you have a choice of either
suffer or remember what I just told you
to put it in someone Frank turns and
suffering how how big can pain get how
long can pain get big enough and long
enough that the only joy in life is
thinking of suicide that's the human
reality that's how we're wired to know
that there's an alternative huge may not
seem so relevant right now this may even
seem morose and overdramatic
melodramatic but the fact is I hope
you'll remember this if you need it
someday oh that's physical pain what
about pleasure well it turns out that
there's a subtle resistance to pleasure
also a subtle kind of
friction or holding a moment-by-moment
micro fixation the same phenomenon of
viscosity within the flow of data in the
nervous system that same viscosity that
turns physical or for that matter
emotional uncomfortable touch or feel
turns it into suffering the same
viscosity that terms
it turns uncomfortable body sensations
into suffering prevents pleasant body
sensations from delivering the
fulfillment that is potentially there so
you discover you notice that oh there's
this subtle
visca I can only describe it
metaphorically it's something and now
it's in our sensory processing all of
our senses somatic visual and auditory
it is analogous to viscosity in a
hydrodynamic system or friction in a
mechanical system or perhaps impedance
in an electrical system I'm simply
making an analogy here I'm not saying
that it is these physical variables but
it's something like that and it causes
unpleasant sensations to turn into
suffering suffering equals pain
multiplied by resistance and fulfilment
equals pleasure divided by resistance so
as the resistance goes down the
fulfilment goes up there's something
like this going on in our sensory
circuits you notice it as you meditate
by noticing it it retrains it that means
that your body is now training itself
out of the habit of suffering due to
physical or emotional causes and your
body is training itself into the habit
of being more sensor
really fulfilled now the reciprocal of
this viscosity the name for that in
traditional Buddhist practice is
equanimity so you bring a quality called
equanimity to your experience and it
elevates your somatic fulfillment and
diminishes your sense of suffering in
the body so not only do you develop a
quality of high concentration but you
also develop a quality of equanimity and
that deepens with time and that spreads
with time until it's affected all of
your sensory experience and you find
that tiny pleasures are delivering huge
satisfaction and you're you find that
really huge pains can be experienced
with remarkably small sense of suffering
now you it's still uncomfortable so the
pleasure and pain still fulfill their
goal in nature to motivate and direct
your behavior but they no longer have
the power to drive and distort your
perceptions of behavior so you have the
best of both worlds so that not only is
your meditation going to develop an
extraordinary not only is it going to
elevate your base level of concentration
in daily life but it's also going to
elevate your base level of this other
quality this this fluidity or
conductivity or whatever you want to
call the reciprocal of the resistance is
going to grow we call it equanimity as
your equanimity grows your your nervous
system is not fighting with itself most
people don't realize but at a micro
level our information processing system
is constantly subtly fighting with
itself and in meditation you notice that
and as soon as you notice it that habit
starts to automatically train away so
you're going to elevate
tration you're gonna elevate your
equanimity and then I mentioned a third
variable which is sensory clarity so you
might think of the concentration as like
a tuner having the ability to lock on to
a certain channel instead of being like
you know constantly losing and you might
think of the sensory clarity as okay now
we're going to increase the baud rate
through this system system is your
senses though right
so now greater resolution higher
resolution screen and we're going to
diminish the impedance in this system so
the concept the combination of good
tuning qualities low internal resistance
so very efficient use of energy and not
heating up the wires so that you suffer
or dissipate energy unduly so we're
gonna like lower the impedance these are
metaphors right you understand I'm not
claiming these are the actual physical
variables but they seem to they seem to
behave this way so we're gonna lower the
impedance in your sensory circuits we're
gonna vastly raise the clarity which
will be the rate at which significant
data is being processed and we're gonna
give you good tuning quality so you can
lock and tune on to whatever you want as
the result of this not only are you
going to get insights into how to
experience discomfort without suffering
and how to experience pleasure with
fulfillment you're going to get an even
deeper insight remember I said that it's
like science we're interested in things
that are deep and also broad so here's
something that's very deep and very
broad which is you'll get an insight
into how the sense of your own personal
identity arises moment by moment an
actual paradigm that is describable in
words that allows you to see how your i
am-ness comes into existence moment by
moment
so that sounds pretty mystical shhhhh
mystical so let me see if I can make it
tangible to you you remember we talked
about image what did I use the word
image for I said it was visual thinking
right and I said talk we'll use the word
talk for auditory thinking and I said
we'd use the word feel for emotional
type body sensations so let's say that
you are listening to music anybody here
like music okay I think most people like
music so you're gonna listen to music
and I'm going to give you the following
exercise I'm going to give you the
exercise to monitor the following three
variables at any given instant as you're
listening to the music you might react
to that music with a mantel image
triggered by the music or you might not
have any mental images at all you might
react to the music with a mental comment
or there might not be any comment at all
you might have an emotional reaction to
the music if you like the music a
pleasant sensation in your body if you
don't like the music an unpleasant
sensation so you might have a feel
reaction to the music or you might not
have any reaction at all now I'm making
them binary variables but of course in
fact their unit intervals right with the
0 and the 1 are just the extremes but if
we if we give ourselves a binary
approximation
what are you doing science right a lot
of times the system is really too
complicated ok let's make some
simplifying assumptions so let's make
the simplifying assumption that in any
given instant as you're listening to the
external sound of the music your
internal state you could either have
image on or image off talk on talk off
feel on feel off so you've got three
binary variables
don't have to be a google scientist to
figure out how many possible states to
the system right eight states to to the
third power so I'm gonna have you
monitor I'll do it now I'm listening to
this ambient sound image and feel feel
talk all three none image and feel I can
do it with my eyes open just as well
feel none feel I'm monitoring my
moment-by-moment reactions to the sound
now do you think that you could develop
the ability to do this with a little bit
of practice well you can I've taught it
to um I've taught it to as oh like six
years old well six year old kid can
learn to do this okay anybody can learn
to do this but here's the interesting
thing
what are you doing science you don't
just do something once you're doing a
lot of times right so let's say you did
this a lot of times and you did it for
extended periods of time like half an
hour and you did it a lot of times so
the laws of probability are going to be
oh by the way notice we're not trying to
control the reactions right we're just
monitoring
we're simply specifying which of the
eight states is a rising reactively
moment by moment to the sound but if we
did this experiment a lot of times you'd
start to notice some patterns you would
notice that sometimes you get two or
three activated at once and every once
in a while you get no activation at all
just spontaneously there's just sound
without any feel image talk arising in
that moment
now as you're paying attention to what
these different states are like in your
subjective experience you'll start to
notice that when there's no feel image
talk reaction there's only the sound of
the music and you are the sound of the
music and there's no observer
there's no perceived observer listener
rather there's no perceived listener at
all for that moment you as an identity
disappear or rather your identity
becomes elastic and melts into the sound
itself for a moment then feel image talk
arise again and you have a big smile and
in your talk space you hear yourself
saying oh my god the boundary between
inside and outside just disappeared I
became the music now of course at that
instant you're back into feel image talk
reaction so you're no longer the music
but you're having an aha moment then if
you drop that okay and just observe
again then at some point once again
you'll have that experience of no
reaction at all there's just the Sun the
music and I am the music this is
starting to give you an insight into how
your sense of self arises based on
direct experience not based on anybody's
theory the Buddha said that his teaching
was a heap a Seco a heap a circle in the
language of his time meant come see for
yourself eh he means calm fussy possum
in C come see for yourself do this
experiment if you want do it enough
times and you'll see oh my god there's
there are times when the self doesn't
arise other times it arises strongly in
general the stronger the feel image talk
reaction the more sense of I am this so
now what are we talking about
we're talking about a vector we're
talking about a phase space here the
space of subjective experience at any
given moment
seems to involve a certain amount of X a
certain amount of Y and a certain amount
of Z and guess what the images tend to
appear sort of around here the top tends
to be here the feel of course is in your
body but they tend to center here or
here now what are we talking about we're
talking about monitoring your thoughts
and emotions your desires and reactions
your entire sense of i am-ness i have
now given you a paradigm that would
allow you to say how much of what when
and where interacting in what ways and
if you wanted to changing at what rates
in as a function of time it's a kind of
it could as a function of time in space
so we're we're able to speak in in this
very precise language subjectively about
we've now got a language that sort of
sounds like the language of science
because I'm talking about variables I'm
talking about levels of activation each
variable has a sort of location in space
they're changing as a function of time
and it turns out although I won't have
time to go into it here that in Buddhist
practice the major theme is you become
interested in how everything is changing
the rates of change which is in a sense
to develop an internal differential
operator on this vector space okay ah
and it turns out that your whole sense
of what's molding this field of
subjective experience comes about
through monitoring the rates of change
so that you can you get a sense that
there is a sort of force and in East
Asia that's called Chi and in other
traditions it's called prana and so
forth but you actually
detect it through watching rates of
change just as the derivatives are so
important in the world of the natural
world time derivatives fluxions as
Newton called them turns out that's like
a huge theme here too and Buddha's
practice so look what's the in in the
mindfulness practice which is the one
that emphasizes this sort of divide and
conquer that I'm describing to you look
at what the themes are here the themes
are divide and conquer we have this
complex system called the subjective
world no one seems to be able to get a
handle on it from any theoretical or
practical point of view well let's look
at these very simple variables auditory
thinking visual thinking emotional body
let's watch their activation levels
let's watch their interactions and most
importantly let's watch their rates of
changes they arise and pass away the
rates of change in Buddhism are called
Anita impermanence and if you study
anything about Buddhist meditation
you'll see that this is a huge theme so
what I'm presenting to you is a model of
mindfulness so any form of meditation is
going to involve sensory clarity I'm
sorry it's going to involve high
concentration that's the lowest common
denominator most forms of meditation if
they take place in traditional religions
will have an equanimity component that's
related to a concept of the soul being
purified but in Buddhism the sign that
the soul is being purified is that your
suffering diminishes and your
fulfillment goes up so that's the
equanimity component then what the
Buddha discovered which was unique to
his take on meditation was the clarity
component oh we
and take this complicated thing called
the self and break it down into its
atoms and see how those atoms interact
to produce the illusion of limited
identity and when that emergent property
or illusion of limited identity is seen
through then what happens to your
identity you notice when you listen to
the sound
there was no feel image talk your
identity sort of became the sound your
identity could become the person that
you're looking at it could be anything
what happens to your identity when this
insight arises is that it becomes a
paradoxical identity instead of being a
limited identity that's limited to a
certain mind and a certain body your
identity now has that might your
original mind body is still your home
base but instead of being a prison where
you have to live all the time it's now a
home and you can leave and come back and
when you leave you become anything
everything and the nothing that is the
source of anything and everything and so
you have what might be described as an
elastic identity or what might be
described as a paradoxical identity or
what is traditionally called
unenlightened identity and that's in 50
minutes the big picture of meditation
worldwide Buddhist meditation in
specific and specifically the
mindfulness practice and it's my
conjecture that because the nuts and
bolts of mindfulness is with regards to
our experience of body mind how much of
what when and where interacting in what
ways and changing at what rates that's
what mindfulness trains you to track in
your own sensory experience well to me
that sounds a lot like science that
sounds like an internally generated
fMRI of sensory experience and because
of that I cannot help but think that if
we get the the senior mindfulness
masters who can track this kind of stuff
you notice okay I I don't does I'm ready
to go the drop of a hat feel feel image
talk non okay that's a skill it's just
there I contracted anytime
my holes even in the middle of a talk
like that it's I'm talking to you it's
going on on autopilot my idea is if we
can get people that have been trained in
these skills at high levels get them to
the people that are imaging the the
effects of this then we get the best of
both worlds we get the the quantified
empirical data
and we see you how that correlates to
the person's internal experience and
this would then allow us at some time in
the future to develop a new paradigm for
what happens in meditation right now
there are dozens and dozens of forms of
meditation and my expression would be or
and each one of them claims to tell you
why they're the best one I would say as
a professional in the field that all
forms of meditation worldwide are
roughly equally in effective they're do
you hear me they're roughly equally bad
meaning that they take a lot of time and
effort they do deliver the goods though
and delivering the goods is very
important how important well just wait
till the next time you're in physical or
emotional distress
you can't relieve the situation and you
can't cover it over with drugs or you
don't want to cover it over with
recreational or medical drugs what are
you gonna do well there's something you
can do so it's very relevant stuff to
the nitty-gritty of human life but my
idea is that because it it takes a long
time and it's hard to do even though the
results are for the people that do it I
mean if you ask me okay I'll give you a
choice
you can live one day as you are as I am
today knowing what I know and I have to
die tonight
or I can live the rest of my life and
have millions of dollars and be famous
and whatever but I'm not going to allow
you to live your life knowing what you
know okay you take anybody that's
meditated for forty years the way I have
and ask them you want to live one day
knowing what you know as a meditator and
die or live your the rest of your life
but you're not allowed to have a
meditators consciousness
no one will hesitate give me one day
with the meditators consciousness that's
incomparably better than a lifetime of
ordinary pleasure that human beings
would have so that's how big it is
for those few that are willing to put in
the time and effort the problem is the
great majority of human beings are not
willing to put in the time and effort
that means that from my perspective when
I look out at the world I don't know
whether to laugh or cry at the human
condition because I know for sure based
on my own experience what a human being
can come to experience as human life I
know what can be with a certain amount
of training and the actual amount of
training about a half an hour a day and
then maybe four hours of intensive
practice per month kept up for your life
as a householder that's actually enough
that may not seem like a lot in terms of
time
actually in terms of time it isn't a lot
but in terms of people organizing their
schedules so that they actually
prioritize and do that it is a lot so
most people will not make those
priorities even though it's not that big
a deal so most people will not live the
way they could have lived as a senior
Buddhist meditation teacher I look for
the solution to this not in trying to
convert people into Buddhism but rather
I look to science I look to science to
give a radical new interpretation of
what happens to us when we're successful
meditators I'm looking for a paradigm
shift that I do not think will come
about through any advanced meditator
simply looking into his or her self
using the methods of the past I think we
need to bring a new methodology in which
would be the method of science
neuroscience let's ask ok what happens
at enlightenment and yet a scientific
model now I'm not the only Buddhist that
calls for this as when people say where
you're going to secularize and take all
the mystery out of enlightenment no I
say we're going to take the mist out of
enlightenment and if that means
secularization so that the masses of
humanity can live as big as they need to
live then ok let's and then it will be a
secular enlightenment but it will still
be deeply deeply spiritual it just won't
have the language of religion anymore
so I look to science towards to bring up
to come up with a new paradigm an actual
mathematical scientific model I gave you
some approximate math that I'm sort of
hypothesizing from the inside but no
one's ever tested things like that from
the outside
but because the basic method of
mindfulness is quantitative it's asking
for tracking variables in terms of how
much of what when and where changing at
what rate and because Western science is
designed exactly to do that it seems to
me that there's a natural meeting point
for these two Sciences and when that
that would give birth to a new science a
science a true science of enlightenment
that would be acceptable to any
scientific thinking person in the world
because there'd be empirical data and
mathematical equations to back it up but
you know what happens with new science
comes new technology and so as a
meditation teacher my fondest hope is
that in a hundred years
meditation is obsolete do you understand
that seems very radical right I devote
my life to spreading meditation I would
like to see it obsolete obsolete in the
sense that that horse and buggy is
obsolete because a new technology does
the same job better so that you know
Einstein has had his happiest thought it
was the equivalence of a gravitational
field and an accelerating frame allowed
him to it was the big breakthrough that
allowed for general relativity so he
called that his happiest thought his
happiest thought was when he realized
that those two were equivalent and that
would be a whole basis for general
relativity so I'll tell you what my
happiest thought as a 21st century
scientifically oriented Buddhist teacher
is my happiest thought is there are many
deep and significant things about
enlightenment that no human being knows
at this time not the greatest masters of
the past not the greatest living Zen
masters not even the Buddha himself
there are things to learn about it and
those things can only be learned
from bringing the light of science to it
and when we do we will accompany that
will be a new technology that will
essentially make classical liberation or
enlightenment available to any
consenting adult on the planet basically
so anybody that's that understands what
they're getting into and wants it could
take a course in a junior college let's
say a community college it would give
them certain very simple attentional
training a little conceptual framework
and then there would be technological
boosts of some sort that we can't
imagine at this point that at the end of
say a six months class you have had the
experience of what's called stream entry
or kensho enlightenment and that's an
integrated experience for you and and so
that instead of having a few thousand
enlightened people or maybe ten thousand
enlightened people on the planet we have
millions tens of millions hundreds of
millions enough to make a critical mass
to change the course of human history
towards the positive that's my my sort
of messianic view I do not for a moment
claim that this is what's going to
happen okay like Yogi Berra I don't make
predictions about especially about the
future okay think of all the great
scientists you know that have made
predictions about the future okay like
john von neumann thinking that computers
would stratify society because only rich
people could have them did you know that
he thought that there'd be a horrible
effect of computers the inventor of the
phone ointment concept of a computer i
found new month-on-month he was totally
wrong about the social impact in fact
180 so I could be totally wrong I don't
claim this will
but it is not hard for me to imagine
that it could happen that science and
spirituality could cooperate in the
lines I'm describing and I am done I'm
out of time thank you for listening and
well those of you that still have some
time
I would like questions particularly I
like challenging questions I like to be
put on the spot I like to get the
questions that you have not been
satisfied with answers so far or
questions where you think you can put me
on the spot
I like questions so I will open it up
for anything that anyone would like to
ask yeah maybe
men oh yeah you're right I'm sorry
because we have to do the other room
okay yeah I'm sorry I'm I'm realizing
I'm behind schedule so we're going to
start a meditation in a little while or
right away rather and that's gonna be
downstairs in what room Cayenne yeah so
if you have questions come down there
and we'll I'll answer your questions and
do some meditation</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
