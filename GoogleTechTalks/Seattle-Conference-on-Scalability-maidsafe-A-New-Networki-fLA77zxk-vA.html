we're going to I'm going to spend half
an hour of discussing scalability from a
different perspective I think than many
of the other speakers what we're trying
to do in Maine safe is look at what's
currently available and as it really
scalable so some some initial thoughts
there's only four slate so computers
break they generally take care of data
with them data gets lost is is that that
better can you hear me okay the back
encryption is very complex remote access
is extremely difficult and syncing
between devices syncing data between our
phone and a computer any other equipment
doesn't work particularly well so I made
say if we wonder why would you want to
scale this then we get some basic
questions when the computer breaks why
should I fetch you so badly why is it
not like your TV or toaster you just get
another one why is your data stationary
it's all in one place so that thing goes
down it takes a weather or it's on a
server the whole thing's going and what
as a very ants that scales so well this
is this dancing asynchronous Network
transport system now let's say actually
ants deserve
there's a great TED video by Deborah
Gordon of Stanford University who spent
20 years looking ants in its very well
and looking at the thing about an ant
colony which is very interesting it
works with no central control it's very
very scalable the ants themselves are
not particularly intelligent beasts on
their own but they don't they don't have
to be they don't know each other's names
they don't know each other identity they
work by basically seeing patterns so
there's four types of ants there's what
a work arounds foragers etc so as an ant
coming every of the colony it made this
eight today I'm going to be a forager
that's what it was yesterday
and it brushes by maybe several answerer
they've been cleaning a nest so by the
same and notice in a different pattern
the ant adjusts what is doing for that
day so the interesting things about ants
as they do for a few simple rules alone
they're not particular effect if they
could be eaten washed away and Rayner
over
I find that's part very interesting
after the nine colony reaches a certain
size it becomes very complex incapable
definite from what happens in ite we we
tend to assume that all the parts of ite
should assembly a human brain it's it's
not effective so ants follow a few
simple rules it's very very critical and
made safe mixtures of us thinking so may
say if we have nodes you may not be able
to eat that at all but these are our
ants and they follow a few rules about
weight Asimov rules except for for data
and scalability the first thing is
everyone must protect the colony or the
network resources must be protected in
our cases data it could
many other things and from a security
perspective we do something quite
interesting we give any data to anyone
ask for anything I'm a great believer in
designing something correctly to begin
with I think yeah it's it's a very
different way of looking at ite but the
lakes of fencer F and Robert can when
they come up with tcp/ip packet switched
information they were laughed at by the
community engineers everywhere thought
internet will never take off they were
wrong so sometimes you have to be able
to look it before you understand from
first principles and really question it
the fourth really take self there are
pre Texas itself but an ant will never
protect itself if it affects any other
rules that it won't distribute resources
if it's going to cause damage to them
that won't rotate a resource above the
colony so if if it's got a node for
instance with a a piece of data which is
a virus or an ant with a piece of food
which is poison don't keep it get rid of
it and the bottom the bottom part is
very interesting all the reactions are
immediate and repeatable so for nine
things another one has got a virus or a
problem that pushes it away instead of
the colony if it comes back it pushes
that way again this happens continually
they don't remember all that's jewelry's
non-ac ISIL so ants work on immediacy
and repeatability so that status lights
and what do is look over on very poor
pr2 things will show you what the loads
are in our situation and for what we do
with data to be getting my first there's
four or five parts to the mid safe
Network which is on the Royal not quite
simple but when you connect them all
together we become very effective so the
first thing is an encryption technique
where we'll take a file
and split that into multiple chunks
c1 c2 and c3 with each of these chunks
we take the hash and save it and I fail
the chunks then go through an
obfuscation technique queer baits are
basically swapped between all the jobs
have it's done as we take an XOR packet
takes off all the way through then we
end up with C 1 C 2 C 3 X developing a
piece of data nose with her the other
ring is of no years so then what we're
doing is we we actually take the the
hash of c1 plus 1 C 2 so we take a hash
of this HC 2 and we encrypt us with
aes-256 which gives us C 1 X E and so on
C 2 X E and then we take a hash of this
again and we restore that HC 1 X e HC 3
XE
this small file is called data map
that's just a representation of the hash
pre and post encryption the important
things here are any chunk here is
useless even given an encryption key as
X or beta of Lotus they're known so
without your data map
he can't recreate us fail at all
another important thing to understand
get some water
another important thing to understand
here is all the data is created from the
fail itself there's no dual user input
so that's fine we can't on we can't on
failures enter a mishmash of junk
okay that's datum up these chunks here
are actually renamed with the hash of
the content so those chunks of Aleen bit
that we and then stored somewhere we do
this with every file in the file system
so we have a data map for each file
concatenate it to become your data Atlas
the data artless obviously is quite a
large fail if you take this instance we
use sha-512 so freaky-deaky times
however many failures you've got excuse
me
so the data Atlas itself becomes a fail
and goes through this process again so
what you end up with is a data map of a
data
this map of your data Alice so given a
data map of your data hours like this
you can retrieve the chunks that make up
the data itself your data Atlas allows
you to retrieve all the chunks which
make up your file system so we call
their self encryption and that's the
first part of the system so we'll move
on from that yeah yeah the key comes
from the hash of the plea encryption
chunk so you at the end up with the when
you break the veil up you've got c1
which is just part of the veil it's
actually ex-ored with some random
theater XOR as an incredibly good a
process of obfuscating information if
you take two two pieces of information
and XOR them and tape one of them away
that's that's one here's very very
difficult to DK DK is not a an algorithm
like a s it you can reverse a brute
force so the encryption key comes from
the plea encryption chunks as basically
our self encrypted fail the the second
part
yeah yeah ah celebrity the data is the
data map is stored well I'll go through
the authentication system which will
explain that as a kind of bizarre way to
work the data itself we store on a
distributed network just like it the
moment is keyed Emily
so another system each node as in a
traditional DHT II you've got we use 512
address as well so every note has its
own address the chunk itself at the end
of the process your C 1 X and E so the
hash of C 1 XE gives you a key which you
store on a DHT we go slightly further
what hope you've got you've got Internet
and the top of that you get DHT layer
and the top of that we have the made
safe layer we have some of the logic
which we'll go through now
for the time being if you just imagine
the data stored on a DHT as you would do
normally on the client side of the
system there's three parameters you
username pen number and password so
client side is odds the human Arnaud's
I'll explain in a second that's ants the
other important case so from from the
client side if we take a hash of your
username plus pen sorry I can never been
here see okay I'm gonna play handed the
hash of using in + pen would give you a
key and that key we retrieved from DHT a
value that value happens to be a random
ID this we call it red random ID then
the system takes a hash username plus
and it's actually slightly more complex
than this but given the time we take the
hash of that again that gives us another
key and it retrieves a value the value
here is basically AES encrypted data
Alice which is the data Atlas you just
asked about we call it team it as
teammate 14-play ID this changes every
time someone does a session update this
random ID here changes so your your
username and passwords never transmitted
but what it does allows your honor just
a distributed network to log in to your
own data there's no third party involved
here so let's say
authentication system or still only a
very short way through the through the
network so that's all very good you can
know encrypt a veil anything think
encrypt all your files and authenticate
against your own data so if we look at
what kind of data you can actually have
you've obviously got your fails as I say
I'll go through the lords in the monarch
is everybody'll be thinking machines
crashed if all over it the notes take
care of our like hands so what kind of
data can be actually create now well
because your log then you have you have
an identity we use RAC and generate key
pairs so if we go back to what the data
was a chunk of data is renamed with a
hash of the chunk content okay so any
when storing this piece of data can
easily hash the content and see if it
matches a key if it's in damaged or
however or even if it's not transmitted
properly we use UDP so it's another
check if we generally I keep here is one
of the other interesting things to know
is if I send you an email or fail code
you know what's actually meet it same
thing and we can use the PKI which tons
with a bit of an email because we have
to get back to have something a
centralized control or rather I say over
a key server so if we generate a key
pair your public and private key and
we do as take a public key saying it
with it's actually not the private key
from this keep here as I say teams a bit
quick so we take those public key and
private key hash that and how it gives
us the key it also gives us an ID so if
the hash of this comes out to be for
instance ABC then we would save that on
the DHT that however many K closest
nodes and it's again it's any open now
that's ID ABC the shears are here now
says that's me I am ABC and he can he
can transmit information to other people
and say I'm ABC I've signed us for you
and you can confirm that by going to the
DHT and retrieving the value for the key
ABC which will give you the public key
and you can confront exactly who's
speaking for you so that's PTI without
without any Sarah first without you
having to trust that I've sent in the
public key and it's actually the new one
the third there's a really good video on
Google by a guy called van Jacobson you
we have networking and find quite lately
puts a lot of a lot of thought and
feeling into the hall PK knowing who's
talking to you why is very very
important and today we don't be doing
actually health uh ability
some of us taking people can use on key
server and whatnot but your grant
couldn't so
right that gives us the ability to same
information and validate it's definitely
come from us we go slightly further
maybe four table here so we can log-in
we can authenticate we can guarantee
that this also we can start to look at
things like here we can save data a good
message effectively and something we
could do very easy is shir I'm very
interested in a sharing thing so if you
have your data Atlas which is basically
you can catenate the data Maps the data
map has X let's plan to force agents
you've got data data as well
oversleeping and you decide that this
information here is very interesting
it's a bit scalability or whatever and
you relate to share that with a someone
but you don't completely want to share
it with the whole world if you take
these data data maps and send them to
the person validated with PKI then what
you've done is you've just created a
private share with no failure servers
and no authoritative control and that
thing is that's one of the things I
really like because researchers this was
maybe ten or three of people researching
every definiteiy per cancer or whatnot
these guys need money and they need to
be able to share information sharing
information unless we using the PTI and
things that allows you to share
information without servers immediately
without any cost and also guaranteeing
any IPR because you vegetal assign your
information so that's
some of the some of the stuff the client
can do as I say this this generally
takes four hours to get through the
school systems
the Nords themselves and as I say it's a
it's a DHT network so so everyone's get
their own own address see we use 512 per
addressing because it ties in nicely
with sha-512 which is a great number
it's one point three times ten to 154 so
it's like 10,000 times Google squared so
on your p ki aur anya distributed
network you've you've got to remember
the internet DHT and made safely restore
pointers to the bit of data so on your
DHD does would say that's key that's
where you store the data which is the
value and it made safely ur the value is
pointers to real the data actually as so
your piece of data ABC you'll find the
point us to where the data as only DHT
so they point and to the made safe layer
I tell you made safe decides for two we
have to store all the information each
node has got availability checks and the
letter to check so
the validity checks easy actually we'll
just do that first so if you've got 4/10
and the name which is your key you know
that the the name of this piece of data
is a hash of its content so you've get
three three guys all with the same we
use replication we don't use forward
error correction of anything
the idea being perpetual data should be
prepared to if you use a three-way
replication let's jump here you can add
some random data on to the end of the
content rehash and ask the partner node
take to take this random data a painter
onto the content and rehash it and give
them by their answer so that way if what
we're doing we are checking chunks of
data all over the network without
retransmit because the first thing's got
a virus owner however we may not want to
try to error about so using the hashing
technique we actually can confirm for
the data is valid or not obviously TV
argument so the bloody T check is is one
thing you lose points if you're not
valid the availability check
the only way the only way to actually do
is if you have the piece of data itself
and append the random information to it
if it's not the exact same piece of data
you'll never be able to answer yeah yeah
so these guys never transmit the data so
yeah yeah
so another guy here you mean Oh like so
this guy intercepts a random challenge
yeah these these all have it all right
yeah yeah yeah all of all of these
things are saying using the PK I think
so
this guy is C 1 C 2 C 3 C 1 asks C 2 and
a st. message so even if it's a few
passes our information on that it won't
be from him so the PKI things very it's
very important for us so the
availability checks slightly different
well what we have here is each node has
a rank I'll put that up here actually a
ranking system so as Nords commander of
the network or whatever there's super
luhan's I'll just call them rank zeidel
rank so you don't know it's these these
could be right three back to night 1 or
whatever loss of rank ones
and these these guys actually get a
ranking based on how often the line
though the system starts with a couple
of super load so we we've defined as it
grows these these super nodes check
every so often left and right the other
nodes in the network so this guy here
will be checked by the super node and
the super node so you actually end up
with an overlapping database which is
quite interesting Amazon do a really
clever thing with us when a de Namur
paper which is very much worth reading
so that the super nodes actually they
confirm this guy here is continually on
and a an attained flame that we'd need a
rank two machine as is the rank
decreases the machines more efficient
and it's really interesting in there and
the office because when we start the
network off and all the machines are
ranked four five and you see them
growing just like we people and they
grow to to rank one status the super
nodes themselves are actually ranked one
machines which are promoted based on the
number of nodes between them and that's
as using Cadets the eggs or rather than
employed in doesn't say XOR lessons so
this guy will never work out more than
five hundred nodes each side
this guy's the same if they do you'll
pull a rank one up for a while as total
and determinants very you wouldn't be
able to tell who's going to be rank zero
line one
but this gives you a ranking system so
that you know if you've got a a client
which is one human guys and he has an
order sociated with them there's a
registration process which is slightly
called complex but it's very anonymous
the client will attach himself to a node
which he uses a another randomly
generated key pair for Colton made safe
and on a mess ID
there's about 20 IDs and system that's
why they take so long to go through so
the Nord Quentin desk line goes the
stored data he can only store data with
the rank of the note that he uses so he
will feel stored on like two machines or
whatever but interestingly as yeah this
is something I should chew ears well
really the self encryption if you
remember was a fail that was encrypted
with no user input which of course a lot
you understand that means that if you've
got sent chunks eb c d e f from i don't
know some hayley minogue MPC fail and
you got to save them the chances are
they're already saved when they're
already saved you don't need to to put
them onto network you just keep your
data data map maybe imagine the first
duplicate a prevention that we could
actually recover something like an 85
percent of the space it's out there
today the other thing it does is if you
have good if you're a rank two your
three machine and someone else is saving
the same file it'll rank one machine
nests will auto promote all of us data
to rank one state so the way the system
works is you basically install install
the client and the node program on your
own computer and if you leave your own
computer on and it's a bit of a lability
or whoever your your experience will be
much better you can actually buy ranked
one space that's something that we are
doing just some old doctor desks on a
network if you fall over if they if it
does fall over through the validity
shaker availability checking process
this guy goes away these these will
obviously automatically make a new copy
if that's fixed in time you won't lose
any any rank so the system completely
looks looks after itself
and there's no is this in Dority
whatsoever so again it's lightly
Definitely Maybe look at this we will
never ever lowered users
we never want to our users will will be
completely anonymous on on the Internet
does they hash of the username plus pen
for authentications actually a very
simplified version of what happens
because we use it same time time itself
so the error of the day that someone's
logged in is added to user name plus
pattern so you've got moveable username
situation removable password citation
yeah initially what we are putting out
is a because this is quite a radical
change in to be computers work you can
own a system which will give you backup
plus shading and it'll just look like a
a normal program for the time being just
to build confidence in the network
antelope to take off but they're also 15
feet when we get fused to our properly
with Windows will be really good but
we've put a fuse file system in place so
their intention with their system is if
you go to any computer login that's
completely your computer under your
control log back home again
and it's gone so EDX might actually
described it really well when these
court days or sorry the question was for
is this system good to look like
I think Planck's credentials are lost if
you forget your password sorry are you
going to classes sorry again what
happens if the client credentials are
lost or compromised because the data is
perpetually available to everybody
if a client loses his credentials is
lost all of his different completely and
as one of the problems is we sometimes
encounter primeira talks as if you're
buying a safe you want a safe that's
unbreakable and ain't loose a
combination that does with the
interesting thing here those you use on
the implant and password you need all
three you could actually give someone
else your username so when your pencil
your password we think with the fewest
thing you're using every day we're also
looking at biometric access here the
first thing we should be using us every
day because you can generate as many IDs
as you want and these can be linked to
the ranking system to go for a trust
metric Spacely for messaging you can see
I'm not going to speak to anyone less
hook up a trust measurement of greater
than 50% you can there yeah because you
can create so many IDs you and you can
share the information you could share
your whole data Atlas with your way
friends and sir however so if you did
lose a significant part of your
credentials you would be able to get
your information I have a question on
performance yeah since this is all being
done on the fly yeah do you have any
metrics that you've looked at yeah we
fed we do create a lot of testing and
the office in this vent racing thing
about that says it's not really a theory
it's an alpha testing at the moment and
for a variable performance system at the
moment it takes one minute 20 seconds
for a five Meg fail so a music failover
over and that's that's that's increasing
as more as more people start using the
system it gets better because we do a
caching thank very similar to Adem like
ash so
if you ask for a piece of information as
the closer it gets to gets copied as is
closely multi casting as we can get so
if someone else rentability ask for the
same piece of information the first hop
in the work should give them it so went
all the way back to the original three
so it gets quicker so has this been test
on a specific hardware or operating
system I mean are you talking about
Google BigTable or Google file system no
no we just use it basically at the
moment is mostly written in Python and
C++ file encryption but converting some
of the Kadeem layer stuff to C C++ this
is just running on commodity Hardware
using Windows or Linux
we've not tasted on Mac OS just yeah we
don't use anything fancy just redesign
you a computer for um actually I get a
couple of questions first of all um
what's the minimal size of your anthill
to be able to work two and a half
thousand to know and tracing leo
Deborah Gordon is a slate which shows an
ant colony this is ten thousand thanks
it becomes very very stable we are with
a two and a half thousand nodes prior to
that we have unknown because of binary
tree balancing you're changing the dam
likely a lot so that the K Bach
implementation we can tell the amount of
nodes are on it based on the eggs or
closeness of your own bucket so we can
actually work out hey don't go down 512
roots
it's far too much there's maybe only 64
128 people on its own yeah then the next
question would be how many ads are
allowed to die at once without affecting
the whole backup system through an
addition to standard Kadeem where we use
a user a location based system so that
before the four
two copies of a rank one piece of data
displayed across time zones user views
mode 1 mode 3 take as a the key bucket
splits we use modulo division so that in
each area we have a random number of
Kadima addresses and we can shove this
across time zone so three continents at
one time Moscow often never come back
one and another one he mentioned that if
the user uses his credentials basically
you can't access this data anymore okay
some sort of cleanup procedure because
that over time would create this
substantial over it I guess
yeah that is there's a there's a thing
called on the wicked my network created
where you store your key which is maybe
ABC which will give you the pointers to
to period data as there's also an ABC
watch list so yet yeah actually harsh
the world ABC watch list and that gives
you the key that gives you another key
and if our use of this key are fifty
people that are looking at how fail the
the watch list is a a support processing
the next person that's looking in the
fail will actually put yourself into the
watch less than the fiftieth one off so
you'll become number one the watch list
itself dies over those over time and the
reason for this is so that we do have
malicious people coming on and seeing we
all like the Cayley single though delete
it we use a PGI signatures for deletion
but as a watchlist empties and this
chunk is a no longer valid
everybody removes themselves from here
the watchlist will check itself every 60
days users have refortified days and
then that data can go ultimately I
believe that we don't want to get rid of
any other data you know the way hard
drives are going I think the hard drive
today
in five years time did the hard drive
that you have we'll be able to store all
the information that Antonia has today
which is an interesting thing from the
scaling perspective also from the
processing perspective five years ago a
laptop today we've been at all 500
supercomputers so or definitely unless
we may be slightly ahead of the curve
with us technology but thank you rate
how do you prevent a malicious user from
taking up significantly more resources
than they're contributing it's a quid
pro quo network so to actually save
information so if this is your you here
and you're trying to store some
information to the network use a store
one megabyte he says okay you store one
megabit back so that's a quid pro quo to
tipper information on you must give
something out is there is there risk of
files that have any certain dynamic
content of having a outdated file at the
other edge of the network be given to a
user as an updates occurring on the
other edge yeah there would be I think
if we stop to the Kadena process because
of the D publish information you can
enter a good thing with dhts are really
really good at putting information on
nicely create difficult to get off a
team so your keys and your pointers you
can end up if you if we just used the
key value pair and store the data the
value that would replicate to the wrong
places but we actually over eight over
eight the values and the ego around
using our views certain modifications
that don't very much modification so we
took care of steal data but also the
thing that you asked for if the file has
been updated you're asking for the post
encryption hash so when you when you get
out fail that's exactly what you asked
for it can't be any different
someone else is updated FAO where you're
both looking at the same chunks that's
gang updates and you're now part of a
share you'll keep getting old one
unless you've joined this year I've only
discussed private cheating here but
doesn't there's a mechanism where we can
publicly share information so you
right-click on a file everyone has
access to and that's searchable so
searchable public information is quite
an interesting point sent thank for
Google continuing the previous question
about malicious users using up too much
resources can you store a lot of data in
the system and then just pretend to
store stuff that they give you in return
and not actually store it yeah we look
at this way continually the the quid pro
cool thing you can only store it on the
same rank as yourself so Lord ank
machines we don't really care too much
it doesn't sound very good but we don't
care too much delete the baby ants you
know they may twerk or but as your
ranking improves you see to build up to
Rank 2 for instance which may take six
months a certain activity level if you
store information and say yeah I'll take
that bike we'll do the quick cruel cool
thing it in to eat that all your rank
drop drops dramatically so it's very
difficult for someone malicious to do
any damage actually only hurt themselves
but I think that's the way things should
work if it's if the designs logical we
didn't really plan for some other stuff
it's just the logic if it is a dictator
that works I'm just wondering if you
compare this to a server that has to one
server that has all information
available and just clients accessing it
is there a certain data that can be
stored on this which is better suited
say like specific to users
or like do you see this just being used
to store data specific to like a
computer or can it be used to store data
that's potentially one user has access
to
at the same time data on several nodes
there this could actually be because you
can basically take today malia and put a
database key value if your database is
good way to think of it actually all of
the information could distort on one
server but the problem is someone owns
it and it's a single location if I if I
was a kind of data thief or whatever
that's acute thing I look for a single
location but that's what we we started
off 165 key address space which is 2 to
the 48 of it it's equivalent to if you
take all the grains of sand and all the
peaches in the world and square them
that's it that's a 160 vector space
I've been we spoke to people about this
it's like taking your data and chopping
it into pieces of sand and then putting
up on the DHT is like throwing out a
signed on beaches all over the model so
for someone to try and reverse the whole
process they have to go and get all the
sun f even if some of its messing your
address base size has to be traversed
and then worth trying calculate put that
went we thought and well order and how
many bets needle or fail so the
distribution is actually very beneficial
from that perspective as I say you can
have continents who a never whole
continent can go off and your data
should still receive another thing that
this does the Nords they should remember
the rotate to colonies the primary thing
if the Nords feigned that they can't
feign knowns as it previously could they
all go into fallback mode and clear and
you colony so for instance if they're
the pacific connection went over india
when offlane don't know how that would
happen but
they did the engine subcontinent would
actually form a new me chief network and
then rejoin a later stage I'm just
thinking in terms of like the one server
if it's available say you can access
basically anything at once
is there a worse case and best case for
some like similar situation with your
system say like you need it like I need
data that's oh here here here yep so
data that's that's particularly
interesting and maybe busy let's say I
think I understand I may have this wrong
the only on the network if you've got
someone in the US and China was here and
CNN that a really good story about China
because of the caching that that
information may have been held here here
and here as the theoretical thing as
these guys start asking about that
information will start making its way
over so these guys will get information
that's closer to them
so you remove that the latency involved
we could run all the way here and as I
say that is a closest to multi casting
if you had one single server with all
the information on it
mostly you've quit every year if you're
right next door to it we could eat and
if your fellow sated what would be
slightly slower easier to maintain I
would say but again it's it's massive
security who who would because I serve
up to dude
in terms of the technologies quite
interesting here I think but the company
structure is also very interesting is it
all of us as a CFO will be free of
charge and there's a charity who owned
more than 75% a company so that charity
will be run by everyone every everyone
who has an order to have a vault and how
the system works so that's really for
the people so maybe I missed this but
this data placement change depending on
the access patterns for example if I
access my files from here and then I
move to China
yeah well my data eventually change and
how does that work it uses a correct it
does do that we use caching yeah if you
if you look at the look at the globe and
see just take it in time zones if you
were on time zone 0 when we're back in
Scotland we generally are your data
would be stored in time zone 0 plus e
minus e as a minimum then other other
people may come in time zone for so they
look for data to be moved there could be
an additional copy there but as data is
accessed the caching the caching
mechanism means that it will flow
through the rip so you ask 10 people you
eventually get to the data that will be
stored in those 10 locations those 10
locations will store it for a period of
time which is calculated through an
algorithm but they will give it to two
other people so you get a sort of a
nanny to you it means if you got a
really popular story you don't get it in
a slash door effect the whole network
takes care of it and then after that
tape periods up it goes away again we're
going to take one more question is it
possible to do computation within the
network let's say possible to do
computation it's quite interesting
because what are the things just three
ways this project will go and it will go
both of what is the de Namur tape thing
but you've got
not completely random data that pseudo
pseudo-random data database reads with
very few rights you can actually do that
with attainable system and we have got D
topple implementation on top of K demo
as well which were we're looking at so
that's a very early fail early stages
but you will be able to do computation
using detail also the nodes using a
traditional distributed their platform
like society or rosetta is something
we're very keen on and that's again that
leads to the desire for research to to
progress quickly so strictly shading
information in a way you can save IPR
plus giving resources to different
projects I think is a is a very good
thing for us to do it thank you so much
