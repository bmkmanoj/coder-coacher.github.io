you so much for coming my name is Ian 10
I'm a vice president at the Chinese
Institute of Engineers Seattle and we're
very happy to have everyone here so for
the members thanks for coming and for
people who are I guess prospective
members are interested in learning more
about the Chinese Institute of Engineers
we're a we're a organization a local
chapter of national foundation that's
dedicated towards promoting and
recognizing excellence in the science
technology engineering and education
fields and that's what we do in a local
community are very happy to have the
involvement of local companies working
with us in our efforts so some of the
events we do include social events like
picnics and outings as well as
scholastic events we host we have
scholarship awards everywhere as well as
a youth math and science contest that we
run every year this year it's happening
November 4th and there's information
about it on our website CIE - usa.org we
have number board members here today I'd
like to just have them raise their hands
so their board members you will have any
questions about CIE or interested more
in the organization they're here to talk
to you about it so this event we're very
happy to have Google very grateful to
Google for hosting us with us our
seminar series has included this year
CEOs from many local startups we've had
the former editor of PC Magazine we've
had PhDs talking about investment
finance and it's been a really great
series and we're very very happy to be
here at Google today won today's talk
has a lot to do with what what CIE is is
a one of the benefits the CIE
organization has really tried to bring
the community which is being able to
have bring able to being able to bring
people together across cultures whether
that's the Asian cultures the many
different cultures in Asia the American
cultures cultures from different
disciplines whether it's engineering or
government or finance and also at
cultures that go across different
companies so it's it's really these
events that we're very very glad and and
it's a pleasure to host these so today
we've got quite an impressive speaker
mr. Chi Chu has
is a graduate of MIT and he's got and
he's worked in the u.s. she's worked in
India he's worked in China he's really
had a remarkable career in leadership so
with that I'd like to hand it over to
cheat you thank you thanks for having me
here is great to see everyone here
my training is in engineering I start
off as a developer and I never perceived
predicted that my career would take me
where I am I'm not really I want to talk
about the Asian values and how it fits
in American cultures because I'm very
passionate about that there's a lot from
my personal experiences so I hope that
this is a relevance to you and it could
bring you a lot of thought about how how
you operate with your teams and also
your your careers so let me help me
understand could you raise your hand if
you grew up why they were born or move
to the US before the age of 10 well not
very much how many people moved here
around colleges or after college oh wow
ok play a lot and how many people here
have to the best of their knowledge know
Asian blood in them whatsoever
cool well it is it's fine out is welcome
to the your new minority you know it's
great it's great to hear it's great to
have all you guys here give you an idea
for me for my background I was born in
Malaysia born in colon poor I lived in
Malaysia Penang for three years and I
moved to the US when I was about three
and a half four years old I only spoke
Vulcan
I did not speak any English and I moved
to the US and then my parents realized
that in a year a year and a half I would
have to attend English school business
isn't South Carolina and I think I was
maybe the only person Chinese person in
South Carolina at that time I think they
were actually they probably have three
others I think there were my mom dad and
my sister so so they realized that I had
to learn how to speak English very
quickly so when I was three years old
they stopped speaking talking to me they
only spoke English to me and so I only
spoke English for for the next many
years when I was about 10 or 11 my
parents thought wow he's so American he
speaks no Chinese so they started to
speak Chinese again to me but by that
time I was lost so from when I was 10 up
I could understand Chinese but I
couldn't speak it and but my parents
still they always they talked to me in
Chinese and I answered in English talk
to me in Chinese I answer in English
except for when I was in trouble when I
was in trouble they spoke to me in
English to make sure I understood so so
that's that's a little my background and
from for a long time they said you're
very very American and I kind of
believed that and in many ways it's very
true but then also in many ways I
I am very Asian in in my core in the
core values
that I have and I'm I don't know biology
and psychology well enough to know
whether those parts of me that are Asian
are because of nature that I was born
with with it or whether they were
nurture because my parents us even
though they spoke English to me
we had a very Chinese values household
so I don't know which that is and at
some level it doesn't matter and I
imagine especially for those who moved
to the US after you were I college the
situation is probably very similar for
you so I grew up in South Carolina
Kentucky the deep south when I my high
school my grade school had only three
Asians in them myself my sister and a
friend of mine so though so that's the
environment that there's no kid there
were three Asians in my high school and
grade school so we stood out a lot it
was it was quite hard and especially in
the south especially when I was going up
there's a lot of prejudice it's called a
lot of names it kind of forced me to
retreat some sometimes and to question
what I liked being Chinese like what I'd
rather just be white American like every
everyone else in that and in high school
so it brought a lot of questions it was
quite difficult but then I went to
college I went to MIT and when I went to
MIT I don't know what the percentage is
now but we were a 30% Asian 30% Asian
and and when I say Asian for that
category I it was 30% Asian not
including India not including you very
very high percentage so it's like a
different world you know so it was quite
I hoping I enjoyed it very much I got my
masters and my bachelor's at MIT and
then I went to Microsoft out of college
and Microsoft in this area also very a
lot of Chinese so so that was it was
great and I didn't feel out of place so
it was I it was great great experience
there I started off as a engineer a
software developer on Windows 95
I wrote the taskbar so if you guys have
used the taskbar and you have bugs in
there they're my fault and then I became
a development lead on Internet Explorer
and that was quite a change I did not
expect to ever become a manager I
thought I was always be an engineer but
I became a manager and and I was a dev
lead and now I learned quite a lot and
then I became a dev manager and as a dev
manager most of what you do is to manage
people and you write a little bit of
code but most of what you do is really
to manage people and then I became a
product unit manager and Microsoft
you're not familiar a product unit
manager is someone who starts to manage
a business and you have you know how
engineers reporting to you but you also
have the program management team and you
have the test team and and those those
three categories that people are often
very very different from each other
engineers I guess our engineers logical
to an extreme and program managers their
job is to control the product to direct
the team so I can i think of program
managers as a little bit of a control
freak so they so they have a lot more
ego in stake of what's going on and then
the test team they have great religion
they are just the zealots for quality
and they they hold the bar high and to
lead these three very diverse set of
people was very eye-opening I'll talk
about that more became a general manager
for Windows Mobile
so I ran the mobile devices team that
built smartphone and Pocket PC and then
I moved over from there after seven
years working on mobile devices
I work move over to the Xbox
organization and worked on games for a
little while and then finally this year
I joined Google and I'm an engineering
director at Google so I run some of the
projects here focusing on the client
projects and I also run the Kirkland
China team which is a team that is based
in Kirkland but we work on
that will advantage and help our efforts
in China so that's a little bit of my
background um when I was when I was an
engineer it was the easiest easiest
thing for me at that point
he's like a right code and I could be
very measurable about whether it was
doing well or not is very scientific if
it worked I knew it
if it didn't work it crashed like things
were just very concrete things were very
logical
when I went to a meeting and had a
disagreement with somebody we would
argue about it based on the logic there
was no ego involved we could say which
is the best design it's sometimes a
subjective but we understood and we
talked on a very engineering basis when
I became a dub lead and manage people
things got very weird at first because I
would talk about the logic of something
and someone come in and they would talk
to me and what they're really concerned
about wasn't the logic whether right or
wrong sometimes was about how they felt
like when they made a mistake and they
felt really bad or when they're arguing
with someone else and there's sort of a
more competition or emotion built into
that like as an engineer I would just
want to talk about okay well who was
right what was the right decision and
even if the person was wrong in the
decision they still had to be validated
and I really didn't understand that and
I would go home to my wife and my wife
say uh you gotta care about what do you
think you gotta care about what they
feel you gotta care about the emotion
but that wasn't something I was trained
for when I became a development manager
and my team grew to 70 engineers so I
was a manager of 70 developers I have it
I have to get up and talk to a group of
people like this it was something I was
very uncomfortable with I I didn't never
learn how to talk to a group of people
so that was a huge learning experience
and I I dare say that I was pretty
pretty bad at it initially as a product
unit manager well you have to talk then
to a diverse set of people they're not
all engineers they think about different
things they have different priority
they have different levels of knowledge
so I couldn't talk just purely on a
technical basis because if I just talked
technically a lot of people didn't
understand what in the world I was
saying they had different priorities so
that as I talked to the developers they
want to know about like what the new
great things are what we can do in the
future is that the miss in that group it
also had testers and they want to talk
about what the problems are and how
we're gonna fix the problems and and
what's going on what's wrong and the
program and a lot of Engineers don't
want to talk about what's wrong and and
how they look backwards they want to
talk to think about how you look
forwards and then the program managers
want to be inspired and wanna know how
they're gonna conquer the world right so
but they're all in one group and we have
to talk to them all and and I I really
had had a lot of trouble with that I uh
around that time I had a great mentor
and I attended a class that was
instrumental in in shaping how I thought
about leadership and how it helped me
understand myself better and I think
that that that one class that one
experience is sort of the central focus
for what what I'll talk about today then
I moved over to uh to Google and uh and
it's what I find at Google is the
culture may be very different the people
in many ways are different though the
way the company operates is different
but the principles of leadership remain
the same and the skills that I learned
as I was going through my Microsoft time
are very applicable to to what I've been
doing here at Google now so are we a
minority in mecca census data for the
year 2000 there there were eleven point
eight million Asians including Indian in
the u.s. that's not quite not a lie
so in this office in Google we have
about three hundred engineers so that
should be about eleven twelve engineers
Asian descent in Google we have a little
bit more than 11 of 12 beacons here as I
said in my college there were about 30%
Asian we are dramatically
over-represented in a lot of these forms
right but as you look to executive
positions as you look to if you're in a
engineering organization if you look to
the vice president's the general
managers of your organization's we are
dramatically underrepresented not only
if you look at our our demographic and
engineering individual contributors and
first level managers we may have 20% 30%
of the population or 10 percent
something like that but when you go up
we're in the single digits and in many
in many companies there aren't oriental
leadership leaders in rather large
companies why is that
Oh are we not good at that are we
uncapable of leading at one point I
really questioned that but I you know I
like when I come to believe is that in
the American culture there are some
things about how Asians developed via
nurture or view nature that the American
culture does not know how to appreciate
and and it's lesson either good or bad
I'm not gonna make a value judgment
about that I I think that is our job if
we want to succeed and want to promote
more representation it's simply to
accept it to learn how to deal with that
and learn at the same time learn how to
preserve the core of who you are
understand what makes up the essence of
who we are and what are things that are
not our essence but simply
manifestations so for example at the
core like I am Who I am and I might or
might not be good at tennis and for some
reason I might need to become good at
tennis so I might learn to become good
at tennis
does that change fundamentally Who I am
or does it just mean that I am who I am
but I can now play tennis right
so that understanding the environment
that we're in recognizing it accepting
it and then learning the skills that we
need to learn in order to really thrive
and succeed in this environment and
that's the essence of what way to
believe we have to do I think I think
it's very very possible by and large
right now every every situation is
different
every individual is different so I will
talk about things in generalizations
there are some there's some data there's
some psychology studies and I can quote
that will make this generalized will
confirm this generalization but I do
recognize that it is is not exactly true
for everybody for example I will make a
generalization that by and large Asians
are more introverted than Americans that
that is not to say that there aren't
very extroverted Asians and it is not to
say that there are very introverted
Americans but the studies have shown
that I recent when I was reading was
suddenly there are 70 percent of Asians
and Europeans actually are introverted
whereas less than 50 percent of
Americans are introverted and that has a
dramatic impact upon how how you show up
in this American culture and to even
further
there's assays that show that the
American corporate culture does not
value and respect introverts so how does
that affect your ability to lead right
now that is a generalization is only
seventy percent right there is the 30
percent that's not but I will talk in
generalizations
so what when we go out and we think
about our skills and who you are there
are some things like that that we cannot
change or we'll take a very long time
for us to look to change and some of
these things can change but at the same
time there are skill sets that we can
learn much more rapidly and still and
still succeed where we want to succeed
so for me the the changing event was
this course I took that included a 360
feedback where my manager my directs my
peers customers I got feedback from
about 12 different key people who work
with me on a daily basis and gave me
gave me input about what they perceived
about me what they thought my strengths
were and what they talked my weaknesses
were in a very quantified way and I also
took a myers-briggs test that how many
people know myers-briggs I'm very good
so myers-briggs personality test that
tells you a little bit about your
disposition I finally found it very very
insightful
I hadn't heard about it until then um so
this is my score on the scale so there's
a scale for for each of these categories
they give you a letter for it but the
first scale is I versus II introvert
versus extrovert introvert versus
extrovert if if you see a zero percent
that means you're a completely
borderline for me I was 100 percent over
an introvert side 100 percent every
question they asked how do you prefer to
interact everyone was in it on a
one-to-one basis I don't like standing
up and speaking in front of say more
than two or three four or five people so
you can imagine that this audience is a
little bit uncomfortable for me s-so
sensing that this is about how do i I
get data how do I evaluate data do I go
for the facts do I go and seek out the
actual numbers or do I take a little bit
of numbers I use my intuition
so I and many engineers really drive for
the for the pure data they don't they
don't like as much intuition they want
to understand the the actual final facts
and they want to base the decision off
the facts the next one is is that one's
thinking versus sensing thank you so
thinking first a sensing is around how
do you make a decision do you look at
the overall data and you and you make
your decision based on the data and then
you look at okay the people involved and
maybe you make an exception to the
people evolve or do you look at the
people first and you guys sense this is
what the the people would would do and
how the people will guide you and then
you look at make sure it confirms with
the data and the logic okay which side
do you push it from do you approach it
from the data side and then try to take
account for the people or you pushed on
the people side account for the data the
last one I'm kind of in the middle for
so this is a perceiving versus judging
so I won't talk a lot about that because
for me that hasn't had a big impact on
my leadership that I've seen yet
so I'll talk really primarily on the
first two
so as an introvert there are two things
as in leadership forums that I had a
hard time doing I had a horrible time
speaking in front of a group of people
horrible horrible time and the second
thing that I had a hard time doing was
when you're in the moment in a meeting
and you have a hot debate on I would
stop and I will want to think and
quietly think about the situation's
sighs the whole thing and then come back
in an hour or two after the meeting with
what I thought about it and in that
moment in that meeting people were going
back and forth they were arguing back
and forth and they don't and and okay at
the end they'll say okay we decided and
I had a set of word I remember my my
manager on one of my reviews he wrote
down on it my manager was Kevin Shields
none of you guys know him he's a good
manager but he wrote on my review she
needs to open his mouth more in meetings
even at the risk of sticking his foot in
it
so but this was directly related to this
mic pre disposition for it being
introvert logic to extreme this this one
was a huge hurdle for me and around
being a good manager because when
someone came to me with a problem I
would dive in to try to solve that
problem when really I needed to think
about what was troubling that individual
was it actually solving the problem
maybe he he she already had the problem
and what he really needed to do was have
was someone to vent but that with or say
hey okay I may be the real issue is a
relationship problem with you or our
partner or maybe you're the issue is
you're not comfortable with me there's
some some issue with that you don't like
how we interact and that's not a logic
problem like debugging a human is much
harder than debugging a computer but
this was something that I was not used
to and I would just dive in and say okay
give me the facts this is what we should
do and I would drive and I solve that
issue so these are the things that
really impeded me but from the
myers-briggs test the the key lessons
the key key lesson that I learned from
that was just because I am predisposed
predisposed for this for one thing or
another does not mean that I can't
become good at it even though I hate
standing in front of a group of 5060
hundred people and speaking it doesn't
mean I can't become better at it and my
message to you is if you look at the
things that hold Asians back even if you
look at things to hold you back whether
or not you're an Asian or not it doesn't
matter who you are
yeah we all have predispositions for
certain things so these are good at or
not good at we need to understand that
we and understand what we can be good at
what we are prevented from being good at
like if if I if I'm want to play tennis
but really I have no coordination
without whatsoever I probably won't
become good
understand what we are predisposed for
and what we are uncapable doing and then
address those skills issues on the flip
side there are some things which you can
become good at but then do change the
core of who you are for those things you
should stick very very closely to your
values and not change those so for
example there have been forums where
I've been in where I saw I observed that
people got ahead by backstabbing each
other that was against my values I might
have big be able to become good at
backstabbing maybe I could but it was
against the core value of who I was and
so that is something that I am not
willing to change I don't think that you
should change that core value however I
can and should learn to become a better
speaker if I want to take is one that
requires that so that's that's the key
that's the key thing so the way I broke
it down is there's values and those are
the core things of who you really are
the things that you must preserve in
order for you to really to live with
yourself because if I change this value
then I might not like Who I am if I
become someone who is a backstabber for
example then I won't like Who I am
anymore if I change my ability to speak
in front of a crowd if I change my
ability to talk with someone on an
emotional basis as opposed to just
purely a technical basis that doesn't
change my value it just changed my skill
I'm still perfectly happy with who I am
understand what your values are
understand what your predisposed for
what you have a tendency to be good at
to me not get that to be comfortable
with really that's the key thing you put
your predisposition tells you what you
are comfortable with then understand the
skills behind that develop those skills
and finally the last one is about
execution and and the key thing I
learned from this
is execution is about mental will and
energy
some people extroverts for example with
a heart British person extroverted is
that was the most critical thing for me
the thing I learned about extroverts
were when they stand in front of a group
like this and they talk at the end of
the period the extrovert has a ton of
energy they get energy from speaking in
front of everybody
as an introvert at the end of speaking
with you I will be exhausted
I will be completely exhausted my flow
goes the other way around it has no
comment about whether I can do this or
not
it just has a comment about the energy
that I will put in to do this right so
for the skills when you align your
values and you understand your position
and you develop the skill that you are
predisposed against when you execute
upon it
you may feel exhausted but that's okay
that doesn't harm you
right doesn't say that you will do a bad
job it just means that you've got to put
the effort in so this is the center of
what what I've learned for me and what's
been the most influential thing for me
around developing my leadership ability
for values like so I always go through
this example for me for values everyone
has a lot of values but the ones that
were most relevant for me as I as I
analyze what's important for me for
leadership were these three things
transparency I believe very strongly
that I should be transparent to my team
to my peers and to my manager right I
believe very strongly that most 95% of
99% of all management problems when
someone is unhappy about their
management situation about the manager
and the situation above them is because
of insufficient transparency that's a
fundamental belief that I hold I might
be wrong on it but that's what I believe
and that's why I will lead second is
teamwork
I believe very strongly in that the
strength of of an engineering team
comes from teamwork this has a lot of
implications when I interview an
individual and they they're able to
solve and keep np-complete and they're
able to do amazing things but when I ask
them questions about how they interact
with other people they say oh yeah I
solved this person and I had to carry
the weight for the rest of my team yet
they weren't really carrying the weight
but I campion them through and they very
well might have I will tend not to hire
that individual that same person at that
same situation that that person says
yeah we face troubles I did XYZ things
everyone pitched in some people were
stronger than others but everyone did
their best that teamwork is that is what
I will go after right so it also has
other other implications when I work
with partners I believe is is my duty
and not not only from an altruistic
point of view but also because it will
end up benefiting me and my team that is
my job to give credit where credit is
due if a teammate does a great job then
I absolutely will give all credit to
them not even like their fair share oh
yeah he did fit the idea 50 if they did
a great job they did a great job if
someone on my team did a great job
I will bubble that up to my manager and
I won't say like oh yeah we did it I'll
say yes that's that person shined right
the push to give credit where credit's
due is fundamental for me in what good
teamwork is and I lead by that and when
I see people not doing that in my team I
call him on it I hold them accountable
to it and that's how I lead and fairness
if fairness does not mean equal fairness
means people get what they deserve
people who are not performing well
should be held accountable should be
held strongly accountable and people who
are doing well should be rewarded right
so I lead very strongly by by these
three three values and whatever I do the
skills I need to gain or not gain I
won't change these
my predisposition though is around
introvert and logic I have a hard time
dealing with things that are not logical
I have a very very hard time dealing
with it sometimes we will make decisions
in my team that are because of someone's
gut feeling I have a really hard time
with that sometimes enough there are a
bunch of people in the team together
they say yeah we want to go that way and
we're not sure if it's the right thing
or not and all the data in fact kind of
points us the other way but we want to
make this bet I have a hard hard time
with that but I believe in the teamwork
and if the team wants to do that then I
will say and I'm pre transparent about
this I'm not sure that this is a right
thing but if you all want to do that and
that's where we all go and in the end of
the day if it is wrong I will absolutely
not say I told you so
because that's not strong teamwork at
the point where I said yes we will go
there I have fully behind it
even though is against logic so I need
to counter
sometimes my predisposition to follow
what logic says I need to counter my
predisposition to what my introvert says
if there's a problem if there's a
problem in a team my my tendency in the
past was to identify the few people that
that were the problem light and go talk
with a one on one one on one 101 and try
to solve it one by one when I was
managing a team of 230 people on mobile
devices my team was 24 30 people that
didn't work I couldn't go to the 30 40
people one by one and have a one-to-one
meeting with every single person I had
to learn how to scale I had to learn how
I changed that and that was a lot about
my learning so the skills I had to learn
I'll put this in the I put this one in
not for me because I since I was five I
learned English but this is one that I
think a lot of a lot of Asians I think
are held back on your ability our
ability to speak English clearly is the
big impediment to our success
leadership is 90% about communication
leadership is 90% about communication is
not what you decide it's not what you do
is how you do it
and I spend most of my time like okay
I'm a director here I write no code all
my influence and all my impact is around
my ability to convince people what to do
and especially at Google where Google's
are very bottom-up driven like if a
director comes and says okay we're gonna
do this and you do that and you want to
do that like they all say see ya I'm
leaving right so my ability to get
anything done is based on my ability to
communicate well in America sarcasm is a
huge tool humor is a huge tool by cost
guard sarcasm because in the Asian
culture in Chinese culture sarcasm is
not used as strongly not nearly as
strongly as is in America I and you
might already sense like some of the
things I've said earlier already have so
it hinted to one my bias toward using
sarcasm and using humor as a technique
for how I relate to people if you if you
look around if you talk to other people
you talk to Americans who who haven't
really interacted with a lot of Asians
and you really pull the truth out of
them it's not surprising but if they're
interacting with someone who they have a
hard time understanding then they will
get frustrated
they will tend to take other avenues
they will tend to go to someone else who
may have the equal knowledge and ability
maybe even slightly less but who they
can interact with who they can
communicate better with so if we are not
fluent we have one strike against us
already at worst
so some there's a book at the end you
can look at I cited but worse at worst
sometimes when we come in and speak with
a heavy accent so we can't be understood
or we have a hard time being understood
that's actually equated with lack of
intelligence you could be the smartest
person in the world but for some people
if you go in there and you talk with
them and they can't understand you they
cannot tell the difference between
whether it's simply a language barrier
or an intelligence issue and that's a
big strike against us so as I said so
you learn the skills you identify what
you need to do you become better at them
now what do you do you execute you've
got to go out and do it when you have
the opportunity to take and fall into
your easier path don't take the
opportunity to talk to go into the
harder path if if for example you're in
the table and you decide that hey I want
to work on my my understanding or my
fluency my pronunciation of English I'm
sitting on a table with a bunch of other
people who we could all speak Mandarin
but if it is important to you to be able
to communicate better that you should
speak to me speaking English even though
it is easier to speak Mandarin you
should push yourself take yourself out
of the comfort zone if that is your
priority I say this about leadership
overall and many of you will equate this
with management by say
you that is even more important if you
are not a manager but you want to become
an influential individual contributor
because as a manager you have the power
of the management structure you can
write someone's review and so you have
the hammer where you have a captive
audience and they must listen to you at
some level but if you are an individual
engineer you're an architect you have to
influence your peers influence people
outside of your group and there and you
have two levers for that one is that the
merits of your technology the merits of
what you have to say and two is how you
say it if you don't master this and your
and your individual intruder you will
have half the battle loss before you
start and then I will say so practice
put the energy in and last to courage
and conviction have the courage to go
out a limb take some risks I hate it
speaking in front of people but I sucked
it up I said okay I'm gonna do it and I
just got up and just started doing it
right I practiced and I practiced and I
practice and I don't know what you think
of me now but I I will tell you I am
much better now than I and I was ten
years ago much much better now than it
was ten years ago
so you're here in my predispositions I
recognize the challenges for me and what
I what do I do about them about them I
invested in learning how to present I
don't do it as often as someone who's
xr8 wool buy do it and I support it with
individual forms I follow up on a
one-on-one basis with key individuals
that's my style so I take a skill that I
need I take the present submission
predisposition I have and I meld the two
together and that's how I found my way
I studied organizational systems I knew
that I had I I had to understand how the
how the organization how people worked
in her organization beyond just the
logic of the technology and so I studied
it
I studied this this amazingly brilliant
a PhD
dr. Barry osser II and so I understood
better about how people relate with you
to each other and I incorporated that
more into how I led in how I manage
teams in making decisions I used to
drive just to the what I thought was the
right decision and then we just execute
announce that and execute on when when
review came in front and I saw problems
I would critique it I would point out
the problems I still have the
responsibility to point out the problems
but I always try to find a way to do it
in a constructive way because people are
coming to you with the best of their
work and they are they have reasons to
believe what they believe even if you
disagree they get to start with the
premise that they have some reason for
believing it and you need to support
that so before when I review come
through and I thought it was completely
wrong I would tear it apart now when I
come in and I completely disagree I try
to find why they believe what they
believe and I reinforce it I agree with
the premise though I may disagree with
it with the conclusion I make a point to
acknowledge and reiterate what their
premise was and why I agree in playing
politics this is one of the hardest ones
that I've had to deal with in an
environment where you have to play
politics and you can get hurt by by not
playing politics I decided not to play
those games and what I focus on was
build great teams build loyalty have
them execute well and have that support
you right and so that is my my method
for for battling that politics I will I
will say upfront that is not always
successful in a highly political
environment where people other people
are really really good at it and they
have highly functional teams I will be
at a disadvantage but I accept that that
is that is something that in order for
me to hold true with my values
that maybe that environment is not the
right thing for you for me for me so
even as I say this I will then talked
around say not every situation is
winnable the first thing that I learned
I have to do is I have to align my core
values with the environment that I want
to work in
want to succeed in there are some
environments where I cannot and will not
succeed
I need accept that and I need accept
that when I reach that that that arena
that I need to move now I will also say
that it's not one environment for
everything so in the US there's the
American culture an American environment
and then there's Washington State and
then there's Seattle area and then
there's the west side versus East Side
and you might be a West Sider you might
be insider but they're all different
right and there's subcultures and at
some level they need to be harmonious
but they don't need to be the same so
when I was at Microsoft I'll say that I
was in Windows and I have one
environment in one culture and one
values yeah and it it more or less
aligned with Microsoft they had some
disagreements and when I was the mobile
devices
it had very different values it's like
work slightly different and then there
was Xbox it was very very different but
it's they're different environments but
I was compatible with them at certain
realms as a individual contributor what
I saw was the environment of an
individual and their lead was very
different than the environment and value
set that I had when I was a general
manager and I was working with the vice
president's and and general managers so
even within the environment that you
have your values the values of their
environment can change so if you dig
down deep and you evaluate that the
environment is not the right one for you
it doesn't mean that you have to give up
and completely change jobs flip to
another company it means you need to
find the environment and and in a large
corporation it changes from area to area
just like it like the environment
changes from city to city the server the
server both in the US that's the first
thing I'd say align your values and then
understand your skills your
predispositions understand the skills
that you need to develop and go after
those and put the energy into developing
them think about the leaders that you
know
think about the the Asians that you know
so you all come from different companies
so I'll say if I think about the ones I
came from from Microsoft one in Google
our community
Jerry Locke if I think about those
individuals every single one that I can
think of of have the ability to speak in
front of a crowd have very good English
very strong command of communication
those are a couple invariants that as a
leader here to succeed if you don't have
that you have a big strike against you
so invest in those there are others that
are situational though like Gary Locke
has to have certain had to have certain
skills for him to succeed over and above
that executives at at Boeing at
Microsoft at Google at Amazon they all
have to have different skills on
addition that but the ability to
communicate well as in a leadership
position is invariant I promote your
values improve your skills invest the
energy to back up some of the things
I've said and also a couple things that
have really helped me here's a this book
is um is very interesting it talks about
the predispositions what agents tend
toward and how to consider those
presenting the win to win this is a book
given to me by CAI fou when I talked to
him about like man I am just horrible
presenting how do you do it and he said
he gave me this book and it's excellent
I highly recommend that authentic
leadership is a book I read about how to
lead by your values how to understand
the essence of who you are and how it is
very powerful to lead by those values
and then if you hadn't heard of
myers-briggs here's my azmuth how you
saw it and the website which talks to
you a little bit about that
so visit this as I said before this is
about me this is my experience is not
everyone's the same but this is what I
found has been critical for me and
developing my ability to lead lead teams
hope I hope that for you some parts of
it are relevant and you can pick apart
which ones relate to you and apply it to
yourself as well any questions I can
answer yes
so the question is how did I change from
being an individual contributor engineer
to go into a management role did is this
something I asked for or was it
something that it was recommended to to
me I for me it was something I ended up
asking for and it was something a little
bit of a frustration where I was able to
write a lot of code but I was limited by
how quickly my fingers could type and I
wanted to have a bigger impact
I want to effect more of the code and
the way that I sought to do that was to
become a lead and have a few engineers
who I could work with and I could help
design for and own a larger area of the
product so is my desire just to have a
bigger impact on it
I did not realize on the management side
that would tell how much of how much I
would change me it was simply my desire
to essentially write more code by
utilizing the other people other
questions yes
so the question is sure so the question
is um do I enjoy the technical side
better or do I enjoy being a manager
better and that's that's a tricky
question to answer because if I was just
going for sheer fun
day to day I would definitely just write
code I I love writing code I I write
code at home just for fun but where I
get more fulfillment from long term but
I look back and think what's more most
fulfilling for me it's the ability when
I when I get a team to work together and
to really execute well and to achieve a
common purpose at the end of the day
that's extremely fulfilling to me right
and and so that's that's the most fun
long-term but is it at the same time
much more frustrating on a day to day
basis because you're continually having
to debug people and there's just no
debugger that I can hook up to someone
and like dump them their assembly and
patch them so it's much more frustrating
that way but it's much more fulfilling
yes
yeah I can
I missed the last sentence you say
I see so the question is on duty duty
Asian leaders that I do see do they tend
to be american-born or present as
Americans there are many many that fall
in that category
and and I think that those who are
American born or who grew up in America
America they will they have some
advantages as Asians but born in America
that others won't have for example if
you grew up here then your English is
probably a lot cleaner than someone who
grew up went to school went to college
and only came over from from China or
Asia the past five six seven years and
had not really been forced to speak
cleanly all their life so there are some
differences there
however I'll say that there's there are
certainly exceptions that prove that it
can be done it can be done very very
well so for example Chi Fuli he was born
in Taiwan he grew up in Taiwan
he speaks impeccable English he also
speaks impeccable Chinese he will give a
speech and he will use like if you
typical of you here speech especially
had technology computers speech and
Chinese you'll drop into English here
and there you'll hear about two Chinese
and then you hear a word in English a
word in English here - we'll see the
whole thing in Chinese he will use the
Chinese words for names for technologies
he won't say Google he will say cuca
right you would you will absolutely not
speak English when speaking to a Chinese
audience so you can you can write both
sides however this is just back to
predispositions if you were born and
grew up in America
then you have the predisposition
speaking cleaner English it doesn't mean
that you can't do that someone else can
also achieve that but it's just a word
predispositions yes
sorry
but that's a great question so uh and
this this actually goes to one of my
predispositions of I tend to focus in on
on things to fix the problems but the
question is what are some preaches
missions that help us as Asians right
and and that's it that's really a good
question my view on a couple of things
one is that are the typical Asian
culture encourages people to be much
more studious to put in the the
diligence to really go the extra yard to
to work incredibly hard right to think
about the long term those things are
highly highly valued if I so I've run
teams in teams in China and teams in the
US and people are the engineers in China
they will they will wake up at
incredibly late hour early hours in the
morning and stay very very late in order
to bend over backwards to accommodate
the schedules of people in the US
whereas if you want the other way around
I very rarely saw whole teams of people
in America stay till midnight or one
o'clock in the morning to attend a
conference call that's convenient to the
engineers in China the the there's a
preposition of dedication that's I think
ingrained into a typical Asian value set
that I think is incredibly valuable for
us on the amount of study that we have
that at people that we spend a lot of
time in us book study right and that
that is a huge leverage for us that also
then creates not only the the basis of
knowledge but also a work ethic that a
lot of employers really really value I
think that's a lot of the reasons why we
are over represented at the individual
engineering levels so I think that's
that's a great predisposition for us but
we need to take it beyond that yes
um so question is why do I think that
there are so fewer up there is it
because the we don't want we don't want
that or is it or is it something else I
do not think that the issue is that that
we don't want those positions I don't
think that is I think that there are the
two two things that our bucket the
issues in the two parts one is um I'll
speak for myself some of the skills that
I didn't have a weren't predisposed for
were important skills for me to succeed
they were actually important like the
ability to speak in front of a crowd is
an important skill that I must have if I
want to lead a group of 200 people right
so I wasn't comfortable doing it I
wasn't good at doing that that was a
real problem for me right now there are
other ones where I think it's something
that the environment does not appreciate
you need to figure out how to deal with
that so I am not good at the like
real-time debates in the meeting arguing
head-to-head going at it so I am not
good at that but I can still contribute
strongly in those environments and the
way I found do that was I would consider
a thing and afterwards I would I would
write up a very thoughtful evaluation I
would send it to my manager who then
David Creed has read it and he was my
champion so we end up being a great
partner I was I would feed him
information he would represented he
would argue it and he would give me
credit for it and so I was fortunate I
had a manager who valued something that
a lot of other people did not value and
that was that's a problem with the
environment that we need figure out how
to cope with but then there are other
parts which are skill sets that we need
to learn I don't think the issue is that
Asians don't want management positions I
have a hard time believing that or at
least I'll say that there are a lot more
Asians who want those management
positions than they are currently in it
your question up here
I was trying to understand how do you
promote your values how do you do that
how do I promote values
I said well hmm until you have said the
as he is very contributor one I I was
ready well I find for me is that the
vast majority of hard questions that
come to me as a manager as a leader are
actually answered by by my values and
and so the thing for me to do is take
those opportunities to lead my answer
with the values so for example just just
yesterday an engineer my team
he has six weeks of vacation queued up
or five weeks of a large number of
vacation weeks tuned up and so he says
well I'm forced to use them now I take
leave but I really don't want to because
it would cripple save your product I'm
very passionate about it and I don't
really have anywhere to go for five
weeks so so I say you know like the
vacation this as a tax
it's not fair to so put you at it at
sort of disadvantage and take you away
for the thing that you love to do the
vacation thing it's supposed to be
something that helps you rejuvenate and
also it's something to that we should be
fair about so because of that you should
tell me what you want to take your
vacation that you think is fair for um
and for the company give me your plan
and if I agree then we'll do it it means
that you're gonna take some part of it
now and you're gonna roll over more than
what the official rules that allow and
I'll go so what I did was I start off by
saying the way that we should decide
this is based on the principle of
fairness now given that this is what we
should do and I do that for a lot of
things like another one was um there's
this battle
this is battle about how much we should
give like how when we decide about so an
issue
about someone and say okay we're not
going to promote this person we're going
to give them a low score there are
sometimes some tricky information that
you have about do you really like
communicate this to this person do you
really want to let them know all the
feedback that happened right and that
can be a really tricky thing the
position I say was hey we believe in
transparency if you don't tell this
person even if there's a hard heart
message if you don't tell them then you
aren't doing the best for them because I
believe in transparency we should be
telling them eat these things even
though it's really hard right even if
that might mean that they leave the
group leave the company we should do it
so whenever possible I will state my
value of how we should decide first and
then I will state what I think we should
do yes
sorry
um the question is what I recommend
community involvement as a way of
practicing leadership on the one hand I
would say yes but on the other I would
say more of each of us needs to
understand what what works for us for
some people community involvement
volunteering it can be volunteering and
your PTA that maybe that's the right
thing for other people it's uh it's
going to Toastmasters it but that's
something that each of us needs to fit
into how what's comfortable as what what
what will help us and it's very
individual decision now if community
involvement is is something that you're
comfortable with and you're passionate
about then then I do think is actually
quite a good way of doing it on if you
actually work on the leadership part
because you could become like Habitat
for Humanity you could go there and you
go work and you could be a follower in
which case you are not learning a lot
about leadership but you go there on a
volunteer basis and lead he'll decide in
which case you are learning the great
thing about community involvement from
volunteerism is in that environment
everyone is there because they want to
be there they're not there because they
need the salary and so if you're going
to lead them it's going to be because of
they want to follow you right so that's
the powerful thing about volunteering
community involvement if you're able to
lead in that environment where no one is
beholding to you they have no motivation
to follow you other than that they want
to then that's great yes
Oh hahaha sorry this is my Africa
pictures
especially when I observed a lot in EM
people write really high again OB
companies III do so the question is in
Indian the Indian population tends to be
more highly represented in the executive
levels than then Asian than Chinese and
and a sort of sort of Chinese descent
all grouped together I I recognize that
and which is why some of the slides I
pull them out I think that there are a
few differences that really separate
Indian from from the rest of Asia in
this regard
one is that India was a British colony
right English is the official language
of India so from a communication point
of view they have a position that that
that China Chinese people for example
don't also if you understand the culture
more there's more sort of assertiveness
in that culture than there is in a lot
of Asian cultures and those are the two
things that I that I think for me were
big challenges that the IIC either for
myself or for friends that I have and so
for that reason I think that in Indian
population is more highly represented I
think actually is a proof point for a
lot of a lot of what I believe oh well
you should think of think to the the
executives that you know of who are of
Indian descent the ones by large the
ones that I know speak very good English
maybe Asian values like tiny values I
can see these values helping us get to
say a middle management level but at the
same time I see those values sort of
hindering us yeah in the higher level
and as an example if you take a look at
I come from GE and GE adopts a lot of
different groups a lot of people from
different groups from a practical sense
and get their core leadership there are
high leadership tends to be more I guess
European face whereas if you take a look
at a lot of Asian companies we tend not
to have diversity and some way that's
due to that do you think that don't have
difficulty moving to the upper echelon
so the question is your your statement
is that a lot of what I talk about will
help get to middle management but will
that will that cause us to get to the
top executive the CEOs the even the vice
president senior vice president levels I
always find a couple ways and then the
follow-on question is what we really
have to in the end change our core
values in order to get tonight without
the next level or not so I'll say a
couple things one is whether or not you
have to change your core values not
which I don't think that you should I
don't think you have to I will still
assert that in order to get to those
upper levels you still have to become
good at some of these things right these
are a qualifier these won't these won't
propel you there necessarily but I I
assert to you that these are hindrances
that if you don't master them they will
hinder you they won't necessarily just
quit this count and because I you can
you can always overcome with other
stronger stronger things but they will
hinder if we don't if we don't master
the ability to communicate well
right so it's important to at least
qualify to get in the game these things
need to happen will you need to change
your values in order to get the top
levels I don't believe so
and I believe that and I have a core
belief that in the end if you if you
compromise the core of who you are then
then you will always be fighting
yourself and one who fights themselves
has not true themselves cannot can't
really execute well in the end if you're
not true to yourself so you will have to
and if I if I look at a lot of the
executives that I know and who are at
the top levels and who I have high
respect for the the thing I will tell
you is they lead by their values and
they lead by very very good values ones
that I share and ones that I can I
believe in and the places where I think
that there are the biggest fear of gaps
are around additional skill levels if I
look at the in google I look at some of
the top executives that I respect here
at Google I look at myself in comparison
of those those people there are very
clear skill sets that that I aspire for
aspire to to learn and to master that do
not compromise my values side what I
would recommend to you is the book on
authentic leadership and that book talks
about how leading by strong values and
align those two year environment
actually becomes a huge benefit for you
to get to the higher levels and that I
was done by um rid by the CEO of
Medtronic s' yes
sure so questions how did I go about
improving my skills and public speaking
the answer is really for me very simple
two things one is I read the the
presenting the wind book I really took
it to heart I sighed and I really
thought about it I really I really
internalized it and then the second
thing was I just practiced I made myself
get up in front even though I like okay
I could decline I'm not comfortable to
that I don't really want to do it I just
threw myself in there and just practice
and I asked the feedback and then I
listen to feedback
I rate it so just two things the one is
get some something someone to help so I
reached out to one person they gave me
the book I read it I loved it I just did
it I did my practice
so two questions like two-part question
one is if you came in into the u.s.
after after you were passed puberty are
you screwed
and the second is as the world becomes
more international does it really not
matter or is it does the this the
difference I should become an advantage
on the first one I'll say you're not
screwed the studies have shown that is
much harder to learn a language when you
pass puberty right so if you're trying
to learn English for the first time a
pass Beauty you know you might you might
have a hard time unless you're you're
predisposed to have the ability of the
pickup languages however there's no but
no studies that shown that that
articulation is something that you
stopped doing at puberty to be able to
pronounce certain letters it's not
something you lose at puberty but you
need to put the effort in the studies
have only shown that that the parts that
that learn grammar that learn on the
phraseology that part changes I puberty
so I do not believe at all that you're
screwed I believe that it just takes
effort
the second thing of as we become more
international will this all not matter
and I don't know and maybe 20 34 years
from now it won't matter but I I believe
that for the next 3 4 5 10 years it will
matter let's face it America is a very
sort of American centric world country
right
America's believe that that America that
the world kind of spins around America
just like China so what will cause it to
change I think that the mixing of the
worlds will eventually happen I hope I
believe I hope it will eventually happen
but I don't think that that it will
happen in the next decade it's my
personal opinion yes when you move up
the corporate management later my
observation is that the higher you move
up the more technical skill you have to
give up or you get less and less
involvement but instead you get involved
with more and more financial management
company acquisitions or getting to more
involvement with personal issues and so
it becomes a toilet different ball game
you have to play politics and in a sense
it's a lot in a lot of sense of it is
all about numbers everything becomes
more quantifiable in terms of numbers so
that's my observation in the London
Business I'm here but I'm wondering
whether you also see that in your career
yeah oh yeah in the future if you want
to move up toward higher up higher label
within Google do you see the same trend
as well so the question is as you grow
go up the ladder do you need to give up
the technical side and and as you said
in your environment um you have you
potentially have to at least your is
your authorization that you potentially
have to give up the technical side and
become more management more in the
numbers more business oriented so I'll
say that I found that that was largely
true for for certain things as a deaf
manager I was actually writing a lot of
code I wrote more code than the average
deaf manager did so for me that part
wasn't true until I became probably unit
manager
and I switch from a pure technical
discipline to one that manages the
business and that was a choice that I
made at Google my role here as an
engineering director is much much much
more technical than it was when I was a
general manager at Microsoft so I chose
to go into a more technical role and and
follow a company like Google we are we
have engineering that goes all the way
up to the CEO so the engineering goes
that the top management engineer is for
engineering is a developer engineer
reporting to the CEO so that's how this
this this company works and it's
something that I chose because I valued
that so so it certainly is true for many
corporations it is is not true for all
and each of us has to make a choice as
to what we value
yes
karate or the weakness you look for
another way you can see is you have to
find a suitable environment because like
financial company
right so so common is I need to find an
environment that is suitable matches
yours and you need to address your
weaknesses and in the core that's that
is a message and that that's kind of the
obvious one over hey find our
environment is compatible with you find
out weaknesses are and work on them I
that's that's always a recipe for how
you should go up the ladder so I agree
with that but my message to you is as
Asians we have a certain set of
predispositions that I did not really
think about internalized until I went
through this one class and then then I
saw okay it's not just me but this is
this is this code that was born with or
that I grew up with in my family that
causes me to behave one way and my goal
here is to bring your attention to those
specific ones as as important ones for
us to address
so the questions for a team of for me
how do i as a leader defined what
successes and I have my metrics of what
I think the team should accomplish and
in the end of the day for me if I
believe that the team works together
really well and execute efficiently then
I believe in success so as I talk to to
my direct reports one of the things I
harp on is even though we're an
engineering team our number one job is
to build a great team our number one job
is not to build a great product our job
is to build a great team a great team
we'll build a great product no one else
other than me my direct reports can
build the team the engineers the line
engineers they can build a product
there's our job to build a team so my
value of teamwork like I lead by that
our job is to build a great team
if the if we build a high functioning
team that enjoys working together that
is efficient that cooperates well to
each other with each other then that's
my number one metric that that we have
succeeded and then I think byproducts
will be lots of great products so any
question so how do i system bot
surviving these well you know I'll say
that when I was a DEP manager I didn't
know I didn't recognize and believe that
and so I drove hard to just create the
great product and I'll say that all
right
in Pocket PC 2002 this is one of the
projects that it was a very hard project
and and we got out the door but at the
end of that project we had a large
amount of attrition it was my fault
because I drove the team very very hard
I didn't build a good team and so I had
a hard time building a great product in
2003 I had a hard time for my great
product and that was a wake-up call to
me that says long-term if you want to
build a great product if you want to win
on all those other metrics you can't
focus on that you need to focus on the
engine
that does that right so I had a rude
awakening around that your 2002 or 2003
when I drove an engineering team to the
ground and had about 30 percent
attrition after the release so the
question is about develop model on
Google versus a Microsoft I you know I
think that is a topic for another time
there they're very there are some
interesting differences there are some
interesting differences being there too
but I think that's beyond the scope we
should talk about today yes there's a
lot of truth to that and there's an
article is reading the other day how do
how do American kids learn how to play
politics
well what's what is recognized and
valued in a Chinese culture for students
people who study hard get good grades
what's recognized well and and value in
American culture
who's the class president who's on a
student council right so so we're you
trained early to go through these
different things right so so I think
there's a lot to do with the upright
ring is it is that nurtures a nature it
might be both but but my theory what I
believe in with some of the literature
that I've read centers around the
education system that's backed by our
values right we value IQ and a lot of a
Asian cultures we value studying we
value high grades like American culture
we value popularity
right it's values its values other
questions yes
so so what do I think about going to the
NBA and going that route of management
leadership versus going technical and
going that route that will depend on on
you as individual and how you learn for
as for me I'm not a good student I don't
think that going to going for classes
would be the right path for me
but sir on-the-job was something that
worked for me so I think that's a very
personal question but in any case
whichever route you go if you end up
going to leader lead and have a team to
lead I'll say that I think no matter
what route you have to go you have to be
a good communicator right you have to be
able to get your point across well it's
not what you say it's how you say it
okay well thank you very very much
