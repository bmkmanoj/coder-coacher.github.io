larger room we really didn't know that
we'd have such a great crowd but thank
you very much for coming
I'm Peter Allen I'm the director of
Google University and I'm honored to
invite today introduce Charles Nesson
the professor at Harvard Law School the
founder of the Berkman Center for
Internet and Society which focuses on
the legal study of cyberspace
he has many great legal credentials
which I'm going to skip over I will
mention that he's a graduate of both
Harvard College and a summa laude a
graduate of Harvard Law School where
he's been a member of the faculty since
1966 he is also a founder of the global
poker strategic thinking society which
focuses on developing an academic
curriculum that uses poker as a teaching
tool Charlie has been an active player
in some of the most high-stakes episodes
in recent legal history among his many
accomplishments he hit the jackpot
litigating the case white V crook which
made race and gender based Kure
selection the Alabama unconstitutional
and defending Daniel Ellsberg in the
Pentagon Papers case I'm as happy to
welcome him here as if I drew an
ace-high flush on the river Charles
Nesson Andrew woods poker teaches thank
you very much Peter so I'm a child of
the 60s who've smoked too much grass
back then and really never has stopped
and I got into this poker stuff on a
sabbatical at one point in 1980 when I
ordered an IBM PC and waited for it to
be delivered and I had learned Pascal
thinking that I would do some
programming and when it came of course
it didn't have Pascal that turned out to
be vaporware but it did come with basic
and I wound up programming five-card
draw Jack's a better poker in basic and
found myself fascinated with the
bluffing algorithm it's like my major in
math in college was mathematics and I
had had the experience of programming on
univac one when I was an undergraduate
and then to be able to actually write a
program that played reasonable five-card
draw
jacks are better was just an amazing
thing to me I got into the internet
really 1994 in my law class I teach a
class called evidence which is like an
amphitheater Harvard Law School class
about how you prove the truth in court
and was blessed with a small grant that
let me get a bunch of computers into the
classroom I've rented 20 Quadra machines
and for my students into groups of eight
and had them work on these machines to
do projects and then we brought them
into the classroom and actually
networked them all together and it was
it was our first learning network
experience and the idea of combining an
interest in poker which to me is like a
fascination as as game theory as
strategic game poker is the
quintessential strategic game and if you
if you're into thinking of games as
languages for perhaps more complicated
things that has simplified forms that
allow you to think about more
complicated subjects poker as a
strategic game is just a surpassingly
eloquent I want to introduce you to
Andrew I met Andrew at a poker
tournament held at Harvard Law School it
was a charity tournament done for the
benefit of our public service auction in
which hundred plus students and faculty
all put up 20 bucks played that
tournament through to conclusion one
winner note no financial prize all money
go
to charity and Andrew was the son of a
bitch who put me out of the tournament
and we got started on this global poker
strategic thinking society which I'm
going to ask him to tell you about the
next year when we weren't allowed to do
that tournament because our general
counsel told us it was illegal and I got
pissed and the result of that is we have
in a sense started an enterprise one of
the objectives one of the objectives of
which is to legitimate poker as a
genuine educational enterprise for me I
see it as the basis of the distance the
scalable distance education environment
that I in the Berkman Center hope to
lead Harvard into poker to me is just
the most wonderful way to engage young
minds and expands people's thought so
here I want to ask Andrew Andrew come
forward and tell us about GPS TS well oh
you've got it Mike good the first thing
I have to say is it it's just as well
that they canceled the poker tournament
I think it's a shame they told us it was
illegal but in the tournament where I
met professor Ness and I had no idea was
a professor I thought it was just some
crazy old guy sitting across from me at
a poker table and there came a place
where he'd pushed all in and I had a
better hand and I asked him I said you
know and he said I'm a professor and I
said what do you teach he said I teach
you evidence and I said well I'm gonna
teach I'm gonna take evidence next year
and I said if I put you out of this
tournament if I beat you will you give
me an A in your class and he said sure
so did Oh believe me cuz I made sure to
thank your class it gave me a b-plus
I was a little frustrated by that yeah
unbelievable right so after that I took
the opportunity to have dinner with
Professor nessam with a couple of other
students and we started talking poker
mostly because I was upset that I hadn't
gotten my a and when we were talking
about poker we started talking about the
number of students that we knew at
Harvard Law School that we'd run into
would played poker quite seriously we
played a lot of Poker then who had gone
on and left the poker world and gone on
to law school and had been incredibly
successful at the law school and in that
experience and what we came to realize
is that there's this incredible parallel
between the type of thinking that allows
you to succeed at poker and the type of
thinking that allows you to succeed in
the law school environment and by proxy
the legal environment and we started
talking about what those skills were and
professor nessam came with the idea of
why don't we get together some great
poker players and let's get together
some great academics and some very
intelligent people and put him in a room
and so on April 24th I believe it was of
this year we convened a meeting at
Harvard Law School and we had Howard
letter and Annie Duke and Andy Bloch in
attendance to represent the professional
poker players we had the executive
director of the time of the poker
players Alliance there we had the head
of Harvard's division of addictions we
had
a very important consideration yeah we
had a signalling expert from MIT there
to discuss the ways in which the human
face can give away information and we
convened these people among with an
artificial intelligence programmer and
some others individuals to study poker
and after a day-long session what we
came out of it was that there's this
incredible need and this incredible
thirst to investigate this very useful
very interesting game from that
conference was born this idea of why
don't we get together students all over
the place and give them an opportunity
to learn from this to study the game to
have some fun talking about it exploring
the various ways and I said great
professor will start poker clubs
everywhere and he said great he's like
but but they shouldn't be poker clubs
because poker is only a tool it's like a
carpenter with a hammer you don't call
it hammer e you call it carpentry and so
we we should call it something else than
a poker club we should call it a poker
thinking Club it's about thinking but it
but its strategic it's a strategic game
so I said okay the poker strategic
thinking clubs no no no it's a society I
said a society ok whatever and he said
but it's where everywhere this this
poker thing it cuts across all
boundaries of race and religion and and
in nationalism and everyone loves it and
gender people love play which should be
global the global poker strategic
thinking society I said that's a
horrible name and he said well I already
ordered the stationery so we have this
great concise name the global poker
strategic thinking society which I think
focuses exactly on what we're doing and
the goals of our organization are this
we have four basic tenets the first one
is to start and encourage the
development of clubs and chapters at
universities around the country and
around the world
we've had an extraordinary amount of
interest we launched on August 22nd in
Singapore since then we've either have
registered as student groups or
developing 18 to 20 groups around the
country another four or five in
Singapore and an Iceland in the UK we've
had interest everywhere and we're
continuing develop that we're developing
a speaker series an educational
curriculum bringing in speakers to talk
about issues surrounding poker to talk
about how poker communicates life skills
we had howard letter come to harvard and
talk we're sponsoring Annie Duke at UCLA
on Friday sheriff I guess that's
tomorrow she's talking about gender
roles in cycle
we had Mike Sexton in to talk and Jim
McManus an author all talking about the
ways in which poker communicates skills
that have allowed them to succeed at a
poker table but also communicate skills
that allow you to succeed in the larger
world
we've also convened conferences we had
an academic conference last year and
we're gonna do another one in the spring
probably here at Stanford and the idea
being that let's call some academic
attention to these games and the fourth
thing we're doing is just providing
students a place to have some fun
playing amateur poker exec submissions
playing games where schools take on
schools Harvard played Yale last week
UCLA's played in USC tomorrow next year
we'll have Stanford playing Cal and
their version of the big game and the
idea being that these games are fun
and it's a great opportunity for people
to explore the types of strategic
thought that are in poker while being
able to have some fun and engage in a
game that can really engage students in
learning and continuing to evolve types
of thinking so that's basically what the
GPS TAS has done so far and kind of
where we're moving going forward but let
me focus on the thinking part in my
class to my students I don't start with
poker I start with the idea of what
truth is in a rhetorical environment how
two-sided it is how there's always two
sides to a story and how important it is
in trying to persuade someone else that
you're capable of seeing their story
from their point of view and
articulating that to them so that they
understand that you understand their
problem it's only at that point that
they start listening to you before that
they're just tuning you out and I use
poker as a way of focusing this thought
of seeing from another's point of view
but first I start with a riddle that I
would love to give to you and see how
you do with it so here's a riddle Once
Upon a Time Queen lived in a kingdom
that she rules with an iron hand
you're supposed to laugh when the Queen
lives in the kingdom she had a son that
she wanted to marry the most intelligent
perceptive woman in the kingdom so she
gathered all the eligible women together
and gave them the law school aptitude
test and three of them scored perfectly
so she had to choose from amongst these
three she brought them to the palace and
sat them around a round table and gave
them the following instructions I'm
about to blindfold you once you're
blindfolded I'm going to put a hat on
your head small little hat so that you
won't be able to see the Hat on your own
head but when you open your eyes with
the blindfolds off you will see the hats
on the heads of the other two now here's
what you must do when the blindfold is
taken off I'm telling you in advance I
am going to place on your hat your head
either a red hat or a white hat when
your blindfold is taken off if you see
one or two red hats you're to raise your
hand all right now do we understand the
setup the blindfold is going to come off
I'm not going to be able to know what
colors the head on my hat it's either
red or white if I see one red hat I
raise my hand or if I see two red hats
I raise my hand and the Queen says the
first of you that can tell me the color
of the Hat on your head take your hand
down stand up and marry my son explain
why she then put red hats on each of the
three and then took off the blindfolds
and immediately of course
seeing two red hats each each of them
raised their hand and they sat at the
table looking at each other for five
seconds 10 seconds 15 seconds and then
one young woman took down her hand stood
up and said I have a Red Hat on my head
and she explained why how did she know
put your hands up when you get the
riddle I just want to just just see how
fast it happens here so let me say about
poker as you're letting this noodle in
your heads the point in poker where you
become a poker player is the point at
which you look up from your own hand
when people start learning poker their
first preoccupation is their own cards
is if I got a straight or a flush what
is to pair beat up one pair what is it
all these things they're looking they're
like this the point at which you start
to play poker is the point at which
you're more interested in what is
happening around you you've got time
wait you can look at your hand just
about any time that point where you
start to look and see what's happening
in the environment and as the game
unfolds you start to see how the others
at the table are seeing you that's when
the poker game really starts so how many
hands up with the Red Hat's who's going
to explain it to us stand up over here
and loud and clear each of them have to
assume that the other ones are perfect
logicians also if there's only one red
hat then one person will have their hand
down and two person people will have
their hand up and they'll be able to
figure it out I know that if there's two
if it's
right right so that's not right um I
have it in my head I can't give it I
know what's going on it's kind of it's
not this is what my mother taught me as
a young lawyer look she said Charlie
it's not what you think of going home in
the cab that counts the other ones will
have figured it out too and since the
other ones haven't figured it out they
have gained information from the fact
that the other people haven't figured it
out I actually have a different solution
I have a different solution
all you have to do is say for this test
to be fair we all have to have the same
color of hat and since I see red hats
mine's red too you're absolutely right
that's not the right edge if she had
white hat then other participants would
have figured that they had red hat
because everybody like everywhere else
sitting raise their hands rody is seeing
some red hat and now if I have white at
and this guy is raising hand that means
they both are they both are raising
hands and nobody is standing up that
means they are confused as well see what
I mean if I had if we three are playing
I have white at you to have red hats and
if with all three are raising our hands
that means I am sure he is seeing your
heart using your hair but you both you
both are kind of you both are not
standing up that means you are also
confused that who why you are not
standing up and since you are not
standing up that means I also have red
hat because you're confused
one more one more
I think there's a base assumption that
all three people are approximately
equivalently smart and they took the
test they passed it so so you can't
assume that somebody has not figured it
out if they if the facts are playing
then everybody would have figured it out
but that's not the case which means that
for example if you or two are wearing
red hats that I'm wearing a white hat
and you have raised your hand but you
have not figured it out yet right that
means that I that you cannot possibly
wearing a white hat right because you're
not wearing the right because it because
you know you know that you're not
wearing a white hat because if you were
wearing a white hat I wouldn't be
raising my hand no no right so it he
pretty much know that except for the
last part which is if if they were
indeed two white hats he would have seen
two white hats since if I'm wearing a
white hat and both of you are raising
your hands and he would see two white
hats and he would not have raised his
hand the fact that he's raised his hand
and equivalently you have raised your
hand therefore there's got to be at
least two red does that make sense well
no well I'm trying to prove that they
aren't too white and if I can prove that
then no from from the perspective of
these guys well from the perspective of
the two of you if you see two White's
you would not raise your hand is that
correct and and you right and and the
only reason both of you are doing it is
because there is an additional red that
you see let's say I'm raising my hand
very strict around here so there's only
two possibilities right I can either
have a red hat or a white hat so if I
have a white hat this means that you
will see a white hat and a red hat and
he will see a white Hydra head also so
which means that you must you will
figure out you have a red hat because
you wouldn't know that I have a white
hat and you have a red hat because
you'll see the red hat but you also
raise your hand so he must have a red
hat so the hypothetical you're
describing right Charlie and I both have
red hats on and you have a white hat on
is that right because there's only two
possibilities either white or red that's
right because you would know that
because you'll see a red and a white and
therefore since I raise my hand you must
have a red notice how it starts I'm
confusing myself right so you see a
white in a red and
I had it just a second ago I just got I
just confused myself right and your
handout he will figure out that's right
you lose your cap there to some extent
though what you've just described is the
step that poker players have to take in
order to be successful is that what the
point at which you realize it is what
hat you're wearing is completely
irrelevant it only matters what your
opponent sees if they had seen a white
hat on you and a red hat then they would
have figured it out and you would have
lost already the fact that they're
confused means that you must be learned
that everyone must be wearing a red hat
because the rules of the game work with
everyone's hand in the air if all three
are red or if there's two reds and a
white so all the information you have is
that you know there's at least two Reds
out there if there was one more white
hat than one of your opponent's would
have figured it out you would have
already lost so in this case it's a case
of stop trying to figure out what you
can see you know you can see two red
hats start trying to figure out what
your opponent must be seen in order for
them to act the way they are this is the
very same thing that happens in a poker
game what you have the strength of your
hand is only relevant in terms of the
strength of your opponent's hands your
position whether you have a pair of aces
in a poker hand and then it comes out
that there's four cards to a flush and
you don't have the fifth card to that
flush suddenly your aces aren't as
strong as they were in real-world
situations in a case where you may think
you start in a strong position or you
may think that your position is strong
because of the own merits that you
assigned your hand
only worth as much as you as the
opposing parties think it is the
flexibility of thought and being able to
see your own self from the perspective
of others be able to assess your
position unemotionally and from a
perspective that your opponent's see it
is a key element in developing business
skills legal skills litigation type
skills negotiation all of those
components interpersonal relations etc
etc all of those components are based on
the ability to understand how you're
perceived and be able to understand what
the other parties in any transaction are
thinking so let me say why I think this
should be exciting to Google the part of
this that's exciting to me is the
prospect of poker as a driver for open
education that to me is tremendous goal
that's still in front of us as a teacher
I know that the key to scalability is
solving the problem it's like any good
any good trick it's got two slights you
have to put something out that's really
engaging and poker is certainly that but
you then also have to be able to
aggregate response coming back to you
from a mass audience in a way that
allows you to respond to it and create
the loop that in is involved in a
teacher sending out a stimulus message
stimulating a response and then the
teacher responding to it and so working
through the Berkman Center largely we've
been working to really try and figure
out the distance education problem and
working with tools to try and aggregate
response coming back so that a teacher
can actually deal with it so to me poker
has the following amazing quality it's
got huge appeal it's a magnificent game
it's the quintessential strategic game
it's the first game it's the game on
which von Neumann focused when he wrote
his original game theory papers
its strategic let's get the taxonomy
straight there are games of chance
those are games that you cannot lose
purposely those are games where there is
nothing strategic on the other side
you're playing solitaire or you're
playing roulette or you're playing
something of that order there can be
some skill in a game of chance in
learning the best odds against whatever
is offered to you that's possible there
are some games of chance which have no
skill whatsoever like the slots and okay
that those are the kinds of games that
have been those have caused difference
over the years as to whether those are
good things or bad things edicts against
playing lotteries lotteries are on one
view a way in which hope is sold to poor
people at bad odds and therefore is
exploiting and you can have a position
against it from another point of view
lotteries sell an amazing product to
poor people namely Hope which nobody
else is offering them so it's a pretty
damn good product from another point of
view nonetheless you get into games of
skill and there are two kinds of skill
games that we're talking about poker is
the quintessential strategic game in
which winning the game depends upon
evaluating an opponent's play and
anticipating it that's the key to it and
that's a key to so much in the life of
lawyers and so all the way through life
that here's this this wonderful
quintessentially American game that
through Internet has been extended
across the world in a development that
has huge muscle in it there's as almost
as much muscle in poker as there is in
pornography as a spreader of of Internet
and yet here is an environment that
generates money so from my educators
point of view I am look
for business models that will support
the development of the open net I'm
looking for business models that will
support open education and I can see a
potential unity of interest with Google
I think I see it in that it is to
Google's advantage if there is a vibrant
explosive educational searchable
environment on the net if you think of
Harvard education coming up on the net
its videos now with technology I was
just reading about from MIT searchable
word searchable through audio
recognition software so that you can
search a video and get right to the
words the part of the lecture where the
teacher speaks if you imagine the wealth
of university education available open
on the nest it's good for the search
business I would think because people
like to search and so I'm looking for
ways of interesting Google in what we're
doing I would love to do some kind of I
don't know whether you do them some
forms of conference where we actually
talk strategy and a longer level and I
we teach poker and do a poker tournament
or something of that variety that would
be a kind of corporate learning
enterprise kind of focusing on the core
idea and I'm sure that if you put your
minds to work you would see any number
of other ways in which a linking of
Google with a Harvard based enterprise
educational game based driving internet
would be a plus it there's the
additional interest from my point of
view of poker being the most wonderful
law subject it the poker is interesting
from a lawyer's point of view at every
level from the institutional level of my
school how does my school feel about
having a global poker strategic thinking
society and what constraints are put on
it to
my town Cambridge which has a
commissioner that wants to get a license
for me to play charity poker - my state
which calls poker a lottery and a game
of chance to my national government
which discriminates against online poker
to a point where the World Trade
Organization has now held us up for
contempt and habla qui and to
international law it's now we're now
we're now out of step with the rest of
the world in terms of online gaming
America which should be the source I
mean thinking in diplomatic terms poker
quintessentially American excitement
around the world about it the world
wanting to play and yet it's illegal in
the United States the United States
trying to repress it
it just seems so so strange to me so
poker has this extremely interesting
quality to it of interest at every level
and as a teacher it just has been a
godsend to me it's lit the last part of
my career up and I hope we can really
put it across so at this point I would
love to open up for questions and just
spend the rest of the time was back and
forth Andrew in any event when when you
talk about education you talk about
poker poker has the unique ability of
engaging people in developing thought in
a way that's really fun which is
something that at times is missing from
a regular education I mean when I
learned when I took my math classes they
weren't always as dynamic or as fun to
me as some of my other classes or minot
classes as I called my time when I
wasn't in school but the key of it is is
that poker teaches a flexibility of
thought and teaches skills that are very
useful poker is really when you think
about it the natural evolution of sport
sport began you know when we want to had
skills we wanted to encourage youth to
develop when we had skills that we
wanted to maintain its
Society the Olympics were about the
javelin throw about running about times
when we wanted to be able to develop the
skill and men to throw a spear a long
ways and run really quickly and throw a
brick aways and things like that
nowadays it's not as useful to me to be
able to throw a spear always I mean I
very rarely go boar hunting with a spear
I mean that's just not something that I
do on the flip side it's incredibly
useful to me to be able to make good
unemotional decisions that have
realistic considerations about numeracy
and probability and elements that are
common to a poker game elements that I
developed when I have to be able to play
poker be able to really understand what
my skill level is be able to pick an
arena to do battle and be able to
understand when other players are better
than me because I'm not that good of a
poker player but I understand that so
I'm able to play at levels where I am
better than the players that I'm better
at or that I'm playing with and so poker
teaches a development of what I call
situation assessment decision control
the ability to really understand where
you sit in a negotiation whether it's at
a poker table if you take that to the
metaphysical level and you're talking
about a negotiation or if you're talking
about international diplomacy and the
interactions between nations
understanding the rules of the game and
understanding the point of offer and
counteroffer or bet and raise and more
than anything else understanding when to
fold what separates a good poker player
from a bad poker player is the use of
the fold when is a situation too risky
when is the return not going to be
beneficial to you when is it a time to
just say look it's dead money cut my
losses and run that skill is something
that I don't see being taught in
traditional education in a way that's
engaging to students and poker by using
a tool a game that's so engaging teaches
resource management teaches all these
these issues risk assessment in a way
that really engages students and it's
something that I think I'm sure most of
you who played poker once or twice how
many people play poker in this room
way to go I've got a question in the
back there
go for it
we should get you on the mic here um one
thing that makes it interesting is
things like risk preference and risk
aversion but there you have to have real
resources at stake and so when you have
real resources at stake the whole
question of gambling and the various
kinds of ethical questions that come up
around gambling come up and so I'm
wondering from a philosophical
standpoint when you think about you know
policy in the United States sort of
being behind the rest of the world in
this regard I think there's a lot of
ethical considerations in there how do
you see overcoming some of those you
know preconceptions that people have
there's absolutely no question
whatsoever that compulsive gambling and
gambling and of itself are issues that
need to be dealt with in a way that
makes sense that need to be talked about
and need to be be really discussed in a
common-sense way right now what we do in
this country is we say things like poker
craps roulette blackjack those things
are bad forms a gamble either putting
your money on the stock market is a
responsible choice let's do let's pick
Social Security let's return the money
to the people so they can invest it on
their own in the stock market that's a
good decision that's something that we
recommend as a nation and yet I don't
necessarily know if most people have
sufficient levels of education to be
able to engage the market in a way that
makes sense
or if they're taught that way you talk
about things like addiction
well addictions an issue and it should
be dealt with I would say that there are
statistics that prove there that
suggests that the levels of addiction in
poker aren't nearly as high as they are
in games of chance in games where
there's a big payout like a lottery or a
games like a roulette wheel if you put
it on your double zero and it hits it
pays 35 to 1 poker is a fundamentally
different game because there's no house
there's no big payoff you're just
playing against another player but that
the addiction question remains but their
addiction at all levels of society I
mean Google I've searched on Google
or oftentimes it sends me to amazon.com
or a similar thing like that there
aren't very many restrictions about how
much stuff I can run up on my credit
card bill I would say that the addiction
to shopping addictions like that are
things that we need to deal with as a
society and right now we do a miserable
job of approaching them in any level of
education so when you talk about poker
yes addiction and gambling are issues
and they need to be dealt with but
taking a tool like poker and throwing it
to the side because there's a danger in
it doesn't make much sense it's like
asking a carpenter to build a house
without using a hammer
because here's the potential to hit his
thumb with this hammer well I mean I
think it has to do with a couple of
things
write to me let me have a shot in nope
the politics of poker are totally
fascinating at this point because
they're mixed up with the politics of
gambling more broadly and the politics
of gambling more broadly is mixed up
with a bunch of other stuff so the big
drivers as far as poker is concerned has
clearly been the television success of
the tournament poker play which has
brought home to millions of Americans
the picture of poker is a fairly benign
thing you don't you know as you're
watching those television things you may
be bored but you don't have the feeling
that you're watching evil it just you
don't come away with a moral twist in
your stomach like you've just been
watching something bad and so I think
that a tremendous change has taken place
in the public from the game having the
image that came out of the early days
poker poker comes out of a gambling
background no doubt about it and a
fascinating one that migrates with Texas
Hold'em migrates from Texas to Las Vegas
is connected with the casinos and
organized crime is prosecuted out of the
Justice Department as part of the
overall gambling spectrum of you know
culture that's there but poker goes
through a transition in the public mind
at least I think it's still in process
stimulated heavily by this huge success
television and the huge success of
online poker all right people who play
you know twopenny five penny poker on
their laptops in their bedrooms it's
hard to convince them that they're doing
something evil
it just doesn't just doesn't feel it on
the other hand politically separating
poker from any other kind of gambling
runs up against strong libertarian
arguments the basic libertarian argument
is I into any damn thing I want whether
it's poker or a game of chance or
pornography or any other thing you can
do in your house including a lot of
physical things that the Supreme Court
now says I can do in my house if I want
so the the problem of articulating the
subject at a higher level of
sophistication than has been the case in
the past is to me the political problem
of putting it across now it's like you
used to just be able to say gambling and
all right the right wing will turn out
against it but boy when you look at that
now the churches run bingo when you look
at the bingo stuff in the churches it
looks pretty much like a casino when
they're running it and the states are
running lotteries like 40 states running
lotteries and you know and what state
that isn't doing casino isn't thinking
about doing it because why do we let the
Indians make the money and all that sort
of thing so I think we're in a very
dynamic time and I think that poker
potentially can be one of those things
where you go from having your first
thought about it being gambling bad evil
negative reaction politicians don't want
to be associated with it to a much more
positive image I was very pleased when
Obama came out as a poker player you
know it's like okay it's okay to be a
poker player
of course our presidents have been poker
players and I mean it's amazing when you
actually look at the history of the game
yes
so when I was a kid when I was younger I
used to play five-card stud seven-card
stud five-card draw five stud high-low
with one card draw at the end and so
forth nowadays poker is virtually
synonymous with Texas Hold'em so I want
to know I'm actually ignorant in these
matters
why did this happen how did it happen in
is it a good thing or a bad thing happen
for two reasons the the first of which
is probably the more important one is
television Texas Hold'em is the in one
sense the simplest form of Poker two
cards down five cards up you can teach
it and you know what do they say it
takes a minute to learn the lifetime to
master it's something that can be taught
and is very easy for people to
understand so for television reasons it
works well from a poker players
perspective Texas Hold'em is the ideal
game because you get four opportunities
to influence the action in a poker game
for those who may not know there's an a
Texas holding me at least this preflop
action flop turn river each time there's
a round of betting so in terms of poker
much more than five card draw are some
of the stud games you have four
opportunities for skill to rise to the
rise to the top because in poker the
skills and the betting pricing your hand
appropriately how do you price your hand
at the appropriate level to induce you
to the opposing party to do what you
want them to do how do you price at an
appropriate level to get them to buy or
how do you price at an appropriate level
to get them to fold and so if you have
four opportunities to do that in Texas
Hold'em so it's a better game for that
purposes
so in your example you gave in the
puzzle you gave you kind of assumed that
I'm playing poker against people who are
roughly of the same intelligence as I am
and who roughly think the same way I am
and this is clearly not the case I will
be playing against some people who are
dumb or some people who were smarter
some people who have completely
different ways how does your strategy
work with I'm not working with logicians
I'm not working with people that I know
how they're going to view my cards well
I would say there there's a couple of
different points on that the first one
of which is the riddle is designed to
demonstrate a type of thinking or a
concept that's integral to a poker
success the second thing I would say is
that oftentimes how players act
something we call table image your
reputation as it were and you can trade
on that the same way you can trade on
any commodity so how the perception you
develop of your opposing players that
they're smarter than you that they're
dumber than you it's something that
affects how you act this is exactly why
poker is such a good game for teaching
strategic thought because just like this
in a market situation in any situation
you're gonna be dealing with opposing
parties some of whom are better than you
some of who are worse than you which
will affect which markets you choose to
enter which will affect what how you
interact with these people and the way
that reputation develops is a very
interesting thing and it's something
that poker players often try to
cultivate very specific reputations they
want to be what's called a tight
aggressive player maybe I don't play
very many hands but when I play I'm
gonna get you to pay me a lot or
something which is meant in part to
scare people away from hands that you
don't want them to bet on but all these
reputational facts are skills and
strategies that develop at the table
precisely because there are various
types of play and various types of
people and this is one of the reasons
why poker so good at modeling some of
the other interactions in law there is
the image for example of the country
lawyer
I'm just a country lawyer it's like
watch out when somebody tells you
they're just the country lawyer right
yeah there must be something similar in
engineering that is the presentation of
a low-key posture on the part of someone
who is in fact deeply sophisticated and
is about to clean your clock in some
fashion ORS
is engineering not competitive in that
in that way look around the room I mean
as a corporate Google's probably one of
the most important corporations in the
world in terms of corporate prestige and
the influences had the dress code here
is slightly more relaxed than most
fortune 500 companies I've only walked
around here for a couple of minutes and
I've been to several like law firms and
things like that very rarely do they
have an organic garden in the middle of
them the office and it's a very
different perception but why why does
Google make those decisions why are you
trying to project that image what are
you doing in terms of from a management
level returning employees and keep an
employment happiness high what are you
doing in terms of a competitor's thing
as your competitors or your business
partners come here what are you trying
to project your business partner who
comes here for a meeting
walks around and sees kids zooming
around on scooters I mean I think the
average age here is like 14 I don't know
how young the people are at work here
but I mean you know what are you trying
to project I mean it seems to me that
it's look our results speak for
ourselves you can take us you know we're
incredibly smart people we don't have to
dress up to impress you I mean I'm you
know one of the only people here wearing
a suit so I mean I'm trying to impress
people tell me
um she said one thing I'm minor point
but I'm curious about it said your
charity poker tournament was declared
illegal now I happen to live in
Massachusetts for a number of years so I
know one other factoids so my question
is why is playing back a man for money
legal but plain poker isn't we actually
we oversimplifies the tad it wasn't that
it was exactly illegal what happened was
the Massachusetts State Attorney General
released an opinion letter that's a that
for their considerations they thought
poker was a lottery which gave the local
municipalities the authority to decide
how they wanted to deal with it
Cambridge took the most conservative
stance which required any 501c3 or any
nonprofit organization to apply for and
get a permit before they're able to hold
a charity poker tournament in this case
so we couldn't hold it without going and
getting a permit so it was illegal to
hold the turn without getting a permit
that permits difficult to get to making
assumptions and say yeah so you say that
you want students to learn like the
strategy and the things behind poker
there's also a mathematical side say say
kids in in high school you know the odds
of some you hitting a certain hand or
something like that how would you see I
guess government reacting to teaching
high schoolers how to play poker when
it's illegal I mean we teach kids how to
drive before they're 16 but that's
illegal drive different things first of
all poker is not really illegal it's
restricted in some races it's not
illegal anywhere in California I mean
Bay one Oh one's like three blocks from
here right some of you may have been
there but the point is is that like when
it comes down to when you talk about
teaching poker it's always going to be a
politically sensitive issue right now
poker still essentially being chastised
for the neighborhood it grew up in poker
came out of Vegas came out of the Wild
West came out of you know
slurs and card sharks and all this stuff
and that's that's still kind of hanging
over the game so it's going to be
politically sensitive but the more you
unpack the game the more you see there's
really nothing morally objectionable no
more morally objectionable playing poker
than it is to playing chess and I think
that carries over when I say things now
like poker is really much closer to
chess than it is to craps that resonates
people say okay that makes sense to me
and so I think that that perception is
changing all it's gonna take is school
districts being comfortable with it and
parents being comfortable and teachers
being comfortable introducing this game
which can really ensure students in
concepts of numeracy and things like
that so um a couple of things that this
reminded me of do you familiar with
Aaron Browns the poker face of Wall
Street one of the things he said in it
because you were saying that poker is
this dodgy background but what he says
in there was that poker was the original
venture capital environment because
people would be able to go into there
and come out with money and start a
business and it was a way of shutting a
shuffling money around in the community
literally literally was I suppose one of
these key points in the book so just
make sure that you get him to speak of
this new annex conference cause he's I
actually haven't read his book yet I
picked it up in Barnes &amp;amp; Noble the other
day and I made a note on my PDA to go
find him try to track him down and the
other person is Jane McGonigal who I
think Charlie you've met before
who's she does lots of work on game
design in development and she's the
person who's responsible for getting
everyone tech courses playing werewolf
which is like I don't know if you know
werewolf but it's like poker without any
any odds at all it's just pure bluffing
and that she'd be a great person talked
about this because there she can guide
you to other games that may be more
acceptable to people that the you can
stage and a poker</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
