hi a from the National Institute of
material science in Subic Japan thank
you right thank you very much
first of all I would like to thank
hartmut neven for organizing this and
also Stuart for taking this all the hard
work and making this a possibility and I
will talk about remarkable electronic
properties of a microtubule so here is
the outline of my talk so I will talk
about frolic condensation and
microtubule most of which has already
been said by Professor Pokorny and then
I will talk about Gordon transport in
microtubule and temperature independent
conductivity of microtubule then
detection of topological qubit in
microtubule then Euler ferroelectric
property of microtubule this prediction
was done by Jack suzunskiy and then
dynamic instability and finally I will
conclude so microtubule basically is is
a polymer made by proteins and it has
three concentric layer of cylinders so
on top of another and the inner core is
water water
channel and on top of it we have tubulin
dimers rolling around and then and
extreme outer surfaces ionic layers so
if we just think of microtubule as a as
a physicist who wants to think of energy
terms say alternating signal frequency
if we sent through microtubule what will
happen so we have to basically divide
the microtubule into three functional
parts the outer layer is ionic part so
basically kilohertz range signal makes a
resonance with the outer surface then we
have the dipolar protein part which is
which responds nearly in the megahertz
frequency range and the water signal in
the water channel inside it's the
hydrogen of
bonds that vibrate so we expect
resonance in the gigahertz frequency
range so this makes microtubule unique
unique in the sense that if we st. say a
particular band of signal ranging from
kilohertz to gigahertz range when it
enters into the microtubule first it
will find the ionic chains then it will
be absorbed some of them will be left
then to each to a kilohertz signal it
will not be able to see the proteins or
the waters the megahertz signal will see
the proteins and the gigahertz signal
will see the waters so it will be
filtered out and the interesting thing
of microtubule is that all everything
all of it is crystals so it has three
distinct symmetries one top of another
so those who are interested in
information processing though you know
that in symmetry has very close relation
with the information content and
information part so that means whenever
there is a symmetry transition you are
going to have some information exchange
and other processes so these are some of
the points which I will ignore in the in
today's talk I will concentrate only on
the protein parts so
okay let me go for it so the question
that we asked for our research two years
back was to understand how molecule is
born spontaneously in the cell and how
it survived and then disappear so we
have 50 trillion cells in our body and
if microtubule is responsible for the
information processing that means
somehow microtubule is processing
information and is able to to coherently
link up the inter body that we have so
how is it being possible I mean if if
continuous change of the length of
microtubule does it have anything to do
with the information processing and if
it has how exactly can we define the
information in it and how exactly we can
probe it how exactly we can tell that
okay look if you give me say 10
micrometer long microtubule okay this is
the information content these are the
informations these are the things it is
doing so we want to define it in the
exact terms so if we know about frolics
theorem in 1968 some of which has
already been told by proper corny but I
would like to tell once again the debate
was about how first life came into being
on art I mean was it just a chemical
reaction or some energy was available
and constrained dipoles took that
suitable energy and form a structure or
architecture automatically so the theory
that was prevalent was something like
along with the chemical energy there was
also electromagnetic energy involved in
it which took energy from the
environment right energy right
electromagnetic energies from some
source and it from the supra molecular
architecture that was the first form of
life so this proposal went on and and
these proposals say something like that
we need a heat bath and we need a
constraint dipole electric field
constrained dipoles and we need
electromagnetic energy
so we and there is there was no
experimental direct experimental
evidence of this frolic condensation
process till now and there are some
papers in 2009 by Jerry Mars who has
discussed well in details how to realize
this for the condensation in practice
how to do the experiment so we did this
experiment in reality and we we have
successfully successfully realized the
fröhlich condensation process
none of my videos are running can you do
something about it
okay okay so this is the heater bath and
we have electrodes which are positive
and negative areas of red and blue
colored and we supply the AC signal into
it and microtubule grows spontaneously
within three to four seconds only not 30
40 or 60 minutes three or four seconds
and you have plotted average link to its
frequency and you will find that if we
go on increasing the frequency from say
ten heart to fifty megahertz we will
find that the maximum the highest lung a
length of marketable that we get is
around twenty three point five
micrometer that is grown within two to
three seconds not sixty minutes only two
to three seconds just you apply the AC
frequency connect the works done and you
see the large microtubules the giant
dipoles predictable frolic is formed at
the bottom of the surface
so this is the experimental result and
some of the AFM pictures and I have not
done any filtration on these images but
when I will publish in the papers they
will be made beautiful so just RAW
images just see now and and and and here
you can see the at particular frequency
the giant dipoles are formed so the
smallest length that you will be able to
see within two seconds if you apply say
now 500 kilohertz signal then you can
get only 200 nanometers long within two
seconds and if you apply and say four
megahertz signal or five megahertz
signal you get 23 or 24 micrometer long
chains all along the surface within two
seconds so you can you can see the
selection once we realize the the
Fralick content set now we should we
should keep it in mind that it could
also be a classical process because
Reimers have challenged frolic other
different ways but before I move on I
must say that Professor cocconi who is
sitting here he was the first person who
said that this kind of condensation
could occur also in megahertz range
because product condensation Frawley
himself said it should be in the
gigahertz gigahertz frequency regime but
he calculated and say that it's
megahertz so our experimental result
directly validates his proposal now
where do you go from Paulie condensate
so cell we try to find out the quantum
qubit or or try to find out classical
bit of information how things are
happening I mean it is is it a
bose-einstein condensate or what which
direction should we go
so we decided to to leave that the issue
of detecting matter if for this moment
and we decided to go towards beat and
topological qubit because topological
qubit those who are interested in
quantum computing does you know that
topological qubit is a version of
quantum quantum qubit in which you are
more in more interested in the
rather than simultaneous multiple states
coexisting together so instead of this
concept if you if you just just switch a
little bit towards space along with it
then the entire concept changes and it
becomes much easier to detect much
easier to handle and and it becomes more
practically feasible that's why for the
last 12 to 13 years topological qubit
has been has been in the forefront and
we have tried to see this also there
were some experimental evidences which
prompted us to move towards this
direction so current transport in
microtubule we wanted to detect whether
the the transport along the microtubule
is coherent or not and this is a very
straightforward and easy experiment to
detect so this is nice image we have we
can do filtering you can see that it is
beautifully done and instead of two
probe measurement so there is a
microtubule chain and the two gold
electrodes are there so to probe
measurements are always faulty because
if you have two probes and you are
sending the signal to understand what is
the electronic property of a device or
of a material and on and using the same
to probe oh you are reading out the
system then you are always taking into
account the noise of the system the
contact potentials and all related
phenomenon that is associated with the
material so always it is preferred that
we should go for the four probe system
in the four probe system what we do is
we send the the current from the outer
two terminals and read the voltage from
the inner two terminals or the signal
that we want to change we sent by far
apart from from the farthest points and
from the nearest point we want to read
what is going on inside so these are
defined structures we have created and
it is and we didn't use any chemical
chemicals and other materials it was
everything was very very pure and
used dry lithography technique so that
there is no flow of ions along the
microtubule and first experimental
evidence is this so we measure the AC
resistance at two different frequencies
as you can see that we go on increasing
frequency and Neera Neera around eight
point there around eight me around nine
in this region and the resistance of the
other of the device of the microtubule
Falls and it goes around three to 48 or
50 50 kilo Elohim with a very small AC
voltage bias so so as for the for the
coherent or ballistic transport we need
around 225 kilo ohm or 40 or 50 kilo ohm
is sufficient so we did another
experiment we measured the current
voltage by two probe and also the four
probe measurement and we found that you
can see nearly one volt is applied and
one ampere current you are getting so
nearly 100 ohm resistance this is the
direct evidence for that so it is the
evidence to for the coatings transport
along the microtubule at 300 Kelvin that
means it's the room temperature so it is
not blasted off and one point I would
like to draw your attention if you look
at the central part you will find that
it's something like hysteresis things
are embedded so we we will later part of
my talk we will we will figure out what
it is
now the third evidence is if if some
system is coherent that means if you
change the link if it is one meter or
100 meter or one kilometer
there should be no change in the
resistance that is the fundamental
definition of a current system so we
took which here you can see that for
length devices we have measured 800
nanometer to 2 micro meter and there is
no change in resistance and we go to
approximately 10 to minus 4 minus 5
ampere current you go to the balusters
regime if you go higher current
resistance to go
another evidence the fourth evidence for
current the transport is that we
measured the power loss if we send a
power stream one side of the microtubule
and then we check the other side then we
find that it is it is nearly 0.5 percent
or something like that at particular
frequency it is around two nine nine
point two Gog or something that means in
this region definitely the microtubule
is becoming current so there is no power
loss while information transport
temperature independent conductivity so
before we get into this temperature
independent conductivity we got we found
that microtubule is independent of
microtubule conductivity is independent
of temperature that means if you start
from 5 Kelvin you go up to 300 Kelvin
you find conductivity remains constant
absolutely no change so first when we
got this we didn't believe our result we
thought that there is something wrong we
repeated our measurements several times
then we handed over our material to our
superconducting material Center
professor Hirata and he also measured
and he found the same thing there is no
change in conductivity we thought that
we are the first person who have
discovered such a material but when we
went for the literature we found it was
first one Indian saw this in MgO jury in
1981 in some materials in high pressure
condition and then in 1988 there was
another observer and there were at least
five reports before us where
conductivity did not have change with
temperature in extreme conditions but in
our case it is the normal condition
normal room temperature and ambient
atmospheric conditions in 2004 I found
that the coherence coherence theory when
and how coherence can appear in a room
temperature system it was explained by
kunitake Ananke and he published this
paper in science and he took gold
nano air which is helical and he
measured and found that it is it is
coherent and also there was report in
1997 on carbon nanotubes which was in
room-temperature current but carbon
nanotubes experiment is little bit
debated because what did they do they
took mercury liquid and then they then
they put the carbon energy from top and
then they measured it but when later
people try to reproduce their result on
keeping the carbon energy upon the
surface and putting two electrodes in
later hey little graphically the way we
did then they found that carbon
nanotubes is not room temperature
velocity so so that makes microtubule
that our experiment the second candidate
after talking to top technologies golden
an aware which is showing room
temperature conductivity now the theory
says that if you have a periodic
potential like system then in the in the
Hamiltonian you what happens is fluxes
get quantized and certain conditions if
it is there then you are naturally going
to see current transport and there are
several papers since 2004 to 2010 you
can find where you can find current
transport so what happens is something
like this so we calculated the energy
level diagram please try to see the the
bending of the orbitals bending of the
energy energy levels because this is
important because when we will apply
external thermal fluctuation then we
will see what happens to those so what
happens basically is these all point
contacts are formed so it is not like
metal not like semiconductor or not like
insulator so multiple point contact gaps
are formed between the valence band and
the conduction band and these and energy
when we have to supply external energy
it shows the electrons at the at the age
of the conduction bands and then leaps
it up and in the in a particular
frequency really particular energy
that's why the coherence transport
so if we see vary the temperature we see
conductivity like this so it is not
absolutely constant it changes quantized
manner with temperature ends and it
fluctuates in a quantized way so we
could encode any resistance by powering
it to a particular particular conducting
state Y we could input particular
conducting state of our choice that I
will explain when we will discuss about
the ferroelectric property so we can we
can input a particular connecting state
and we can vary the temperature and that
conduct conducting state with that
conductivity retains along the strip so
so professor hikita
in 1997 he first explained theoretically
with some experimental materials how and
and for what reason this kind of
temperature independent conductivity
could be realized in practice so if we
zoom out you will find that that the
encoded energy level which is which are
shown with an arrow this has pair of
levels
also just beside it so both side upper
and lower value if you have another
conducting steps where it it basically
jumps so it is not a random jump it is
always quantized so these are different
experimental results and when you encode
very low resistance say we can encode a
couple of Oh homes in microtubule here
we encode it 40 kilo home so then we
then we find that this resistance
variation goes very lowered two to three
kilo if we if we incur set gain or home
it will be nearly 100 home that means
you get almost a straight line so we try
to find out an explanation and then we
what we did in the Hamiltonian we added
another thermal fluctuation term and
then we found that our energy band
diagram changes a little and it forms
two other kind of versions where the
point of point contact is like
circular circular point-contact instead
of a single point and the fluctuation
occurs from black to red red to blue
blue to black continuously and it
maintains the particular contracting
state so so microtubule is not a metal
insulator or same semiconductor it's
it's the density of states this is in
between metal and semiconductor and it
switches back and forth and and
conducting a conduction age accumulation
by standard calculation we found that it
is 0.23 G 0 G 2 is the 2 e square by H
in the quantum conductance then we go
for detecting the topological qubit in
empty initially what we did is we try to
find out the pure energy conduction
modes that is that was already proposed
but later we thought that let's try
start from scratch
let's try to do some picture let's try
to play with the with what could be
possible that could be not could not be
and then later stage of our research we
will try to find out how much we were
not a connection modes are are feasible
so what are the differences between
beach qubit and a topological qubit bit
when suppose we have a molecule and we
change the conducting state of a
molecule by reducing it or by changing
conformation of the molecule then
classically we can observe it we can
measure its conductivity so it is called
bit when qubit then that means the two
or three or multiple states it can
coexist and at a particular time we
cannot say that we surely this and
topological qubit is also similar
similar like that and but topological
qubit is associated with a particular
space if you want to destroy a
pathological Kiryat you have to destroy
the space if you distort the space if
you change it by any means you cannot
destroy it so topological qubit was
first proposed by theta F maybe in 1997
and the topological qubit till now has
been realized only in the
superconducting systems in the
millikelvin temperature
and the basic reason has been that you
need quantum liquid and flux of quantum
liquid to flow and if you want to detect
it because wantem mechanical States if
you want to detect they are very
solitary in nature if you want to detect
it it will change into something else
but in topological qubit and there is a
there is a good possibility of detection
because suppose one space change to
another space some energy will be
released and then you can detect it
that's why there is no direct evidence
of detecting qubits very physic feasible
manner
but there are many papers of detection
of topological qubits in the last 10
years you can find the topological qubit
there has been detected several times
and so so in case of topological qubit
you can you can measure the phase slip
directly that means if you have in a
space if you have topological qubit you
send a or signal from one side you
measure from other side you will find
very defined quantized phase change in
the signal if you if you if you change
the length of the space you will find in
some length resistance decreases in some
length jumps so all the Ben effect
should be there so very nice ways and
simple experiments are there using which
you can verify the topological qubits
are there so here are some simple things
yes topological qubit shall I explain me
to microtubule and the meaning of
topological qubit because I have already
already said a lot because now if we see
the picture then it I think it will be
easier to to go on also I'm sorry I
don't have very simple cartoons but you
can find in Google many simple cartoons
what is topological kaviti and how it is
done so basically it is associated with
the space so some certain patterns and
it has Kuantan stay quantum states si
similar to the qubit but it's very
typical space and if you change the
shape of the space the fundamental
property of the pattern does not change
so that is the basic difference with a
qubit with the topological qubit but
there are many many different
specifications are there so microtubule
is a 2d hexagonal close packing
structure and eight nanometer is the
time dyma
now we try to try to form the
topological qubit patterns and and if we
if we repeat the first layer on the 14th
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 up to 13 14 we find that
there is a seam so hexagonal packing
bags there so there this is called type
that is B and if we if we want to start
from one side of the blue and reach to
the next thing we will find that 6l gap
we get periodicity that means 40
nanometer periodicity more than this we
cannot create similarly if we change the
external cross packing a little bit we
can get to let us say where there is no
break in the hexagonal close packing and
then 26 cells is required for to come
back to the same point one periodicity
that is 280 nanometers so that means if
there is a topological qubit so you need
minimum 200 nanometer resolutions yeah
so we what we did is we did not consider
any any mathematics or something we just
do
if we have a gap - that means one line
starts we count one two we draw the
second one and when the third one in
this way we went on creating different
lines so it will be spherical lines
continuously so we call each lines as as
one topological qubit this goes one unit
now if you see you'll find that in gap -
it is a direct overlap of two lines so
if you have a hundred lines on a
particular space you cannot
differentiate how many lines are there
so that means we we take only one
restriction that is if they touch they
disappear so we just neglect that
possibility so in this way we have found
that if you send eight there at the gap
of eight which is if you wanna cheap
number then we will find that when you
come back and start you will find it
decomposes into eight five if you send
save seven gap you get seven six in this
way decomposition occurs and if we try
to put multiple qubits we will find only
four sets of combinations age 5 10 13 7
9 11 13 5 7 10 13 and five seven nine
thirty and the decomposition lists are
also also given here so you just want a
piece of paper if you play with the pain
you can find this kind of relations okay
so this is about horizontally if you if
we send signals into microtubule what if
it takes information from the
environment u 1 e 2 e 3 then you can
find that if we start with topological
qubit 8 then it decomposed into if
another signal enters decomposed into 5
3 another signal enters 5 3 2 another
signal enters 3 2 another signal enters
give them and disappear because we say
touch disappear so in these operations
in future people can work on but if we
go to lettuce B I got very interesting
things that is gap 2 survives gap 3
survives gap for decomposed into goes to
2 and you can send signal straight if
you if the gap
is X that is straight then hilly city C
is infinite if you put it in the
Hamiltonian you will find that you get
if you get a typical situation where MPC
G or the multiple point contact gaps
that we showed at the beginning of my
talk that appears spontaneously that
means if this kind of microtubule is
there then it is coherent you don't need
to have any external energy supply it is
always ready to do that and this lettuce
B is very prompt towards information
transport letici and lettuce B are
complementary to each other so that is B
gives us 2 3 Q 2 3 4 and X and a gives
us 5 to 13 something together they cover
entire series 1 is good for computing
that is simply we are finding it
decomposes interest rates other don't
want to decompose so what can we detect
about the topological qubit for
different lengths so for for different
lengths of empty which should be able to
get four different sets so let's go for
the experiment now we cannot do the
biggest problem when we want it to do
this experiment we wanted to measure
quantum Hall fractional quantum Hall
effect which is the easiest and direct
mean to detect the topological quantum
qubit
but microtubule does not respond to our
X Y that is the particle because we have
in a megahertz frequency range only one
molecular layer take so we cannot create
the magnetic flux gradient which is
essential for the our X Y so we have we
are left with only our xx but we found
that when magnetic flux variant is
created basically our xx the horizontal
resistance also changes the our
principle is that we cannot absolute
term we cannot detect a quantum state
but we can change the point we can
change that trans transformation from
one topological qubit to another that
means if we can convert topological
qubit a to topological qubit B
energy will be released or absorbed
so what did he do we sent an AC signal
in the middle part the shaded region so
AC signal we know very well that does
not change the resistance of a device
the DC resistance of a device because DC
resistance of a device depends on the
topological order AC signal cannot
change unless until there exists some
topological order and that undergoes a
quantum transition so this is a simple
experimental setup so we have a function
generator with two capacitor because
this is part doesn't come into it and a
resistance measurement device so we
measure only that a DC resistance of the
system we change the function at a
frequency and see what we find
we find for always four different
regions where we see the see the large
DC resistance change this figure almost
looks like if you have gone through the
literature's of fractional quantum Hall
effect results the result this result if
you frequently to be and this resistance
this looks nearly similar that means we
are seeing the absorbance and and we
find that seven distinct Peaks appear
and this will appear repeatedly on
different links so we measured we
repeated this measure on different
devices then if there is a qubit there
should be a quantum phase slip that
means one side we will send a signal or
the next side there should be a phase
difference so you find the phase
difference and they are also quantized
45 90 135 180 and 0 these repeats say
statistically then we try to find out
the condition qab pc de that picks that
we have + 8 5 10 13 we again we use the
condition topological qubits don't touch
and we find that exactly unless until
you have that these topological qubit
you cannot get this fix you can verify
so quick summary of the energy levels
that we have bought so 9.03 megahertz
you get a you get resonance but in
microtubule it becomes current and no
phase change it is even phase current
twenty point five six megahertz again
phase current sixteen point three five
eighteen point one five megahertz in
this megahertz you get one thirty five
degree phase difference and one in two
degree phase difference and and they are
they're coupled to each other and two
twenty three twenty four twenty three
point two seven twenty four point zero
six and twenty four point nine one
megahertz also other absorbance Peaks
which varies what you did is we measured
which change the length of the
microtubule from two hundred nanometers
up to say 10 or 20 micrometers and we
found for every length which are the
cubed Peaks appear which are which
disappear so we try to find out a we
found that it strongly dependent on the
length and follows a very particular
algorithm continuously along the length
that means if you now give me a
particular length say 22 micro
micrometer what should you be a qubit
properties I can tell exactly that this
and this this and this energy band you
will get it and get a absorption and
this energy band you will get a
absorption with this angle phase change
and that angle has changed so I can
exactly tell okay two interesting
thoughts
one is that one period for this for this
particular particular operation that we
say that this phase phase locking is a 2
micrometer and the 12 different rate can
be done so 24 to 30 micrometer long
microtubules are necessary to get all
the states and there is a negative Delta
minus Delta plus and minus Delta that
means in microtubule particular signals
you can send from this direction and
particular signal at the same time you
can send from this direction both
direction you cannot so we try to create
in both directions but we didn't get and
last experiment that we did to do to
detect whether there exists
quantum topological qubit or not is
quantum interferometry the experiment it
suggests theoretically that if you have
bomb from both two ends you if you
generate topological qubits into the
system and if you can make a field
gradient in such a way that you trap it
then what happened the middle region
will automatically or and create pulse
with a certain time so the here is the
here is the to end qubits that we
created with two signals and the the top
result we got continuous oscillations
from that so there must be existing some
sort of topological order inside the
system
what kind of key queues are these there
in literature you will find there are at
least 15 different kind of topological
qubits we do not want to definitely
define right now because we have got the
experimental results and several
different kind of signatures we have got
why this is topological qubit but still
since it is room temperature we want to
be very very sheer what is the real
nature of this kind of topological
qubits finally phonetic property of
microtubule in the month of April I came
to Center for consciousness conference
and I showed the bottom result we had
loss of noise at that time we removed
the noise and we have got perfectly
square so there's this is lossless any
kind of if you get perfectly square
behavior that means to store energy you
don't need to need to spend energy to
retain a particular bit and if you
change the temperature and the
information is not lost it retains as
you can see 250 K and 300 K at different
bias we can create so multiple states
you can write and you can retain both
kind of measurement could be done
simultaneously and as I have already
said that if there is a link change
continuously that was first sentence of
my talk first
our objective that if there is a dynamic
instability or the microtubule is
continuously changing why it is changing
and what are the nature of a particular
length
even we can tell exactly what keep
itself so we want to build now the
language using which we want to
communicate with the cellular organisms
so this is the conclusion microtubule
process has classical bit and quantum
topological which together it's
conductivity is independent of
temperature but whether it should be
classified in metal semiconductor or
insulator we don't know but we think
that it should not be classified in any
of this lattice and lattice B are
complimentary to each other as far as
topological qubits are concerned and
together they build a fantastic system
of information processing by changing
linked empty tombs nature of each
topological qubits empty stores and
processes bit without releasing a
consuming heat it's perfectly solitaire
so finally I would like to acknowledge
heartwood and Stewart for their
contributions
vo ard well Dave some tank is here I'm
like no I would like to acknowledge him
for his kind grounds and jsps Center for
consciousness studies for some some of
the grounds and professor Daisuke Fujita
in dr. Shepherd it's ah-hoo and the
Subrata closed and professor kazuto
Kazuhiro data satellite and super tour
my postdocs they have done majority of
the experiments and proprietary produced
our results because it's it was hard to
believe at the beginning and professor
Fujita also generously helped in AFM
measurements because he is very expert
and he suggested that we should move to
four probe systems all to probe data
useless and also finally I would like to
thank all of you for listening for this
long time thank you very much
are there any questions maybe we can
take one question question you said that
the conductivity is not matter not
semiconductor and so on what type of the
conductivity is I don't know but it is
electron conductivity or what type
because if you transport electricity
you must transport charge and therefore
there is something that should be
explained because I assume that there is
a certain amount of electrons in the in
the I may say conductivity band of of
microtubule yeah I have I have shown
upon activity band I've shown that
picture the point contact so it is there
is no in case of metal there is no gap
in case of semiconductor you have a gap
small gap and in case of insulator you
have a large band gap right so it is
very well known but in this case kind of
material you have a point contact gap in
a between the valence band and the
conduction band so you can say it is
another kind of material new kind of
material that does not fall into this
category so you can find a new name
thank you thank you any more questions
yes
so I guess I have a couple of questions
first I'm trying to understand why you
call these topological qubits bits
evening is how do you read information
from them okay yeah
first I call this topological qubit for
three reasons
topological quantum bit we have got the
beat we detected it we have got the
topological order change by measuring DC
resistance change with AC what are you
detecting what are you detecting means
like what does you're like you're
showing like a loop around a microtubule
what's that no no no no no no you saw
the experiment of DC resistance change
using the AC signal frequency that we
supplied to the device did you did you
check that so if we apply a very
particular energy you will find sudden
fall in the in the DC resistance so DC
resistance of a system you know DC
resistance of a system determines the
the topological formation the in the
structure when there is a certain change
in that that is quantized that's why I
call it topological qubit so at a
particular frequency at a at 6 &amp;amp; 7
different frequencies always whatever be
the length of the microtubule you will
find it will be enhanced or I mean
dominated or sub dominated but in those
frequencies if we apply a signal at a
very small part of the system AC signal
purely AC signal will find that DC
resistance is getting changed so that is
how we did it of course there are many
other detection process by which we said
so there are standard 5 different
experiment 5 or 6 different experiments
which has been established theoretically
to detect topological qubits which you
can find in the literature so could you
store could you store a quantum state
and could you store superposition
and know the hoenn we try to do this
kind of experiment basically what we do
is we send a particular kind of current
particular magnitude of current which
reaches the material to the coherent
State for an example suppose we are
working with say we know if we send a DC
current of 1 micro ampere we know that
the resistance will fall below say 20
kilo ohm or 1 kilo ohm we know that that
means it is going to the coherent State
so so externally we first send that
current when you send that current we
take it to the coherent State and we
store the topological qubits then we try
to transform one set of qubit to another
set of give it one qubit we cannot write
one topological qubit we cannot write
but a particular set is possible to
write but what we'll say to you will
write depends on the length of the
system we cannot let's can we take this
discussion offline because I'd actually
like to join in it to it because I don't
think this is a topic but next speaker
is Stuart Hameroff and we'll reconvene
