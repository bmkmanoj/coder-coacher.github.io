innovation for open society biological
open source and the componentry that
gives rise to this movement that we're
fomenting in some circles successfully
in other circles it's still a cryptic
story that we hope to get past that may
be introducing who I am and what I you
know my history to put a bit of a
context to this to make sure that you're
all there at the right talk you this is
the tech talk right and and and you know
that this is not about I saw that one of
the titles is just building a lamp stack
it was called so I hope it's not you're
not thinking it's going to be about
computation in software engineering kids
okay the metaphor I'm going to be using
for this little presentation is the
building a lamp stack for the life
sciences not the intention of actually
explicitly building a series of software
tools but rather using the metaphor of
the power of having an available toolkit
to do dramatically different things and
to imagine yourself in a in a thought
world in a science fiction nightmare in
which no programming languages no
operating systems no standards were
actually made publicly available at any
point during the evolution of the IT
industry it's almost unthinkable imagine
life with no common and powerful
programming languages with no standards
to work towards and with no fundamental
operating systems with characteristics
you can work towards that is exactly the
situation we're fighting ourselves in
the life sciences and more pronounced
than that is that those who do
understand any aspect of the programming
or the standards in metaphor again have
now protected these with patents so what
we now have is a situation where in the
life sciences in biological innovation
as I call it not just life sciences in
academic laboratories but real
biological innovation that can happen in
a farmer's field it can happen in a
clinicians office it can happen in a
public health workers out station in
kampala this is true biological
innovation not just biotech that happens
at Stanford or Berkeley in those
circumstances those individuals have the
potential the latency to be able to
create substantial innovation and create
a lot of wealth of their communities the
problem is the tools of fundamental
science are not available to them and
the tools of the scientific method are
so siloed that it is a great disservice
to them to not use their creativity so
what I'll be talking to you about is in
a
a huge opportunity at the same time as
talking about a huge problem in the life
in the life sciences or biological
innovation part of my discussion will be
about patents but only a part of it part
of it will be about biotech but only a
part of it what I'd like you to do since
there are only six of you here google
what I'd really like you to do is try to
think very very far outside the box and
imagine a very very different world in
which the four billion people who would
not be able to afford this if I were to
buy this at peet's coffee as I did this
morning one just like this it costs four
dollars there's four billion people
whose entire income not disposable
income but entire income per day is less
than that four dollars in fact I looked
very hard at walgreens to buy a little
prop that would cost less than a dollar
that you'd recognize and I couldn't find
a thing but there's over a billion
people who make less than that in their
total income less than the price of
three quarters of a snicker bar it turns
out in their entire for an entire day
not disposable income but in total
income but there's nothing wrong with
these people except that they're poor
they're smart they're creative they're
committed they're poor so we can think
of those as an enormous resource so what
I'm going to be talking about biological
innovation or biological open source but
I'm trying to think about is how can we
tap into enormous creative latent
resource that's out there in the world
to deal with some fundamental problems
the most fundamental problem is if four
billion people can do not have any
income to buy a latte there is something
so fundamentally incorrect about the
world that we can view that as a grand
challenge a true grand challenge yeah
the typical response to poverty into
serious problems with in the developing
world or for that matter within the
inequities in our industrialized world
is to fix the problem so if there are
problems of health the idea is at best
in philanthropy or governmental circles
well let's develop a pharmaceutical or a
vaccine for that problem if the problem
is food security well let's build a
better yielding crop variety that's
actually a very linear response it's not
a catalytic response and it doesn't in
any way leverage the enormous creativity
of the people experiencing the problem
that is what we wish to get beyond in
development circles if you look at some
of the great philanthropic foundations
the Rockefeller Foundation which has
been supporting us for 15 years the
Gates Foundation which has been denying
for many years their basic approach to
philanthropy is identify a problem
identify partners who will solve that
problem on behalf of poor people and
that's the great failing it's on behalf
of poor people rendering them no longer
creative members of the problem solving
equation so what I'm going to talk to
you about is a latent revolution that is
extraordinarily exciting to us because
it is uniquely possible at this point in
time where communications informatics
the life sciences themselves indeed the
social fabric have co-evolved to the
point where this is possible okay so
first let me introduce myself since
there's no one here to do so who knows
me better than me though Murray may say
otherwise I I was actually born not far
from here as you can hear from my accent
I'm not Australian well at least I'm not
born in Australia I am now an Australian
citizen and our Institute cambia was
formed about 15 years ago with the
concepts formed that about 20 years ago
as my response to what I perceived as
both an injustice and an opportunity at
once the my own background is as a
molecular biologist I did my PhD at
University of Colorado in Boulder I did
my undergraduate in the labs one of the
lab that invented recombinant DNA here
at University of California and during
that time I became fascinated by
obsessed by methodology to discover that
if you really wanted to change the world
it's not discovery-based science that
will do it it's inventing a method that
empowers many others to do discovery
based or invention based science so
methodology or tools are a very very
powerful and seductive engine for social
change I discovered that even as an 18
year old working in recombinant DNA a
new method would come along within a
matter of weeks or months everyone would
be using that method to do whatever that
method made available which in turn
spawned new methodology itself so my
assertion even before I developed a
sensible social conscience or an
awareness of the world outside of the
middle-class white guy was in fact that
if you wish to change something
providing a methodology that fits the
hand of the potential user is the single
most powerful and cost-effective way to
do so when I did my PhD it was on a
small worm of all things called seen
Arab dittus elegance a little nematode
it's only a millimeter long and the
reason I worked on that was
because people knew every single cell
from the time it was a single design go
to single fertilized egg cell up to the
pointed hatched our labs and others in
Cambridge England and a few others in
Washington University in st. Louis what
worked out the lineage of that to follow
it every cell became so this cell at one
time was a progenitor now became a
muscle in a nerve cell and so on and so
forth with the idea that if we could
understand the nature of these cell
divisions and how decisions were made
we'd understand the worm that was that
was a grand ambition my interest wasn't
so much understanding the worm but to
figure out how to understand it I was
very interested in developing a method
that would allow us to know the instant
a cell was different than what it used
to be so in those days I was trying to
develop methods for doing what we call
heuristics for actually illuminating
information that has been previously
cryptic and this is where in this entire
talk I think you can hearken to the the
mission of Google in developing and
portraying for the world the information
that is out there and asking is there
information that is currently latent or
cryptic in the system that is of
enormous value can we relay much much
more information than simply that which
is digitized but actually relay
information that is intrinsic to the
natural world in a format and at a time
by which human beings can make judgments
on that there to the social and economic
advantage okay so this is when the in a
sense part of my introduction of myself
is relevant to cambia after I left
boulders I went to the plant breeding
Institute in Cambridge at the dawn of
what would be considered plant a genetic
engineering this was in the early mid
80s and I worked with a team that did
ended up doing the first field release
of a genetically engineered crop and in
fact I invented the tool that became the
mainstay for plant genetic engineering
and every company ranging from Monsanto
to Amman Paul plant breeders now uses
that tool and in the course of
developing that I also became aware of
something else that how you shape the
tool depends very much on which hands
can use it and so we set out at that
time myself and all of my colleagues my
immediate grad student and postdoctoral
colleagues working with me on that
project we're from what are sadly called
developing countries these were
scientists from from Africa from China
from India from Poland from Mexico who
knew that at this point in their career
back in the 80s it was getting a
publication in a major journal that
would give them a career development
opportunity
they also knew that if they went back to
their home countries the likelihood that
they could have an impact on economies
social justice decency yields and crops
was very very modest with a toolkit that
was available at that time it's very
cumbersome it was very reductionist and
fairly ineffective so what I saw here
was an enormous opportunity these were
committed smart people they were
dedicated to something that I knew I I
knew very little about meaning they're
their home countries agriculture and
economies but if the right tools were
there if the right communications method
were there to include them in the
problem solving equation it would be a
massive untapped force that we could
actually tap at that time another
interesting feature juxtaposed into my
thinking in doing this field trial of
genetically engineered crops we actually
by accident beat Monsanto by one day it
was June first of 1987 and a year later
I was giving a talk at UC Davis and the
Monsanto guy of the suit and everything
got up there with his fancy slides
talked about the world's first field
trial of a transgenic food crop June's
second 1987 I think she's been given the
next talk and I had these you know
there's old slides used to use 35
millimeter slides or die ate the realest
investigators were called died azo is
there white on blue and they usually had
little hairs other for when they stuck
around in your backpack and stuff and I
gave the signs you June first 1987 and I
felt really embarrassed to have dinner
counteracted this but the first field
trial actually was was not there by a
multinational out to make money it was
there by a public sector institution the
plant breeding a pseudonym Cambridge to
ask a fundamental question how do things
behave in the field so the public was
out to ask the question how do things
act it's a fairly humble question
Monsanto is out to solve a problem
commercially humble is not a word that
is usually used to describe Monsanto
okay so the issue was the public sector
wasn't late to the game it was actually
early in the game what it failed to do
is capitalized on that advantage to make
sure that public priorities maintained
front and center in policy and in
science it capitulated the ground very
early so what I saw though was that the
work being done in the field was
basically intensely reductionist you
would take a concept that you could do
in the laboratory and extrapolated into
the field and assume that well if if we
can do this in the laboratory that's
what we should do in the field instead
of saying what is the real world of the
field the economy's how I
culture works how anything works and
then go back to the laboratory if
necessary and build a system that can
operate within those real-world
constraints that's not the paradigm that
was it play that was the moment when I
realized all of these things fit
together reductionism per se was driving
the game in life sciences whether it be
public health whether it be agriculture
or natural resource management so
reductionism was driving the second
point that came to the head was that
most of the people who are committed to
solving problems were marginalized from
the problem solving process these were
my colleagues from poorer countries or
from areas that did not have the
resources to do this work so the people
the type of science the people and what
was the other aspect of it that was
really critical ok methodology it turned
out that in the course of a year I sent
this tool it happened to be called the
Gustine and I'll talk to you a little
bit more about that idea which was
simply a gene we could insert into
another organism which would produce in
some cases a color that would simply
tell you what's happening in the
organism it wasn't out there to fix the
organism it was out there to tell you
about something it was a reporter gene
okay in developing that and sending it
out to the tens of thousands of
scientists around the world who we
discovered is very very fascinating they
all started using it within a matter of
weeks or months the entire field had
shifted to ask the kinds of questions
which that tool could facilitate so
these three things juxtaposed offered an
enormous opportunity if the people who
are answering who were solving problems
and experiencing problems were not
properly enabled not properly empowered
if the types of science and types of
problems being solved were
inappropriately being influenced to be
reductionist in nature when the problems
were holistic and if a way to change all
of that is to provide technology or
tools tools not solutions but tools that
allow those people to solve those
problems in those circumstances we could
see a complete sea change in how the
life sciences becomes an engine for
economic development and social
development that was the premise that
guided the formation of cambia cambia
was initially an acronym for the center
for the application of molecular biology
to international agriculture but if any
of you speak any Spanish or Italian
you're recognized it also means change
over the last five years we've stopped
using the the acronym akov cambia
because we're way more than molecular
biology now we're looking much more an
innovation system reform and over the
last 10 years we've become very heavily
engaged in the world of patents and
we're understanding what is it that
limits the shape of the tool that fits
the hand the hand that wields the tool
and the product that comes from wielding
that tool and it turns out that the
patent system is an enormously powerful
tool to deny such capability recently I
was at a meeting at Yale that my friend
yokai banquet was running called a2k it
seems like everything has to be an
acronym it's a 2k and I was the sort of
the cleanup batter at the meeting
speaking and I proposed that a 2k was so
yesterday it was really see to UK which
doesn't lend itself to much it but it's
the capability to use knowledge that's
the true battleground if all if you're
successful here's a classic thing we
learned in physics when I was taking
these courses if you have a proof that
you'd like to test test it at the zero
in one case test it at the extremes if
it falls down which is likely to do it
one of those places then it tells you
you're on the wrong track so let's
imagine you're successful with that all
the world's information that Google is
is incredible all the world's
information is available to anyone
anyone anywhere and what somehow they
have to turn that information do
products and services that improve their
lives okay into processes that they can
engage in which their social or economic
well-being is enhanced or personal
well-being the information and in this
case for dollars gets you a cup of
coffee the information is a necessary
but insufficient condition to social
advancement the capability to use that
information is the next battleground
this what I'll be telling you then is
that in biological innovation which is
the fundamental realm of innovation in
our world it's what produces our food
it's what maintains or destroys our
natural resource base it is actually
what produces or destroys the public
health that we enjoy or do not this is
biological innovation writ large to
actually produce a change in biological
innovation capacity will require the
capability to use this information and
to find the relevant information to so
use so cambia was formed initially as an
attempt to get the scientific community
as my as our first constituency to focus
on methodology to say we're using
methods ad-hoc that just fall off a
shelf and assuming that that whatever is
there
what we will use to solve a problem and
this is the classic situation of walking
into the hardware store and discovering
that there are shelves and shelves and
shelves of hammers and so what a
surprise all the problems are nails
you've heard this many times if
everything if the only tool you have is
a hammer everything looks like a nail
interestingly enough the consequence of
that of that homily is that if you put
more exciting tools on the shelf people
will find and discover many many more
opportunities to solve problems than
they had before so cambia was formed
back in the late mid 80s with the
concept that if you design a tool
specifically to expose new types of
problems that occur under real field
conditions with real people and so that
it can be wielded by people who may not
be economically advantaged but maybe
intellectually or morally absolutely
committed what changes can happen in my
assertion enormous so we started this
under the umbrella of the United Nations
i joined the food agriculture
organization of the united nations is
their first molecular biologist and i
tell you that was a rush i had a lazy a
pass a United Nations passport then the
inside picture of me back with hair and
everything that said molecular biologist
doesn't say United States or Australia
says molecular biologist and you know
going through going through immigration
Q some time you get up in the front you
have the United Nations passport they'd
open its just oh molecular biologist
well go right on insert it it was quite
a rush but then I discovered that those
organizations are consensus driven in
many many unfortunate ways one of the
issues is that they have designed
themselves they had evolved to actually
mitigate against individual initiative
so they do not tolerate individual
initiative because they cannot because
most individual initiative in those
circumstances would be antithetical to
their consensus so what I discovered a
setting of cambia under the aegis of the
United Nations would not have worked
because it has to be cutting-edge it has
to be scary it has to be pushing in new
directions in a new way where even the
scientific and academic community will
by no means by in and early days so did
the usual set it up in the front room of
a house using savings accounts and it
worked now this is where the patent
world came Xin decided that to give you
the story about the lamp stack the
history is probably a more interesting
way to get you to where we are now what
happened was fascinating we
at this point we was was me and another
colleague Kate Wilson who's a terrific
scientist we decided that we would set
it up ourselves as a private independent
nonprofit I mean unlike some in Silicon
Valley at an intentionally non-profit
and and we set out to do this based on
savings accounts and our assertion was
that well perhaps if we patent the core
methodology this Gustine I told you
about but then make it available on a
tiered pricing basis around the world we
can use revenue from that from the
for-profit sector to power the next
generation of methodology development so
in a sense use a revenue development
method from patents to actually secure
enough money to build an institute that
would generate the next generation of
technologies and by making a very low
cost know reach through obligation
licensing scheme we thought but we'll be
able to do then is have a reasonable and
equitable relationship with the business
sector but use that to power what
amounts to a social and technological
revolution which is baldly stated what
we wish to do so it turned out to work
but it worked painfully slowly and in
the process we learned a great deal
about the intellectual property system
and its abuses and its trajectory so I
did file patents on that Gus system
luckily that was in the early days of
patenting or the University of Colorado
over I did some of the works it's just a
method nobody's interested Cambridge
SATs just a method nobody's interested
in and so you go into debt you file the
patents you get into better that
horrific patent attorney who actually an
extraordinarily good patent attorney but
it was a horrific event to co-own a
technology with somebody that reminds
you somewhat of Jabba the Hutt and
handling job allows patents and this was
a terribly frustrating time in my life
because it discovered that I invented
the technology thought of the technology
in 1979 1980 reduced it to practice to
genetic engineer the first animals which
were nematodes in 1983 brought it into
plants and made it work in 1985 in
plants it wasn't till nineteen
ninety-three that the first patent even
issued and when it issued it wasn't
until nineteen ninety-five that the
first license was taken over ten years
from the time of conception now in the
life sciences that them in an IT that's
generations of course in life sciences
it still feels like a long time but
that's how long it takes to develop a
product
in the life sciences there is no
feedback loop for successful decisions
so that's why exit strategies are common
in Silicon Valley because exit
strategies get you golf club memberships
and Alexis for life the issue of making
something of value takes so long that
it's very rare that a decision maker
that starts something is actually there
for the finish now an IT if somebody
starts a project here at Google you're
usually still sitting in that seat by
the time it succeeds or fails and if it
fails you hear about it and if it
succeeds hopefully you hear about it so
there's a feedback loop for successful
decisions now in the life sciences even
in the old fashioned life sciences that
doesn't work that well in plant breeding
for instance it will take over ten years
from the time you do in a genetic cross
by very conventional means to the time
you develop a new variety of plants ten
years is typical sometimes it can be
longer okay with a pharmaceutical or a
public health practice even it can take
even longer now if that's the case
imagine you've risen to some degree of
prominence in your field and you're in
your forties or 50 and you make a
visionary decision to pursue something
what is the likelihood you're still in
that seat 10 12 years later when it's
tested in the market place it's very
very low that means people occupying
that seat have rarely been tested by
successful decision-making except by a
very trivial metric of money not wealth
money so that's one of the biggest
challenges we faced with this is looking
at the metrics for success if we want to
change the direction of what because the
problem solving that's out there we have
to look at the metrics for a success for
that so it's coming back to the bit of
the history after leaving the UN is
setting it up in a sort of the
equivalent of a garage we finally got
our first grant and that was from the
Rockefeller Foundation and the
Rockefeller Foundation at that time was
funding five or six million dollars a
year in rice biotechnology mostly in
Asia but also African Latin America and
because I've been very prominent because
of the development of that the Gus gene
are very very famous they wanted to
actually use that fame to gain access to
help troubleshoot the laboratories in
Asia that we're doing rice biotechnology
so that was my first job where my travel
budget was about four times more than my
salary my salary was less than I made as
a grad student to go and travel to every
lab in China India Indonesia Vietnam
Philippines actually turned out west and
east and southern Africa and Latin
America so pretty much everywhere to
actually work hands-on in the laboratory
to troubleshoot to transfer new
technologies to develop new rice
biotech methodologies so you know this
was the first you know but that by this
time the savings account was gone so he
took the grant and I knew that I was
going to be a physical wreck if I
traveled from say the western United
States or from Europe to Asia every
single week and there are probably
people at Google who have to do that and
you bet you there Rex I bet so I decided
how about Australia its in the same time
zone as half the world's population and
most of the world's rice scientists and
rice growers so I approached some
colleagues at the scientific agency
CSIRO in Australia said how about if I
base it there for a year they said sure
sure we'll offer you an old prefab
building in the back of the campus so I
went there for a year and that was 15
years ago it turned out that the quality
of life and the proximity to half the
world's population in the same time zone
is enormous important feature in fact
unless there's a big seismic event I
mean a really big seismic event
Australia will always be in the same
time zone as half the world's population
so in the increasingly important world
of real-time communications and the
unwillingness to do all our work at
midnight Australia is beautifully
positioned for quality of life clean air
and to talk to our colleagues to our
north to our south to accept the trip
penguins or actually Kiwi sign New
Zealanders Maurice from New Zealand but
they don't want to hear is so so that
was cambia now then then what ended up
happening about the whole world of
patents as we begin to think about
designing new technologies we realized
that the the interest in finding the
design of those know technologies was
associate with the ability to make money
with technologies but actually that's
not a true the real push in biotech
turned out to be making money from
technologies this is a really different
thing I want you to imagine imagine if C
programming language was only available
to those who could afford a particular
amount and in fact there it was
exclusively licensed to a few entities
it would not evolve as a language it
would not have the broad standardized
form that it has or the power it has to
sculpt higher-level languages
consequently the industry would be
stifled that turns out to be the
standard in biotechnology as new tool as
new discoveries were made they would be
fashioned or or prettied up to be
inventions which they often were not
those inventions would be patent
and the money would be made not by the
use of those tools but by the exclusive
or semi exclusive licensing of those
tools to others and so a company would
make its money talk about the successes
of the biotech industry it's almost
always by having the little component
tree that's necessary to make a true
product and actually flogging it off as
before as much money as possible well
that basically is what's called rent
extraction in economics terms it's
causing as much rent to be drawn out of
the system as possible which slows down
the development of the sector and makes
it highly parochial focusing only on the
interests of those who have enough money
to pay the price so it became clear to
us that while we were trying to use the
patent system to do something
interesting the patent system itself and
the business practices surrounding it
was evolving to do something utterly
different and utterly frustrating and
that was that it was designed to be
gamed and there's an old story that's
quite rude that's just why does a dog
lick himself because you can and this is
exactly what's happened now why have the
business methods of the biotechnology
industry and recently NIT why have they
evolved in a particular way because they
can because the patent system allows a
certain type of gaming and it basically
extortion it's often called intellectual
property protection and you may remember
that in the sopranos protection well as
protection you know you pay me a certain
amount I won't break your legs okay in a
sense that's all a patent license is
you're not getting anything except in a
sense a indemnity from somebody suing
you so we discovered that the patent
system for say could reflect both the
strength of invention but also the
appalling weakness of a business model
that was not inclusive because it did
not distinguish between tools and
products so as cambia started developing
rockefeller gave us a little bit more
money and finally in 1995 we began to
see licensing revenue from companies
that were using our tool we started to
develop new technologies to explore what
would happen by providing new
technologies in a different format and
we discovered something else about
technology development that can kill it
it's called transaction cost if I
negotiate with Google or with Monsanto
Monsanto as an example is a licensee of
our technologies it's not a company I
particularly have affection for though I
know a number of people there that I
like they use the technology in ways
that are very effective for
business model kind of uninteresting for
mine but it's is there but it took us
three years to close the deal to license
the technology they have countless
lawyers they can throw at it they can
delay as much as they want because they
knew that all they were getting was an
indemnification to keep us from suing
them now do you think they were
frightened of a little struggling
startup in Australia suing them of
course not we couldn't have afforded to
even get to the get to the courthouse so
consequently it was almost a matter of
good faith that they bothered licensing
it at all but it took us forever now the
number of companies we have maybe 50 or
60 licensees to those early technologies
and each one of them ate a little piece
of us and it took us away from the
creative issue of seeing the vision of
interaction with human beings of
building technologies we realized that
that mode is dead the mode of high
transaction cost licensing has to be put
behind us now one of the great powers of
the open source revolution in IT is
interestingly the lack of transaction
costs basically here's the rules if you
like it click here get on with it use
the tools but you agree to the rules
it's not valuation focused where you say
how much is it worth to you that's your
decision how much it's worth to you but
you're not expected to pay that you're
expected to pay in performance in
performance behavior in compliance with
the terms so that lesson of transaction
cost was one that we learned very very
painfully at quite a high expense so we
realized then that we weren't going to
be able to game our technologies that
way because what we needed to do was
actually provide them to everyone as an
incentive to build the next generation
so in a sense we over 20 years developed
in quite in parallel to the free and
open source software movement developed
the same concepts but in a world that is
influenced by patents by long time lines
and by a pre-existing gaming mentality
but now this is a court of the abstract
if any of you read that this is where I
actually get to turn back the the the
Wayback Machine about 4,000 years
because there is this cachet amongst
software development that free and
open-source was really it's a whole new
concept developed in the software world
but in fact it's about as fundamental a
human I like the blue the blue screen of
death just an honor of Microsoft excuse
me
a Google parse my password about 4,000
5,000 years ago humans started very
effectively domesticating plants and
animals so until that time they say
until about ten thousand years ago's we
were exclusively hunters and gatherers
whatever was there we would take if we
could take it if we can catch it need it
would do so ultimately that proved to be
somewhat unproductive in terms of
developing free time and developing
sadly and developing power structures
and so ultimately it became clear that
if you selected particular plants that
were better than the ones the generation
before and planted those you would start
to develop what ended up becoming
agriculture and over the several
thousand years of the domestication of
plants and animals virtually everything
that we have in our agriculture was
developed by a means and by a mechanism
that is utterly indistinguishable from
the norms of open-source software
development that is it was based around
the idea that you can benefit I didn't
say free software you can benefit from
your work as a plant breeder as a farmer
as well because farmers and plant
breeders were the same ones just as many
times the software that had been
developed prior to web 2.0 was designed
to be used by other software engineers
so in Linux is not designed to be used
by me it's designed to be used by people
to write programs that do something on
it similarly plant breeders and farmers
were the same entity for thousands of
years what happens is in plant breeding
let's take an example of rice it's a
plant I know extraordinarily well but
never enough rice is an inbreeding crop
that means that the pollen and the egg
typically are from the very same plant
now what that means is to get any
variation from one plant to the next
door from one generation to the next you
have to do a genetic cross that is you
rub the pollen from one plant on to the
as it were the eggs of another plant and
the progeny will have different types of
seeds you plant those and you find one
that does better for you that means it
tastes better it flowers earlier flowers
later stands taller stands shorter does
whatever you need is more resistant to X
Y or Z the genetic diversity of the
materials that gave rise to the rice
plant was enormous and so was the
contextual knowledge of those people
that were doing the cross and this is
something that is fascinatingly
different between software and the life
sciences and it's a point of huge
opportunity for us
what's the difference between somebody
programming in C on a Linux box in
Bangalore and somebody doing it in
Berkeley answer nothing Bob but the
interesting enough if you're programming
in C the contest is exactly what's
different but not for the programming
for the very very vast majority of
programming if you're programming for a
Linux box it could be running in
emeryville in a big warehouse or in
Bangalore and somewhere else what we've
done is basically removed context by
having standard operating systems
standardized calls standardized
basically demands web to is changing all
that but basically up until now with
software development we've tried to
remove context by homogenizing the
operating parameters in the life
sciences whether it be in public health
or health crises or in agriculture that
cannot be done but interestingly enough
that is exactly what industrialized
agriculture has tried to do where we
have actually taken land whether it be
in India China Africa Iowa and tried
very hard to turn it into a model system
so that we could then breed plants for
that model system and we could make
better performance in that model system
and we have seen the consequences which
is that we destroy soil fertility we
destroy rural livelihoods and in fact we
end up producing an over endowed super
plant that is actually inferior because
it cannot grow in diverse environments
and produce diverse results what's ended
up happening is that what software
engineering is doing now and moving to
web two point O is now in a sense what
the life sciences needs to rediscover
and it needs to rediscover not discover
it because only until 60 to 70 years ago
when hybrid maize started to be
developed and forty or forty years ago
or so when the Green Revolution which is
to get smaller shorter plants can take
stronger input levels without falling
over until that happened the idea that
each farmer's field each farmers paddock
was different was considered a truism of
course they're different therefore the
farmer had value in the context the
farmer would understand what is better
for my farm or for the market into which
i sell my produce but is better for my
regional community because it comes up
early enough that I can get the labor
pool that I need to do the harvesting
now as opposed to the other guy who does
it later in that way she or he uses the
same labor pool later all of these
contexts pieces of information
have been drummed out of it and so we
now have a highly homogenized and in my
view extraordinary precarious situation
in agriculture that is not dissimilar to
the early stages of software development
in which we only program for a
particular unified environment once we
learn how to have highly diverse highly
diverse user inputs actually sculpting
the tools themselves which is the
harbinger of web two point 0 then we
will see a richness in a context
dependency that is truly remarkable and
we need that in biological innovation we
need to restore we need to maintain the
imperatives of reasonable economic
success and business models but we have
to restore contextual dependence into
that that's a huge scientific challenge
this isn't a woolly birkenstock clad
idea of let's go back to the earth it's
nothing like that it's more like let's
take those lessons which we have
unlearned relearn them and graft onto
that scientific method and the ambition
to do far far better but the humility to
do it better in the context of other
people doing better this is the key but
we have to push against now in the
patent world about seven years ago the
Rockefeller Foundation realized that
even in rice biotechnology which they're
promoting in the poorer countries of the
world they were discovering that the
richer countries in particular larger
corporations and universities gaming the
system we're seeking patents on
fundamental processes and fundamental
components of the rice genome and the
rice genome engineering capability and
that this was going to inhibit the
development sustainable sector that
would improve rice over the years and
this is a remarkable feature we have to
remember because life sciences takes a
long time it means that it takes a lot
of confidence in the investment
community now that investment community
doesn't have to be guys in silk suits it
can be the panchayat it can be a small
consortium of local banks or seedsman
that invest just enough to keep a
process going for ten years but they
need confidence they need confidence
that there's a reasonable likelihood
they can deliver at the end and not be
crushed by a multinational the other
aspect is in the globalization of
agriculture the likelihood that you're
only operating locally is zero every
needs to make some cash to buy school
uniforms to buy medicine to have free
time to do anything
to get cash you have to sell to sell you
these days are always selling into a
potentially international market even if
you're selling in East Africa to a local
grain merchant that grain merchant may
wish to have the option in a bumper year
a surplus year to pull it with other
grain merchants in an export for
production of corn syrup blah blah blah
blah if you don't have that option you
can't generate the cash if you can't
generate the cash you can never
bootstrap out of poverty it's one of the
most fundamental truisms there is and
yet it is constantly denied in the
development set poverty is associated
with the lack of freedom of options in
business development for currently poor
people and that is associated with the
tools and interestingly enough patents
even patents only in the United States
can grossly under mine business
confidence of local scale small local
scale investment internationally so what
I'm talking about now is that to clean
up the world's house we have to clean up
our own house including including the
United States and Australia and Europe
and Japan and another industrialized
patent jurisdictions so we have to look
at the patent system and rockefeller
started funding us then to begin which
what was at the time the first public
sector fully searchable text searchable
patent database that was integrated
amongst jurisdictions and we've done
that over the years and and my-my-my
plaudits go to Google for having finally
developed google patents and let me show
you what we've done over the years with
patent lens marika net who's here is
deputy CEO has guided the development
over the last two years of the patent
lens and what we provided or is not just
information and not just search of a
patent even for a full text and not just
database or the forms of a patent but we
try to provide guidance cartography maps
in a sense for the nature of the rights
being accorded and this is very
important up to for those of you who
anybody here like history like just
reading history sometimes just to color
okay let's pretend that you did in the
Middle Ages in Europe there was a stage
which is still actual there's still a
lot of harmonies with it now where the
preferred solution to any social problem
was religion the only the only this
before science and so if you needed a
solution that something was very
challenging you would seek it in a
religious solution however that solution
through
the turgid texts the interpretation of
those texts was denied to the common
person and only accessible through
clergy that could actually read the
liturgical languages in that case Latin
often in through illustrated through
illuminated texts that were only
selectively available to a few they
would read and interpret those but only
if you even had access to the clergy and
the clergy became an enormously wealthy
and an enormously powerful group within
the church what ended up happening of
course is that spawn a number of what
were called by the church heresies in a
number of different approaches towards
in a sense democratizing access to
divine knowledge well as science emerged
in the last 300 years has a very
powerful and reproducible tool to get
true verifiable knowledge about the real
world what should happen but basically
increasingly a clergy emerges to ensure
that the power associated with that is
reserved for the select you know science
doesn't solve problems science creates
an understanding for the problem the
solution usually comes from either
process or product that is based on that
science so a change in your lifestyle
when science proves that smoking causes
lung cancer you can choose not to if
you're lucky enough to resist the
blandishments of the industries you
choose not to that's a lifestyle choice
that can improve your life based on the
scientific knowledge base or you can buy
a medicine or a plant but only if
someone has made those so the real issue
is science is not the real clergy it's
those that interpose between science and
solutions and in the last 40 or 50 years
that has increasingly become the world
of patents patents have actually been
the the crucial liturgical language
really of science in action patents are
not about science they're about the
conversion of science into perceived
economic value and that specialized
language and capability has emerged as
the ecclesiastical elite but we wish to
do is democratize that process we need
the business people anywhere small
business people very small business
people in any part of the world are able
to make a reasonable determination of
Greenfield versus minefield in the world
of patents you are all of you familiar
with what patents really are all the
patent is is the right
stop someone else from doing something
if I have a patent on this cup of coffee
it doesn't give me a right to drink it
it just gives me a right to prevent you
from drinking it in fact it only gives
me a right to sue you if you try to
drink it so I can't actually physically
stop you there is no jackbooted patent
police I can call upon but I can however
call a silk suited lawyer to file a
written blah blah blah blah so a patent
is a right to stop to invoke civil law
to stop someone from doing something but
doesn't give you a permissive right and
this is its is it's critical Achilles
heel and by understanding the nature of
these rights we can actually map out
areas of freedom and decency where you
don't actually have to navigate the
rights or if the rights are reasonably
provided we can licensed the rights but
if they're unreasonably provided
collectively if we have the landscape we
can navigate beyond it and we can
actually create new opportunities to
provide a pathway so there was a very
good paper written by a man named Ken
kookier anybody's interested in this
topic in nature biotechnology which is
the preeminent journal in the biotech
field something about navigating the the
IP landscapes or something it's a really
good paper what's it the patent maze
thank you and the analogy he uses in
that in that paper is extremely colorful
and useful and that is that in the early
days coming back to history the great
European empires were formed largely
because of control of trade and their
control of trade was based on maps if
you understood the safeway and sometimes
the only way to get from hitherto yon
where jaan would have nutmeg or in Dion
would have whatever you wanted to sell
then you had massive commercial
advantage over the others so it ended up
happening is those who controlled the
cartography the maps the the secret
paths were in the position of massive
economic and military power those maps
are the future to know where it is safe
to go how you can get there and do
useful things and interesting there now
right now patents in their raw form are
in complete absence of such a map so the
patent lens is an attempt and we hope in
collaboration with Google will be a
better attempt to actually try to create
a visible visible cartography where any
human being who has a wish to solve a
problem can recognize whether that
problem is already solved by someone
else which is an interesting issue
whether it's unsolved but unsolvable
in the current skein of rights or
whether in fact there is a pathway that
can be taken that can deliver a viable
cost-effective solution so what I want
to do is wrap this concept up now with a
vision of something really very tangible
so I've talked sort of effervescently in
the-- really about tools why not talk
about a real one that we're working on
in the lab we're a very small
institution like staggeringly small
sometimes like I'm not sure that
somebody is there to turn on the lights
now marina are here but here's one of
the things we're doing the original the
original act of gene transfer of
actually moving a gene from the test
tube actually originally into a plant
let's say you want to make a plant
that's resistant to nematode attack or
that makes it more nutritious seed okay
let's say you'd like to do that the very
first act is to besides actually coming
up with an idea is to transfer it into a
plant now the way that is typically done
throughout the world right now is using
a natural tool called agro bacterium in
the soil if you have a garden in the
soil I can promise you there are
millions millions of these bacteria
called agrobacterium tumefaciens no
matter where your garden is there will
be millions of these bacteria they have
evolved a phenomenal capability that
capability is to be a small Trojan horse
what happens is that agrobacterium over
millions of years has evolved the
ability to associate itself with plants
that are wounded and then to insert into
that plant a small snippet of code of
DNA what that code does when it
integrates is it called into the plant
genome is it is a true parasite it goes
in there and it says make this plant
form a Gaul or tumor and so the plant
open or are by making a lot of hormones
it shouldn't right or it shouldn't it
doesn't normally I should say and that's
a home for the bacteria so it starts
multiplying but that's not enough the
bacteria also puts into that little
inserted code the ability says now I
want this plant to synthesize compounds
chemical compounds that only I can eat
and the plant then starts doing that so
in this goal it's producing these
compounds called opines which only that
egra bacterium can eat so what a clever
biological system in terms that it
doesn't kill the plant plant just makes
a bump and feeds the bacteria which live
in the bump I need to meet the compounds
it's an incredibly clever scheme
but to the eye it looks just like any
other plant disease and a hundred years
ago even 50 years ago everyone assumed
it was because the bacterium was a
conventional pathogen you'd rub it on a
plant it would make a disease like other
plant diseases or or lesions on any of
us turns out it was only 35 years ago 30
years ago in fact that it was discovered
that this unique process of transferring
appease snippet of DNA was happening and
it was thought at the time it's the
unique example in the entire world of
inter Kingdom gene transfer and so we
thought well why don't we get rid of the
deleterious genes that make tumors and
opines and put in something sensible
it's helpful for the plant helpful for
agriculture the basic concept plant
genetic genetic engineering was
contingent on that and it worked but of
course what ended up happening all the
fundamental discoveries were made by
universities and the
max-planck-institute the University of
Ghent University of Washington and just
confusingly Washington University in st.
Louis all did some of the fundamental
biology that and they all filed patents
on and this was back in the 70s or late
or early 80s know what ended up
happening they SAT there latent ly like
a time bomb a submarine now the
technology of own is using but then
pretty soon the patents started
surfacing and firing the torpedoes till
fewer and fewer people have the rights
to do this and now in fact there are
only two companies in the world that own
really the dominant rights that monsanto
and buyer a german company and
interesting ly enough virtually
everybody else has been crushed out of
the industry so what a surprise that
there's public dissatisfaction unease
about genetic engineering at around the
same time that it's become instead of a
robust industry done by public and small
private sector but instead being a large
monolithic enterprise by an opaque
private sector does that sound at all
familiar in your industry because if it
does it also is associated with some of
our vision of how can we prove to people
that it doesn't have to be this way so
we set out just if they say how can we
analyze this patent ticket so we spent
some years analyzing four or five
hundred of the top patents if you can
imagine for 500 there's actually more
the top couple of tier of patents around
agrobacterium transformation and that's
available in what we call a patent a
technology landscape and it took us a
long time to do this which also taught
us that it's not a sustainable
enterprise to
this as a one-off with one team like
this so we did these technology
landscapes sorry about your bandwidth
here it'll come up you don't want to
read it anyway and realize that again
there was an Achilles heel and the
killings heel is the classic one that
lawyers always cleave to in those
definitions from the earliest days the
definition was based on our scientific
ignorance they would say that any
process that uses agrobacterium
tumefaciens to do blah blah blah blah
and we started reading these we read
more and more and more these patents and
analyzing and realizing wait a minute
well we convinced a different bacteria
could find a different bacterium that's
not agri bactrim a different genus a
different family with bacteria then all
these patents would suddenly become
irrelevant and then I thought well what
would happen if we just put it out in
the public build it and they will come
well then somebody's going to improve it
they'll file a patent on that it'll
begin the fick it all again so that's
when we can see many years ago of the
idea of what is now called biological
open source which is to use patent
licensing to generate the same freedom
of innovation space that has now
achieved in the free and open source
software movements so we did is we we
actually invented a new technology for
gene transfer that is that we move the
capability from agrobacterium into a
completely different family of vector
and that was a benign bacterium not a
pathogen at all just one that's
associated with with the growth of
nitrogen-fixing root nodules it's gone
it turned out that it worked and two
years ago almost exactly we published
this in the journal Nature which is a
very prominent journal also and at the
same time we went live with a
collaborative infrastructure to try to
build and improve on this and a
licensing scheme that took a very
interesting concept and that was we want
everyone to use it even Monsanto for
free we don't want a penny of your money
hi we'd like it but we're not going to
ask for it he'll not use it for free but
here's the here's the catch the mouse
click the catch is and by the way you
know the visitors not as closer it was
amazing it's incredible like three point
text like this just this oh except I
can't imagine what I signed so what
people assign when they take license
they say you can use this technology not
just for research you can use it not
just for humanitarian purposes but to
build an industry to do anything you
like
we don't want a piece of your success we
do however want you not to rain on
anyone else's parade so you agree that
if you get any rights from any other
third party or if you develop something
that would dominate this technology you
agree to license those day every other
licensed eat for free out of the same
conditions sounds familiar it is
familiar and happen another one which is
an honest ershon okay if you have those
rights you agree not to ever assert them
you don't have to just lighten up you
don't assert okay what's another one
well if you learn anything about the
biological safety of this technology you
share with everybody and the final thing
is if you make improvements that you
wish to protect yourself okay you make
serious improvements this technology you
must show this with other licensees or
just keep them secret yourselves so
another's it allows somebody to build a
culture of you know I can do it faster
in house if they want but I think
they'll see that productively it's
better to share but we don't want the
transaction cost of of drilling down
into their notebooks and things like
that so these three provisos have been
pretty attractive and since then we've
now got many many licenses of this
including the largest agrochemical
company in the world BASF which is it
realized as it came late to the biotech
game if we take out this license and
start the ball rolling in this we really
can do something special meaning they
don't have to pay for a technology they
can actually put their money into
product development which is a sensible
business strategy so it's moving this
one of the largest seed companies in
India JK agri seeds has licensed this
and we just had to do something
interesting we say that if you want to
support our this initiative we have a
totally separate technology support
agreement where based on the size of
your company you can contribute a
certain amount of money per year just to
keep us alive it's non-compulsory and so
far everybody has done it but we've done
is saying in the non-oecd countries
where cash may be an issue we want to do
technological and business affirmative
action I want to see big industries
competing with Monsanto based in India
like the fart like the generics did for
a long time knock on wood so what we do
is say okay JK agri seeds you can
license it for free and you can have a
technology support agreement in place
which keeps us going but instead of
giving us money for that you find and
identify a and fund the mid-career
scientists somewhere from India assign
them to us for three years will train
them as cutting-edge patent analyst and
they will build technology landscapes
for the public on the web they go back
to a really well paid job too
work with this company where they've
already had the red pill of open source
and they've helped the community of
general understand the landscapes it's a
really remarkable idea so the final 1
i'm going to close is to say with soap
what we talked about a tool like that of
genetic engineering alternative ways is
that really where we want to go that
have a bunch of companies doing genetic
engineering to be honest I'm not really
very interested in that concept you know
we have to break the monopoly so that
people have a choice to say no because
of their wish is not mine but more
importantly we have to give them
something positive so this is what I'm
going to leave you with the molecular
heuristic that I started the whole thing
on imagine this imagine a farmer
planting a field and not knowing what's
in the soil what you're just imagining
happens every day in every farmer's
field they don't know what's in there
they don't know how much nitrogen how
much phosphate how much water how many
pathogens the soil is the unknown
information the weather is the unknown
information we don't know any of these
things what if you did what if you could
actually not just plant your crop at
plant another plant that produces a
plant that produces a color that color
is an instrument it tells you how much
nitrogen is there it's a bio indicator
imagine the genetic engineering is not
used to make a higher yielding crop but
imagine that it's used to make
instruments but tell you what is in the
soil how much nitrogen how much
phosphate whatever else so farmer for
the first time in human history will not
be wading into the unknown will actually
be able to use an instrument that they
can get from another farmer across the
field because it will cost nothing it's
a biological organisms a seed it costs
them nothing to plant and it's their own
knowledge and their own commitment that
determines the response to that
information this is kind of web two
point oh but in the field the idea then
is that the organism senses things
plants do anyway and we we adjust it
through genetics to modulate that
transduce the information into a form
that anyone can understand okay and then
they can decide what to do nitrogen is
the single most important and limiting
nutrient other than water in agriculture
worldwide and it's invisible what if
every farmer had the option to plant an
indicator plant that would start to turn
orange on the tips of the leave when
there was not enough available nitrogen
that farmer would for the first time be
able to make a decision
do I take out a loan to buy urea do I
actually cycle it with organic nutrients
do i do I rotate crops with legumes to
do it there are many many many options
but that farmer will for the first time
have the intellectual and informational
power to make those determinations
herself this is a phenomenal opening to
use bioindicators we're not trying to
own the process we're trying to share
capability so the Lemelson foundation
based out of portland is supporting us a
little bit in getting this bio indicator
idea off the ground in a sense it's the
Apollo project of this entire BIOS
initiative by focusing on something
which revolutionizes the ability of
people worldwide to make their own
decisions in their own economic
development and all the componentry
that's necessary we're asserting that we
can build a true lamp stack for the life
sciences or basically the ability to
have all of the tools put them together
in a heuristic and a measurement device
like this or a group of measurement
devices in an open-source setting where
anyone can use them in different
combinations to make their own
instruments that do interesting things
we think can afford the revolution both
process wise and transaction costs
intellectual property wise and more
importantly socially in how you solve
problems and who are allowed to solve
problems so it strikes me that this is
in a sense Google writ large in the life
sciences it isn't about using IT for the
life sciences using the philosophy that
embodies Google's success into the life
sciences it's really about getting other
people to solve problems the reason
google is wealthy is because you've made
other people wealthy by allowing them to
make decisions based on better
information you have created wealth in
the world and in the process become a
wealthy company what we wish to see is
the same type of revolution in the life
sciences where this time those four
billion people that can't afford that
latte become empowered to become wealthy
if that happens it's going to be because
they have better decision-making
capability and more respect given to
their ability to do so so what I'm
hoping happens from this is that google
is an entity whether it's the dog or the
dot-com realizes that we have a unique
time limited opportunity to push the
boundaries into a form of philanthropy
that is anything but top-down it's
anything but top-down is totally
inspired by the successes that have made
Google success so that's not gonna leave
it and take any questions you have right
now so thank you thanks thanks thanks to
both of you for coming sir
all right blender be looks like
not much and this is this is interesting
I don't mean to make that a glib
statement for a long time I tried to
look for a sustainable business model to
generate revenue so that we could do
this it's not expensive to do what I'm
talking about my guess is that a seven
or eight year program for what I went in
fact when I was at sai foo here a few
months ago I gave a little X temporary
talk about this where I that's where I
first coined the concept of calling it a
lamp stack for life sciences and jon was
it that's where i met john and i picked
the number out of the air not completely
arbitrary that was probably going to be
about eight million dollars a year for
seven or eight years and there has a
life of its own now in the overall
federal budget or any budget for public
research that's small change so we're
talking about a very small amount of
money and it's not about a model at the
constitutional issue one of the
interesting great features of the green
open source movement has a taught us
that properly managed diverse and highly
distributive innovation can be very very
effective and that there are new
incentive methods that can bring things
out of the woodwork that already exists
you have to reinvent a lot of wheels so
there's a company called innocentive are
you aware of that it's an interesting
little compliment now it's getting
bigger there was a spinoff of eli lilly
the drug company and it was a
fascinating observation that that many
many corporations for instance that do
physical things like process chemicals
need a process engineering trick but
somebody already knows they know
somebody knows it's somewhere they know
it's out there somewhere but they need
it it's not a big proprietary thing it's
just they need the efficiency so what
they did is innocent of this guy alpheus
Bingaman started the company as a
spin-off decided to start posting
challenges and financial rewards it's
incredibly simple it said that anybody
who knows how to do the ion exchange of
this resin or such and such in a way
that cost less and such and such give us
a reasonable way to do it you'll get
10,000 bucks and lo and behold they
turned out that our scientists at
universities and companies it I know how
to do that and they would actually go in
there and submit this thing under
confidence you don't say if you do it
this way in this way they didn't try to
own it they just said I can solve your
problem now I can get some money boom
done it wasn't a matter of research it's
a matter of pulling things out of the
woodwork a very clever idea but why not
harness that for in a sense this true
Apollo project the reason I call an
Apollo project is because if you think
about what that entailed it wasn't
really about the moon that was sort of
the vision of what you want to see
happen but really what it was about is
developing in know
Armas industrial and technological
capability and building the site column
psychological self confidence in this
case of a nation both of those are what
we want to do in the life science you
want to build a psychological self
confidence in in human beings that are
out of the disenfranchised they can
solve problems and we want to build a
new technological capability so the
metaphor of the Apollo project is
sensible but the expense is different by
a factor of thousands and thousands well
I think this have a great question
fantastic questions you're already doing
that in a sense without meaning to when
you launched google patents a little
while ago it was a delightful step
because it basically even though we've
been doing stuff like this for years and
years we don't have your infrastructure
we have a total of eight developers at
cambia and so obviously the synergies
because we know a lot about the business
rules of pets the synergies between can
be on Google in the informatics arena
are potentially very very high in a
sense we're the weirdest company on
earth because we want to go out of
business our job is to see our world
view so commonplace that we're
unnecessary so if the google patent
analysis capability became as
sophisticated as we imagine and if it
proved good business for google i
wouldn't care as long as that capability
is there for the rest of the world then
we don't have to spend money on on
developers and struggling to buy patent
data sets then it becomes a worldwide
public good so that's a classic example
where the capabilities that are already
in house or in houses here can be
leveraged marvelously the informatics
capability in the communications
capability another is this when I
launched this two years ago we launched
the two years ago some of you know Brian
Bell and our food runs the Apache
Foundation and has been signally
important in developing that that tool
he offered us the use of his collabnet
capability collabnet is his company
which provides distributive software
development tools basically and so we
went live with something called the
bio-forge two years ago and it was a
resounding failure and as a resounding
 I just realized I signed the form
saying this could be broadcast
it wasn't it was a learning experience I
said that to the camera because what it
taught us was that the culture of an
innovation community matters far far
more than the bits and bobs or the
software or the anything else you have
to think of the culture of the
innovation community software
engineering has a totally different
culture and a different set of needs in
life sciences innovation so the toolkit
available in whether a subversion or
repositories or anything that's
available to sovereignty are totally
irrelevant to a life scientist who might
take three years four years to do a
piece of science and where most of the
time is offline so there's no
gratification being online most wet
scientists the life sciences go online
to check email or to do a couple of
serfs but they're not there they don't
do their innovation online so we
discovered as building the bio-forge was
very much a field of dreams we built it
and they did not come because in fact we
hadn't tailored it to the incentives and
the motivations of that community so it
was a great learning experience and now
we realize is that as the new
capabilities that are called sadly web
two point O are coming out we're seeing
that they're catered around
adjustability or tailor ability to the
community we're not going to have to
reinvent that wheel that many of the
communications in and incentivization
tools can be grafted onto the current
sorts of interfaces the wet science
can't be done by in kind I mean
ultimately people can contribute but you
have to be able to coordinate it that's
the issue I don't think most of the
Apollo project will be done in our
laboratories which are small we have to
have a small capability to maintain our
currency and quality assurance over
components but basically it'll be done
by using tools like the InnoCentive
which again is an informatics interface
there has to be a communications part of
it about validation part of it in a
quality control part of it these are all
things done on a website so again it's a
sort of thing that we can tap into
Google skills for in principle but
ultimately somebody who has to know the
industries know the life sciences has to
do wet science in a laboratory in a
field things like that that's best done
by highly distributive innovation that
uses incentives to pull things out of
the woodwork if they exist already or to
stimulate their creation rapidly it's
not going to be an academic exercise
it's not going to be published it in top
journals it's going to be solving
fundamental tool development challenges
so a lot of potential in kind but
there's also cash issues I mean we're a
small institution we
to convince I'm going from here tomorrow
to the Wellcome Trust which is the
world's largest private medical
philanthropy were quite interested in
this topic and a rockefeller right after
that who've been interested in us for a
long time to try to develop a consortium
of out-of-the-box thinkers who don't
want to see top down linear philanthropy
but want to see something so catalytic
that makes people's breath stop for a
while thinking could this be a different
way of doing business parsing the
patents rendering the poll patent system
transparent so that its excesses can be
fully understood and the consequences of
bad decisions can be anticipated or
visualized they can't right now there's
everybody who's arguing about patents is
arguing about something of which they
are fully and comprehensively ignorant
because no one knows for instance in the
next week Maria's publishing owner on
our web facility and probably in the
journal Nature also in the next few
weeks after that the first analysis
really of gene patenting that is
comprehensive it turns out that some
friends of ours at MIT about a year ago
little over a year ago published a paper
indicating that at that time their
analysis showed that over twenty percent
of the human genome had already been
patented which is shocking what's more
shocking is that our discovery was that
the data sets they based it on mostly
incomplete it turned out the GenBank
which holds the world's is the main
repository for DNA sequence information
is only as good as the supplied data
they get they receive and the amount of
data about patented DNA sequence they
had was a fraction of what they're
really was so our guys have worked with
the patent offices with GenBank with
others and discovered that in the
granted applications it's what maybe
thirty or forty percent more than that
and in the inserting the granted patents
and the applications the things coming
down the pike at seven or eight times as
many sequences are claimed and unless
you understand that it's hopeless and so
we built into that the query interface
called blast where you can actually take
a DNA sequence that you may have
discovered and challenge it against the
entire now patent and patent
applications data set so what we'll be
publishing is the technology landscape
on the rice genome and the rabid opsys
genome another small plant and we've
discovered is a horrific horrific truth
and it's the tip of the iceberg so the
first thing we need is utter
transparency in the patent system so
that its excesses can be either
cured or eliminated and any of its
strengths and there are a few can be
shored up so there's lots and lots of
rooms to the interaction now the
question is it sounds like you've
identified information around patents as
being one of the places that if the
information was better with two tables
that your work to go forward is there
any other any other place where an
information need or information search
need you've identified that that it was
solved better
we have the second the second one is a
wonderful and very broad question the
first one the first question can be
answered very specifically and one of
the reasons Maria is also joined us here
is because she's been leading the team
that actually can give you utter chapter
and verse about the enhancements in the
patent lens or the patent search
capability that we think add value and
then in the future can add much more so
rather than going prolix about that
right now what I could say briefly is
that is that there is embodied in the
different classical database fields of a
patent a huge amount of information that
is currently largely missing and I mean
basically the pet the search right now
on google is as far as i can see in its
very earliest implementations and it
doesn't embody the ability to search for
many discrete fields and actually to
query them with complex database styled
queries that is going to be important
for instance one that we're just
releasing is it released today or about
the the term okay but it'll be released
the next week or so and the public is
searching for patent term one of the
classic problems of patents is that
everybody assumes that if you see a
published patent it's because it's a
published right and it's not the huge
number of patents have lapsed and so
what's interesting is that it's a wealth
of technology in many cases that you're
free to use but people don't know that
so to be able to search for for instance
search for everything with the keywords
of compression algorithm and blah blah
blah blah which expired honor before
next Tuesday or next year if you're
doing a remember it's not a criminal
offence in most cases to actually
infringe a patent so it's a business
decision so if you decide you can keep
it all in house for two years and use
that technology to the patent expires
you know it's up to you it's a business
risk but you can do it but the ability
to search for patent term now and
constrain your search based on that is
very important the ability for virtually
anybody to look for related documents in
different jurisdictions it's going to be
utterly critical that we understand the
growing patent jurisdictions in what we
call the cjk character said Chinese
Japanese and Korean it is utterly
critical and that's going to be an
interesting challenge but what's
particularly interesting is that almost
all of the context dependent issues that
we use in in other types of languages
don't work in the same way as you I'm
sure they're huge numbers of experts in
this company that know that so
understanding the Chinese system
not so much important for the u.s.
though it is or Australia the other ways
but it's important to establish this
openness within China as well I mean
don't forget you've got 1.2 billion
innovators and who utter Lee need a
productive environmentally sound
agriculture and right now one of the
biggest problems I see having done 30
working visits in China is that the
environment is going to hell in a
handbasket faster than you can even
imagine because of abuses in in an
unsustainable agriculture necessary to
keep things live so internal development
it's not a matter just of finding out
the Chinese doing how the Chinese might
know what the Chinese are doing and
develop a better internal structure the
same is certainly true in India and
there were patients pneus in the WTO
world of foreign multinationals in
controlling has to be illuminated by
looking at relationships in business
terms so this is one that I think is
hugely important that we're not able to
do very well because we can't afford the
database access most companies have many
many affiliates and subsidiaries many
patents are owned only by those
subsidiaries and affiliates if you don't
know their relationship the ownership
relationships you know nothing about the
power relationships patents are about
power did you know that virtually every
patent up there has one piece of
information that is the most important
that is not publicly available and that
is who has the rights there could be
there could be a thousand pounds from
the University of California in fact
there are many more than that and not
one of us has a mechanism of asking well
who has the rights to these because it
will only show as a matter of record the
owner of the document and the process
the patent application and the patent
grant not the owner of the rights they
can make an exclusive and quite
confidential assignment of full rights
to Monsanto to Microsoft anybody else
and we have no matter of public record
to find that out a great service if we
can put our heads together and figure
out a way to demand policy-wise that
that simple matter of who has the rights
to this pattern which should be the
nature of it you know when the patent
system was developed it was it was
developed on the nod and a wink that
when you grant the patent to somebody
they actually do the thing you know when
it was my great great grand uncle thomas
that started the US patent system use
the secretary of state at the same time
as being the patent examiner imagine the
standard of novelty and non-obvious of
non-obviousness to get it passed thomas
jefferson he actually demanded often
working models of things but because of
the law it's fairly easy in the law to
say what you can't do it it's almost
impossible to say what you can it's the
nature of grants of Rights granting one
of the interesting features is that in
the early days of the patents it was
with a nod and a wink that is we grant
you formulated this right to exclude
others but the not in a wink was however
you'll do this thing so in other words
if Eli Whitney applies to make cotton G
and the understanding was that you get
the patent but with the understanding
you're going to make up cotton gin out
of it not just stop everybody else and
not sell the rights to somebody we don't
know so interestingly enough what has
now happened is that that transference
of Rights has become a completely opaque
world where it's as if you're fighting a
battle with blinders on you have no idea
who has rights and they can come to get
you in fact they can destroy the IT
industry if they're used incorrectly and
they are certainly already doing it in
guiding unfortunate business tools in
business models in the biotech
industries so finding out who has what
rights is not trivial it's hugely
difficult there are ways to parse some
of it other ways we have to change
policy but you know you guys are fairly
influential and policy changed too so
there's another area where some real
force can be brought to bear into a
second question I'm trying to my press
so it was a really interesting like yeah
yeah yeah oh you have the types of
information oh god
provided it would facilitate one of the
dreams I had not that there's going to
be a lot of answers to that that that's
a creative question that requires me to
sit around and drink a bottle of wine
and think about it which I can't do
right now because I you know its
previous bottles of wine from what i can
remember her well as I one of the
classic situations in managing natural
resources including and farming but in
this is also true in public health is it
nobody knows what anybody else is doing
so one of the initiatives that I know is
going on somewhere the instead program
is about trying to use information to
look at hints of latent public health
crises before they happen the same can
be done with natural resource management
and with farming conditions so the issue
of abiotic stress which would be in by
abiotic is not organisms is one but
biotic stress is also we don't have a
simple way of mapping migration of
unreal time of locust or mapping real
time migration even on a modest scale of
insects or pathogens that could be a
fundamental importance and for which you
can develop a prophylaxis an example
that actually overlaps with our ideas of
the bio indicators in fact very strongly
is that if you've ever been up to Napa
area or any of the great wine growing
areas the world of course the greatest
being Australia what you'll see is that
at the end of pretty much every vine row
you'll have a rosebush not purely for
the aesthetics of the rose though that's
a sort of an upside it's because the
rose bushes are more sensitive to fungal
pathogens than the vines are when you
start to see the rosebush wilt you know
that only at that point do you bother to
spray say with a Bordeaux mixture or a
fungicide what's great about that is it
saves money but it also saves the
environment the more information you
have about both abiotic and biotic
stresses in the environment overlaid
with mapping capabilities in real time
the more thoughtful information that
farmers are go and and natural resource
managers will have to be able to bring
to bear so big answer to your question
is huge yes in terms of real-time
biological and abiotic / am
that can be sourced and understood by
farmers in local languages imagine for
instance I've done a lot of work in the
south of India and where there's a lot
of problems with migratory pests coming
in now imagine that you actually or any
extension agent have the ability to look
on a variant of Google bio maps to
actually look for a report and easily
from the users perspective could could
have inputs put in as inputs are
inclined to be put in inputs inputs
uploaded to know that the brown
planthoppers have been sighted at this
position this position this position so
imagine that the interface to google bio
map could actually have information put
in by users that talks about the
prominence of particular organisms or
whatnot so the biological inputs of
organism density of environmental
parameters into that so it becomes a
true interfacial development are
enormous unfathomable they're so big one
of the great successes if you want to
call it that of modern agriculture is
called precision agriculture it's based
on knowing with these they have these
giant john deere's with gps is going out
through through iowa and they know which
patter that they're trained is it where
which part of the field doesn't have
enough X Y or Z so that they don't put
as many seeds there they put more than
fertilizer whatever else that's all
automatic we already have these they're
cool that are not John Deere there's
people the issue is they lack that
information about the particular
paddocks so imagine also that the
environmental upload of soil and water
conditions is also available so when you
do google maps you can say show me
what's known as soils here show me
what's known of nutrient deficiencies so
you can then this is where it gets
really exciting you can then find
community let's say you say show me a
place in the world that has similar
constraints and it finds you a place you
say give me a name of a guy or a person
to talk to who lives there and works
there just gives you that you say and
you put them on skype or whatever else
and you say hey how do you actually
handle the rice when you've got this
infestation of brown Clapperton hoppers
and they say well actually I just grow a
cane cane row on the sign of it and it
brought the ability to have con you know
what you said about context is to
actually ask questions about related
context at this point we can't do that
nobody knows how to do that but when I
look at google map
just discouragingly accurate I mean I
can actually see the car parked in front
of my house on the day it was taken to
their who was that who was visiting it's
a pool cleaner good over and you look at
that you think somebody who lives near
there if I can communicate with them and
ask them how they handle these
parameters these these biological or a
biological stresses on their field it
would be phenomenal so getting the human
side of it in there is fantastic if
people in a sense were registered for
their communication capability around a
particular geographical location and
we're willing to share knowledge back
and forth what you'd have is a
revolution amongst farmers farmer to
farmer peer-to-peer solving of problems
without always going through a
bottleneck of an expert sometimes that's
a terrible disaster because the expert
promotes themselves by denying such
access selectively so huge and the
answer to your question would take me
weeks and leaders to the properly
brainstorm but I've been thinking about
for 20 years as Marie and and it's just
wonderful what could be done for a field
based agriculture for poor countries
because they're not poor in commitment
they're not poor in context knowledge
they're just pour in confidence and the
tools and you do a lot for both that's
all a failure I think so I think so and
the reason I think so is because we can
make a distinction between tools and
products so similarly we would ask you
in IT I assume that you in the software
world or okay it's a safe guess here I
can ask you is it sustainable that
programming languages operating systems
interoperability standards whatnot
should be freely shared of course in
fact it's almost unthinkable that it
wouldn't be so my view is that not only
is it sustainable what it does mean is
we disrupt the status quo the current
business models in biotech are in my
view short-sighted in inadequate because
they are based around not sharing those
core tools my view as those business
models must die we have to have business
models that are about products and
services not denial of access so in the
short term it's going to be hard very
hard
because we have entrenched interests
that say we are making money and then
people say we'll see they're making
money it's but how are they making money
and what at what cost to the community
at large into wealth creation at large
so when you look at the number of me to
drugs out there you said why when people
say you have to have patents per
pharmaceutical innovation you said why
and the other aspect when I listen to
when i go to Davos and I listen to the
big big wigs talk about global health
within about seven or eight milliseconds
it segues into a discussion about
pharmaceuticals which is insane it's
just that that's the one that has a
mature if corrupted business model where
you can get a recurring revenue stream
if you really want public health you
want something where there's basically
no medical cost an enormous social gain
from it but that isn't discussed because
the business models aren't there so yes
it is absolutely sustainable as soon as
we establish some exemplary businesses
that can use these and people start
looking at them I mean when people ask
me always you know how do you make money
on open-source this is a funniest talk I
had people say well you know the models
for making money in the open source
world and then people said well you
could put yourself like red hat or you
could you know it does in his services I
said well wait a minute hey make money
with open source you make you money by
using it not from open source but with
open source and I said well Google is
probably the classic example the most
profitable company the world it makes it
with open source now you use plenty of
proprietary stuff but she used gobs of
open source as well and use it to make
money that's how to make this a
sustainable business model is you get
people to stop thinking of the tools of
biotech and the genes as a way to game
it to make money but instead as a way of
using it to create wealth so when we get
a few examples of companies that are
brave enough to take that gamble then
people will see it sustainable in the
short term no short term we're going to
have to drive it
yes and no one of the interesting things
about the life sciences and I suspect
this is true of software engineering is
that the first version never is very
good and the interesting features is do
you have remember that for a company to
use it to let's say the gene transfer
tool you actually have to meet not just
the permission to use it but also the
cost effectiveness of your process it
has to be efficient enough to make it in
your business now it's very rare that a
company has the capability of not only
coming up with an idea and protecting it
but also making it cost effective to
work in your business for that you need
to leverage other people's inputs so
it's interesting is that the almost the
only way you can make money from that
initial sort of tool development is by
basically as we would say in cricket
querying the pitch by base basically
making it so difficult for other people
to proceed that they buy you out and
that's the exit strategy for a lot of
startups is you invent this tool you're
not planning on building a
pharmaceutical with this you're not
planning on engineering a new plan
you're planning on being so irritating
to a Monsanto or a pioneer or a merc
that they buy you out and you make
yourself personally wealthy but what is
it done to this sector in general not a
lot in fact not a lot positive and a lot
negative so my assertion is we're not
looking for small business models right
now that are making money on tools we're
looking for a complete revolutionary
approach that allows huge new business
models to emerge from using tools we
don't have that in the life sciences
when people say you need patents in the
life sciences to innovate I utterly
refute that utterly refute that the two
most prominent technologies in the last
30 years in the life sciences our DNA
sequencing DNA sequencing the ability to
determine the order of bases in DNA was
the most powerful technology developed
in the last 35 years developed largely
by a man named Fred Sanger enormously
creative inventor in Cambridge England
he's not patented and within moments of
its development it was broadly taken up
it has been the most pervasive
technology and you don't need a patent
to see broad adoption of a powerful tool
the other one curiously also developed
the Cambridge monoclonal antibodies
hugely important developed by Cesar
milstein and somebody kohler colored
milstein bob kohler i don't know
and they didn't patent it and it was
taken up hugely the medical industries
in virtually everything so people will
tell you we have to have this to secure
the investment it's a circular argument
interestingly enough to say we have to
have the pads to secure the investment
interestingly enough they're saying we
have to have the patents because other
people might have the patents it sounds
like mutually assured destruction so did
we really need a nuclear silo well
Russia had our nuclear silo so we had to
have a nuclear silo and went back and
forth and back and forth until one of
them got bankrupt it that's not a
sensible way to run a planet we don't
have to the neat thing is since the free
and open source software movement became
so successful we've actually for the
first time been able to point at such a
success as a metaphor so we've been
pushing this for 20 years in the life
sciences and people said you know they
did humor me a little bit you know not
but in the last three or four years
people say cheese of the business models
look like they are robust and sure
there's a lot of differences we're not
porting it over directly there's a huge
amount instead for this when guys like
Nick d'onofrio from IBM come weighing
out in a panel that we're on that that
the analogies in the life sciences are
too profound to miss then other serious
hitters take it seriously so I think
we're there plus the system is
collapsing that's the other idea where
does not getting much out of the
pharmaceutical industries we're not
getting much out of agriculture so the
life sciences potential is augering in
so that's the worst pun you asked me a
short question you'll get an answer goes
on no personal answer her question what
occurred to me when you were talking
about
just take a gene sequencing period
against what's out there hmm it would
also be useful for people to to know who
else has query for the same coyote count
there's lots of issues sure but for
instance right if somebody says I've got
this bug it's even my client mm-hmm
right it would be very helpful other to
know who has the same problem you're
absolutely right there's an initiative
actually called she said which is the
global initiative for sharing avian
influential data Maria's involved in
this and it's one that I believe she's
talked to Vic Gundotra about the whole
issue is exactly as you say to
anticipate pandemics you have to know
which variant of the influenza is
reported in particular place but people
are jealously guarding that information
even though it's not to their advantage
so ironically the reason that we're
going to that there's potential for that
is that people sense that if you have an
open source premise it's not just open I
mean open source is not about just
sharing it it's about sharing with
conditions of the reciprocity if that is
in place then we can come up with
incentives for people to share but it's
quite challenging but hugely important
as you say I mean that one is a classic
one oh my god I mean the influenza if
that if that takes off all bets are off
so
I just I spent my twenty percent time
China's group of Socrates
through the scholar feature which the
search of which I couldn't oh it's okay
oh okay gotcha so I asked the question
what would that look like are you
biologists originally her or have you
yeah my friends in biology and I need to
do field biology ah did field surveys
for fast species stories for Beth in the
Olympics oh cool and it's the same sort
of thing like do I need to kill this bad
well will be the answer my question
without the answer to that question firm
ation all being me to organize and
accessible in some fashion unfortunately</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
