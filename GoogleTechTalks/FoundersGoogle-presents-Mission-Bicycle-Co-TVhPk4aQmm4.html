is Zach Rosen the founder and to my
right is Jefferson McCarley the general
manager of the store it's up on valencia
street in the Mission District so I'm a
little bit biased I actually do own a my
submission bicycle just as a disclaimer
it's sitting right over there and it's
just been an awesome experience I built
it myself or not really just by myself a
little bit of assistance but chose every
piece of it it was such a awesome
awesome experience that I decided that I
wanted to share it kind of with Googlers
and also I think we kind of care a lot
about you know urban transportation you
know we obviously care about bikes we
have thousands of the litter all over
campus so I thought these guys would be
great great kind of pair to bring to
come here to talk about a number of
things because Zach actually is also in
the software business so I think you
know if I look at what we're going to be
talking about today it'll span a pretty
wide gamut it'll go from urban
environments you know the history of the
bicycle technology to even perhaps agile
software development and and other geeky
topics so and also we want to make this
interactive as possible if you have a
question we're gonna have question in
that answers at the end but if you have
a question that's burning right kind of
given what Jefferson just says like jump
in raise your hand I'll call on you and
we can make this as engaging as you want
so to kick it off Jefferson wanna ask
you what is what it would make some
mission bicycle unique okay so I'd like
to introduce this guy right here this is
a mission bicycle this is a sort of what
we call that Valencia this is our first
frame design right here there's a lot of
things that make this unique
specifically let's start with a frame so
the Valencia is a frame design that we
commissioned local San Francisco frame
builder a man in a brilliant guy worked
with us to develop this design it's it's
a track geometry so if you think of a
velodrome like the racecourse a big oval
racecourse for bicycles this is the Burt
that's the birthplace of this frame
design around 1999-2000 its hotly
debated someone discovered that if you
take a track bike out of the village
room and you put it in the city and
makes a really amazing urban bike it's
fast
it corners so smoothly it's really light
so this guy is at 19 pounds one finger I
have a strong finger is super easy to
take care of it's virtually
maintenance-free and it's a it's elegant
it's simple it's clean it's beautiful so
Zakin and Matt saw that there were these
these weird bikes appearing on the scene
but you couldn't actually buy one in a
store you had to kind of have the
know-how to find a track frame to put
them together yourself and that's so
that's sort of the birthplace of this
bike let me talk a little bit more
specifically about the bike the tubing
is 4130 chromoly steel it's a very it's
got a high strength-to-weight ratio so
think aircraft tubing it's not a
straight gauge tube so the tube in the
middle is thinner than it is at the ends
that's so that we've got the strength at
the welds where we need it but we don't
have all the extra weight of all this
extra metal in the middle makes it a lot
lighter the steel is very forgiving a
lot of people think oh wait aluminum is
a much lighter metal why don't you use
aluminum aluminum is a lighter metal but
it's much softer metal so you have to
use a lot more of it to give it the
strength that you have with steel makes
that's why you see the tubes are big and
fat on aluminum bikes Luminum is also a
very rigid material so this is very
forgiving and very comfortable on the
road we the customer gets to pick every
component on the bike we start at seven
hundred fifty dollars with sort of base
components they're all good quality and
then we move up from there usually have
two levels of quality above good to
choose from you get to choose your
handlebar style your saddle the wheel
colors as you can see we actually build
each wheel by hand dan is over there
lacing spokes into a wheel right now
every bike is built
completely by hand James is building a
bike right here they're built on
valencia in san francisco part by part
so let me move forward from the
single-speed our original bike to the
Sutro so this think this is a single
speed right here this one of the reasons
why it's it's so light and people are
often shocked and surprised that there
are so many single speed bikes in San
Francisco we have a lot of tourists that
come into the shop we're sort of a
tourist destination for bike heats all
over the world and they're like how is
it that San Francisco can be known as
the helia city in the world and also the
single-speed capital of the world and
Google Maps is part of the answer we
actually look at the terrain and we are
thoughtful about how we plan our routes
we don't go straight up one hill and
down the other side we're very smart
about getting around so the way this is
geared is actually quite easy to get up
a nice incline um now any like Russian
Hill is going to be tough on any bike
but on a single speed it's actually not
too hard to get from point A to point B
in the city we do have a lot of
customers though that do live at the top
of russian hill or at the top of a hill
or a hill as part of their commute and
they need gears so we try to be as
accommodating as possible we always have
been try to build a truly custom bike
for each customer so we started putting
internally geared hubs on our frames
Charlie geared hubs are amazing they
give you the versatility of a full range
of gears that you would find on any road
bike or hybrid that was 21 27 29 speeds
but it's all done comp inside the hub so
instead of having an external derailleur
sprockets chainring front derailleur
back to earlier two shifters two cables
like this whole mess of mechanics that
this easily goes out of alignment
because I
awesome it needs a lie I'm seeing some
smiles needs a lot of maintenance we
have this solution that is virtually
maintenance-free the thing that we
didn't that we there's just one thing we
don't like about the internally geared
hub and that's that it made our
beautiful bikes a little bit more
cluttered looking so this bike for
example as you can see it has cable
guides on it when it comes to single
speed a lot of our customers ask us to
just put one front brake on it's eighty
percent of your stopping power for a lot
of people that's not that's enough of
course a hundred percent is safer than
eighty percent but some people like the
fact that it makes your bike a little
bit lighter it makes it a little bit
cheaper but really it's vanity having
just one front brake means that we don't
have to add these cable guides there's
no cable that runs back here it's just a
cleaner look so what we found is that
with people 18 speeds they also want a
rear brake generally so now we have two
cable guides one for the shifter that
goes down here and down here and now we
have added this one any this one and our
beautiful bikes are still beautiful but
they're not quite as elegant and clean
as they once were so for the last year
we've been working on a new design that
solves that problem and let me show you
what that is supergirl it's called the
Sutro and we named it the Sutro because
you can climb up to sutro tower on this
bike so this is a fully geared bike but
look how elegant can I get an own or ah
cuz if Jefferson boyfriend spike it is
it is yeah he he let me uh he let me
borrow it for you as much as its cities
you can compare them right next to each
other so you see no cable guides not
even the for the rear brake this has got
a rear brake on it it has gears it's
fully geared bike but incredibly
incredibly simple and beautiful ok so
I'll show you this side so you can see
how it works cables running right
through the frame now going back to the
geometry track geometry one of the
things that we like about it is how it
feels it puts us in a nice upright
riding position without being like Dutch
spike style um I've seen a lot of Google
bikes on this campus and the they don't
look at the most efficient bikes
necessarily so there is sort of a rule
like the the lower down you are usually
you've got drop handlebars you're
aerodynamic it's a very efficient use of
your leg muscles on the other end of the
scale fake Amsterdam very short
distances very slow but very comfortable
so we're looking for that sweet spot
between comfort and efficiency and track
geometry gives us that so what we didn't
invent track geometry we didn't invent
the internally geared hub we didn't
invent internally routed cables but
nobody's ever done this in this
combination before we're lucky because
we we don't have the constraints of of
an old fashioned bike industry we get to
think we get to start from scratch and
we get to think well we ride in the city
what kind of bike would we like to ride
a little bit more what you think but
those constraints were are like what
like I kind of when you say you don't
have to operate those constraints just
to kind of explain that little bit more
yeah sure um I think traditional on a
traditional bike you go into a bike shop
and you say i'm looking for a city bike
hybrid um they're going to show you a
bunch of bikes off the shelf and they're
going to have things they're going to
have a lot of features that are supposed
to help sell the bike and move this one
has to water bottle holders that sounds
great although my ride from home to the
movies is only 20 minutes and I don't
really necessarily need to hydrate for a
20-minute ride and how can be there's a
quick release here it makes it so fast
and easy to adjust my saddle height
which is something I'll do once when I
buy the bike and then my legs aren't
going to grow or shrink regularly so I
don't really need to make that
adjustment ever again um what the quick
release does here is it does make it
super easy for someone to steal my
saddle not a great feature for a city
bike same thing with the front hub and
the rear hub no quick releases on these
wheels so they're just that much harder
to steal in an urban setting um what
about the kickstand I need a kickstand
well what we did was we sort of exploded
the bike we took traditional bike with
fenders and kickstand and water bottle
cages and quick releases we took
everything apart and we put back what
was only absolutely necessary for urban
commuting and what we have is in as a
result is something that's lightweight
beautiful simple practical our
philosophy really here is form and
function so what happens when a customer
walks in because I can imagine the bike
geek right that you know maybe even
tries traveling out of state comes and
like you know that they're at home right
they know all they know the derailleur
they know that you know they can talk
the language how do you you know what
does your customer base look like and
how do you guys kind of interact with
people that are coming from that
experience where they're like I need a
kickstand two water bottles you know
every possible gear that you can give me
right how do you have how do you how do
they feel the mission bicycle shop and
hat and how do you guys approach that
problem well so I don't try to tell
people what the best solution is for the
yeah what we try to do is we just give
people information kind of like we just
did now like a pitch um yeah yeah
exactly so there's a so you you I
someone comes in and they say well I
want to sit upright I want to be up like
this this is the most comfortable i was
at Burning Man and there was a button my
burning burning man bike a SAT upright
like this has a big cushy wide saddle
and that's what I want and the answer is
yes okay that is very comfortable I can
identify with that yeah and so here are
the pros and cons to that so just giving
people information like yes is
comfortable but after a few blocks it
starts to get frustrating when
everybody's passing you on the left here
here in the US we ride bikes differently
than in Europe and um Amsterdam and this
is something we can talk a little bit
more about later about Amsterdam
everybody rides a bike and it's a
beautiful sight it's a very specific
kind of bike they're all the same bike
there's no diversity they're super
comfortable but there Amsterdam is a
very small town and they ride very
slowly yeah they're not in a big hurry
Americans we get up late and we're late
for work and our goal is we've got to
make that time up on the road and the
movie starts in 15 minutes and i'm
hungry and i just want to get home
quickly so we don't necessarily want to
have to always have a very slow ride
home it's nice for us to be able to
coast if we want to yeah but if we need
to book it then we can just think of the
big flies yeah so I mean kind of given
that shop experience right so now tell
me tell me about mission bicycle the
company kind of like what which rovi to
start this you know and what it what is
the company not just as a bicycle but as
a institution or as a group of kind of
people working on something yeah so I
mean I can I can run you guys through
some of this story but I want to build a
little on what Jefferson go for it so I
mean that the story was honestly I have
no bike industry experience when I got
into mission bikes this has been a hobby
project that just gotten completely out
of control and I'm a really wonderful
way and it was purely like that the
beginning of it was just I wanted a
great city bike I really wanted I bought
that crappy
bike and it was it would got me around
but I wasn't fun and I ended up you know
having a friend helped me design a bike
and by essentially a track bike and I i
went from biking being this thing I did
to get on the city because there's
better than the bus system to following
love with biking I had to really was a
really amazing experience cuz it in a
literal way changed my life like the way
I got around the city became really
enjoyable and made me a happier person
and my quality of life like went up a
notch and it was just you know we is
just this conversation I had with my
friend and business partner Matt Cheney
but viski why are no bike store selling
awesome city bikes like why do I have to
go on craigslist and get one from some
guy or like build one myself this is
crazy and there was no good answer it
was the answer was the industry just
wasn't building great city bikes there
was no no one had put together the bikes
are designed it with the constraints
that we we had in mind they were
designing with different constraints
like a hybrid bike is built for trail
riding on the weekend so it actually
isn't built for the city so we started
from scratch in the and the we've been
iterating on this and one of the I was
talking about to say the day well I
think it kind of blows my mind is the
bike is about a hundred plus years old
as a other product to the technology
other technology and it's a really
simple technology like there's how many
parts on a bike 20 25 it's it's not many
parts and we're literally building water
a little bit building on right now yeah
right so it's not like it takes right so
where's 20 some parts 100 years of
evolution many generations of bike
designs and we're still making it better
which is awesome and you know the the
specific constraints we had in mind
we're just our experience being how many
people here ride bikes in San Francisco
cool so I'm to ride by ride bikes yeah
in general yeah right there we go so as
and our bike is definitely not designed
for everyone in every use case that's
part of the point we designed it for our
what we had in mind is an amazing city
bike riding experience so no maintenance
you can't get up in the morning like oh
my bikes broken this
you have to go to get on it every day
ride it hard for an hour every day and
rely that will always work and not have
to be not the bus with it that's a first
big constraint and you know old road
bike were a bike with the derailleur on
it that you can't really generally do
that they're finicky the second
constraint was it need to be really
comfortable for City riding which is the
geometry and everything and the third in
another constraint was it needed we
thought I need to be 20 or 25 pounds
that was a sweet spot because it turns
out that bike theft is a real problem is
why people don't leave the bikes outside
like to do in amsterdam because of a get
stolen so people bring their bike inside
their house they put on the landing they
put it in an office place and so part of
our design constraint is how do you make
it bike really easy to throw over your
shoulder and go up a flight of stairs
which I don't think many people might
construe think about if they don't have
that in mind um so that's where we ended
up with this kind of it's been an
evolutionary process designing the bike
but that's been the ethos and you know
just like you design software with
design castrates in mind or you design
an application to be experience with
design castrates in mind we're doing the
same thing on a bicycle and that's it
yeah that's been or take yeah so how
does your how is your background I mean
when you kind of had that increase in
quality of life right I mean you were
basically in the software world yeah so
how did you and you had no experience in
the bicycle world but you knew you knew
that this was something that you really
passionate about like what did you learn
or what did you kind of take with you
from that software experience that I
kind of just channeled channeled it into
making a very successful bicycle company
which is very physical product my
different uh it's definitely a different
experience walking into mission bikes
than it is walking into tech company
yeah no doubt about it although you guys
have a an interesting blend here about
uh so there's definitely things that
there is just just no dick the hard part
of things just don't map at all for sure
but a surprisingly large amount of
things and what I did for my my job at
mission bikes and then at the software
companies i work at is exactly the same
in a lot of it is one of the base basic
things that's the same is what are we
trying to do for our customers we're
trying to provide the best experience
them for the moment they go to a website
in the moment they walk into our store
the moment they design a bike or buy a
bike or have a bike and ride it every
day about that entire experience front
to back to be amazing same thing you do
when you design a phone or you design
you know gmail or web app so that's that
that's a that's at the center of the the
company and that's exactly maps in Safa
world and organizationally I think and
we were geeking out about this yeah I
might be me maybe meet came out and
maybe the only people find this really
awesome and interesting but uh how many
people know about just-in-time
manufacturing or lean manufacturing a
little bit cool so good is a good
percentage yeah it's really that's
really high so there's now I'm going to
go in the geek world so this is a series
of essentially as i understand it
manufacturing process improvements
spearheaded accredited to in large part
to toyota as a company and there's a lot
of there's a lot of ideas in this it's
really a philosophy about how you do
manufacturing very very well but one of
the principal ideas is you try to you
know essentially you try to reduce as
much waste as you can in a manufacturing
process and one of the ways they think
about how to do that is what you know
one of the the things you will notice
about a Toyota factory is there's no
inventory so turns out American car
companies for 50 years we're just buying
a bunch of parts sticking them in
storage and then they go grab a part
when they needed it and go build a car
and a lot of that inventory just sit
around and rot if you look at Toyota
factories their ideal as there is no
inventory the truck pulls up to the
factory the moment they need that part
the part and instantly goes turns into a
car drives off the lot there's no
inventory at all to build a car factory
that delivers millions of cars a year
with that level of precision that's an
art they've been working on that for
literally 60 years and that's why they
are who they are decades so one of the
big things that's different about our
company is we don't carry bike inventory
I mean we have sometimes the time the
bike is built to pick up but the bicycle
actually
the customer walks in the store that
bike actually is in their mind they're
thinking about that bike then they get
it into our system and then we order the
parts and it gets assembled in a bike
and and they ride it out of the shop and
so here's the funny the punchline of
story what is agile and scrum it's lean
manufacturing applied software
engineering like almost all of the
inspiration and a lot of the theory and
thinking and agile scrum came directly
from the lean manufacturing world and so
all the things organizationally we're
trying to do in software development to
make engineering and product design a
really efficient process that's more of
a kind of a heart and a dance is the
same exact thing we try to think about
in Howard building bikes so cool and so
with any software company I feel like
the most successful ones have a mission
to them right so there you know it's
obviously like you know Google we
organize the world's information make it
universally accessible and useful right
so what is what would you describe me
you guys are you guys want to be the
Toyota of bicycles or I mean what is the
larger mission that you guys think
you're tackling with with mission
bicycle and I actually would love to get
like kind of both your reaction sure how
much they line up because I mean I feel
like you're you're much more alike than
the visionary stage right in the role
right much more of a higher level I mean
you're you're in there every day you
know seeing customers come in and engage
in with them right so I think just kind
of like you know your true perspectives
on that question there's a it's a really
good question and I'll mice my take on
this is I mean at the root of it we're
trying to improve people's quality of
life living in cities through biking
that's our vehicle to do that and the
experience that we all have who work at
the company riding bikes everyday and
experience of a friend's you ride bikes
every day in the cities is a better to
better life than the alternatives and so
we it's it's it's actually a remarkable
interesting story but basically biking
is almost doubled in most a major
American cities in the last 45 years and
then no one really I believe knows
exactly why and how a lot of the city
planners are trying to kind of
claim credit for a lot of that in some
some cases you can you can tie it back
to that but it actually started before
all this new investment in bike
infrastructure kind of happen as a
grassroots thing but essentially in
cities like you can get to a density
you're not going to build more roads you
can't you can't fit cars or enough cars
into a cities and European cities are
kind of maybe 20 30 years ahead of us
and how they think about this but
essentially we're getting an urban
planning nerding it's a lot we need yeah
we need to have a vision for what we
want a city experience to be and a piece
of that vision has to be biking I think
not the entire thing but a good chunk of
it and we want to be a part of that we
want to we want to it's not just about
making bicton selling bikes to customers
for us it's about how we actually drive
that forward so that's that that would
be the mission right I mean you deliver
any accidental mission by producing
these bicycles exactly so we in a
variable way we're building bikes to
enable people to have an amazing
experience biking in cities yeah we our
mission is aligned yes um but being in
the dredge of the test there's a test to
make sure okay its execution at
theoretical align so but but talking
more from the trenches like the
day-to-day store experience there is a
one of my missions as general manager is
to make sure that the that the custody
that the experience is accessible that
feels accessible and friendly and warm
and we speak in layman's terms because I
don't know if anybody's ever had the
experience of walking into a bike shop
and there's like there's a level of
intimidation there's often a level of
attitude that comes from the staff um
there are sort of dusty dirty places
that look more like hardware stores then
a place that you want to go and spend a
thousand dollars or more um we actually
see it there's like there's like an
invisible barrier between them at the
door of our shop and and there's
something about crossing into the
store that's that's that's difficult and
intimidating a lot of us don't know a
lot about bikes we don't know what a
headset is we don't know what the
difference between a Kevlar tire is or
we don't know about chromoly tubing so
we feel a little dumb we feel a little
intimidated and the sometimes attitude
that we get from bike store employees
just makes that so much worse so what we
try to do is create an environment
that's welcoming and warm and open and
friendly and we just hold people's hands
through the entire process you repeat
the question oh so he asked what are the
specifically what are the some of the
things that we do to do that one is uh
we welcome everybody with the hello that
walks in the store and it's all right
pretty simple yeah yep crazy um and then
we back off a little bit and we let
people there's sort of like us after
doing this for enough years there's sort
of a science to it there's a psychology
about like the customer has to come in
and sort of get acclimated and just sort
of soak in the store and the energy and
kind of look and listen and is it safe
to ask a question and what is the vibe
of this place so that's one of the
things we do is we say hello and then we
leave them alone um we look for eye
contact when if somebody makes eye
contact with us then we're we're there
to answer questions we we try to
approach people and talk nine non bike
stuff if we can um to let them know that
we're human beings and we have the skill
set to talk non bike stuff it builds a
sense of trust and rapport the 2nd
juniors at the same problem yeah yeah
and then we do our best to get people
actually on a bike because I can talk
about geometry and I can talk about the
position and efficiency and the way
something feels and handles but until
you get on the bike itself um that is
what really sells a bike I always
recommend test rides we have a map
give everybody in the store and this is
kind of unconventional it's a map of all
the local bike shops in the neighborhood
there's like sex and we encourage people
to test ride are our competitors bikes
and then come back to us if they think
that our bike is right for them we don't
work on commission too so you had a
question as well
so got a repeating person right so the
question is on sourcing where do we
start source the parts and how do we
think about sourcing parts particularly
one main American manufacturing so our
job is divided the best bike parts
period for every part that we use and so
we bought we look at one of our bikes
over there the rims from velocity based
in Australia although moving to Florida
that's a brooks saddle that came from
England you know Thompson stems and
seatpost we love them made in Georgia by
a jet engine manufacturer who whose
employees love biking and use our tools
and so we've and we just gotta gone down
the line of every part we're trying to
buy the best parts that we can find so
some of them are in main unit USA
someone are made in Taiwan in England
all over the place you know that's a
very it's a very big question we the way
we think about it is purely how we build
the best bicycle and how we deliver that
to a customer and and we love the parts
manufacturers you work with like the
folks that we work with like Brooks an
old company like has been obsessing for
literally 100 plus years on how to
design an amazing leather saddle and
they have that in the bones of the
company and it makes the saddle
tremendous so that's that's totally what
we look for and there's still there are
still our specialty bike manufacturing
parts companies in the states like chris
king and thompson is where so chris king
is in up in the Pacific Northwest
Portland Seattle and Thompson is in
Georgia and what you find our companies
that are very high-end very precision
focused they build the best part that
they do in their industry they care the
most about it and it's not our job to
buy the cheapest stuff people don't come
into mission box to buy a chief bike
they come in to buy a bike that lasts in
a lifetime and so that's what that's we
deliver in a cost more
them right it costs more up front sure
um it doesn't cost more in the long run
trick possibly I mean my last hybrid I
had for several years and I had to take
it into the shop for a tune-up about
once a year on tune ups run about a
hundred bucks I have to call at the
making appointments to drop my bike off
drop the bike off and then I have to
come back another day to pick the bike
up this needed replacing and this needed
replacing and it was easy over a hundred
dollars a year in maintenance our bikes
we've been selling bikes now for about
five years and we don't see anything
coming back I mean it's really rare that
we see any kind of maintenance issues at
all so if you add up a hundred dollar a
year savings on maintenance our bike
becomes pretty cheap after a couple of
years yeah and it's one of those things
that for me it's like with comfort
you're going to use it more and get more
value out of it that's where you're
actually buying for so when you buy a
bike that fits well that like does
exactly what you want to do I mean that
that's where the real value is right you
know irrespective of price tag just
tuned to a certain extent absolutely
what I've seen in this industry a lot
and it's a really sad thing to have to
witness but a lot of people come in and
they say I'm thinking about getting into
cycling so what I want to do is not
spend a bunch of money because I don't
know if I'm gonna like it or not so I'm
gonna buy a cheap shitty bike for four
hundred dollars to see if I like it and
if I like it then I'll come back and
I'll buy a nice bike which is a
guarantee that you won't like it um it's
gonna make noise it was probably not
assembled correctly it's going to rattle
it's not comfortable it's not fun and
you've just wasted a hundred-dollar your
four hundred dollars yeah apparently we
our goal is to snot sell bikes but to
sell bikes to people that are going to
write them when someone comes in and
says um yeah you know i i'm probably
going to ride this bike a couple times a
year on the bike path then um i give
them a business card to our competitor
that's that's probably not our that's
probably not our bike that's the that's
the
$100 bike yeah what makes us happy is to
know that our bikes are on the road
every day so I want to get kind of back
to this this mission aspect of it
because i think it's it's interesting
right because you guys obviously when
you have a mission there's the future
right and we're not in that future yet
so kind of like what is what is to you
like the future of the city right and
how does how does a company like Mission
bicycle play in that and push it forward
and change it if that that makes any
sense totally I mean so there's
definitely a big grand vision behind as
I we're actually caught in a practical
the practicalities of this yes right so
the next bike we want to design this is
my taken this we're still talking us
internally some of the biggest unsolved
problems in biking in the city is theft
and safety right it's things like having
to take your lights on and off your bike
every time because someone will just
grab them or you know dealing with rain
and weather or vikes get stolen all the
time in the city and so we would I would
love it for mission to play a big role
in solving these like really solving
these types of problems for our
customers and there are there's some of
the more practical things like that's
one of the if you ask people where the
biggest obstacles to getting into biking
in in cities it's you know those it's
it's how literally how you get from your
home to your office feeling safe and
comfortable and how to deal with the
fact that there are you know there's
there's crime and you you know and a lot
of the bikes are not designed to make it
hard for people to steal things off the
bikes ours are we we put a lot of effort
to make these things really rugged and
so those are things that and I think
that's not something we could do only as
a company that there's something that
you know the city has to really invest
in and you're seeing that like you're
seeing bike bike path improvements
you're seeing the police taking by crime
a lot more seriously it really a lot of
that is policy yeah
I one of the things that I think is
really cool about mission bicycle is
that all we sell our urban bike products
there is no spandex in our shop anywhere
there are no water bottles for a long
distance rides all we're just completely
a hundred percent urban bike commuter so
we have this passion and everybody on
the staff has this passion that you can
just feel when you walk into the store
for urban bike commuting it's what we
talked about all the time and it's
almost like we make efforts to make the
bike make the city more bike friendly
and that's something a lot of shops
aren't able to do yeah they have that
mean i agree i mean when i walk in
there's there's a lose that feeling
right there's that sense of community
like me even talking with you guys it's
like everyone has that vision it's
awesome is there and i kind of want to
open up this question so perfect
I'm going to need these things they can
spoil the right foot
really good good question Jefferson gets
a special more than I do so we generally
our bikes a the folks when it rains use
detachable fenders and that's a
recommended practice we sell we have a
couple bikes here with racks they're not
huge racks but they're elegant and they
work and in general like what I would
love to do is find a ways to make these
these type of couch mo like really easy
to take off when you don't need them
part of it is to make these things 20
pounds simple light and useful everyday
but when you need to go grocery shopping
or you it's raining outside it's really
easy to deal with that so we're trying
to you know I deal is we can design
these things with the best of both
worlds perfect example so this is a very
beautiful elegant rear fender made from
bamboo by two brothers in Pittsburgh
they tell me that they even travel by
bike to get the hardware which is also
made at Pittsburgh it's cutter with the
varnish a green varnish that's supposed
to last 27 years and um and it is
removable so here in this part of the
world we have a rainy season and it's
going to start pretty soon a couple
months from now december november on the
earliest and then it lasts through the
spring so sometimes we put our fender on
our bike for rainy season and then we
take it off for the rest of the year
because um yeah it's a little cluttered
visually but also it's a little extra
weight that that we add to the bike and
then on the rear rack we have found an
amazing fender made in canada I'm sorry
our rear rack made it kind of its on
that baby blue bike right there one of
the reasons why i think is the best rock
and her maid is because if you've
written with panniers you may know of
this thing called he'll strike whereas
you're peddling your heel hits the bag
your bag it's super annoying and this
rack in particular has sort of an arm
that extends it far enough back to leave
it's the only Iraq I've ever seen to do
that it does have a really nice sleek
profile so it's not great for putting
stuff on top but it's perfect for
putting bags on the side big for big
grocery trips are ideal is form and
function that's definitely what we
design for ya thank you yeah it's a very
good Google question yeah it's a repeat
repeat in the question is around
scalability for their business model the
model for business so we've been growing
fairly quickly especially for a bike
company since we started there's a and
it's a question we obviously wrestle
with a lot and we think about a lot as
we look to grow as we have in the past
the next three or four or five years so
there's definitely a limit to know more
people in the world you will buy a
bicycle through a computer and never
having test written it but you'd be
surprised how many people walk in our
shop from Paris saying my friend bought
a bike when he was in San Francisco last
here I love it i'm here to buy a bike
and so our assumption is you know we're
we're reaching a very defined group of
people who are living in major cities
across the world our shop and lunches
you how many people have actually been
to it or seen it yeah so it's like 400
square feet it's very small it's very
focused so our assumption is that we can
reach these people pretty efficiently
who need to probably physically in the
real world with stores in these major
cities over time but much of a business
has focused in terms of how we support
customers or however reaching customers
and publishing online so we have a
pretty big web following and we kind
Kristen that's essentially what they do
most of their time is interact with our
customers and publish and so that's kind
of the model for our businesses work
with our our followers and grower
audience of people who are connecting
with us through the internet and then to
use these kind of physical presence as
brand hubs in different parts of the
world and we definitely assume we're
gonna be opening another store at some
point
soonish next few years and but you know
it's hard and capital intensive and you
know fly across the country a bunch i
guess to manage it so that's something
we're taking very seriously yeah sorry
far as i do first
love it but one thousand dollar is still
medium fries sure so there's a big gap
can't aspire to a thousand dollar by and
for people who are concern about things
like urban transportation you know that
we get more cyclists on the road we're
going to get more advocacy for bike
lanes bicycle rides parking off the
streets all these things that we all
what are you guys doing the car keep
thinking about either often for
doctoring by or maybe harder for people
to bring in their own sort of
Frankenstein body and get next trip down
to like basically the experience that
you have so really excellent question
yeah so was this a start making a
conservator just repeat it concise oh so
the question is housing dollars a very
it's a premium price in a premium
product and there's a limited reach up
not everyone is going to have a thousand
dollars to invest in a bike and and more
bikers the biker how do we get about
bikers exactly awesome question so and I
want to reiterate that so on that point
so there's actually really great studies
on biking safety basically showing that
while the like the amount of biking in
San Francisco and other cities they
shown this in many cities across the
country has been doubling the number of
basically accidents people have had as
as state pretty much flat so essentially
Vikings gotten twice or three times
safer just in the last three or four
years purely because people are seeing
more bikes in the roads and cars are
learning how to drive and bikers are
learning how to bike that's an amazing
thing and I completely agree that needs
to happen so we are very we're a very
small and focus company we can only do
so many things and we're we're still
trying to and we have a long way to go
continually refining just what we do
already and making it better so I
definitely don't see ourselves doing
something drastically different anytime
soon in terms of how we're what types of
bikes were making and how we're reaching
customers that's just not what we think
about but we we love all the other stuff
that's happening like my kitchens are
awesome and I also totally mean I agree
that people don't go from not biking to
a mission bicycle in one foul swoop all
the time usually the the experience is
maybe someone someone to mine they
borrow a bike or they had an old bike in
a garage
start writing and within a couple weeks
they know that they need a better bike
or they want 25 like to get them a
lifetime so but we don't we definitely
have a number of people walk you do walk
in to the shop and know they want to
bike ready to bike want to bike glass
and lifetime and we will be so yeah so
um it's a great point and all of us on
staff would rather see people on a bike
than not on a bike whether it's our bike
or another cheaper bike it's maybe we
want to stay focused on producing a
superior quality product and not get
distracted by trying to offer too many
things so that's probably one reason why
we need to just maintain our brand in
that way but also um and I hope this
doesn't sound too Randy but when you can
buy a bike at Toys R Us or kmart and
adult bike we tend to think of bikes as
toys we grew up with bikes and we don't
think that we should pay very much for
bikes it's unfortunate an unfortunate
mindset yeah um we don't think twice
about paying a lot of money for a car
cars are just expensive and we've just
sort of accepted that and you know it's
funny because people come into the
intermission bicycle often and there and
they balk at the price because they're
used to seeing like sit for two hundred
dollars or three hundred dollars but it
turns out they drive a very expensive
car and they use a macbook pro and they
use like everything else in their lives
is a very high quality but when it comes
to a bike they they don't want to spend
very much money so part of it may be a
little bit different mind culture oft
yeah good answer good question now have
a go
mm-hmm it's a good question yeah we used
the questions so the question is are
have you based money are we self
financed or be profitable yeah the
company is profitable and it's been
growing we've set a pretty good pace and
we we like our rate of growth although
we were we're we're pretty ambitious so
we want this company to be we really
want to be all around the world we're
very many ways we're already kind of a
global company but we want to really
make that real so we ended up so this
the business story behind mission bikes
is we started it in a web development
consulting company that I started with a
couple business partners called chapter
3 which is still running we were
literally building bikes in our
conference room and we which was
interesting and what we clients there
was really interesting and we we had no
idea what we're doing and we ended up
spinning it out as its own independent
company in 2009 in opening this store
and to do that we raised some small
financing for friends and family so just
to get the store up and running and get
the business going and since then
through scaling our profits and some mod
modest free investment it's been it's
been growing but it's not you might
might so the other back story here we
talk much but is Jefferson really does
is the general manager operates a day
today with this awesome staff these guys
run the show I don't run the show I have
a separate job doing tech work at a
startup called Pantheon that I work you
know not a.m. till whenever um that's 5
p.m. no no and I come bug these guys on
nights and weekends generally or an
email so uh you know I'm very familiar
with the kind of venture financing model
we're doing that at Pantheon I get it
it's not what we do emission bicycle
it's a different kind of company and can
you can you explain that though I'm it's
like software company right everyone's
like VC capital R to raise rounds all of
this
and then all of a sudden used to
transition to this other type of company
right you're create a physical product
right and seems like yeah that whole the
whole culture entrepreneurial culture of
raising rounds everyone paying attention
you know it kind of seems it seems to be
disproportionate attention maybe yeah I
don't know your thoughts on that are oh
I think there's a lot I think um you
know every year in America I don't know
how many millions of companies get
started and maybe 10,000 of them are
ventured tech companies so most of the
startups that happen in the country or
not you have texture tech tech venture
is its own thing right yeah um if you
look at the numbers for tech venture you
look at it you take a step back and look
at it as an ecosystem it has a really
define character you know some some
number of thousands of companies get
venture financed every year every year
maybe a hundred or so them have really
great exits like it's sold for 100
million plus sort IPO or whatever and
maybe one Google comes around a decade
that's kind of the the rule and so if
you go down the venture path and then
tech world and you raise money that's
the path you're on you know that's
that's the ownership path that you're on
so you did you in exchange for being a
tech venture company you accept that's
your kind of destiny that's not the
destiny that I know don't want to have
permission bicycle we don't want to we
don't see this as a company needs to get
to a billion dollar exit in 10 years
that's not the goal the goal is the
mission the goal is to change bike
commuting in the world and so the path
we're on looks much more like any other
start-up in America which is the other
nine hundred the other 999 thousand you
know whatever companies get started
every year which is you know it looks
more brick-and-mortar it looks more bank
loans it looks more like you're
profitable and you come on profits on
advertising biz in advertising basin so
that's and it's very built brick by
brick by brick and that's definitely
what we do fish bikes and that comes
with growing pains so we are growing
pretty quickly and we this is an
unconventional model there there's
nobody else that we can look to to see
exactly why okay what do they do and how
did they
do this we're starting from scratch and
we're really coming up with a new model
so it means we learned we've learned a
lot of hard lessons along the way yeah
it's it's we're doing something weird I
mean the bike companies don't not carry
bicycle products like the in the way I
went to enter bike a couple years ago
which was it's basically the big trade
show for the bike industry and I could
rant on up for a while on this but one
of the things that really irked me about
interbike was the way the industry
thinks is that the bike brands think the
bike stores are their customers they
think they're selling bicycles to stores
and that the store sell the customers so
what that means the people who actually
designed the bikes don't actually think
about the person who's riding the bike
that's disconnected and it leads I think
to a very insular thinking about how you
design products I think it leads to a
lot of just the way it operates is just
kind of dysfunctional um we're not in
that bucket we both design the bike and
we people come in our store every day we
interact with customers all the time and
so we can kind of close that gap a lot
and we can have a much deeper
relationship but with our customers
because we're not just a local bike
store that that has someone else's
product we have our product and so we
take it very you know any feedback to
give us we take very personally this is
this is our bike so we're able to design
incorporate design much much quicker we
we we kind of live and breathe our
customers needs I think much clearly
much more clearly so that's pretty
exciting me and I think that the fact
that we look weird the fact that we
build bikes on a needed basis and we
don't carry inventory and you know
customers can design every little parts
they can come in our shop and build a
bike with us that's just awesome that's
that's kind of unexplored territory
where we're just kind of making it up
and we're just trying to design it an
amazing experience for customers and
wherever that leads us will go and that
creates missionaries so when we are able
to produce a really fantastic products
and give a really fantastic customer
experience um we convert our customers
to missionaries who want to
help share the message that's guilty as
charged that's some part of our
advertising strategy we spend almost
zero dollars on advertising cool I think
I think what we'll do is we'll wrap it
up because there's so much interact with
and I want to give you guys the
opportunity before we got to run off to
your next meeting or your next event but
I mean the back looks like it's almost
done in the duration that we spoke so
you guys going to may get that kind of
experience and I there's I think seven
people from Mission bicycle here so why
don't we why don't we just kind of let
everyone mingle there's plenty of bikes
and give them a round of applause</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
