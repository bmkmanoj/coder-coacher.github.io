OpenSocial is okay good good now that
that that that's good the only the only
answer I was hoping
or is that everyone's hand stayed in the
same place either all up or all down and
it was a half and half I was dreading so
so what I what I've got set up here is a
about a dozen slides to walk through
some things on what problem are we
trying to solve when a bunch of us in
the community including many people here
at Google said hey there's a need let's
see if we can find a way to do it what's
the state of it right now and what are
some of the interesting directions
what's happening what's coming where
where do we see things going on the this
is the seven word summary right that
this is why we thought there was
something worth doing here and I think
it's act was actually a couple of you
know what do we mean by web and what do
we mean by social that that and what do
we mean by the social web so if you know
I think the tim berners-lee did a blog
post I don't know what it was a couple
quarters ago now where he did an
equivalent statement I think in a very
eloquent as you'd expect way where he
drew an analogy between the the net the
web and then the graph and he said the
web is about the idea that if you have
simple lightweight open protocols that
allow a bunch of separate things to
connect together in the case of the web
a bunch of separate separate pages to
connect together in an intelligent way
you get some emergent wonderful stuff
and before that we did the same thing
with simple lightweight open protocols
to connect machines together and we got
the net you know so if you connect
machines with simple lightweight open
interoperability goodness connect pages
and apps goodness the next step is do
the same thing for people if we can find
simple lightweight open protocols that
allow us to connect people to each other
we should be able to get the same kind
of good emergent properties that you
know that the web gave us with the graph
thank you for connecting there you go so
you know that when I'm talking about
what it is about the web that we all
like that's sort of why Google you know
why Google would soar one of the core
values and foundations at Google is that
it's that notion of open that notion of
interoperable and that notion of
emergent stuff when you let lots of
nodes connect social is even more
obvious and we've got evolution on our
side here right we as a species are
social what we care about is largely
other members of the species and there's
lots of you know
lots of good reasons for that beyond
biological reasons it's just that's that
is that is what's interesting to us
that's how we get things done that's how
we have fun that's how we have how we do
work that's just how we work it's always
been true almost all the killer apps
have always been social apps the word
social is to quote one of our early
product managers Joe Kraus social is the
new black right now it's a little bit in
as a label which means it tends to lose
its meaning right and it's like oh yeah
yeah yeahs social but it's based on
something deep right we used to spell
social collaboration we used to spell
social group where we you know there
were lots of different ways that people
recognized that people care about other
people so obviously the value
proposition here is take the good ideas
of how the web works combine it with
this real need and we ought to be able
to come up with something pretty
valuable to me will know that the web is
social when I can run any application I
care about on any site I care about with
any of the people I care about right
that's when it has changed from social
is a feature or a destination or a thing
that I go do and has move to its
ubiquitous has moved to it's just part
of the fabric of the web you know you've
all heard the analogies about you know
when when electricity when electric
motors first came out you could go to
your Sears catalog and buy a home
electric motor right and it was cool i
had an electric motor how many electric
motors do you own now none of us know
but it's a lot and we don't think about
it it's just part of how we do things
right you know you all of those kinds of
analogies apply here the web will be
social when it's baked in and it's just
available everywhere to everyone and you
get the benefits without without having
to think about how it all works so when
we looked at that that's a that's a
large space large large set of things to
tackle we said what's the first piece of
this so we want to bite off what's the
first place that we think we can
actually get some get some community
traction going and solve a real problem
quickly and in the first problem we set
out to solve with OpenSocial was saying
today if I'm an application developer
and and I've built this cool new app
this is Noah by the way so Noah's built
this cool new app and he wants to deploy
it out there and he knows there are all
these
people who want to throw sheep at each
other want to keep track of where each
other have lived want to share music
tastes with each other want to recommend
books to each other whatever and they
all live in all these different places
and they all have incompatible ways of
doing it so if Noah wanted his
application to run on orkut or on
linkedin or in high five he'd have to
have separate relationships separate
separate separate technology to do it
and the promise that the thing that we
say we want to do is we want to make it
so that Noah can code to open social and
reach everyone obvious right so that is
the only trick computer scientists have
let's use that trick so the benefits of
OpenSocial in that world for app
developers is reach it just means code
once get to more people and you don't
have to one of the good things is you
don't have to be perfect you don't have
to be right once run anywhere if I can
reach 10 times the audience with two
times the effort that's wonderful right
doesn't have to be free anything that
makes it not ten times the audience ten
times the effort so you can
incrementally get that benefit for the
containers for the actual places where
people today hang out and interact with
each other what they get is they get
better functionality orkut is a more
interesting environment today because
because non orkut programmers are
building things to make it better
myspace is a more interesting
environment today because of that you
know all of that that's what the
containers get they get more goodness
for their users and users this comes
back to why we want a social web in the
first place there's more things they can
do in more places with more people so it
just makes the whole web better a
question that we often get asked by by
by cynics in the press and in partners
is why does google care so I I didn't
put it on the slide but I'll do the you
know the 30-second answer Google cares
because Google wins when the web wins
and we win when the web wins sort of
ideologically and financially right so
fortunately we don't have to choose
between doing what's right and doing
what's good for ourselves in this case
because Google is our whole business
model is built on a vibrant successful
web where lots of people get lots of
value from doing things online and
anything that makes that better ends up
being good for our business as well as
just being one of the reasons many of us
here at Google
excited about working in this space you
know like you know they line up which is
nice so when if users win and in a way
that allows all the different people who
have to play together to choose to play
together that makes the web better
that's that's what we're trying to do so
what is OpenSocial what does it take to
start to deliver on that promise well
first and I think technically by far the
most important is a spec right and it's
a spec first because that's how the web
works it's like let's come up with the
protocol that defines how tab a into
certs into slot B and if we can agree on
that protocol and it's a rich enough
protocol to enable people to build on
top of it and a clean enough protocol to
enable people to implement it then the
magic starts to happen that that's the
goal see so so defining the right set of
API is the first thing then of course
you have to write a bunch of code you
have to write code that makes it easy to
implement the spec you have to have the
people who are going to be building the
tabs and the slots do so have to start
getting that to get that the dynamic of
the virtuous cycle going of there's more
application so there's more reason to
use the applications and vice versa and
then open socials people there's a
community of people who are working
together to do this the there is also an
organization oh I'll get to the
foundation in a second you know these
are some of the this is the current
snapshot of the state of OpenSocial I'm
going to get into that I'm saving all
the meat for the end I just want to get
all the context done first these are at
the last time we took count these are
the various destination sites that have
either ship tour announced their intent
to ship support for OpenSocial roughly
the top thirty or forty percent or live
to live to end users is that about right
yeah rough lifers 30 well yeah it's not
exactly the same workers are chef
shipping code its a mix of developer or
user releases okay so you know that's
roughly where it is it's it's you know a
bunch of use depending on how we count
that means it's 270 million users who
you can reach with an OpenSocial
application which is that gets people's
attention which is good because that's
what's needed to prime the pump not
going to go through all the numbers but
it you know there's there's there's a
lot of uptake that timeline by the way
we first
said the word OpenSocial to the world on
November first so you know no you know
that the first time anyone had heard or
had the ability outside of the the
initial partners working on it to to
look at the initial api's was november
first so that's eight eight or so at
months ago you know not not not quite
full term yet and you know pretty good
progress for free and a half months in
there's an OpenSocial foundation that
Google Yahoo in my space said hey we
think that there's actually I actually
learned something I don't know how many
of you have dealt with IP issues around
technology and is in particular IP
issues around lots of parties playing
together around technology and I I
learned about that last bullet there my
originally wrote it as goal get out of
the way right the goal of the foundation
was hey this thing is working what can
we do to not slow down the community and
one of the things that could slow down
the community is IP disputes so let's
see what we can do to create an IP
framework so that no one has to think
about IP right the goal of talking to
lawyers is so you don't have to talk to
lawyers again and you know that that's
that's that's what Yahoo in my space in
us are trying to do and and that so
that's on track to be bootstrap it is
not meant to be the organization that
sets the direction of OpenSocial it's
meant to be the organization that makes
sure the community can continue to set
the direction of OpenSocial
intelligently all right that's all
context you know any any questions at
that level I've got you know this is a
very dense slide that's going to involve
drilling out to other other other web
page websites and going through things
and more depth so just that that was all
the problem statement ok so the IP plan
is there is that there there is a
non-profit entity the OpenSocial
Foundation you know a California
nonprofit corporation I forget which 50
X it is you know that I'm happy I was
able to forget but so there's a
non-profit entity that holds the
copyrights and that administers an IP
regime and roughly although you know
it'll be public as soon as it's as soon
as the lawyers stop talking it will be
an IP regime that says everyone who
contributes to a spec promises not to
sue anybody who implements this
back and that's pretty much the open ID
scheme we thought were many things we
liked about the open ID scheme we worked
with some of the people who were
involved in setting up the open ID
scheme and there were a couple of things
they said this was this was a bit of a
dead end don't replicate that but
roughly it is not trying to actually
hold patents or create cross licenses or
anything like that that gets complicated
right not trying you know it's just this
is a bunch of people who a bunch of
geeks who want to throw some good ideas
together to build a good spec some of
whom happen to work for large companies
and and then a bunch of large companies
who want to use the fruits of that so we
have to clean it up right so there so
you can be comfortable using the fruits
of this and the way we're doing that is
saying everyone who contributes to a
spec will sign a non assert saying I
will not sue anyone for patent
violations over any patents I might or
might not happen to have if they
implement the spec and that felt pretty
good to everybody it's been working with
open ID it avoid it's it's that one of
the goals was for an engineer who wants
to contribute to OpenSocial to spend as
little time as possible talking to their
legal department right we did not want
anything where you have to get a legal
department involved before you can have
a technical conversation and we didn't
you know that would just be the death of
the rhythm of development I don't think
the IP policy will help her hurt with
that I don't think
you it's yeah I guess that's possible i
think that comes down to though a
fundamental belief right it do you
believe that the right way for the whole
community to win is with a you know with
with open standards freely adoptable or
not yeah no I understand that was that
was that what that was a generic you and
you know if any particular player
because you know google has a large
patent portfolio if we decided that the
best way to win was for us to make sure
we got more than our fair share because
we had more than our fair share of
patents no IP regime is going to help
that right and on the other hand if we
believe that no we actually think the
main reason the main reason we have
patents is to keep anyone else from
doing something silly with their patents
then many IP regimes are going to work
so i think which is why i set which is
why i said i don't think the details of
the IP policy will affect it it's more a
core business value do you believe that
the way you win is by making the web
more social when you believe the way you
win is by locking up a corner of the web
they're both viable business strategies
but they're very different and anything
else at this level okay so just note on
version numbers that they don't mean
anything but just more of a timeline
thing when we launched we felt in when
we launched in November first it felt
half-baked so it was OpenSocial 0.5 we
didn't say that at the time is now this
is now long enough in the past I don't
mind calling it half-baked that Dan is
cringing but we launched version 0.5 and
we got a lot of feedback around good
start but boy is this broken or what
about this big hole or I can't do this
you know mostly from the people who are
trying to use it so I want to deploy my
music application on myspace and this is
what's stopping me fairly quickly came
out with a pretty significant 0.6 it was
very different a couple months after
that came out with a 0.7 and these are
all spec versions you know with that
with people implementing as they were
going 0.7 that was you know at the 20
different from 0.6 mm ya like like that
and then that's the one that's feeling
where the developer stopped complaining
and started coding they start they said
okay I got it I can now build what I
want my users to have on top of this
there's a 0.8 version that's been
defined that people are starting to
switch over to and it's incremental and
enhancing as opposed to as opposed to
changing the foundation yeah uh yeah but
I can't directly attribute that to the
versions because it's in such a
compressed timeline that is just a
natural adoption cycle that's confounded
with it because you have to get
mindshare you have to get awareness and
then you have to get mindshare and then
you have to make it to you know you know
so you can first you have to decide
you're you're going to code for
OpenSocial and then you have to figure
out what it is and then it had you have
to finish the things you're in the
middle of you know there's that that
natural delay and there's also a little
chicken and egg many of the people
building applications are very small
organizations which is wonderful and
it's one of the things that a standard
allows is for small organizations to win
because they can get big reach with
small effort but that means that they
are very quick roi focused so if if we
meet with a developer and say this is
cool new feature there's going to let
you make your appt ten times better and
it's going to be available on myspace in
six weeks they'll say wonderful come
talk to me in three weeks because six
weeks is distant future so there's the
this some of that going on too so you
know I don't have a graph you know I
don't think we've actually done a graph
of total number of apps available but my
sense is it's very much an increasing
slope curve well that's right that was
the first 0.7 was the first one where
many containers went past the sandbox
stage and said we now think the quality
of bar for apps is high enough that we
want all of our users to see this and I
think we're about to see we're getting
into it so that the next centerville
we're about to see a whole lot more at
takeoff the biggest week you've asked
for is hey JavaScript neat but sometimes
it sucks so what if we do rescue a
restaurant so that's what's coming in
here today which is defined convenient
method right now so that's probably a
little too small does that read a ball
or a little small come on ctrl + be my
friend there we go that at work okay so
you know the basics of you know where
OpenSocial 0.7 works is there's its
first what problem is this is the
problem to let multiple apps play
together right sort of compounding of
apps that's another one of the the
recurring fundamental how do we do this
right in computer science how do we do
modular software development and
deployment and a lot of OpenSocial is
built on some technology google
contributed in which was the gadgets
technology that was first used in
iGoogle for non social apps but it was
very much a technology to allow multiple
independent developers who didn't
necessarily trust each other to submit
and deploy code that ran together in a
context so that it's there's a
foundation of just the plumbing of
allowing that to happen before you add
the fact that these are social
applications and what that plumbing
looks like is basically a deployment
package where this is a very simple one
but this is what the distribution of an
OpenSocial application looks like it's
an XML manifest that defines a little
bit of metadata like the name of your
application so it can show up in a
directory the fact that it requires some
core functionality like in this case it
requires OpenSocial 0.7 and then the
actual payload of your application which
is the code you want to run in the final
place so that's that that's bare bones
there's a lot of other optional metadata
attributes and but the bulk of what you
do when you're building your application
is you just copy this thing and then you
you paste new payload in here and you
add with whatever optional metadata you
want that's a distribution mechanism the
reason that's nice is as a developer
once I've built one of those things I
can
register it with lots of different
containers and say here is my
application and different containers
different mixes of push and pull but you
typically host one of these things at a
known Earl on your on your site as an
application developer so now there's a
path I can go to to get the application
manifest and then when I updated and you
respect cache control headers and
updates and I've now deployed it to you
know millions of users in dozens of
countries and dozens of containers with
with a you know with 11 central thing
that's that's the idea there so the
payload itself is this in a typical
application I'll show you I'll show you
what they look like in Orkut that was
just the one I I'm opening it up but you
know in a typical typical container
you'll see that applications end up
getting drawn inside boxes oops sorry
about that click drawn inside boxes like
that so that that box it's labeled slide
TV is is the contents of one application
everything outside the box is drawn by
orkut and it's completely up to orkut to
draw it the job of a container that
wants to run an OpenSocial application
is a to give it an iframe on the page
and say this is where you're going to be
be to inject that payload that was in
the content block into the iframe and
see to provide the runtime library in
this case the JavaScript library methods
make them available to the application
so in the case of the hello world app it
didn't do anything we'll get there in a
second but there are going to be some
methods called by the application that
depend on the container and it's up to
connect to the container to make them
available so that's the job of a
container let's go back to here so
that's you know that's about as simple
as we could get I'm going to go through
past a bunch of mechanics here and let's
actually start building an application
so the first application we're going to
build is going to just get a list of my
friends so we're actually going to build
an application that's a little bit
social here does something that depends
on what container them in and therefore
the same application if I run it in
LinkedIn will give me a list of my
linkedin network connect
if I run it in my space it will give me
a list of my myspace friends and it'll
do that because one API multiple
implementations so that load friends
javascript method at the top there is a
simple call to the OpenSocial API is to
pull data so no magic there you create a
request a new data request and then you
say hey what I want to fetch is the
viewer and I want to fetch the viewers
friends so I want to know Who am I and
who do I know you make those calls and
then you do a request send and then it's
an asynchronous model of course Ajax a
model so it's an asynchronous model is
so in your page you you call load
friends and then in this case the
callback onload friends does something
and what it's doing is it's unpacking
the request so it's from the data that
you get back it's saying get out the
viewer get out the viewer friends and
then hey let's actually let's actually
spit out some HTML into the Dom of the
page so we'll go ahead and we will for
each view or stick them into a list and
done so so all of all of this is just a
JAX javascript programming there's
nothing special about it you're just
writing a web app the way you always
write a web app you just need access to
a little bit of social data how do you
get the social data you call the api is
they get social data and it's up to the
container to provide those api's in a
clean way so i'll show you just a little
bit i'll actually do one of these it's
not want to do many of these because it
gets redundant the this this is all on a
public site by the way everything i'm
doing here is on a public site and you
can read and and do whatever but if we
were to actually look at the actual
gadget spec for that load friends so far
that this is it and it just goes out and
it and it references a j/s file that has
the stuff we showed and this is the full
manifest but what i really want to do
rather than just looking at this is i
want to copy the link here copy link
location i'm going to go into orkut and
i'm now going to say an orchid hey i
want to edit which applications i'm
running
so at the moment I have those for
applications set up and I'm just going
to paste that new one in let's add that
and it's confirm it this is now orkut
saying hey I want to make sure Izzy that
our users know what they're getting into
when they run an application so let me
give them a you're about to do this are
you actually willing to let this
application have access to various bits
of your information it's up to the
container to enforce whatever policies
at wants around access to user data and
I'll go ahead and add the application
and there it is so this is that
application that we just we just
installed and in actually type it but
though we just installed and in this
case it pulled list of my Orkut friends
if I were to take that exact same Earl
pointing to an XML file and stick it
into high five I'd get my high five
friends the chrome would be different
the installation flow would be different
that's up to the container but the
application is running in its own area
its own box and it controls its destiny
inside that box so that's you know
everything else is more of the same
right exercise for the reader so i'll go
down to the bottom of the tutorial and
just show you some of the other things
but i think you already get the flavor
of developing in the existing open
social programming model so let's go
back here and so a couple of things that
are here you know one is a couple of
things to point out there are methods in
here where in addition now sorry I
scrolled down too far so in addition to
the bare bones of what I want to do is
to just display information about the
user about the users friends you can
there's also some hooks to do things so
one of the things you can do here is
we're actually getting information about
with it in this case what gifts I have
given my friends so it goes out and
makes calls to the datastore which is
also defined by the OpenSocial API and
says and you can say hey I've given Dan
a peanut I've given grandma cashew and
can keep track of those different things
it's fetching that and there's also and
this ends up being very impor
there's a post activity call that's
another OpenSocial primitive which is to
push messages out to the people you care
about and exactly how those messages are
delivered is completely up to the social
environment to the container but the
notion is an application that hey a
user's just done something in my
application that i think is of interest
to the people they know let's make it
available so so the core OpenSocial data
types that it works with we're seeing
all of them here first is people who am
I who are my friends second is a data
store to just keep track of some
statements and persistence and the third
is activities what am i doing that
turned out to be the over threshold bar
to unlock a world of creativity in
social applications we weren't sure
exactly what that minbar was but it
turned out that who i am who i know what
i'm doing is actually what we mean when
we say enable social apps and there's
lots of other things people would like
that's what they needed so let's let's
uh i'll go down to the bottom here we'll
just do one more so you know so here's
the gadget spec the gadget spec looks
the same a little bit different HTML in
here and it's pointing at some more
JavaScript let's go back and actually
look at that javascript again just to
see it so this is I'm going faster CC
sighs sort of size of scroll bar but
this is the complete application that
knows how to post activity about when
you've given something to somebody and
post sense that throw updates the
information in the data store updates
the who's given what to whom and then
does all the fetching need it to draw it
and let's do the same stunt as before
copy link location go into orkut edit
our applications and let's remove the
old one just so we're not confusing
ourselves taste in a new one at
application this is step 5 of the
tutorial and now i can i notice this
before it took a refresh before it's
stuck okay so i can give a peanut to
dance one of my friends dandy what a
peanut or do you want to cash it casha
casha there you go so i will give
cashew nut and and that's it there you
go dan peterson has received the cashew
nut no one's given me anything anyway if
we wanted to dan could look log in with
his credentials he'd see on his account
that when he ran the same app he's
received this and whether or not he's
running the app he could go into his
news feed and see that David gave him a
cashew nut and then he could click on
that and discover the application say oh
that's so cool let me get cetera who i
am who I know what I'm doing a little
bit of persistence a little bit of
plumbing to enable apps that's it that
turned out to be what's needed in an API
so if you remember that promise slide go
back to that you know if you remember
the promise was as an application
developer I should be able to code to a
single well-defined API and be from that
be able to reach and deploy these
applications in a bunch of different
contexts this is where we are delivering
on that promise I wouldn't say we're
close to done but we're a good ways
towards delivering on that promise I see
some healthy skepticism well here's what
I think a lot of people think is the
critical blockage point to explode I
hope you were going to give me some help
um I don't know who will value from what
I develop and as a receiver I don't know
which developments out there would
benefit what my activity needs desires
goals are and in some places up in some
sense there's a market place in between
your examples are directed communication
I and what we need is what we need is a
way to discover that someone else's
activity has generated something I can
value from job without being caught up
in directed communication yes see this
goes back and our other words to
understanding why Mission Control works
as a collaborative endeavor in the face
of surprise and change and whatever it's
this ability to not have to know I need
to ask him right for him to tell me what
to do as a task in that case after
something's gone wrong in a space
mission yep I can simply observe there's
activity and go oh I need to be doing
something or there's value over here and
this goes back and forth without
directed communication yes communication
breaks it all down so how do we get to
the point or how do the things you're
doing get to the point where we can help
people discover where there's value yep
without having this high workload
overhead of directed communication or
background knowledge to know somebody
has value for me yeah i mean i can i can
generate value for somebody else yeah
that that's an excellent question and
and certainly the the sample tutorial
app i went through is it the opposite of
you know it's it's it's kind of cool
that i could do something social with
someone else in a standard way but boys
at the beginning of the interesting
stuff it's also why some circles we
don't like to use the word social
because it tends to it tends to drive
people to those kinds yes it does yes it
does when it's this in a distributed
world what we're interested in is taking
advantage of that diversity when I don't
know exactly what there is to take
advantage yeah so that yeah I agree that
the two images sort of tag lines that
that I find most useful in thinking
about this one is just colloquially
peripheral vision right I want to enable
peripheral vision and the second the
clay shirt yeah okay okay
alright alright so the well established
doctrine in the in the field asserts
work from esteemed esteemed researchers
the peripheral vision is the appropriate
way to to think of this problem space
clay shirky and his recent book has a
talks about a mechanism for achieving
this he calls it just it just
summarizing a bunch of things he says
published then filter which is the idea
that there's starting to be this this
information connection mechanism which
is far from you know unicast or even
broadcast its broadcast everything all
the time everywhere and just tuned in to
the stuff you care about you know and
and that's that that you know that's a
good description of an ongoing trend
without being a prescription for how to
do it better right it is all that the
fact that this is happening now is is
like many other things technically
enabled right until it was possible and
it's as always it's you know look at the
fundamental costs of different things
and when cost structures change what's
had possible changes the cost of
physically getting the information from
me to you has plummeted to where it's
actually possible for me to broadcast
everything look at youtube it is
possible to broadcast stuff that there's
absolutely no point to broadcast and the
odds that anyone would care about it are
only point 0 0 1 percent oh that's a
huge audience if they can find it right
that's what enables published then
filters that you can lower those costs
so i think what will enable intelligent
filtering is awareness of social
connections right it's not the only
thing obviously Google search is a
wonderful filtering tool for the world
of everything that's on the web and it's
a wonderful filtering tool ignoring
social connections and figuring out how
to how to blend sort of raw information
based signals with social who do I know
who do I care about what are the people
I care about care about signals there's
been a bunch of people who have
unsuccessfully tried that right no one
has no one has cracked that yet I think
that I think the mechanics of OpenSocial
are going to allow more experiment
they're going to allow more people to
start tossing more information out into
the ether I think one of the things that
Facebook is doing very well and they're
actually doing it more we were several
of us were at f8 yesterday looking at
their their preview of what's coming one
of the things they're doing very well is
really using their newsfeed as a great
vehicle for a publish then filter
experience but just trying just starting
i believe to really figure out how to do
the filtering but that notion of let's
just throw it all out there i think
friendfeed that many of you have
probably seen as an example of a
start-up that's playing in the same
space of let's just spew a lot of
information out there I think news
crawls on CNN or as an example of
publish yeah it is a place across all
the different things we're all be
discussing these two days where are you
in just building infrastructure and the
example you decided letting the
experiments happen yup versus as in the
energy talk however you want to partner
in creating those experiments in guide
you know guiding those experiments even
though just as in the green talk you're
not really about three technologies will
get free energy and whatever but on the
other hand there's lots of interesting
ways Google philosophically and
potentially financially benefits if
those things work yeah so where do you
want to go in the experimentation
innovation discovery process as opposed
to just leave the structure up and then
whoever happens to be cool
what we want to do both is the short
answer and and I think we have to do
both partly because the right way to
build the direct end-user value that we
want to create that we want to see
created need some upgrades to the
infrastructure so if we can bootstrap
those that's necessary so that's why we
need to do that at the same time you
need some proof points you need some
examples you need them both for the
people working on the infrastructure and
to just get the juices flowing out there
so anything we can do to actually
connect all the dots I I had it as an
end of the talk thing let me actually
just give you an example of one of the
places where so everything I've said so
far has been about what the OpenSocial
community is doing and Google is one of
the loud voices in the open social
community because we care a lot about it
and we have a lot of people you know
contributing to the community but it's
all it's all you know on both an IP
regime and a branding regime and
everything else that's all opensocial
Google friend connect is a new product
that's in alpha release from google for
the last cup last couple months that is
built on top of some of these standards
and I'm not going to do a deep demo I'm
just going to use it as an example of
you know how we're trying to play at
many levels of the stack and the idea of
Google friend connect is let's take this
idea of gee I want to be able to make
things more social and remember when I
said the first problem and the first
promise was you've got these existing
social destinations and how can you make
them more interesting there's the whole
rest of the web right there are all the
little websites another quote from Clay
Shirky every website is a latent
community I completely agree right every
website there is a set of people who
huddle around that website with varying
levels of interest and they might some
of them are there they are
disproportionately likely to be
interested in each other than random
random people so what can we do to start
to unlock that and so the idea of friend
connect was what we do to make it very
easy for any site owner to drop in to
sprinkle some social on to their page
and start letting their the users of
that page interact with each other get
some benefits from knowing who each
other are what can we do to do that in
order to pull that off we said we have
to you know build on some infrastructure
some which exist in some which didn't
six
ago so it's built on open ID for
authentication it's built on Oh auth
which you know I'm not going to try to
explain details for those who don't know
but it's an authorization protocol it's
kind of like a valet key for the full
website where you can give someone you
don't have to give someone the password
to your email to give them the ability
to access your address book for example
and it's built on OpenSocial to let you
run applications so this is an example
we're saying let's look at the state of
the infrastructure let's build an
interesting end-to-end app that we think
does something pretty compelling for for
site owners and visitors to the to the
ninety percent of the web that gets you
notably small traffic compared to the
big sites in Owen by the way and doing
it we're finding some gaps in the
infrastructure so lets you know yell at
the folks next to us who are compelling
the infrastructure and try to move that
forward that's a half answer but you
know the butt but it the rest is all
details because it's you know we think
we need to work on all of this and we're
we we take it as a constraint that
anything we build around making the web
more social has to be something that
someone else could build on open
standards and and if those open
standards don't exist let's create them
let's advance them let's propose them so
that's kind of the how we do it but then
we work above and below the line how are
we on time you all right so let me shit
let me tell you what I didn't tell you
and then we can you know I expected this
to drop into QA and it did so thank you
for for engaging you know we talked
about OpenSocial 0.7 which is the thing
that has those 270 million users that we
cited OpenSocial 0.8 which is which is
approved and people are developing it
now there's a bunch of relatively
incremental enhancements to the
JavaScript methods things that are not
interesting at this level a very
important thing that we knew from day
one people wanted that was missing is
we're widening the programming model and
the power of the initial OpenSocial
release is all you have to do is code in
JavaScript standard web development
methodology run in the browser that's it
you don't need to server you don't need
to scale your servers you don't have to
worry about that just you know you can
do it all in the browser one
full some developers think that's
wonderful other developers say you're
tying my hands I've got servers i like
to code in rails or PHP or java or
whatever I've got a back-end and I want
to take advantage of it and you're
telling me I can't get the social
information on my server I can only do
it in the browser that the RESTful API
is that are part of 0.8 fix that we're
all of the things that you can do
through the JavaScript that are now
there's now a wire protocol that you can
also use to get that same information do
those same interactions from your
application development server and
therefore obviously they can play
together so it's an app developer you
can now choose what mix of app
development you want to do based on your
servers and what what mix you want to do
inside the browser the one of the one of
the word i realize that i haven't said
yet is shindig so shindig is an Apache
project it's an apache software
foundation open source project and the
mission of shindig is to make it easy to
adopt OpenSocial so what shindig has
built is a complete implementation of
the OpenSocial container side code so
that if I am a high five or a friendster
or or in a myspace or someone like that
and I wanted to I could download the
shindig stack plug it in by poking up
some data sources to the bottom of that
stack and I would then be able to do all
the mechanics around being an OpenSocial
container including implementing the
JavaScript and the RESTful API so that's
an open source project that's what I
wanted to cover I think we we ended up
talking about all the right things but
like i said i think i think let's do you
know declare this officially over but
i'll hang around for as long as people
want to chat so yeah we're what kinds of
applications are people building the
well it depends on on your tastes and
cool at the most part the most popular
stuff is as always you know what you
would find in you know and something the
most popular stuffs like what are the
ones that are that you know we just just
turned on orkut worldwide and the top
apps were a couple of music apps
and in the game and and you know and and
the things yet yep I like is a music one
buddy poke is just you know just say
yeah you know you know just yeah yeah
and and and that there you go so those
are the popular ones it's games it's
music it's fun and there's this
self-expression because one of the thing
because the places where a lot of this
rolls out is initially is on social
sites right so that's that's 11 Avenue I
think that's I think that category of
things is actually what I like least
about the label social because that's
the category that people think of when
they hear the word social and for good
reason because you know anything that
gets hundreds of millions of users
caring is but another very interesting
set of things that are not quite live
yet but a few of the business social
sites which don't tend to call
themselves social but the people like
LinkedIn people like Salesforce people
like Oracle that have you know are
working with OpenSocial are starting to
develop some really interesting apps
around using this in a business context
around you know you know an application
to see where I've been and where I'm
going on a map so you can if you're
going to be traveling and in the same
place as someone else or an application
who knows something about this that can
help me to work your network to find
things in an interesting way you know
those are not live yet but they're going
to be much more value creating there's
there's a category of application
actually Facebook touted this is one of
their top ones high five is seeing this
as one of their exciting ones which is a
how many of you know causes the app
causes yeah yeah if you do it's a very
simple application they all are
technically very simple it's an
application that let that lets you say
hey here's a cause I support and you
know I want to donate five bucks to it
and then your friends see that and then
they can donate money to that cause and
then it shows you your impact it's like
how much impact have you made by your
front you and your friends and your
friends friends contributing to this
cause that you care about you know and
it's both a self expression thing that
leads to an action and then and then it
turns out it turns out that one of the
things we're seeing with friend
act that ends up being you know you know
it almost doesn't count as an
application but ends up being valuable
is is I can show you is just very simply
a gallery of who's around so yeah so so
here is this you know here's one of the
front connect sample sites here's a
gallery of you know the people who have
decided to join this site so when I go
to the website i can see who's there the
peripheral vision thing and if i choose
to sign in and it knows i have google
cookies around so i'm going to sign in
with my google account then it's not
only going to show me who's around but
it's going to show me which of my
friends are around and members of the
site I don't even know if I'd call that
a nap the reason I think it's
interesting is because the ratio of how
much I care about it to how trivial i
think it is technically is really high
right the value the value to code ratio
there is surprisingly high to me too one
more okay yeah you know so for me when I
go to some random cooking site to see
not only that there's 2,000 members of
the site but you know but but that you
know I'll be able to see down here here
are my 10 friends who are also members
of the site and I can you know and i can
start clicking on them and finding out
what they're into him find out oh and
now I didn't know mussie was into
cooking wow that's kind of me you know
that like I said that's about as trivial
piece of technology as you can imagine
but the fact that that's that useful is
interesting
for this so do you for example about to
describe it as Delta is from the
Facebook model so the Expos emails to do
applications you expose people's friends
friends can you post the friends friends
walls and so forth so what's the bill um
yeah that's the first part of the
question so OpenSocial allows all of
those allows yes or no answers to every
question you just asked ok because
OpenSocial has to do because OpenSocial
is an API so one of the interesting
things developers coding to OpenSocial
have to get into their head is the fact
that there isn't a single policy
although there is a single mechanism and
and it as always with one of these
things that means the second container
they run on they say oh I didn't realize
that might be different and then after
that it gets easier so there is built
into the API at all levels the ability
for example to say you know you know how
much do you drink and the container can
say I don't know or it can say a lot or
a little because in some containers
that's an important piece of the profile
and others it's irrelevant right email
is just another example of that and
every call that is passed to the
container has that there's there's uh
what is a technical question is how can
we ensure that whatever the containers
policy is can be trustworthy enforced
right so built into the protocol is our
signing mechanisms for requests made
from the application to be signed by the
container with the ID of the owner of
the page and the viewer of the page and
the application before it's passed to
the container back end so the container
back end can then make sure that
according to whatever its policies are
it grants access to whatever subset of
the information yeah I'm play very
likely that there are any episode
so if I want fun to develop a new one it
seems there is little incentive to do
this but one is required do something is
it there's a way for me to find out if
something already out there I just typed
it oh I get it something out there um
yeah they're they're early stages so
there's no it's not as easy as it could
be but first you can go to you know the
hint of bet the there's always a long
tail but there's also always a short
head if you go to four sites and search
their directories you'll have ninety
five percent coverage of interesting
stuff if you go to those same four sites
and look at the top 10 most popular apps
you know that'll tell you most of what's
going on that's right but it's exactly
that yet and it's exactly the equivalent
problem to suppose you want to create a
new website that does something
interesting around you know finding out
the price of my houses and sharing it
with you know how do you find out if
that's a good idea to start a company to
do real estate pricing or hat shopping
or whatever you know that it is no
better or worse than that situation any
given ever will get them funny
so I'm going to give it the exact same
analogy exactly the same answer it's a
deep and important question but the
answer is going to be the same as if
your developer and you're thinking of
creating a new website are you going to
make money well it depends if you run
ads on your website again because you
can have ads running around these apps
but before you should place the host
these applications right because if if
I'm lived in maybe I want to have a
different model where I actually pay
developers to build on my platform here
and then I wouldn't want to have asked
an art hankla but in case I was like
myspace work never win even maybe you
can monetize with ads that are on a
certain set of where your app shows up
as opposed to on everywhere it's just
going to vary a little bit here one of
the when i'm going to give you two
examples of that taught me that i don't
know anything about monetization ok
because i was you know we're talking a
bunch of developers they all care about
this and there's the simple answer of
run ads on your application it's your
application it's just the just a web
page run ads if you wanted that the
container allows it one example is the
people who make one of the the PO caps
the you know throw a sheep at your
friends apps they said that they were
asking us a very important question
about OpenSocial right and they were
saying am I allowed to throw coke
bottles and my friends and we said huh
it turns out that they had a popular
enough application that they were
getting approached by product placement
opportunities where brands wanted to
inject their branded objects into this
application for more engagement and then
that became a question for the container
to do you or do you not allow that sort
of product placement which is a
fascinating question completely non
technical may end up being the way
someone makes the first hundred million
dollar business in this I don't know
right that was one of the two that
taught me that I know nothing about
monetization the other one is this is
this you know silly addictive
application called type racer ok so type
racer you run type racer and you get a
little you know countdown 3 2 1 go and
then it shows you a phrase
and you type the phrase and it keeps
track of how fast your type in and it
shows you how fast you type compared to
how your friends type and people compete
on you know when my it 60 words per
minute in my 89 words per minute
whatever right wonderful one day yeah
yes well yeah no I mean you're already
tensing up thinking about it imagine
when it's counting down in front of you
right so so somebody said and I don't
actually know if you did this deal but
he got into conversations where why
don't you get people to pay you to put
reviews of a new movie as the phrase
that you have to type Raiders of the
Lost Ark is the best movie ever i can't
delete imagine how they did the special
effects right it's like that's a huge
monetization opportunity that has
nothing right so i am sure there are
creative ways to make money here that I
don't have any cool about</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
