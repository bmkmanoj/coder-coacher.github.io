for those who don't know me my name is
Ming for those who know me my name is
still Ming I'm I'm the jolly good fellow
which nobody can deny
it's my honor today to introduce a
fellow jolly good fellow
Matthieu Ricard now Matthew is a very
good scientist who became a Buddhist
monk he was regarded as one of the most
promising scientists of his generation
Oh Troy biologist your mother yeah I
took it from the web he completed his
PhD thesis in 1972 before like most of
you were born and unfortunately he
wasn't able to join Google at a time so
so he went to Nepal instead and became a
biologist
now just kidding he became a monk and
he's lived in study in the Himalayas for
the past 35 years where he has been
doing a humanitarian projects matthew is
also a best-selling author
he's a translator and he's a
photographer and all these pictures they
are taken by him he is also an active
participant in current scientific
research on meditation and the brain and
in many other studies he is the brain
that they study when many high school
it'll call you the brain okay if they
did it they'll be right so Matthew is a
very happy man he is so happy he wrote
an entire book on happiness and he
autograph my book so so I'm very happy
thank you
Matthew is one of the most fascinating
man I've ever met in my life and I knew
telling me once yeah and I meet a lot of
famous keeper here you guys know that
and this is an honor and pleasure for me
to welcome
matthieu ricard to our presence
you know just to go on about for those
who don't know him and all those know
him there's also an interesting story of
of a middle east wise men called mullah
Nasruddin maybe many of your crew know
him and once he came into a coffee shop
and went straight to the owner and asked
him did you see me enter and the guy
said yes and then he asked but do you
know me and then I said no then how do
you know it's me so thank you so much
it's a pleasure to visit this
wonderfully enjoyable place where you
submit people in swimming trunk with
that with moving the alleys going to the
swimming pool and occasionally manx as
he leaves his massage chair to go to
this off to his office so definitely I
would like to work there and it seems
better than being at home so probably I
have nothing to to teach you about
happiness and someone told me actually I
should never have written this book
because I never suffered very much in my
life so this the last person to write a
book on happiness and suffering so
anyway I thought we'll just share a few
ideas because they were very dear to me
and they brought a lot of sense of
fulfillment and joy to be alive and a
sense of direction in life and this came
through meeting beings of great wisdom
it sort of started like that you know
when we speak of leadership leadership
has to be someone who somehow inspires
you by showing you the kind of potential
that you could actualize showing you
what you could become and give you a
sense of direction and inspiration
that's not very frequent in life now I
was quite lucky in my teens to be born
in the family in France where my father
was a well-known philosopher so we have
all these great thinkers and poets at
home my mother was an artist so with all
these you know three eldest painters and
all that coming
because of my musical connections when I
was 16 years old I had lunch with
cywinski himself you know just for two
hours with three people all together and
an uncle was an explorer he went around
the world on a sailboat without the
enzyme after the Second World War and he
all got all kinds of eccentric friends
such as one when we went to see in Paris
and there was a small note on his door
saying I left on foot for Timbuktu and
things like that so a lot of wonderful
people and in science of course the lab
I was working with with two three Nobel
Prize of Medicine Giacobbe mono and
wharf at Pasteur Institute so it was
very exciting very there was let
definitely lot of people to look at as
know what what could I do where could I
be inspired at the same time definitely
I would have wished to play the piano
you know like Stratos every star or the
chest like Bobby Fischer but I don't
know if you remember about the beefy
sure but who wants to become Bobby
Fischer so there was a kind of
discrepancy you know you could take
hundred governors you would have a
number of wonderful people and some
governor little quite short temper not
so nice to deal with but same thing with
philosopher same thing with scientists
same thing with artists no matter what
that particular skill or genius was
there was no correlation as such between
their human qualities and their
particular genius so you could try to
pick up all the things and make your own
salad and try to but that somehow didn't
seem artificial like making a part of
all that and thinking is going to work
so then I was lucky enough to travel to
the Himalayas and then I met something
quite different sort of men's of wisdom
men and women and wisdom and what was
special about them no they are all the
great tibetan teachers who have led the
invasion of Tibet and towards India and
other places is I didn't really care so
much what they knew dams of
no poetry Tibetan grammar and even
Buddhist philosophy in the beginning it
was not my my interest at all but what
they were that was inspiring the the
quality the human quality and then I
thought you know I won't become like
them not just know what they know and so
because there was a kind of the first
trigger was seeing a documentary movie
on those great teachers that someone a
friend of mine made for the French
television and at the end of the
documentary there was a five minute
silent second one face of those
meditators and Hermits and spiritual
teacher and the dela Garman after the
other just like saddened was so powerful
it was like twenty Socrates or twenty
cent positive sec whoever you feel like
it's represent the wisdom of humanity
just they're alive in our time so as a
while I should go to see and then that
was very interesting because somehow
someone like that and I'm going to show
some images show you what you could
become it's a source of inspiration give
you it that this is possible some
somebody made it somehow then of course
you get interested in how but first you
have to see that it's a it makes sense
and so also in the course of living in
the Himalayas and you after a while
traveling back and forth some of the
things became quite clear about what
brings little more fulfillment in life
and it seems that we saw much put our
hopes and fears in the outer conditions
so now let's be clear from the beginning
it is we want outer conditions to be
optimal
compared two hundred fifty years ago but
the life expectancy even in Europe was
like thirty years and now who doesn't
want to live long to be healthy to have
access to education to have a wonderful
working place harmonious human relations
in one family with friends with people
even play in country where there is
peace where there is not a oppressive
regime so all that we really deeply
a sort of yearn for that and that's
right and we off to to develop that to
the maximum we can to and especially in
the world where this far from being
granted for many many places of the
world where 3,000 children still die
every day of malaria and all that you
know and that's so much to do just to
bring those minimum outer condition yet
it's quite clear too that if we only put
our hopes and fears in the outer world
we it's not going to work in our search
for for direction for meaningful genuine
sense of fulfilment accomplishment what
we would call genuine happiness genuine
happiness doesn't mean pleasant feelings
one after the other is one more and more
intense piling them up renewing them
seeking them and then collapsing out
exhaustion at the end so that's not
going to work so it's more like a
cluster of qualities that we can develop
as skills like you know openness genuine
altruistic love compassion inner
strength some kind of inner peace and
then that gives you a sense of
confidence that's not just like a false
confidence of arrogance but confidence
that you are less vulnerable and
therefore more ready also to to be of
service of others and contribute to a
more compassionate and and society that
gives you better way of flourishing
yourself and others and because less
more confidence means less feeling of
insecurities or fears the more readiness
to be there for others so it's quite
clear that the outer condition
themselves not enough however necessary
or useful they might be not enough
because we also can clearly see that our
state of mind the way we interpret and
translate those other condition you know
in a sort of experience are what really
determines states of well-being and or
misery
the state of mind can easily override
those outer conditions we can be feel
terrible in a little paradise and we can
feel still very strong and joyful and
wish to worry about one's life and
contribute to the happiness of others
even in the face of adversity and so as
the Dalai Lama once gave this striking
example if you move in the you know very
luxurious flat at the hundred flow of a
hi-tech skyscraper for the first time
you just bought it and then you are
totally ruined within destroy in your in
your heart and your mind all you are
going to look for is a window from which
to jump and the other hand you could
have this great joy to be alive and
empathy whatever all those human
qualities even you know when other
conditions doesn't seem nice at all
but because your state of mind is
stronger and that's a such fortunate
situation because imagine that to find
happiness the world will have to be the
image of your desire your fancies that
universe will be a vast catalog in which
you could order all the ingredients for
happiness forget it it's never going to
happen like that there should be six
billion catalogs and everyone will
choose different items and they will
never work so but no this is not just a
it seems obvious but great thinkers
thought otherwise Immanuel Kant wrote
that complete happiness will be the
complete fulfillment of all our desires
in quantity quality and duration no just
the whole idea of happiness goes to the
drain is this would never happen never
how can that be
and anyway impermanence is there even
you had for a fashion of a second
everything to be happy then one piece
was going to be missing the next day
so again collapse doesn't work and we
know in real life
I remember once going to Tahiti with the
younger BOTS of my mana
was a first - booty smokin tight it was
big news so in the day right now okay no
so in the evening news there was two big
items they found a snake in the forest
there's no snake entitiy and second I
tend to Buddhist monk arrived in Tahiti
so the next day we were this wonderful
like postcard looking sunset in Paul
Gauguin's house and why he was not there
but very beautifully lit swimming pool
and sitting there and then looking at
each other and say no that's for the
owner of that it's supposed to make us
happy
this seems to be no relation and then if
that makes us happy then what if we
double the size of the swimming pool we
twice as much happy so of course no no
no relation it's the way you interpret
things and we are the confirmation of
that about the way of interpreting the
world the next morning because notitie
looks great on postcards but it's pretty
hot and damn wet when you are there so
we were sitting on a beautiful tree and
they was imagine there was this kind of
soft sort of mist refreshing mist
falling from the tree I was sitting
there complete bliss thinking what this
is real paradise nor even the trees are
conditioned but then someone came and
said you know those are pissing flies
so our perception of the world changed
right away so now so let's assume that
the inner conditions for well-being are
really what will determine the quality
of everything that goes by and that's
fair assumption but then that's where in
the most better position because that's
our mind the final experience of that at
least we are not going having to modify
the whole world to our taste but we can
change our mind if we change our mind
which is our world that's the world we
experience so that's the ID so for that
we need to identify which conditions in
our mind are leading to a sense of
fulfillment sort of fruition
accomplishment and sense that we if we
look 20 20 years in ahead if we look
back within that somehow that's the best
we could do with our capacities and
which was the right direction something
that's really truly meaningful in our
life so what are those conditions which
will nurture that quality also the
quality of every moment that passes
because after after all life is not just
remembering the past and projecting in
the future that's the quality of the
present moment that's what the day is
made of someone says take care of the
minister ours will take care of
themselves so if all the minutes are
unhappy how could the house and day
somehow be fulfilled so we need that
quality so that has to do with states of
mind and then the our states of mind
which are totally detrimental to the
quality of of that life like a tree tree
sentiment grudge nagging jealousy
obsessive desire sort of arrogance all
those odd just makes you feel miserable
and of course they also induce you to
act and speak in ways that also cause
suffering around you so it's a lose-lose
situation that comes - very
self-centered no excessive accessor
better feeling of self-importance
bringing everything to oneself and
trying to build up a so-called selfish
happiness
sometime at the detriment of others
well-being that's absolutely not going
to work if if a selfish happiness is the
goal of your life then that life is soon
going to be without any goal because
that simply cannot work the reason it
cannot work that excessive proliferation
with oneself is a constant sort of
torment and feeling being vulnerable to
everything criticism
praise and failure and success all those
will take disproportionate sort of
importance will be like a storm in a
glass of water and that each of those
will be like small balls bouncing in
that small tiny bubble of the of the ego
and then hurting you every time so we
need to get that explode that that
self-centeredness bubble and let those
bullets
let's loss in the vast space of
open-minded and so that we not just
simply obsessed with this what's going
to happen to me how do I feel and all
this thing that is just a way of buying
trouble for ourselves so now there are
other type of emotions and mental state
which definitely we feel as something
that is nourishing the sense of
well-being like say loving kindness and
conditional love wanting to an act of
generosity with no strings attached
chance to me a wish of bringing some
happiness or relief some suffering to
others and some sense of inner peace in
the strain is in your kind of
contentment
so all those together makes it a way of
being and that's what genuine happiness
is is not just pleasant feelings and
trying to accumulate them endlessly
because pleasant feelings are so much
fleeting even you try to renew them they
depend upon circumstances upon time they
change in nature from one moment to the
other something that's very pleasant you
know like a chocolate cake one serving
is great too
see you become nosiest to the same thing
as change of nature the most beautiful
music you can dream of you might if
you're really hooked on to it listen
three four times at a row but imagine 24
hours non-stop what a fatigue you
doesn't work and also it is something
that somehow is so centered upon oneself
you can experience intense sensation of
pleasure everyone is suffering it's not
something that is inspiring necessarily
and it's so vulnerable to change now
where the happiness as a way of being as
a optimal sort of way of the mind to be
will remain throughout the ups and down
throughout the different emotional
states and give you the resources to
deal with whatever comes so rather than
being dependent on the filtrating
changes of ups and downs of life that's
what gives you the resources to deal
with those changing conditions it's like
the depth of the ocean is always there
compared to the change of the surface
whether it's sometimes storm sometimes
beautiful weather but if you don't what
have the depth then you are in the midst
of that's weather change of the surface
with nothing to refer to so it is a way
of being and as a manner of but manners
need to be learned it's not graded yet
we it is true that we small s born with
the kind of traits there are more or
less happy and extrovert kids or kids
which are a little bit more violent and
some others are very sweet and will give
their toys to others so we have traits
but no those are just blueprints this is
not the time to elaborate on that but
epigenesis means that even you have this
set of genes at any time they is
something that could regulate the
expression the wonderful study is now
done showing that almost any kind of
gene that determines traits can be
modified by the environment
receiving and giving love and tenderness
the gin can be for stress for instance
can be blocked for life if there's a
strong component of tenderness is very
early in life and so those are just sort
of potential that we are more or less
sort of gifted in the beginning but sort
of the hard work and the interaction can
change that so there's there is this
flexibility in everything in the genes
in the way we experience the world so
there is margin to to change and not
only that but by which kind of mystery
our mind at the way we experience things
would just change to us happiness just
because we wish to be happy everything
else in life we need to learn we need to
when we born this and an unidentified
flying object cannot speak and not walk
the can do nothing we'll die in few days
if the mother wasn't there - with great
love and care to make it me that that
newborn baby be alive and learn and
learn experience of life and so and so
forth and then everything in our life
like going to school learning a
profession and building human
relationship all that comes with with
learning with like emotional skills on a
sort of learned by experience so how
come that the most fundamental thing
that determines the quality of our life
we just come just like that so we need
we have to understand that that we
usually underestimate the power
transformation of mine we think that
this is just life we are like that this
is the human nature to be this mixture
of light of shadows quality and defect
and actually does desirable it will be
terribly boring not to have jealousy or
strong passion events that tear us apart
you know that's exciting and good wrote
that three days of uninterrupted
happiness will be so boring it's always
the same my suffering is so vibrant you
always changes
so exciting but you know is it true - I
was just saying that to justify the fact
that we are not quite sure how to change
that and then we try to make a
philosophy to fit with that state of
affairs because in truth you know when
you are sitting maybe in the beautiful
garden or somewhere by lake and with
someone you love or just like enjoying
the beauty of nature and filling in
harmony with the world with others with
yourself we lessen your conflict working
and just know not the Stars or something
like that and feel really at peace are
you going to regret the tense atmosphere
of the emergency room of a hospital or
something or if I come now when you're
sitting peacefully and said please get
angry right now so why should I you know
I'm fine
or would you like to spend a whole
afternoon being terribly jealous you say
no - doesn't sound such a nice prospect
but if I say well would you like to
spend the next 2-3 hours you know having
compassion or loving kindness as the
main sort of state of mind present in
yourself you say well that seems pretty
neat you know for you that we feel
instinctively that even though we can't
escape for the time being those kind of
different kinds of mental toxins that
will rather be well off without them but
now is it possible to change that
because we might say it's all deeply
intrinsic to human nature that we can do
anything so yes in a way it is in human
nature and it says we all have those
positive and negative emotions so in
that sense it is part of human nature
but to be part of something they're
different ways of being part of
something you could be part of something
of like the whiteness of the screen
that's all over the texture of the
screen and to remove that you have to
destroy the screen but this is also
somehow part of the screen is there on
the screen but it doesn't penetrate the
screen doesn't belong to the string
doesn't remain to the screen and the
screen allows it to appear yet it is not
modify as such but it allows it to
appear so that's the key so in order for
all the mental states a mental construct
to arise in your mind whether positive
emotions or negative ones
no matter
there has to be some kind of basic
screen or like the light if I show a
torch light to shine on you the light
can show or in the garden beautiful
flowers or maybe a pile of garbage so
you might say this is beautiful this is
ugly the light allows you to see that
but the light doesn't become beautiful
or ugly the light is what makes that
perceptible visible likewise at the
fundamental aspect of cognition of the
mind we call that the bare consciousness
or the the disorder of a pure awareness
it is the kind of basic cognitive factor
and I think meditators can
introspectively sort of experience that
behind the screen of thoughts this kind
of pure aware presence because that the
luminous aspect of my of mine in
Buddhist term lumen is not that it glows
in the dark or like the those Google
things shooting from the earth but that
it is luminous compared to a dark object
like this tool wears no cognitive
quality whatsoever so it is luminous and
since its cognate II is cognizant so now
that is not tainted by hatred jealousy
and so forth allows that to occur but is
it cannot be if hatred was so
interestingly part then it word should
shine on everything like if the light
was beautiful in itself everything will
be beautiful when you shine the light on
something or ugly whatever so that's not
the case so that gives margined because
those mental construct are result of
causes and conditions so it gives you
can modify those constant condition and
that's the principle of mind training
and that's what meditation is about
meditation has many meanings but the
root the actual literal meaning is me in
sanskrit Bhuvana means to cultivate and
it's in tibetan gone means to be
familiar with something to become
familiar with a new way of being with
new qualities with them a perception of
the world that is more attuned with
reality not seeing the world as solid
autonomous permanent objects but as a
dynamic sort of
independent of ceaselessly changing
causing condition even ask consciousness
is a stream a dynamic stream constantly
changing and so if we it also to develop
qualities like compassion and
loving-kindness so meditation is really
to cultivate something it can be to
cultivate in a con to begin with like
leather through mindful breathing to let
the taught subside little bit and
through not being caught in that
constant we Apple then from that state
we can develop those qualities like
compassion and loving-kindness so it is
something that need to be trained and
everything has to be learned otherwise
this spoiled brat of our mind is going
to continue to run over the place and
then this know we have this mixture of
custom joy and Thomas so we can do much
better we said just normal but normal
state is just a pandemic is we are all
so much like that that we think it's
normal but optimal is something else and
we this is possible so we can use all
kinds of methods techniques that's what
the sort of the methodology or the
science the contemplative science is
about using antidotes for instance
antidote means there are things
one-to-one that are mutually exclusive
you cannot in the same gesture stretch
your hand friendly way and give a blow
you cannot in the same moment of thought
want to harm someone and want to do good
please very simple but if you think of
that the more you'll bring say
altruistic thoughts thought of
benevolence in your mind the less at
those moment there will be space for
malevolence harmful thoughts and so
forth so if you can imagine that yes we
do feel moments of love and moments of
resentment but we don't activate them we
don't try to generate loving-kindness
and just keep it flowing in our mind and
remaining it and feeding it and sort of
maintain preserving it for like 5-10
minutes it's not something we do but
that's what we need to do if you want to
become that more part of our mind if we
want to change our minute-to-minute
emotions and moods and then finally
traits
that's how we learn you don't learn
skiing by doing it 15 seconds every week
you have to do it a certain
time it won't happen without a minimum
of sort of dedication and to dedicate
oneself to something and find the time
for it we need to see the advantages of
doing so and in case of changing one's
mind
advantages are quite obvious there are
many other ways but just to give you a
quick example of fine sense anger and by
hangar here I mean a malevolent anger
not indignation in the face of injustice
or or Massacre or something but the
anger that really has a component of
wishing to harm and also when we are in
invaded by these we are one with anger
we cannot see anything else we see the
other personal object of our anger as
hundred percent despite able we can see
an equality in that person and we
completely associate with this anger
even though a few a few hours later we
might say no I was out of myself I was
no more myself we know that something
that was quite it's like having the flu
no you are not the flu but fluke sort of
grips you but then we could do something
else instead of being obsessed by the
trigger we could look try to dissociate
and look at anger gaze at it the raw
sensation and feeling and emotion of
anger not deep the the causes and
circumstances that that creates it
because that's the fuel that's the word
that you have constantly on the fire but
look at the fire itself forget about the
wood if you do so the fire cannot
maintain its us very long and you cannot
sustain itself on its own it's just
bound to vanish it melts away like the
morning Frost and other rising sun and
that's a very skillful way of dealing
because it avoids two extremes that do
not work one is venting anger that
people say you should break channels and
all these kind of things to feel better
when you are angry it doesn't work it
makes you more and more angry you get
angry easily and more often or keeping
it as a time bomb somewhere in the back
of your mind and then again it doesn't
work so now here you have for the time
being solve the problem you deal with it
it vanished away there's no trace for
the time being it
might come back when you start again so
instead of venting it or keeping it
which will reinforce the tendency for
hunger here each time you deal with it
with this very powerful intelligence of
dialog with the emotions you're actually
awarding in the tendency and at some
point will be less likely to become
angry it will be more difficult to make
you angry and you can imagine some time
where at least hatred the wish to
willingly harm terribly someone else
could be completely gone from your mind
and that would be could be a result of
my training definitely we can enhance
our compassion and so forth so it is
something as highly desirable in our
life it's not just a luxury it's not
just a supplementary sort of diet of
vitamin of the soul it's something
that's really at the heart of every
moment that we go back it's something
that also with time we can see in
ourselves that it really brings some
change and it really brings some more
openness so that we have a more
fulfilled life and we can put it at the
service of others instead of the
lose-lose situation of the seeking the
selfish happiness and this considering
others where we feel miserable we make
other miserable here we have a win-win
situation loving-kindness and compassion
are among the most positive of all
positive emotion and that's we are going
to show you just now and also of course
others will perceive it in a positive
way so I just want to show you very
briefly since we speak of changing
changing your mind changing your brain
some since some years now
we have been collaborating with
neuroscientist this is an endeavor that
s was started by the Dalai Lama inspired
by him into studying the influence on
the brain of a sustained mind training
and the idea was people who have
thoughts for instance a concert
violinist has done at least 10,000 hours
of violin and there is some areas in the
brain which have
the area that this with the fingers with
the motor coordination and all kinds of
things it has fastly increase in
activity even in size so what happens
not if you lunge the piano but if you
learn compassion if you train in
vigilance in attention would that change
the brain too if that does it means that
meditation is not just breathing out for
a few moments and the mango tree and try
to empty your mind unsuccessfully but it
is really a deep change that comes to
mind training so that was a very
interesting sort of approach so we
needed to start with experienced
meditators because know if there's a
noticeable difference in them then we
can notice in oh how do they you which
there and start with novices if there
was no difference in those experts then
not expect to find one after one week so
here's the place where they come from
and where is almost as nice in the
google campus but but it's still easier
to meditate there than on in the subway
but we can soon have a google campus in
tibet or somewhere and i'm so men will
be very happy to to be a star one on top
of Everest without oxygen and so those
are the beautiful places where they come
from and when this was in eastern Tibet
August first the hottest day of the year
and the night before we were camping and
with tibetan friends and we have a quite
large tent and it was snowing at the
skanda side they say we are going to
sleep outside
I said why we have a big tent so yes
it's summertime so they sleep outside in
the morning there was 10 centimeters
snow on their on their clothes so this
is what I'm fortunate to see from the
window of my small Hermitage in the
Himalayas so I can't complain and this
is a example of what is spiritual
teachers here you can see that it's some
kind of beyond word a kind of human
quality that we sort of can't miss and
in reality it was certainly is very
strong it's almost like human goodness
becoming palpable
that's what Paul Ekman I think you are
going to receive soon one of the world's
passage of emotions that's how we
describe you know an encounter with the
Dalai Lama
there's something that you almost
physically not there well not of this we
advise but something that's so sort of
natural and simple and yet something
that you can really feel the kind of
strength mixed with goodness and the
sort of solidity but at the same time
sensitivity I mean it's very hard to
describe but it's really what makes it
extraordinary good human being and this
cat is certainly one of the fortunate
ones who's and it's my first teacher
conversion Bechet and and then yes this
is a hermit who comes out of six years
of meditation in the Hermitage so the
question is it is so happy because
finally is coming out or because or
because it did six years of meditation
and knowing him well I would favor the
second hypothesis at his something that
he acquired through his training for not
in Madison Wisconsin now the meditators
have 256 electrodes and there are two
ways of measuring brain activities one
is two electrons a photogram that is a
very good time resolution thousandth of
a second change can be recorded on the
scalp but not so clear exactly where it
happens in the brain so we have to
combine that with fMRI which is magnetic
resonance scanner which is a very good
three dimensional analysis of where
things happening in the brain is drain
imaging but not so good in time wises
the resolution is one or two seconds so
it's like a camera in the first case
that is very fast shutter speed but not
so well focused second case is very well
focused but slow shutter speed but if
you combine both you get both spatial
and time temporal resolution so that's
coming out of two and a fourth in the
scanner so the huge relief from that
mini retreat and this is
this is Richard Davidson the lead
scientist in in Madison Wisconsin
although there are other labs you know
doing this study in Princeton and
Harvard and Berkeley not so far from
here and more and more interest so the
many state that you can study because
meditation is very varied so that you
can study focused attention mental
imagery or visualization you can study
compassion and that's one of the one we
have studied most and each of these as a
different brain signature so compassion
here is a I mean I'll spare you all the
reading that but is the unconditional
feeling of love that begins with an
object but then becomes more and more
universal to all sentient beings and
it's very powerful and strong feeling of
loving kindness so this is the first
paper we publish in the PNAS and another
the actual first results so now what we
need is to compare things we need to
compare a meditator at rest and in
meditation worsen it compared meditators
with control group those who are novice
in meditation and see if there's a
difference so we give the instructions
up to them same instruction that
meat-eaters used for many years and ask
them to do it for a week and come back
to the lab and then in the lab what we
do is a minute of rest same unit of
intense getting in the state of
compassion or focused attention whatever
the subject is and then doing that again
and again 30 40 times are in out in out
and measuring changes with that with the
experimental eaters with with the
controls in case of the control the
Green Line is the resting state the blue
line is also the meditation state they
try they feel something but it's not
strong enough to elicit a strong
response in the brain here you see with
the meditators that the rest line is the
same but now when they engage in
compassion meditation is a huge increase
twelve hundred percent of the brainwaves
particularly in the gamma range which is
connected with the connections in the
brain and so forth and it does happen
also interestingly enough mostly in area
of the brain which the left prefrontal
cortex which has to do with positive
emotions so compassionate
is among the most powerful positive
emotion and just to give you an idea
this is a huge increase
maybe there's something big happening in
the brain if you are about to be run
over by an elephant but to go from a
resting state and in 50 seconds
voluntarily bring a powerful mental
state that's never been recorded like
that in neuroscience so even the
everyone starting to doubt is it an
artifact or something so it took almost
a year to make sure that this was really
the result of meditation and not just
something else this is just different
way of showing or displaying the same
result another way here are the controls
here the meditators it's very very
different and we also did real-time
monitoring when the compassion
meditation sort of takes off increases
then the minute later we'll just have a
small keyboard and with the right and
left arrows he will come up 1 2 3 4 5
then if we prolonged that after some
minutes he might start losing it little
bit so we he will go down he's not going
to look at the numbers but to be
influenced but he is just changing the
keys and then he will come down maybe 4
3 2 and then it brings it back strongly
again so he will go up for this absent
down turns out to be very closely
related to what is actually measuring
the brain is 0.69 correlation if some of
you are statisticians
you know is there's a chance of 1 in a
40 million times that this is just
random or due to chance and this is not
the brain imaging and here.when limit on
compassion the area that is vastly
activated is this left prefrontal cortex
which has to do with positive emotions
joy sets of enthusiasts so compassion is
in itself a most powerful emotion now
interestingly enough - the blue
signifies a decrease of activity and
that area of the right prefrontal cortex
is normally associated with depression
rumination excessive self concern
negative effects so here it's seen that
compassion is almost as an end
not to depression which is of course a
fascinating Avenue of research now and
also this aspiration to relieve
suffering that comes with compassion
strongly reduces the activity in the
amygdala which is known to be connected
with fear and anger
so again compassion reduces that it also
increases activity in Animoto area of
the brain that means compassion comes
with the readiness to act of course for
the benefit of others
so now attention normally if you have to
maintain your attention very sharply you
start losing it out of fatigue there's
the problem of air traffic controllers
for instance and if you have tests where
you task where you see flashing numbers
very fast and each time there's a zero
you have to press a button after five
ten minutes we start making more and
more and more mistakes and your score
goes down which is happening here but
with meditators after 10 minutes there's
no change and now we did that for 60
minutes absolutely no change to errors
in thousand trials and they don't report
to be tired just like a set of flow is
this is precisely what the skill is
about if you do it naturally perfectly
without being tired but you know this
fly in the face of so much assumptions
William James the founder of modern
psychology said that no one can maintain
the attention more than a few seconds on
a given object so that seems to be quite
different here and this new array of the
brains which is activated in the
meditators when they perform those
attention tasks and compared to the
controls that just cannot do it that
much so now what about short-term
training say well it's great for you to
be in the Himalayas for 20 years what
about us you know we can go to the
swimming pool yes this there's a coffee
shop every hundred feet yes that's quite
good but what about meditation which we
saw dear friend is trying to bring to
you as a boon an extra booming in in
Google what if we do 30 minutes a day
for a few months what that's exactly
what was done in a very highly stressed
employees of about the company in
medicine
they volunteer to do 30 minutes a day
for Tet for three months and there was a
control group we said we'll give you the
training after but please come to the
lab every week so then the measurement
were done before and after so this on on
trade off anxiety there's a advantage of
questioners and analyzes that determine
your level of anxiety you can see here
time one the control group and the
meditators or the apprentice meditators
no difference and there was a
significant difference just after three
months now the left I mentioned about
this right and left side activation of
the brain more positive effect on one
side one negative ones as you can see
here at time a two which always says
three here the the meditators I much
will activate on the left on the left
side and surprisingly the control group
was even negatively activity because no
it's kind of boring they have to come to
the lab without doing the meditation so
actually a little bit upset at the end
of those three months but later they
went through the training don't
now the interestingly enough the immune
system also is boosted and significantly
you know to not to miss work they have
to get a compulsory flu shot in November
so that they don't do it they don't they
don't skip coming working so now when
you give a vaccine whether it will work
or not depends upon the strength of your
immune system now in the first Iraq war
a vaccine that normally will take eighty
percent cases because the soldiers were
going to the world was so stressed it
would only take fifty percent so your
level of stress decreases the
effectiveness of the vaccine so here
after those who have gone through these
three months of 30 means in the
meditation the immune response was
boosted twenty percent so that's also
means the same strength also to fight
actually naturally flu and other disease
related to stress and now the strength
level which measure with cortisol in the
saliva and all the meditators is four
times less than in the control group but
that's not with the novice meditators
that's with the people doing long
retreat so there is definitely an effect
in those
preliminary studies even for short-term
I mean not short-term but a short amount
of time every day already in three
months show a significant effect and
then maybe next year my something that
might make a big time sort of news we
are not studying the aging process which
is has to do some of you might know at
the end of the DNA the chromosome they
are freed with whole telomere is a
single branded DNA and it's shortened
with age now it seems the preliminary
result now I will tell you just between
you and me after three months of
intensive meditation that's not 30
minutes a day that's more like in the
meditation sort of workshop for three
months a significant decrease of the
slow of the elimination of the telomeres
oh wow that will be big news isn't it
stay young meditate so now to come back
to the outer condition which I mentioned
the beginning now we often see people
extremely rich extremely powerful on top
of that they might be strong and
beautiful and they visit you here they
have depressed and so forth I see what's
wrong with this guy if I had all that I
will be happy where that's not the case
of course for money which is the one of
the obvious candidate if you are below
the poverty line and can feed your kids
and suffer terrible condition yes to go
above that would make a huge difference
in the quality of your life but now
being Lobby after that behind that then
doubling tripling just doesn't make any
difference here is the GDP in the United
States three times increase from 46 to
96 the gross national happiness
stationary even slight decrease now
marry us buy you happiness here you are
times zero five years later well you
know reset Davidson will give me that
slide said you know I've been married
happy for thirty years
but that's the what has been come out of
the study yet there's another data that
shows it's still better it is happier
reported life for people who are married
or live in companionship rather than
people who are single or separated but
relatively the change of happiness
basically you come back when we were and
now widowhood where you recover to from
it also so external factors only have a
limited effect on our level of happiness
they do have but altogether if you bring
all the social factors that do with
thousands of studies of not seventy
years basically they contribute to
something but only about 15% of your
reported happiness people differ the
emotional disposition effective style
and though this conditions are
relatively stable if you win the lottery
you are completely happy one year later
your models come back to some level they
can be changed that's the point
meditation has demonstrable effects on
the brain and we represent one of the
few ways in which purely mental training
has been demonstrated to have robust
impact on brain function and this image
data and this is the monks accepting
from the lab
so now here you might say well there's a
contradiction here you say that
happiness can be trained and we just
show that you know before after marriage
before I talk widowhood money doesn't
make any difference so then what if it's
that stable was the point of meditating
you're going to make just another of
those small Peaks and come down so
what's the point well remember what I
mentioned the beginning genuine
happiness as the way of being is not the
peaks of joy and Pleasant and then the
laws of depression and so forth
this is the absent down but when you go
up and down you go up and down above and
below a baseline so here mindfulness I
mean the meditation and mind training is
raising the baseline the platform in
which you stand in life the place where
you come back those who work those up
sundown is going to happen maybe you
will be less vulnerable to them met less
carried away by them less affected or
impacted by them so that you maintain
the sense of direction of meaning in
life but you can change that and so
that's it really worth it and Deveaux in
life and also to get the inspiration to
do that we need to identify some kind of
potential that we have within ourselves
we need to someone sit quietly and say
what really matters for me in life what
do I really want to accomplish in life
not just you know feeling questioners
and after you pass some tests and desire
and then putting that in the in the
machine or in the computer or going to a
profession orientation and then okay you
have this disease that is what you are
good for but really feel what deeply you
would like to spend your life so that
twenty years later when you look back
you say no I did my best that's what I
wanted to do
I'm sense of fulfillment of
accomplishment that's otherwise you know
what's the point
even you succeeded in this this that and
you feel not so you know there's some
sense of accomplishment that's not there
such as the fulfillment that was worded
to live in that way that's what we want
so I think it's so important to identify
within yourself
what really matters and then find a way
that's always find a way to accomplish
it so I think this if meditation could
be as a mind training not taking the
exotic aspect or oriental aspect of it
just it could become a genuine
contribution to a more open
compassionate society and also to the
quality of our life so thank you for
your attention
I think that time for some questions
that's anybody have any questions thank
you very much that was fascinating
I'm just curious with the power of
meditation to change some of the the
brain the way the behavior for children
now with Asperger's where there's some
brain dysfunction have you heard about
any research in that well you know all
this is quite preliminary there's been
some what we have form a subgroup on
education in desire no this is
spearheaded by the mind and life
Institute which doesn't do research but
sort of bring together all these people
and we have a strong sort of since last
year with really taking trying to study
education not only from educators and
social but bringing together
psychology's educators social workers
neuroscientist and contemplatives and I
think that's one of the first time that
this happened is at the very good level
of science and contemplation so there
have been obvious ideas of doing with
children which have attention deficit
and you know so this is a really
beginning approach but that's just part
of the what really would like to
contribute more like a secular approach
to those things not just the Buddhist
label it's nothing wrong with the
Buddhist label but it might know looks
too much like a religious approach and
then deprived the tools for actually
serving society in a deeper way so I
have a friend of mine in France who
started that in school you call that
secular training - attention looks very
good and everybody's happy about that so
well I think this is the way to go yes
and so you said is the heart mind
Institute the not the mind and life my
Institute is a website right now thank
you
hi I keep hearing the number 10,000 in
tens of thousands of hours of training
and and it's really cool to see the fMRI
effects of meditation but I'm also
curious there have been advances in
training so that random people who can't
go to the Himalayas for 20 years yes
that's that's exactly why we there's a
simpler biofeedback kind of thing where
where people can recognize yeah the
state made like the monk who is who is
pressing the keys on keyboard yes he
knew what he was feeling we've been
taking our feedback I know when we start
to be hooked on the on the on the on
this electroencephalogram and we can
look and you can start genuine
compassion and you see those gamma
where's going this is this kind of fun
but at the same time you know it's lipid
interfering you suppose I see myself in
my Hermitage try to meet it I don't want
to watch a screen on unburn waves and
this is electrode e 25 I know I'm trying
to make it let's go up I think this is
more like a distraction
but but I think again to the $10,000
argument is that's why we do not
longitudinal studies and and our goal is
if the robust result there was one
groundbreaking paper in PNAS two years
ago not the stream were coming this year
which will really establish that
contemplative neuroscience field may be
better but the real goal is once the has
been robust study with the experiment
data is ready to go to everyone
otherwise there's no it's just a
curiosity but if it really applies and
knowing about the company or certainly
can apply here
i'm wondering so when you're an expert
meditator you have a leverage level of
happiness that is higher than otherwise
what if you stop meditating how long
does it take to go down is it anything
that lasts for long ever or not at all
well you know the idea of stopping
meditating for 20 years to see how
terribly miserable I will become that's
not exactly I mean we need this very
determined volunteers you know the cycle
anymore it's like the kami Cassio of
happiness that becomes like a medicine
that you have to take forever
no no I think you know there are things
like skiing no I haven't skied for 35
years and I could show you a photo last
year it was a joy after two hours to be
able to ski as before so they I think I
think they are there is something that's
so deeply changed that it certainly
remain as that's the point of a way of
being of a baseline it takes time to
acquire it but because of that it has
really strong and firm foundation I'm
really convinced of that and actually
that's the real test we say no it's fine
if the messages are sitting in the Sun
basking in the Sun with full belly no
problem imitation always good but then
confronted with adverse circumstances
that's where he or she is put on the
scales and I think that's where in daily
life you can see and what we need is
flows change now the fireworks of
mystical experiences don't last but it's
like the hum of a clock when you do when
you stare at it it seems not moving but
when you look from time to time it has
changed for those change a slow hence
the need for mind training but because
they are slow they are much more likely
to be stable and that's the ID no the
brain won't degenerate too quickly
hopefully and then your experience also
I think it's something that at some
point there's a kind of sort of a no
return point in this kind of space line
yes
thank you so much for you
