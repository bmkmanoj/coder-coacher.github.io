MICHIEL BACCHIANI: My
name is Michiel Bacchiani,
I am part of the
Google speech team.
So we make that microphone
button on your Android phone
do something.
So more specifically, I am a
senior staff research scientist
here at Google, and I lead
the acoustic modeling group.
That's part of the speech team.
And so I've been doing
speech recognition
research for about 20 years.
I've been at other
places before here.
I worked for about three
years in Japan in the ATR--
the Advanced Telecommunications
Research labs,
which is sort of like
a Bell Labs of Japan.
And I worked at AT&amp;amp;T research
for about five and 1/2 years,
and I had a bit of a
stint at IBM research
in upstate New York for
about a year and a half.
And I've been at Google for
almost exactly eight years.
And speech recognition
is sort of a typical hard
applied science.
So there's a lot of math a
lot of statistical modeling.
And as a result of
it, we like to process
large amounts of
data, and so that
brings about a large
amount of computer science.
And so Google looked like a
very interesting place to work.
So I was intrigued
by this place when
I was offered the opportunity
to do something there.
About eight years
ago, I looked at it,
and it certainly is a
very different culture
from what I was used to.
So when I came from is
the typical research
lab where there are somewhat
of the ivory tower syndrome
where you sit together
with all the other PhDs
and, you know, you're
doing exhaustive research,
and then there's the development
group that's somewhere else,
and we don't really
talk to each other.
And there's a bit
of finger pointing
going back and forth where
the researchers would say,
they never take our new idea.
And the development
group would say
that whatever code we get
from research is such a mess,
we have to all
re-implement this.
And both of those is true, but
it doesn't really work well.
And as a result of
it, you don't really
have an outlet that is
built for your product.
So you would live off
publications, largely,
and that's one way
to get your stuff out
and that would be exciting.
But, so now I'm looking
at this Google place
that is clearly very different.
Actually, one of the
concerns I had for real
is that, are these guys all
sitting on colorful skippy
balls high fiving each other
and saying awesome all day long?
Which is not really
something I enjoy,
because I did enjoy the hard
science of what I was doing.
Also in retrospect, what I think
is very different from Google
to do other places, I think,
is sort of the three aspects,
I think.
There's a people
component to it,
which is we are
extremely collaborative
between engineering
and research.
In fact, we make
hardly any distinction,
where it's hard to distinguish
whether somebody is a software
engineer or a researcher.
And it's just because, if you
want to get your stuff out,
it has to be engineered.
And if you're an engineer
and you engineer something,
you might run into
a problem and you
have to research on how
to solve that correctly.
And so that's a nice environment
where people are collaborative
and there's no hang ups
about what department
you're in or what
your title is exactly.
and you really jointly
get something out.
I think the second aspect
of it is a product.
Your stuff really gets
used by a lot of people.
There's a real path
to get whatever
you code to get in
the hands of people,
and actually, people use it.
And not only is it
sort of a satisfaction
that somebody will
use your code.
There's some interesting stuff
that it brings up for research.
I mean, it gives you signals to
look at on how people are using
things, whether it's
working for them or not.
And you can really
focus on a user
and sort of make
their experience
better, which is an interesting
research setting in itself.
Sort of, how do you make
use of those signals
to improve your product?
And the third thing is sort
of impact, because you know,
you really can improve
people's lives.
We did some, you know, I
work in the speech teams.
Working with some deaf
people and giving them
opportunities they never
had before is exciting.
You really, I think, have
a more profound impact
on somebody's life.
And I think a lot
of Googlers have
this mean altruistic
streak where they really
like the fact that
their stuff can
do something good for somebody.
And that brings a lot
of excitement about.
So that might sound
a little naive,
and naive can be bad, because
I have colleagues that
look like they're 13-year olds.
And I know they're not, but
they look like that to me.
And they think that the normal
world is whatever our Google
environment is, and even if
you tell them that's not true,
you can't really convince them.
And we have this
rich food culture,
as you might have noticed.
I literally heard a complaint
to somebody that said,
do they have to really put
truffle oil and everything?
There's somewhat of a
bubble here, that's true.
But in general, I think it's
a pretty happy place to work.
So more specifically
to speech, I
think that it is really this
kind of company in this mindset
that it's not surprising
that it took speech, I think,
from when I joined eight years
ago from sort of user torture.
You know, where it's like,
say or press one for sales,
or say or press
two for, you know.
To now, we're sitting at
home and looking at an ad,
and people are like,
I like this cellphone
because it has
voice recognition,
as a feature that
they actually want.
So again, sort of this
user focus, I think,
is a positive thing.
And I think, in more general,
it's not just the speech thing
where it's been lucky that
they had some success.
Information retrieval, Google
search has been applied
and really is useful to people,
I think machine translation,
I think there are many,
many more areas to come.
So don't just take it from me.
I think we have a
very interesting panel
with various other people
in various other areas
that you can quiz and
we can discuss things.
Some.
Of the things I think that
we will talk about a little
before we go in
our Q&amp;amp;A session is
to discuss this whole
collaboration, which I think
is contrasting some of our
relationships internally,
as well as with the
research community outside.
So let's start with
introductions, I guess,
of the panel.
So how about we go
from left to right.
So I'll let you guys do it.
UMESH SHANKAR: My
name's Umesh Shankar.
I've been at Google for about
seven years, previous to which
I did my Ph.D. at UC Berkeley.
I entered Berkeley
as a systems student
and fairly quickly
ended up focusing
on security and
privacy, which is
what I still do here at Google.
I'm a software engineer.
I lead the data protection
engineering group,
so we spend pretty
much all our days
figuring out how to
make sure that all
the private information that
Google stores stays that way.
And as far as I'm
concerned, Google
is really the most
interesting place
to work on security and
privacy, because we don't really
have that many
theoretical attacks.
Most of the stuff that most
people think of as theoretical
is real.
And there's really
no playbook for how
to do data protection
at the scale
that we want to do it at with
the performance and usability
requirements that we have.
I mean, it's just been an
incredible learning experience
for me here.
And to a degree that I never
really thought I would,
I've used almost everything
I learned in graduate school.

EUGENE WEINSTEIN: Hi,
I'm Eugene Weinstein,
and I think I'm one of the
13-year-old looking people that
Michiel was--
MICHIEL BACCHIANI: You wish.
EUGENE WEINSTEIN: Well, I
don't know, you might disagree,
but in the sense that I've
never really worked-- well,
some small internships
aside, I've
never really worked at another
company other than Google.
So I was lucky enough
to be able to do
kind of the applied part of
my Ph.D. Here as an intern
while I was a Ph.D.
Student at NYU,
and I joined here full time
about 3 and 1/2 years ago,
and I work on
speech with Michiel.
So I work a lot on the
internationalization side
of speech.
So at Google,
internationalization
is a big thing.
We can't just get away
with making our products
work in English anymore.

But for speech, this is
like a whole new ball game.
Because it's not just, like,
translating some strings,
right?
We have to model new
languages, right?
So this is a difficult thing.
So I kind of enjoyed being
able to scale things up
in that respect.
Now, voice search
supports 40 languages,
we just launched four new
ones a couple of weeks ago.
So that's been so that's
been really fun to work on.
And the other scale
issue that I've
gotten to work on that
I think has been really
meaningful to me is
the work that I've
done with keeping
speech models fresh.
The things that people
are talking about
and the ways in which they
say them are changing, right?
As demographics
change, things come
into and out of
popularity, and people
change the way they search
for things with their voice.
And we have to take the
petabytes of data that's
coming in from users
of our products
and we have to make
sure that we're
servicing the user
in a way that's
still current and relevant.
And so to me, it's been
really fun to take the, let's
say, theoretical things that
I learned about in grad school
and apply them at
this ridiculous scale
that I could never even
conceive before I came here.
So it's been really fun.
OKSANA YAKHNENKO:
Can you hear me?
I can't hear myself.
So, my name is Oksana Yakhnenko.
I've been at Google for a
little bit over two years.
I joined in like December, 2010.
I have my Ph.D. In
computer science
and I was mostly working
on machine learning
and applications
to various things
like text classification,
computational biology,
and computer vision.
And then I've been
[INAUDIBLE] in computer vision
for about a year and a half.
And one of the reasons, when
I got on the job market,
I was a little bit disillusioned
with academia, in terms of,
I publish a paper and you spend
so much time writing this paper
and you so much
work in the paper.
And then you have like four
citations and that's kind
of the end of it.
I mean, sometimes you
have more than that,
but I actually felt like
my work was affecting
a very small niche of people.
So basically, I started
looking for a place where
I could actually do
some more impact.
And now I have joined
a group in Knowledge,
so we work in search.
And specifically, my
group, we don't really
do anything that you
guys see directly,
but we work sort of
behind the scenes,
and we work on
information extraction.
So there's this effort
called Knowledge Graph,
and this is basically the
graph of related entities
that Knowledge
Panels uses to answer
the questions and
the queries that you
guys type in the search engine.
And basically, our project
is to automatically populate
this graph with a lot
of unknown entities
and unknown relationships.

So things that we do, we do
a lot of experimentations
with like, hey, here
I have this model.

How good is this model?
Not only on paper,
that like, this model
is going to give me 95%
accuracy, which is like, OK,
cool.
But like, how many users is
it going to impact, right?
And it's like, even if my model
says that it's 95% accurate,
do I know that
it's 95% accurate?
Because not everything that's
on the web is true, right?
So that was basically some of
the more challenging things
that I've been
working on, things
that I enjoyed doing here.

GIDEON MANN: Thank you.
And thank you, Michiel.
I don't think I've heard such
an eloquent description of what
it's like to work at Google.
And I think I would echo
a lot of the same things.
Especially, Michiel talked
about a mean altruistic streak.
So I think that, if I
have an affliction, or one
of the afflictions I
might have would be that,
and so I've always been looking
for opportunities at Google
to use the work that I've done
to have some kind of a broader
impact.
And one of the nice
things about this place
is that you have a
platform to do that,
and the opportunity to do that,
and the support to do that.
So in particular, I have
worked on machine learning.
My background's in natural
language processing,
but I'm moving a little bit
more into machine learning.
And in particular,
I've been looking
at how to make machine learning
something that everybody can
use, and something
that is easy to use,
and something that you can
drop into your web service,
and something that you
can training easily.
And so, it's been
really exciting
to pursue that here, because
there's so many opportunities
to get feedback on whether
you're doing the right thing
and going in the
right direction.
So I'll cut myself off
there and turn it over,
but I'd love to talk about
that more with you guys.

OMAR BENJELLOUN: So my
name is Omar Benjelloun.

Can you hear me?

So yes, I've been at Google
for about seven years.
Before that, I did
a Ph.D. In databases
and I spent two years
doing up [INAUDIBLE]
also, working on databases
and uncertain databases
and reference
reconciliation problems.
And I also joined Google
for similar reasons
to what was discussed
earlier, like having an impact
and doing things that
are really useful to more
than the community of
researchers that would maybe
read my papers.
So at Google, I've
been also working
on projects related
to structured data.
And so, I just want to mention
two projects that I worked on.
One is about, so
I lead a project
about public data
and statistics.
And the goal of
that project was to
and continues to be
to get official data
about, important statistics
about, the world, countries.
Your city gets
that official data
directly from the sources
of the data, which
are international or
national organizations,
or local organizations.
There are lots of reconciliation
data integration problems
to solve in order to do
that, and provide also means
for any provider to
give the data themselves
and using an easy to
understand format.
And then reconsolidate
all that data in a place
where we can make it useful
to users through visual tools
to explore the data.
Visualizations,
ways to drill down,
compare, and so on in a tool
called Public Data Explore.
And more recently, we've been
surfacing that data directly
in Google search.
There's a statistics
feature that we just
launched about three
months ago where you can,
if you search for a
population of India,
you'll see graph
that's interactive,
and you can move your mouse
and see the value over time.
But we also try to give
you context by figuring out
what are the most relevant
other countries to compare
this data to in order to help
you understand the content
and help you explore.
And currently, I'm working on
another project in parallel,
which is about, again,
structured data,
but figuring out
what is important,
how to rank the information
that we show you.
So if you search
for, say, Brad Pitt,
we show you a knowledge
panel about this actor,
and we'll select a few facts
that are important about him.
So how to select the
right set of information
and rank that information
is this different problem
than search ranking, because
it's the structured data world.
It's a very sort of both
research-y and challenging
problem, but it has
direct applications
and direct impact on our users.
And so, that's what I find
exciting about our work.
MICHIEL BACCHIANI: All right,
so you have some idea, I think,
who is on our panel.
So I would like to bring
up some of the topics
that I brought up,
and you can chime in
whether you think this
is appropriate or not.
One of the things is always
the perpetual question
about researcher versus
engineering, and how it's
organized, and why they can
never get a straight answer out
of any of us, whether
they're a software
engineer or a researcher.
So anybody wants to
chime in on that?

GIDEON MANN: I'll take the bait.
So if you can't get
a straight answer,
I think that's almost by design.
I think that at the
company, there are really
a tremendous number
PhDs, and the PhDs
are in every part
of the organization.

I took a training
today from someone
who had a psychology PhD.
And she was in the
people [INAUDIBLE].
And I was surprised, though I
probably shouldn't have been.
Because that's really the
nature of this organization.
It's an amazing place in terms
of the level of education
and intelligent [INAUDIBLE]
and everybody here.
So as far as the distinction
between these different roles,
I don't think there is much,
except it's more determined
by your local contacts,
who your local manager is,
and your local group is.
Alfred is one of
the people that's
been thinking about
research a lot at Google.
Likes to talk
about that research
being done opportunistically.
[INAUDIBLE]
I think that that's
probably about right.

MICHIEL BACCHIANI:
I think you want
to use the microphone
so that we can hear you.
when
OKSANA YAKHNENKO: So we have to
do annual reviews for yourself
and each other in the company.
So do the publications come into
play for research scientists
when you guys do your work?

MICHIEL BACCHIANI: It's an
important issue, I guess.

OKSANA YAKHNENKO:
Take the blue pill.
OK.
So when you do your
performance evaluation,
do the publications-- how
much publications actually
weight for research scientist?
GIDEON MANN: So this is,
again, my biased assessment,
but I think Google as a company,
really judges you on impact.
And impact is a lot
of different things.
Publications, launches,
standards, talks,
contacts that you develop.
So I think that
it really, again,
is you want to self
define your impact
and how much, according to
the way that you've defined
your impact, you've achieved it.

Eugene, you feel like you
want to add something?

EUGENE WEINSTEIN:
I definitely see it
as, let's say you come
to Google and you just
do engineering projects, right?
And don't write any
papers and don't
work on what people
outside would
view as quote unquote
&quot;research,&quot; right?
That's OK.

It's an engineering
organization, right?
But let's say you
come here and you
expect that you'll be able
to just, like, work on papers
and do theoretical
stuff and not take part
in contributing to any products,
like some of these more
traditional research
organizations
that Michiel alluded to,
that's not really OK.
So I think that
it can definitely
be a boost for researchers when
it comes to performance, when
it comes to evaluating
your impact.
But that can't be the
totality of the contribution
that you bring to the company.

MICHIEL BACCHIANI: So can any of
you sort of comment on projects
that you're doing
which you think
are essential to have this
integration between engineering
and research?
That you don't
think could ever get
done in the sort of
traditional model, where
it's completely distinct
silos doing either research
or engineering?
Or where it would be
a much longer process
or much more involved
to actually get that
off the ground?
You all work in
different areas, so I
guess there should be a
wealth of examples of things
you get out there
that you think are
good examples of mixing the two.

UMESH SHANKAR:
This those kind of
works if you hold it really,
really close to your face.
OK.
Cool.
So maybe my group
isn't the best example
of this sort of
inextricable link,
but we're definitely
forced to confront
kind of the edges of standard
practice very, very often.
So in cryptography, one of sort
of the first things that you
learn is, don't make
up our own, right?
It's like very, very hard to
get right and wherever possible,
you should use a standard thing.
But once in awhile, we
come across situations
where the standard
thing doesn't quite
have the properties
that we need, and it's
times like that I'm really,
really glad that we have
absolutely world class
cryptographers who
work at Google,
that we talked to
and say, OK, what
are our options here?
And sometimes, they'll
actually come up
with something different.
In other cases they'll
say, well, there's
this new encryption mode
that's sort of experimental.
And we believe it has these
very specific weaknesses
and it either is or
isn't appropriate
to the particular thing
that you're doing.
Absent that expertise,
I just don't
see how we could possibly make
a good decision of what to do.
Conversely, because
you're confronted
with such big challenges,
and because the culture
of the company is one that
really encourages people
to take big bets,
that already tends
to blur the line between
research and engineering.
Because I think a
lot of people's mind,
engineering is something where,
it's sort of really clear
what you have to do and
you just kind of do it
on a quarter by quarter basis.
And research is this
thing where you really
don't know what you
are supposed to do,
and you get a really
long time to do it.
In reality, I don't think
either of those is really true.
I certainly know as
a graduate student,
like, I had to publish
stuff every year
to kind of keep my name out
there and do a good job, right?
and I think for new faculty,
it's probably much, much worse
before they have tenure.
Conversely, here, as
I was saying before,
there really isn't a playbook.
It's very rare that
we know in advance
what is the right thing to do.
And a big part of the challenge
is figuring out that thing,
trying really bold
and innovative things,
and finding out what
the right thing is.
Whether it's published
at the end or not,
I mean, that sounds like
research to me, right?
The difference as I was
saying to some folks
earlier is that it has to work.
You don't get to make
assumptions that aren't true.
That's a really good
forcing function, right?
And then I certainly know
that in my previous time
in academia, like, yeah.
A lot of people would publish
stuff and at a conference,
someone would ask a question
like, but is that really true?
And really, the
person brushes it off,
and that's kind of
the end of it, right?
And the difference
is that here, you
can't do that, because
it has to work.
And I think that constraint
of it having to work
is incredibly positive
for innovation.
It forces you to kind
of stop doing things
that don't work and
try new avenues,
and I think the
end result is much,
much better as a result of it.
And I think you're
saying also about how
you want your impact to be real.
And the net result is, that's
what everyone wants here.
We want to make a
real difference,
and that's part of
that same function.
I personally find it extremely
satisfied to do that.
OMAR BENJELLOUN: Just
one last comment.
I think one difference that
I see between doing research
or just innovative work at
Google versus in academia
is that the constraints that
we have here are the real ones.
They're the real, most
challenging constraints that,
if we solve them, then
we have the potential
to have an impact on-- to
solve the problem for real.
And I find that in
academia, sometimes,
at least in my
experience, we tend
to solve, sometimes, problems
within constraints that
sometimes can be
artificial, or we
try to define a set
of constraints that
make the problem tractable,
without knowing if these are
the real, most
realistic constraints.
While here, we have users
and they use our services.
And if we don't come up
with something that works,
then it doesn't work.
So it has to work
GIDEON MANN: Here, I'll give
a concrete example of an area.
So, distributed optimization.
When you have a particular
optimization problem
with very many variables,
larger than it's
going to fit on one machine, you
want to solve it very quickly.
It's important to the business.
How do you do that efficiently?
How do you do that
with low loss?
People have been looking at
this problem for decades.
In the early '80s, there
was work out of MIT
for tickets to [INAUDIBLE]
looked at this problem.
But the networks have changed
and the problems have changed.
And so, there are
a lot of people
looking at this
problem or variants.
One of the key parts of
the Google Brain project,
if you read the
paper carefully, is
they had a very
clever implementation
of a large scale
distributed optimizer.

I mean, as Omar and
Umesh have talked about,
you're not forced to
look at this problem,
you're not forced to solve
this problem in every context.
Here, you're really forced to.
You really need both a
theoretical perspective
and applied perspective
to solve it.
And then the end result is
something pretty spectacular.

EUGENE WEINSTEIN:
So, we talked a bit
about how the constraints
are real, right,
of what you have to-- oh sure
we talked a lot about that.

That's an area where
we're constrained,
but I think it's also
worthwhile to bring up
the areas where the constraints,
the-- how shall I say it,
the leeway that we have
seems almost so real,
which is in the
computation infrastructure
that we have access
to hear Google.

Sometimes, you have to solve
a research problem just
to get the thing to
parallelize at the scale
that you're allowed
to run it at.

The fact that we have to
answer to Google's users
introduces the
constraint in that sense
that we can't do stuff
that's wrong, right?
But the situation with
the infrastructure
that we have here at Google,
it makes things that much more,
I think, appealing to a
computer scientist from just
coolness standpoint and from
the standpoint of how much you
can get done.
Sort of like the
amount of leverage
you can sort of
bring to the effort
that you are able to
make as an individual
by using this infrastructure.

OKSANA YAKHNENKO:
So I think this
is to Omar's comment
on constraints.
So in my perspective,
it's almost
like your definition of
research changes a little bit.
So in academia, you have, like,
either a set of known problems
that you're working on, or
you try to make up a problem,
and you want to
convince everybody else
that this is important.
Whereas research here is
finding-- sometimes actually
the problems jump
you immediately.
Because you have an algorithm
that works amazingly well
on paper and it works well
on, like, a million examples,
but then if you try to round
it over the entire web,
it just doesn't work.
So how do you scale it up?
So this is something
that Eugene brought up.
And then there's another way
of looking at it is, like, how
do I find a problem
that I want to solve
that's worth pursuing, right?
And even answering
a question like that
is a research in itself.
So it's like, what
are users want, right?
And if I want to
get from A to B,
what are the
resources that I need?
What are the kinds of people
that I need to talk to?
How do I evaluate the
results that I have?
How do I scale it up?
How do I put it into production?
Things like that.
I think that's a
lot cooler and has
a lot more-- you learn
a lot more, I think,
by actually doing research
that way than just, like, hey,
here's a cool problem.
Let me try to come up with
another kernel for a support
[INAUDIBLE] machine.
MICHIEL BACCHIANI: So
there's been a fair amount,
I think, of academia bashing.
But I think all of us have a
warm and fuzzy feeling when
it comes to academia,
in the sense
that we engage with the
community quite a bit.
And I think in various ways,
we try to be supportive.
So in contrast to
all the telling them
how they do everything
wrong, maybe we
should tell them a bit sort of,
how we are in favor of them,
and try to play nice with them.

UMESH SHANKAR: We love you guys.

No, seriously.
OKSANA YAKHNENKO: Are there
people who are in academia?
Can you raise your hands please?
OK, so we're not
offending anybody.
MICHIEL BACCHIANI:
So I would like
to bring up some other things
we do, in terms of, you know,
we do publish quite a bit.
I think it's encouraged, which
I think is a bit of a misnomer
that we don't care.
I think we do give a
lot of monetary funds
to people that are in academia.
We have a giant program, in
terms of visiting researchers.
I think we try to be
collaborative outside as well
as inside, and maybe
you could share
some of you
experience with that.
GIDEON MANN: So I think,
in addition to everything
Michiel said, one of the
interactions that I personally
have enjoyed most is
the intern program.
Because it's a way
not only of getting
kind of fresh blood
and fresh ideas,
but it's also a way of
strengthening connections
to the academic community.
So friends of mine that
have gone into academia
will send interns my way.
And this is a way
of kind of keeping
those connections strong and
also transmitting knowledge
back and forth.

So I'm thinking of a friend
of mine, Noah Smith, who
works at CMU/LTI,
and he is like super,
super into these advanced
latent variable models
and graphical models,
and it's great, actually,
to have his-- he has
a student here, now.
It's great to have his
student here and get
that learning here.
And then I think
also, it changes
his student's perspective
about how to run experiments
and what experiments
might be like.
To say that, you
know, can simply
run 1,000 iterations or 1,000
different models at once,
and what does that mean
about the search space?
What does that mean about the
techniques that you might try
and you might want
to investigate?
And so, I'm hoping
that it really--
and I'm expecting that it's not
going to be a one way street.
It really is kind
of like an exchange.
I had a student from
another friend of mine
who was working on
systems related problems.
And I think when
he came here, he
saw that the depth
of kinds of things
was very different than the
problems he had looked at.
And so, it was also
a lot of insight
that he could bring back.
And so that kind of relationship
I find especially valuable.
And that intern
program is vast So
among our panel, who has
current interns in their team?

So I think that
gives you a sense.
I don't think that's uncommon.

UMESH SHANKAR:
Just to kind of add
to that, as I was saying before,
and it sounds kind of funny
but its actually also true.
You know, as a proof that
academic research really
is valuable is that
I really did end up
using so much of what
I learned in operating
systems, databases, networking,
of course security and privacy,
all these areas.
The concepts that were
developed in academia, things
that kind of maybe
seem far fetched
at the time, that
only made sense
to use an algorithm at
an extremely large scale.
Well, that time arrive.

We're very grateful that
kind of work had been done.
And I think I
wholeheartedly agree
about the kind of interchange
between a place like Google
and academia.
I mean, we go to conferences.
That's a great example of that,
where, not just Google, right,
but many other companies
in the industry
have people who actively work
on research topics, who publish.
You go to the conferences, you
learn from each other, right?
And in some sense,
the conferences, like,
shows you how many
similarities there
are in the kinds of
problems that people work.

There is also something that,
the flip side of my comment
earlier that the things
you do have to work,
is that it takes time
to keep them working.
And there's a certain
tax that you pay,
often substantial, for that.
And in academia, it
is a little bit freer
of those sorts of
constraints, and there's
something very nice
about that too.
It lets you go in perhaps
more different directions
than you would otherwise.
If I were to draw
another sort of,
like, compare and contrast
between academia and a place
like Google is that I think
Google actually really rewards
taking long term big bets in
maybe a smaller number of areas
as an individual, which can
have a really big payoff.
Of course, the flip side is,
maybe it doesn't work out
and now you're like, man, I just
a couple of years on this thing
and it didn't end up
really working out.
Academia, I think, in general,
it's quite common for people
to work on more different
projects at once,
and kind of, OK, the
idea captures your fancy,
you can kind of start
working on it, even
more so than you could
at a place like Google.
And I think having
both those models out
there probably is a really
good thing, in total, for when
you look at what we,
together, can produce.
MICHIEL BACCHIANI:
Gideon disagrees
GIDEON MANN: You know,
I'm not sure I disagree,
but I don't think I've ever
thought about that way.
It's really interesting.
I think that you're right.
I mean, there's like
a historical baggage
you start to
accumulate of, this is
what the world, meaning
Google, ecosystem looks like,
and that's what you
have to operate in.

I don't think I've ever
thought about it that way.
Interesting
MICHIEL BACCHIANI:
Sometimes with publishing,
this is something that I
think I frequently hear,
is that we are not
allowed to published.
There's, I think a rumor
that I've-- not universally,
but that's something I've
heard frequently that--
or it's discouraged,
or whatever.
And I think it's very
unfair, but again, this
is one person saying it.
But you guys want to
comment on whether you think
this is a fair statement, or
where does this perception
come from, if you had to guess?

OKSANA YAKHNENKO: I think
the perception comes
from that a lot of people who
actually go to Google sort of,
like, disappear for a couple of
years, and they don't publish.
The reason they don't publish,
I think, is actually twofold.
Not enough time and not
enough time to write a paper.
Because you get so interested
in what it is that you're doing
and you become so involved
in actually getting the thing
to work and seeing the
impact of this thing.
Sometimes, you just don't
really care to write it up,
or sometimes you
just don't really
have enough time to write it up.
With that said, when
I joined I still
had a couple of leftover
projects for my grad-work,
for my graduate work.
And I took like two
weeks or three weeks
that I was allowed to
use Google's resources,
and like even like
Google [INAUDIBLE]
actually wrap it up and submit
a publication that got accepted.
They sent me to the conference.
And this was, like,
for the work that I've
done that was still
the ideas that where
the academic ideas
when I was in school.

I'm an engineer, but I've done
a couple of collaborations
with people in research where
it's sort of like a two way
street, like where I tell
them the types of problems
that we're really interested in,
and I simply just don't really
have the time to look
into it and where somebody
from research actually was
like, oh yeah, cool, yeah.
This is like my
area of expertise.
I have an algorithm that could
be well suitable for this.
I can run some
experiments and see
what will come will
come out of this.
And then basically from
something like this,
a paper evolved, and we
actually submitted a paper
to conference.
In terms of submitting a
paper it's like super easy.

This person worked
for Corina Cortez,
and it was basically like
telling Corina about the paper,
and she was like, yep,
cool, you can submit.
Like, this is the
level of approval
that it had to go
through, pretty much.

EUGENE WEINSTEIN: I think
with respect to publishing,
the things that
we're saying here,
you guys don't have to
take our word for it.
Just go to
research.google.com, right,
and you'll see that
there are hundreds
of papers coming out of Google.

These aren't only
people that are
in the research organization.
So I think, for
most people here,
I think it's pretty
much a personal choice
about whether you
care, like Oksana said,
whether you're motivated by
getting your work out there
in front of people
outside of Google,
or whether you want to
focus more internally
about presenting your
work to your colleagues
and getting buy-in from them
and getting collaboration
opportunities there.
It's very much a
personal choice,
but if that's
really your passion,
I would say that the vast
majority of the people
are able to publish,
and publishing
is encouraged by
managers, by VPs.
MICHIEL BACCHIANI:
We have a question.
AUDIENCE: So I wonder, talk
a little bit about the origin
of problems.
Obviously Google has lots
of products that do things,
and clearly problems
that are directly related
to those things are important
and valuable to the company.
Is it possible to have an
idea that maybe doesn't
have such an obvious connection
to something for the company,
and to what extent would you be
able to actually run with that?
A month?
A year?
Two years?
Whatever.
Does that make sense?

EUGENE WEINSTEIN: So I don't
know if you're familiar
with the Chauffeur project,
the self-driving car out
in Mountain View, so that's
one example of something that's
totally not connected to
the mission of the company,
as most people would see it.
So there are things like that.
Like, would I be able to,
right now, go to my manager
and say, can I go and
spend 50% of my time
building a self driving car?
Maybe not.
That's not always
the case, but there
are these things that happen
in that kind of organic way
and that aren't always
directly related
to what your job role is.
MICHIEL BACCHIANI: So it
seems to be the perfect time
to bring up the 20% project,
which isn't quite 50%,
but, you know.
In contrast to what you
said about the freedom
to do off-the-wall
things, I think
there is some provision that
provides a lot of people
to do so.
I think a lot of us, because
we're so ingrained what we do
and like what we do, we
don't really make use of it.
But it's a reality
that exists, I think.
Maybe can you guys
comment on whether you
have people doing 20% things?

OMAR BENJELLOUN: So I
considered as a manager,
I've had many of the
people on my team
who are interested in
doing 20% projects,
and I've always encouraged
them to do that,
especially if it's
something that's
going to help them
learn a new skill
or advance in their career
or establish new connections
or find new, potentially
interesting areas to develop.
And it's generally been a
very positive experience.
Some people do it
for a long time,
some people do it
short period of time,
and then they stop doing it
and then they come back to it.
It varies.
It varies a lot.
One other comment I wanted to
make is, also, in the projects
that we work on, there's
sort of a mix of projects.
So I think that many
product areas at Google
have some established sort
of short term projects
that they know they want to
get done and launch quickly,
but they also have some sort
of fraction of projects that
are more sort of exploratory and
are trying to do explore sort
of longer term
opportunities, and those
can be more researchy.
And it's always possible
to go and propose an idea
and say, hey, I think there's
something really interesting
here, and that's an
interesting challenge,
and if we solve
this problem, this
is going to have a big
impact on what we're doing.
And if you convince
your director,
your VP, then you might even
get some headcount and engineers
that can work on this project.
GIDEON MANN: So Tom, to
address your question,
I think one thing that I didn't
realize about this place,
before I started is
the autonomy and self
direction that each
individual engineer has.
They have it in the
choice of project,
but they also have it in
their interest of time.
And so, you are so valuable
as an engineer to the company
that you are actually
a prized resource,
and the company's
goal to some degree
is to keep you as
excited as possible.
And so, to some
degree, that means
that you can kind of move
and your place of interest.
Now, I think what
people usually find
is that after a
certain point there,
they start thinking
about aligning themselves
to the company's
larger interest.
Now how can I support
this larger area
that the company is going in?
It means that your
projects will move faster,
it means that
you'll move faster,
it means you'll
get more support,
more other people will
be interested in joining
your torch-bearing cause.
But it really is kind
of your own discretion.

I don't think I understood
how much that would
be true about being here,
but it certainly is.

UMESH SHANKAR: Just
to kind of follow up
on that very briefly, I think
like the usual process by which
this kind of thing happens
is, you start small,
like you build a prototype.
And the real process by which
things get kind of sorted out
and what ends up making
it and what doesn't is,
like, there's a marketplace
of people's time
because people's time
is really valuable.
And if your idea is really
good, and you convince
people to work on it, then
your project will grow.
And if you can convince
people that your idea's good,
maybe it's not that good.
Because maybe it is and
we're missing an opportunity,
but I think, on the whole,
the system works pretty well.
And it works very
organically, that means
that you have to
probably invest more
time in learn skills of
persuasion and things
that you might otherwise
to get it off the ground.
That's not necessarily
a bad thing, either.
So yeah, small things
can become big.
If anything, I think
maybe one mistake
that people sometimes
make in trying
to start new projects
is thinking too small.
It's hard to get people to want
to sign up to something which,
even if it all works out great,
still ends up being small.
That's just not that exciting.
So having a big vision
for even something that
starts out small really
ends up being key.
And that's really, I think,
a lot of Google's all about.
GIDEON MANN: I just
want to piggyback on
that I totally agree.
And I think one
feedback I get from-- I
met with Jennifer Rexburg,
who's a prof at Princeton,
and she was like, it's amazing,
I meet all these engineers
at Google and they're all
so able to communicate.
And I think, partly, that's
not the interview process.
I think, partly, it's
the work process.
You're forced in kind
of your daily process
to communicate
with other people.
That is kind of what will
propel you and communicate
about your ideas.
And so, just as
Umesh was saying,
it's like, that communication,
persuasion, building
the vision, that is
kind of the part that
will drive you on your project.
So agenda-wise, I
think we're getting
close to starting
the Q&amp;amp;A session.
I've noticed that we have
more and more questions,
so I would like to
encourage it even more.
AUDIENCE: This is a
segue [INAUDIBLE].

I understand that you are
all PhDs in computer science
[INAUDIBLE] as
far as I can tell,
seem to work on areas
within Google that
follow from graduate
research context
in a specific area for
your dissertations.
And so I was wondering, in part
because I am a math PhD, not
a computer science PhD,
about the adjustment process
that some people have
[INAUDIBLE] Google, as friends
of mine have PhDs in
biophysics and then
they start to work
on video chats.
One example that is true.
Because I think it's kind
of an adjustment process
to be a database
researcher in academia,
and then a database
researcher at Google,
and it's another kind adjustment
process to be a mathematician
and then to work on [INAUDIBLE].
What kinds of [INAUDIBLE]?

Just the kinds of
resources and learning
curve that people face in that?
OKSANA YAKHNENKO: So,
most likely, if you are,
what was your example again?
If you're a mathematician, well,
if you're a mathematician, most
likely, you will not be hired
as a front end developer.
Mostly because,
as far as I know,
and maybe actually,
people who work in the HR
maybe will be able to comment
a little bit more on that,
but that is as far
as I know, they
try to put you on a
project where you really
can contribute.
Because, yeah.

STU: May I try
answering that one?
I'm not on the
panel, I apologize.
[INAUDIBLE]

We have, [INAUDIBLE] one
of the earlier comments.
Last time I asked, we had
some 3000 people [INAUDIBLE],
some of them are none of
the above. [INAUDIBLE].

A whole bunch of psychology.
[INAUDIBLE] a few medical
doctors, Juris doctors,
[INAUDIBLE].
But we have over 2500 in
the computing cluster, which
I will define as math,
science, and engineering.
And then we have another 300 or
400 in biophysics, [INAUDIBLE]
which is as far
out as you can get.

And [INAUDIBLE] hiring
outside research.
Yes, we do take
a look at skills.
If you're going to
come in as an engineer,
you'd probably [INAUDIBLE]
real programmer.
And then we actually
do a sorting hat
with a serious effort to find
a plausible place for what
you know.
We're assuming that you're
a Ph.D. [INAUDIBLE].

And yes, of course
there are courses
on this, that, and the
other. [INAUDIBLE].

And your colleagues will
contribute [INAUDIBLE]
but the goal is we can be doing
something useful about a month
after you show up [INAUDIBLE]
in courses and learning
[INAUDIBLE] how to make
the elevators work.

But after that, we
expect you'll be
doing something kind
of useful in a month,
and be valuably up to
speed in [INAUDIBLE].
And by useful, I mean
a team [INAUDIBLE]
depending on you to actually
do something. [INAUDIBLE].

MICHIEL BACCHIANI:
More questions.

AUDIENCE: The problem
between academic research
and corporate research is
that every very smart idea
you guys have [INAUDIBLE] is
the competitive advantage.
So How does that
conflict with publishing?

GIDEON MANN: I'll take that one.
I had in mind to
directly address this
when Michiel was talking
about publishing.
I think that it is very
clear that the fruits of all
this labor is
material advantage.
And that it is
valuable work, it's
important work,
and that it makes
a difference at the company.
And so I think that everything
that gets published,
people think about, OK, well,
how much are we actually giving
away?
And I would say the things that
are, in particular, I would
say Urs is probably
the gatekeeper.
And if he feels like we're
giving too much away,
he'll say, let's
maybe either delay it
until the competitors
have got in close enough,
or let's hide some of
the most key pieces,
not so that it's
useless, but just so
that we don't give
away the bank.
And so, I think that,
yes, clearly it has value,
and clearly we don't
want to give away.
And so I think that.
But in my experience,
to give an example,
we published a paper on
distributed optimization.
And they didn't want
us to directly say
the number of cycles, or
the amount of time things
had taken up on that
racks or on the machines.
So we converted it to
some arbitrary scale,
and that was enough
to satisfy people
that we weren't
giving details away.
So I think that there's
always room for negotiation,
even within that space.
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

GIDEON MANN: So, my impression
is that Google's general
position on patents is that
they wish there weren't.
They didn't exist.

Google is involved in so
much patent litigation
that I think it would be
beneficial to the company
if the whole patent
system was more evolved.
Maybe Stu has a slightly
different perspective.
STU: True, but it
ain't going away.
So yes.
Somebody will look to the
publication [INAUDIBLE]
might have been patented and
submitted, in which case,
some [INAUDIBLE].

We would be delighted to
disarm, we just can't.
GIDEON MANN: But I think to--
STU: Have that conversation.
GIDEON MANN: But, to that
point, I think that it's not--
STU: It rarely delays you
more than a couple weeks
to actually get the
lawyers [INAUDIBLE]
and [INAUDIBLE] probably one
paper in 100 [INAUDIBLE].
GIDEON MANN: Oh, but I think
part of the question was,
how important to your
career is patent filing,
and I think it's--
STU: Very little.
GIDEON MANN: Yes,
MICHIEL BACCHIANI: There's
a question over here.
AUDIENCE: Obviously, [INAUDIBLE]
products here [INAUDIBLE].
So, excuse me, so [INAUDIBLE].

Because people somehow
appear to be [INAUDIBLE].
EUGENE WEINSTEIN:
Yes definitely.
So you mentioned 3,000, right?
So Google is, what, 50,000 now?
STU: Has 2500 PhD's,
and nobody ever
uses the title unless
they're a psychologist
or a lawyer or a medical doctor.
So unless you actually
ask, you probably
won't know [INAUDIBLE]
to get a PhD [INAUDIBLE]
actually pretty damn good.
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

MICHIEL BACCHIANI: So I think
it's not so much that it'll
give you an edge,
let's say, in title
or in how much people respect
your value, your opinion.
It won't get you that.
It's more the
ability that you'll
have to bring that research
kind of flavor to the work
that you do.
And I think in turn,
because you will
be able to show
that kind of skill,
in turn, that will
get you the respect
and buy in from your colleagues.
It won't be the fact that you
have the Ph.D. There was also
the adjustment aspect
of the questions
OKSANA YAKHNENKO:
I think one thing
that you'll learn
as a Ph.D. Student,
and it's mostly because you
spend, like, five years working
on one problem, is you really
learn how to problem solve.
So it's not necessarily the
title that gives you the edge,
but it's the fact that you, in
the process of getting the PhD,
you learn how to solve problems.
So think about it.
If you come to
Google, you get thrown
into an environment
where most likely,
you will be working on something
that is or is not related
to your Ph.D. Or to your
research project directly,
you still know how to approach
a problem, how to solve it,
how to evaluate your results.

And I think that's like a great
skill to have, for anybody.
And I think most of people
who actually work at Google
have that skill already.
So in terms of
adjustment, I don't know.
GIDEON MANN: I'll
speak to adjustment.
I was a post-doc, and I think my
biggest adjustment coming here
was that Google is
not very hierarchical.
And so, it's like when you're a
graduate student or a post-doc,
you have your adviser,
and your adviser
has a final say, to some degree.
I mean, about what you do.
It's really not like that here.
It's a very big
company, there are
a lot of very
different opinions,
and as an individual
engineer, you
have a huge amount of
autonomy and a huge of ability
to persuade that is kind of
separate from your manager
and from your team.
So one of the ways that
the engineering groups work
is that there's this
interesting kind
of a triad that decides
how things happen.
It's the manager of the team,
it's the tech lead of the team,
and the PM, potentially,
of the team.
And that triad is also
subject to the whims
of all the people on the team.
And so it's like a very
complicated process
how things get done.
And I think that understanding
that model, which
is different from
the academic model,
I think that is the
biggest adjustment,
and I think a
healthy adjustment.
I think academia is very rigid.
But I think that's
a big adjustment.
OMAR BENJELLOUN:
Just one more comment
I want to make on that question.
I think there's a very
strong computer science
culture at Google, and
engineering culture, but also
computer science.
So if you come with
a view of problems
which is sort of
academic or researchy,
or wants to think about problems
in a fairly rigorous way
and model them property and
solve them property and prove
that you have the
right solution,
this is something
that's very respected.
And so, I think at Google
more than anywhere else,
doing things right and
solving the problems sort
of at a fundamental
level is something
that is valued and respected.

AUDIENCE: I have a a comment
first and then a question.
[INAUDIBLE] question.
The comment, well, you asked,
or somebody [INAUDIBLE]
the idea that people
[INAUDIBLE] publishing.
Well, the fact is, I'm
in software engineering.
I go to software
engineering conferences.
I publish in
software engineering.
And you see [INAUDIBLE].

I mean, it's not
a value judgement,
it's just a fact if I
look at the program.
So people come away
saying, OK, there's
lots of PhD's at
Google, there are
lots of smart people at Google.
They're not [INAUDIBLE]
in software engineering.
What they do in software
engineering [INAUDIBLE] Well,
why is that?
And so, I think that's
where people get the idea.
It's a very pragmatic
[INAUDIBLE].

MICHIEL BACCHIANI: The
comment I have, and this
is my personal view
of it, but I think
the panel said it
to some extent.
But people join here, and it's
a very different environment.
So they have this
engineering team mates
that really want to
get something going.
And at some point, you
have the system out there,
and it serves people, and
there's traffic going in,
and you have the
signals coming back
from that which you
want to optimize.
So to some extent it's
sort of like taking a break
and doing the
paper publications,
and sort of formally write it
up and doing the measurements
in some kind of controlled way,
which isn't usually frequent
the way that an application
is deployed, where it's just,
you get more and more traffic.
A lot of the things are not very
well controlled in that sense.
It makes it harder
to do the paper
and sort of becomes
a distraction.
I think they get so
roped up into it.
AUDIENCE: I was
saying [INAUDIBLE]
I was responding to the question
that was asked, where do people
get this idea from?
I'm saying, that's where
people get the idea from.
MICHIEL BACCHIANI: I mean,
to some extent, I bring it up
because I think the
misperception is that there's
some kind of corporate shut
down on any kind of publication
because that's
not what we value.
I think that's very unfair
to address us like that.
AUDIENCE: OK.
So, my question for you, though,
which is completely [INAUDIBLE]
is you spend a lot of time
comparing Google to academia.
Now, I'm somebody who's,
my father's attended
[INAUDIBLE] which, the minute I
moved there, became AT&amp;amp;T Labs.

And I spent a lot of time at
Google Research [INAUDIBLE].
So as somebody who spent
time in AT&amp;amp;T Labs, I
ask you how you compare
[INAUDIBLE] now,
of course, you went
there in a different life
stage. [INAUDIBLE] According
to this is a brand new PhD.
[INAUDIBLE] How would
you compare life
at AT&amp;amp;T Research
versus life at Google?
MICHIEL BACCHIANI: So, when
I joined AT&amp;amp;T Research,
I gave you the
context of getting
hired at AT&amp;amp;T. I remember
I was done with grad school
and had lined up five
or six interviews.
And the first interview
I did was AT&amp;amp;T
because whoever was my contact
there was very proactive
and got that going, so it was
becoming the first interview
that I did.
And I visited one day and
had the interview process.
And it was actually so much fun
that I came back the next day,
and this is '99, right?
So the market is hot, I guess.
And they're worried00 I
didn't even factor in my mind,
but they were eager
to get people.
So the next morning, I
get a phone call saying,
like, I still have to do the
paperwork and the approval
or whatever, but you're
going to get an offer.
At that point, I
literally canceled
all my other interviews
because I liked it that much.
So I loved AT&amp;amp;T
Research When I joined,
it was really a fun place to be.
But I also felt that in
my years there, I mean,
there were nasty things because
the company was going down
the drain.
But AT&amp;amp;T Research in itself was
AUDIENCE: You have no idea
how far down the drain--

MICHIEL BACCHIANI: But I
mean, AT&amp;amp;T research in itself,
I think, was the greatest place.
Because all my colleagues
there were famous,
so there was no attitude.
They was sort of
like, do good work.
There was a lot of
interesting people to talk to.
There was a collaboration
within there,
but the rest of the
company was alien.
In fact, I remember making
fun of the rest of the company
where you'd have these
town hall meetings,
and we didn't really understand
what people are talking about,
because it's like, the rest of
the company, to some extent.
So I think the contrast
is, like, all of this
is AT&amp;amp;T research.
The entire company.
It's very open, collegial,
sort of collaborative,
many aspects to it.
So I think that's
the best comparison.
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

GIDEON MANN: I'll take that.
And so in 2009, I had this
project I wanted to work on.
I found a guy,
[INAUDIBLE] Silverman,
who was at NYU HD program.
I convinced him that
we should work on this,
and as part of the
project, [INAUDIBLE]
in spreadsheets,
machine learning,
he checked out the spreadsheet's
curve, he built it locally
and he embedded our software
into the spreadsheets.
I thought it was the
coolest crap I'd ever seen.
And then he produced
this demo which
showed what it would be like
to have this code in actually
the spreadsheet.
It was like a different
group, a group that
sat-- I think they
may have at that point
sat on the same floor as we did.
But we didn't know them at all.
And so we built the prototype,
he and I [INAUDIBLE]
mostly his work.
And then he showed
the demo to the group,
and it was a very
exciting moment,
because we're able to show them
their software doing something
that they hadn't
expected before.
And so that particular
group kind of
laid dormant for
a very long time.
And I think recently,
we went back
and built a lot of those pieces
in a different direction.
But I think that pathway
is a very common pathway.
You see someone else's code,
you check it out, you build it,
you modify it, you talk to them,
you try to get their feedback,
you try to plan a way forwards,
and it kind of moves this.
And that's just
saying it's organic.
It's like, you can see just
about any code in that company.
You can send an email
to just about anybody
and they will respond.
Actually, the more senior
are, the quicker they respond.
And I don't know why it works
that way, but it seems to.

As far as collaboration,
internal collaboration,
I think it is a wonderland.
It's fantastic.
people are very eager,
they're very interested,
and it's a nice place
for that aspect of it.
AUDIENCE: This one
small anecdote.
I worked in IBM research
for quite a while,
and IBM Research and
IBM Software Group
were two completely
separate entities.
And we had a prototype we wanted
to build into the product,
and it was a nightmare to
get their hands on code.
And there was envy, and
protective, and politics.
I mean, here, we have access
to almost all of the code,
you can talk to
almost everybody,
mean there is not the question
of what forums are there
for communication.
The company is the
forum for communication.
OKSANA YAKHNENKO: And
just to add to that,
we have tons of resources
to even like, you know,
finding who's working
on related projects.
For example, everybody
has like an internal page,
and anybody in the
company can actually
access your internal page.
All the projects have
internal websites
with, like, members,
what they work on,
what they're
interested in, there's
a mailing list for that.
Then there are mailing lists
on pretty much anything
you can imagine, so there's
like a mailing list for machine
learning, and there's
a mailing list
for some internal
specific tools,
or like, mailing lists
for some of the products
that are being developed.
It also happens from,
well, in my experience
anyway, is that, when
I joined the company,
I already knew a lot of people,
not necessarily in New York,
but in other offices.
And just like, people I've met
at conferences, or like people
who were in the same field.
And remote communication
is like super easy.
You literally go to a conference
room, you press the button,
and that person is on the
screen in front of you.
Magic.

And then, as Gideon said, people
are really, really willing,
and really supportive.

If you want to set up a
meeting with somebody,
you don't even have to, like,
sometimes you can just put it
on the calendar, and
they will show up.
It's like, it's magic.

EUGENE WEINSTEIN: Also just to
add one note about what venues
there are for fostering
collaborations.
So we have a thing
called beer and demos,
which is, it's on Friday, right?
Right, so you can
show up to this room,
It's very much
like this, and you
can have beer and watch people
demoing their half working,
or quarter working, or it
might work, kind of demos.
And if you have interest, if
you're interested in the work,
then you can come up
to them and create
a collaboration that way.
We also have millions of tech
talks, people, both internal
and external speakers coming
to present their work.
And you know, there
are visiting faculty,
there are other
people that are around
and want to share
their ideas with you
and are interested in
creating collaboration.
So there's many venues
that we haven't thought of.
It Sorry?
MICHIEL BACCHIANI: So you
could be needing for 10 minutes
already, so any
questions that you think
are really, really important to
be answered by the panel rather
than the person
that will probably
be sitting at your table?
AUDIENCE: Ask a question?
MICHIEL BACCHIANI:
Yes absolutely
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

STU: I suspect that
some of our offices
in other countries [INAUDIBLE].

MICHIEL BACCHIANI: One
of my favorite quotes
is, some people in other places,
probably for good reasons.

Final question?
AUDIENCE: So, [INAUDIBLE] it's
most important, in response
to the [INAUDIBLE]
I was wondering
what the extent of that was
and how common [INAUDIBLE].

UMESH SHANKAR:
Well, in some sense,
it's part of the
price of success.
You build something and
it's not being used,
you don't pay the tax,
but that's not really
where people want
to end up either.
And part of it, too, is
I think you sort of build
in the cost of maintenance
to your utility function
of how good your thing is.
Where that just
becomes part of how
you decide if a system is good.
Right?
It's not too good,
even if it just works,
or even if it works well.
It's how easy is it
to modify over time?
How easy is it to
maintain over time?
How much of your resources
or your team's resources
is it taking?
And so, you get better at it.
Sort of naturally, things
often evolves to a state
where you spend your time
either on doing new stuff
or making the things that you
already have more efficient
and taking less
maintenance burden so you
get to a good state again.
So yeah, it definitely
various, I think.
Working on infrastructure,
your definition of success
is making people that use your
stuff successful in a sense,
and that's what
my team's work on
is largely in the
infrastructure area.
So we probably pay a
larger tax that most,
but some of what--
I sort of alternate
between calling it
a tax and learning.
Because a lot of the
times, the things
that we spend a lot of time with
are basically customer service.
So a new team is integrating
with some technologies
that we've built.
We've built security and
privacy infrastructure,
and they'll have a
novel scenario, right?
They have different data
access patterns from ones
we've seen before,
they're doing some mash up
of kind of more
internal facing systems
with externally facing systems,
and that's a new thing,
and they're querying
data in a different way,
all this kind of stuff.
OK, we haven't seen
it before, right?
And so it's like,
ah man, we've got
to put down the code
that we're writing
and help them figure out
the right thing to do.
Maybe we have to
change our code,
maybe they have to
change their design,
maybe we just come up
with something clever.
But the net effect
of those things
is that, when you design the
next version of your system,
you've already taken
those into account.
So I think maybe I
was a little harsh
in calling it always
a tax, exactly.
There is certainly an
element of that, right?
You end up doing some stuff kind
of a lot, and it's like ugh.
Got to update
something again, right?
Or some machine broke
somewhere and now
you've got to fix something.
So that kind of
stuff happens, right?
But I said over time, the
trend is towards, OK, well,
if some machine broke
for the 10th time
and I'm having to spend
the 10th time to fix it,
maybe I need to engineer
around that problem.
And now you have a much
more robust system too.
And in terms of
customer service,
maybe you build
your system in a way
that people don't have
to ask as many questions,
and it's just more natural
and easy for them to use.
And that, too, is
progress, so yeah, you
try to find a good equilibrium.
