presentation the title is robust IRC
which is the code name for project which
I've been doing in my spare time with my
body axle who sits over there and the
subtitle is RC without net splits
because you know that's what it's all
about so as a brief outline first I'm
going to cover the motivation why would
we want to do another thing that does RC
like an RC server / network then I'll
give an overview about what robust RSA
actually does like what makes it special
I'll cover the robust session protocol
what is wrapped and how are we using it
I'll cover the fine print so what is it
that you need to look at when running a
robust IRC network and then you will do
a brief conclusion so hands up who has
never heard of IRC nobody who has never
used RC no way excellent so perfect
audience I I don't need to lose many
words but briefly IRC is the longest
internet chat protocol still in
widespread use I think it's standardized
in quotes in a couple of rfcs many of
them are not quite relevant anymore and
many things you see in the wild and IRC
are not standardized so it's kind of
fuzzy hmm but so what's our motivation
so RC is widespread in some circles most
notably free and open source software I
have a couple of open source projects
and all of the communication goes over
IRC also we're using it here so that may
also be interesting and I'm using it
with a couple of my friends to
communicate we have looked at and tried
various other alternatives to RC but
none of the alternative is convincing
each of them has other trade-offs but in
conclusion RC has a lot of different
clients and a lot of people know how to
use it it's relatively simple so that's
just the the protocol that we still want
to use even though it's old and the
biggest problem in our daily lives with
Ric is actually just that it has poor
stability so what do I mean by that any
cheese p disconnect that you have splits
the RC network so when that means really
any two
p connection that is involved in IRC so
you have a connection between the client
and the server and yet connection
underneath the various servers that form
network right and if your client loses
connection to the server then it's game
over the session will be terminated and
you get kicked out of IRC so that's like
the tiniest net split that you can
imagine but then even when a pair of
service which are connected by a TCP
connection lose that connection you get
a bigger net split you get a split that
affects potentially you know tens
hundreds thousands of users depending on
the size of the RC Network and the
bigger problem with that is that regular
maintenance such as software updates
reboots of any given server etc
triggered at so each of those will
trigger next plate and that puts
incentives in kind of the wrong way
right because suddenly you have an
incentive to run your machine with a
very high uptime and never do any
security updates and never do any
software updates never reboot it so we
thought how could we prevent net splits
but still stay compatible with the corps
IRC protocol so the idea is twofold
first of all we want to handle it is p
disconnects transparently so we need
some sort of transport or tunneling
protocol over which we can tunnel our
see in the sense of what's defined in
the RFC's but which doesn't rely on a
single TCP connection being there and
being stable at all times and then the
other idea was there's highly reliable
databases such as chubby and others like
SED in the open source world so why can
we not do kind of the same thing but for
IRC so we could distribute the IRC
server across multiple actual servers
right and that implies that if we're
going to go that route then we should
also use something like pack sauce or
more recently wrapped and that dictates
a certain input output model so that's
the interesting part of the project
right its first of all is is it feasible
to use like a distributed consensus
protocol such as wrapped to build an IRC
network across multiple servers and how
would we actually do that like how does
the input and output need to look like
all right so an overview first I have a
couple of diagrams later to hopefully
explain this by the way if you have any
pressing questions please just raise
your hand otherwise we'll have time for
questions
at the end so the idea is that we have
this one virtual IRC server which is
made up of n robust IRC servers so in
the smallest configuration you need
three different robust IRC servers but
then you can go higher and each time you
reach an odd number you'll get one more
permitted failure so if the minority of
servers fail that means that for a
network of three robust IRC servers one
of them can fail and nothing bad happens
for a network of five servers to can
fail etc etc right and then for
communication between the client like
the actual IRC client like you'll see or
whatever you're using anti servers with
the virtual server rather we use a thing
called the robust session protocol which
I'll cover in a minute and then on the
IRC client so that you don't have to use
a specific IRC client we have a thing
called the bridge which is a very simple
program that you run on the same machine
as the IRC client and it translates
between just regular IRC and the robust
session protocol so it does the
tunneling for you and maybe in the
future we could add that to our seek
lines in the form of plug-in or even at
native support if it turns out that the
idea is great so this is the
architecture on the top left we have the
IRC clients which just speak IRC to the
various bridges the idea is that
typically you'll have a bridge / IRC
client but then you can also think of
set up such as your computer clubs which
provide a shell server and they could
run just a single bridge on their shell
server and then every of their members
uses that right so there's not a
one-to-one mapping but it's a little bit
more flexible and later on we can also
think about providing a bridge in the
actual co-located with the actual robust
RAC servers so that people who don't
want to install or run the bridge can
still connect to the network but they
don't get to enjoy the reliability that
comes with the network so then from the
bridges we speak to that robust IRC
cloud on the right hand side and what it
does is it tunnels IRC over the robust
session protocol there's multiple arrows
because for most of the requests it
doesn't really matter where they go to
and but they
need to eventually arrive at the RAF
leader of covered up in a second okay so
the idea behind the robust session
protocol is that instead of using just
such SP connection will do HTTP plus
Jason simply because it's very very
widespread and every programming
language in which there exists an IRC
client can most likely already handle
HTTP and Jason so the things that a TCP
connection provides like connecting
disconnecting sending and receiving we
map to four different methods they
create post get and delete burbs and
then we have different endpoints for
those so you can create a session which
corresponds to the HSP connection you
can post messages you can get messages
and you can delete your session the get
messages one is a little bit special
because it's one get request but it runs
forever so it gives you HTTP chunks and
whenever a new message comes in you'll
just get another chunk right so you
don't need to pull four messages with
costly requests over and over but you
just get a stream of requests for
sending messages using the post methods
there's a retry mechanism in the bridge
however duplicates are filtered on the
server so that the retry is kept simple
but is reliable still for receiving
messages the bridge will keep the
message ID of the last received message
and whenever it needs to resume the
requested will just tell the server hey
I'm at this message and I will get all
the messages that followed that message
and as I hinted each server can handle
any methods and the way we do that is by
reverse proxy in the request to the
current leader if necessary so when is
it necessary everything that modifies
States so create post and delete need to
arrive at the leader whereas everything
that just reads can be handled by any of
the server there are some people in the
rap community who think that this kind
of reverse proxying is bad idea we opted
to do it still because that way when you
have a network outage between the client
and any given robust IRC server which
happens to be the leader you don't lose
like that fraction of the network right
and I mean you do impose an additional
load on the robust RC Network but you
make it more reliable so
that's a trade-off that we made in that
favor okay so Rob who has never heard of
raft raise your hand all right couple of
people cool so raft I just got to cite
the Wikipedia definition raft is a
consensus algorithm was meant to be more
understandable than taxes but it's also
formally proven safe and offers some new
features and then it goes on to say rap
offers a generic way to distribute state
machine across a cluster of computing
systems ensuring that each node in the
cluster agrees upon the same series of
state transitions so what does that mean
it's it's kind of like axis if you've
heard of axis and if you haven't then
it's just a protocol which whenever a
new message comes in will replicate the
message to all of the other nodes that
are not the leader and whenever there's
a failure of any given node the protocol
ensures that that node can catch up with
the rest of the network so no matter
which node in the network you ask it's
either a little bit behind or it has
exactly the same state as any other node
in the network right that's what rap
tries to do I put a couple of links on
the slides which are you going to
publish later on there's rough consensus
that github good i 0 which is their
website and it has like a list of
implementations which goes on and on
along so RAF was published I think two
years ago end of 2013 and since then
there's been new implementations popping
up in every single language that you can
imagine that people would want to
program in and so that kind of
underlines how simple rap is to
implement and not saying to get right
but at least to implement in a
reasonable passion whereas taxes was
much more complicated than that if
you've ever dealt with it and then the
last link is an interactive
visualization of Wrath and I recommend
if you're you know even a little bit
interested in how it works just look at
that it's very simple to understand and
afterwards you'll have a much better
understanding and then if you're still
interested read the paper which is not
very long there's been a new paper i
just read like yesterday which confirms
that the original paper is much easier
to understand if done like a series of
tests with students who should compare
this to pax's etc so very briefly let's
assume that we have three nodes we have
a which highlighted which is the current
leader we have nodes B and C Egypt those
is a separate server like physical
server and then a talks to be in a tux
to see so the communication is always in
topology where the leader talks to Egypt
followers and the followers don't cross
talk so this entirety builds the raft
network and then we have a client which
wants to talk to that Network and what
it does is it sends the message to a and
then a replicates that to B and C and
assuming that these latencies apply so
communication from A to B a single round
trip takes six milliseconds and from HSE
a round trip takes eight milliseconds
then a message is committed after a
receives the acknowledgement from be so
because you need quorum right so a has
the message so you have one node of 3 B
gets the message and acknowledges that
so you have two nodes of pre and
suddenly you're at the majority right so
that's an interesting observation with
regards to how the latency will behave
but I'll cover that in more detail in
the fine print later all right so how do
we actually make use of raft the idea is
that we replicate all of the IRC input
messages by a round so what do I mean by
an input message and input message is
everything that a client will send into
the network right I can actually emit in
the demo part I'll briefly demonstrate
what that is but typically it's like the
nickname command to initiate a session
say hey I'm that guy it will be joined
commands to go into a certain channel
it'll be pretty message commands to send
a message to that channel or to other
users and all of these messages will be
replicated using raft notably the
answers to that messages so the what I
call the IRC output messages will not
because they depend only on the input
and on the state which builds up based
on processing that input so each of the
robust IRC servers will compute the same
state and notably that same state will
be generated after replay so if one of
the nodes goes down for example because
you reboot it and you start it back up
again it will go through all of the
messages in the RAF block and then
arrive at exactly the same state all
right so here's an overview diagram
which
hopefully it's not too confusing once we
go over it one by one so decline on the
upper left-hand side starts by sending a
post request with its message the
message could be something like join
hash I three and then that goes to the
leader possibly by way of a reverse
proxying the leader replicates it to
node 12 also to load three but once it
replicated it to node 12 it reach quorum
and then the message is seen as
committed and both the leader and the
followers will call IRC server the
process on a message which is a very
simple function that just receives an
actual message as an input it has some
state in the IRC server object and then
it gives you more messages as the output
right so the output which it generates
could be something like a colon stapler
Berg join hash I pre right and that's
what all the other clients will see and
then each of these nodes commits it to
the output stream and the output stream
is that which gets pulled by the various
clients with the get request right all
right so that's all nice and clean but
what about the deletion of old messages
which you need to do because in the
model which I've explained to you so far
RC messages will just pile up and will
be retained forever by default which is
both a privacy problem and the storage
problem because you don't want to keep
data for longer than is necessary and
eventually you'll run out of disk and
very big networks right so what we've
done is we we chose to implement a
periodic cleaner which in rap
terminology is called compaction on each
of the nodes so what do I mean by by
compaction / cleaner if you look at the
IRC message log at the left hand side of
this slide you'll see that it contains
first nickname secure than contains join
hash I three it changes the nic to
secure without the underscore and then
sends a print message so the proof
message you can garbage collect
immediately because it will never modify
any state right it will just be routed
through the network so that's a very
simple decision to make and then the
nickname message you need to look at
whether a later nickname message
obsoletes an earlier named message so
the first one in this example we can
just
Elite because if you replay it the other
way around if you join the channel with
any Nick and then rename yourself you'll
still arrive at the same state as if you
join with another different name right
however let's assume that I'm not only
joining the channel and sending a
message later but I'm also changing the
topic of the channel so if I do that
then the problem is suddenly we can no
longer just delete the message we need
to retain it and why is that because if
you look at what the server sends in
response to the topic you'll see that it
contains not only to topic itself but
also who said it and when did that
person said it so if i were to delete
the first nickname message then suddenly
the nickname would be wrong in that
reply and then we would introduce an
inconsistency in the output stream that
would be bad right because then if then
the network behavior would diverge based
on when and how you restart the notes
right and that is what we want to avoid
all right but what now if you add
another topic message afterwards then
suddenly the old topic message will
become obsolete and so will also the
nickname so you can delete them both
right so compaction is a step where
first you need to go through all the
messages delete all of those which you
can immediately delete and then repeat
that process until there's no more
dependencies between these various
messages such that nothing changes and
then you can stop right all right so for
the fine print let's assume you're
running such network and your or you're
interested in running such network and
there's a couple of points to look at
first of all the speed of the network is
limited by the server network so what do
I mean by that the latency of any given
message from when the client sends it to
when other clients can receive it is
determined by the median latency between
the leader and the followers because
first in rapt message needs to be
committed on the majority of the network
and then only the leader can put it into
the f sorry any node can put it into the
output stream right so we'll take at
least that long
oh but that's not actually a problem in
practice because that latency is you
know below 100 milliseconds typically
depending on your network topology but
the below 100 milliseconds is when
you're sending a lot of messages like
thousands of messages per second over a
network that run over the internet and
not within a single data center or you
know campus so I'm not even sure because
it's very hard to get numbers on the
current RC performance so it's hard to
get numbers on how many messages per
second the current networks handle but
it's even harder to figure out what the
latency is but i think that the latency
right now may not be very much better
right and also consider that one hundred
million seconds latency is like nothing
for RC right you won't even notice that
then obviously the the point of robust
Ric is to be resilient but that
resilience requires at least three
separate failure domains right so what
do I mean by that if you place your
three robust RC service or more in
different data centers are connected on
different uplinks and have different
power supplies etc that's all great but
not everybody can afford to do that so
fewer paleo domains like putting all of
the three robust IRC servers into the
same rack are obviously okay but then
you get less resilience right because if
a one single machine fails like a
hardware failure that's fine and robust
tracy can handle that but as soon as
your entire wreck fails you're still
host so yes you can build a brazilian RC
Network but it's not as simple anymore
as just putting up one server on
something which wouldn't have given me
resilience anyway right just saying so
it's it's a higher bar to run this than
to run a traditional RC Network and then
the last point which I've suffix with a
question mark because I'm not quite sure
is that the throughput of robust RC may
be too little / small for very big
networks and by very big networks I mean
something like free node or one of the
other like top 10 RC networks I looked
at the freenode website where they say
that you know they provide numbers such
as for a typical server you'll need to
have like 300 gigabytes of traffic per
month or so and if you use that number
to come back at a number of messages per
second with some you know guesstimate
calculations you'll arrive at like a
thousand three hundred messages per
second I think so the 1000 plus that
we're achieving at the moment may
actually be enough but I can't be quite
sure because you know it's there's like
no absolute numbers so yeah keep that in
mind so it's probably not a wise idea to
say to the p.o people hey why not
migrate to that like right now but maybe
in the future it's possible all right so
conclusion before I give you a
demonstration is please help us testing
and give us feedback that may be right
here during the talk or later very happy
to hear what you guys think and then
there's a website that we've set up
where you can also get these
instructions on how to set up a bridge
and join the network and if so should we
do the demo first or do you guys have
any very pressing questions sounds like
no so I'm going to just do the delavan
okay so who of you has never seen what
IRC looks like on the wire please raise
your hand oh yeah everybody cool okay
I'm gonna just gonna skip that then so I
have a command called local net which
will just bring up three different
robust RC notes on my local machine
there now running and they have status
pages which may not be a big price you
can see which one is the leader and you
can see all of the peers that are
configured you can see some internal
draft statistics and then you can see
what kind of active requests its
handling as of now it's nothing right
but as soon as I start bringing up in
our see client and going to make that a
little bit smaller and connecting to
that network via the bridge which local
net set up for me I'm going to just join
an arbitrary channel we can see on the
Status page that registered an active
session it doesn't have the active get
messages request because that is
distributed randomly across the note
right so I'm just I just looked at
status edge of the first node so let's
look at one of the second node okay it's
not here either and then it must be on
the Status page of third that we have it
so that's the long-running pull request
and the message pushes like for example
if i write this message or if i set a
topic that's that's done using post
messages right alright so i'm going to
bring up a second IRC client alright i'm
going to join the same channel we can
see that the second person is now in
here and messages work okay so that's
the boring all right everybody could
imagine that we can implement an IRC
server but now let's look at the
interesting part we have a bunch of
robots rcv processes we have the server
processes here here and here and then we
have the bridge process so let's choose
the first server process which is also
the leader just by way of how a local
that sets them up it first brings up a
leader and then it joins the other nodes
and we're just going to kill it ah so
now it's gone we can confirm that by
looking at the Status page the first one
is not available anymore the second one
still is and the third one is as well if
you've watched closely the second one
became the leader in between my
refreshes so once it noticed that the
old liver is gone the remaining nodes do
a master election and then a new leader
is selected and yeah we can also see
that these get message requests are now
only at the remaining service right so
let's send another message and here we
can see that it actually arrived right
so if we degrade the network by removing
one of the nodes it still just works now
what happens if we remove another note
so I'm just going to kill the second
server and refresh here to see it's gum
the first one still gone the third one
is now still here it now says its
candidate but it doesn't
a leader so leader is set to mill and
what happens if we send another message
so as you can see here it doesn't arrive
and at some point my IRC client will
start complaining that it doesn't get
new messages so the ping pong exchange
which IRC clients do will just not
result in a pong message right because
anything that you're going to send to
the network it's not going to accept so
the bridge will endlessly retry that so
the network itself is just frozen now
right however if I know go into the temp
directory which local I created for me
and I'm going to use to restart script
to bring up the second load again we can
see that after a while the message will
eventually arrive here oh yeah so here
in the leg line you will now see that
the first IRC client realize that it has
a lag of 20 seconds and then here you
saw that the message eventually arrived
so the network will actually you know
get into a clean site again once you
bring up the remaining nodes and as soon
as you have like two of three nodes or
just the majority in bigger networks
then you can use the network again
alright so that's the demonstration part
I'm quickly going to show you the robust
RC website so here you have just you
know the instructions for how to build
the bridge and you can choose which are
supplied you use and then it will adapt
the instructions for you so with that
any questions yes ok so to repeat the
question i think it was could we chart
the network and have a different leader
for every single channel so that we can
have a higher three right yeah we
thought about that but it's not quite as
simple because there actually is a
dependency between each of the channels
because the nickname state is shared
across the entire network right so if
you rename in one channel you must also
you rent and other channels so if you
were to charge the the network per
channel you would need to make each of
those charts aware of what is going on
in the rest of the network at which
point you're roughly replicating all of
the state again right if you want to do
it right because you're all these RSC
commands actually have subtle details on
what happens when for example you send a
message to a nickname which does not
exist does it not exist in the entire
network or just on that chart so how are
you going to handle that that all seems
rather complicated so we've opted to not
do that unless it really becomes
unavoidable at some point yes please
yeah so the question was is everything
HTTPS or anything unencrypted the answer
is everything is HTTPS what we're doing
in the robust session protocol is such
so that you cannot just steal any other
person session you need like a shared
secret between the server and the bridge
excuse me and that secret in order to
stay say it needs to be transmitted
encrypt that right so we just use HTTPS
for everything and you cannot even
configure a lot HTTPS listener alright
more questions yes please ok a question
was do the servers all communicating
constantly with each other or how do
they notice when something goes down the
answer is yes the RAF protocol in the
library that we're using has like a 50
millisecond heartbeat where it just
constantly probes all of the other all
of the sorry it yeah so so this is the
way it works if we go back to the
diagram this one right so a always that
the current leader always communicates
to all of the followers and the
followers just look at when was the last
time I've heard from the leader and at
that time exceeds a certain threshold
then they start the master election to
become a leader right and the that
why yes the master needs to be in
constant contact with the other notes
but the notes don't need to be in
contact with each other the set answer
question ok cool more questions yes
please we try to but then we couldn't
quite figure out how to use it so we
contacted the author and the author was
very much not interested in helping us
so we opted to use a raft implementation
by hashing core which they use in
console if you've heard of that and
they've been a quite a nice upstream so
we've gotten a couple of patches
upstream further questions yes
split-brain scenarios by that you mean
that if you have like a so for example a
good scenario where you have where you
could end up in a split brain scenario
is if you have four nodes and then let's
say two of them are in the same data
center each and the link between the
pairs of two that one fails right but
and the answer is wrap just freezes
right when you kind of reach quorum then
you cannot progress right with regards
to the the four-note scenario I think
you just shouldn't do that like you
should always have an an odd number of
notes like use three or five or seven
etc I'm not quite sure if there's any
protection within wrap or within the
implementation of proper we're using so
in the demo I went down to one node and
then I restarted the second node and
damaged recovered right just to be clear
yes so at that point you have the
majority again right so you can repeat
yes yes that was what I was trying to
outline I think you just should never
configure a wrap that work within an
even number no there isn't so so if you
actually look look at the wrap paper
they have the concept of terms and the
higher turn number is what wins right
that's that I haven't really explored
all the different corner cases and I
think it's just fundamentally safer if
you use a number of notes that just
doesn't reach majority in such case
right but no but the point is if you
have a three-way partition in the three
node network then none of them will
accept new messages until they elect a
new leader which is only possible if you
have two of them which can reach each
other right no no all of the messages
will make it through yes but the son of
a case yeah so the point is really I so
the way I think about it is that
uncommitted messages are not messages
that make it through right and and what
Raph does is like an implementation
detail for me and I know that the bridge
retries messages over and over until
it's actually committed so whatever is
in flight doesn't really matter because
on like what you see as user is that at
some point your message just goes
through right it will never be lost
silently now all right further questions
alright so the the question was whether
we could still chart by channels if we
just use channel IDs right so I guess it
would be better if after thought we
discussed this because we've actually
had some thoughts on this and we have
like a design document where we outline
why this doesn't work don't want to
rehash it here off the top of my head
but yeah okay any other questions yes
please yes so the way it works is the
question was do we support life
configuration updates like adding more
service the answer is yes we do because
the the raft configuration like how many
nodes that are in the network and which
addresses these nodes have is just
another wrap message so to remove a node
you commit the message that this is now
removed from the configuration to add
one you can just do the same thing but
added this also covers in the future the
actual configuration file of the RC
Network behavior itself which was just
be committed to wrapped and then used
yeah the question was
more of half of the service died and you
want to remove them can you do that
that's a very interesting question yeah
yeah yeah I mean if your network
degenerates in into such a case where it
cannot recover at all then no you cannot
do it yes I think you would need to
delete the state of all the notes and
restart them yeah at which point you
have a factor p.m. let's play right yeah
throw the questions the question was is
this if possible or a otoscope I think
as possible because DCC is there a
client connect right so the clients just
exchanged a message over the regular RC
Network where they have like their their
addresses what they think is their
address right I don't think they even
used like what the IRC server tells them
is there a stair address so that should
still be just as possible as it is right
now which may not be a satisfying answer
because it actually sucks do two methods
all right but yeah okay further
questions okay question was what do we
do about message ordering the
interesting fact is that in a typical RC
network that's not handled all right
questions are just yeah not really
ordered kind of okay okay there's lots
of facts in any case how wrapped helps
us here is that wrapped defines message
order right because the message will be
ordered by virtue of the protocol
needing that order so you have the term
ID and then you have a message ID and
that defines a clear order and every of
our nodes will process messages only in
that order that's what rap guarantees us
so suddenly you do actually have an
order IRC network it doesn't answer the
question okay okay yeah yeah well the
point is you haven't ordered in the
sense that every server is happy and the
same about ordering not that the clients
actually agree with your right yeah
further questions
oh yeah sure the question was what
exactly is create and delete and could I
explain how it maps are seaso create
does nothing else but reserve a session
ID and generate one of these shared
secrets such that every other requests
like post get and delete become possible
at all because for those you need to
session i right so it's kind of like an
entry in your TSP connection table
that's exactly our maps that's an answer
your question yeah it is all right okay
question was kind of do s the network
with a lot of crater press think the
answer is yes as of now the better
question is kind of us to network with
any other sort of the US and the answer
is also yes right so yeah we haven't
thought a lot about how to handle that
sort of abuse yeah we should probably
just yell X power created sessions after
a while especially if they're not used
because typically they will be created
and immediately used right so it should
be simple to implement protection
against this okay put the questions
sounds like a no so then I just close
with the inviting you all to join us in
the robots RC network and perhaps start
your own maybe okay thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
