to this talk I am was invited by Jason
because I moved here about two months
ago I live in San Jose I am a research
fellow at Stanford so I'm a theoretical
biologist but today I'm not going to
talk about biology but about this art
project which I started which is called
1,000 paintings com.com
yeah you can hear from my funny accent
that I'm not from around here but I hope
if you don't understand me just let me
know how I want to structure these talks
I want briefly introduce what it is how
it started and then how its spread and
maybe some related projects okay so what
is 1,000 paintings come the first place
well as the title suggests it's a it's
an art project and it's about 1,000
paintings literally and these paintings
are that's that's how they look like
these are the real paintings it's a
thousand paintings with the numbers one
to a thousand that's basically it
now there's of course much more to it
but at the very heart of it that's
that's it
the paintings are handmade you just want
to stress that fact it's not just a
print it's handmade and it comes with
this website which is basically the
heart of the project 1000 paintings calm
and as you can see here so far we saw
about 780 paintings and there's of
course 220 left if you do the math
and all paintings have been sold on this
website so exclusively there's no you
can't buy the paintings anywhere else
except here so when you go to number
that's basically how it looks like you
see the painting or at least some
representation of it you can most of the
time you'll see that is sold there's
some Wikipedia information about it but
if you go to the availability list up
here you get a list like that very long
list of all the numbers and you see
whether they're sold as you can see most
are sold or whether they're still
available and what the current price is
and what the max price is the reason why
I write here current price and max price
is because the price of each painting is
defined by a formula okay
the formula looks a little bit like this
so it's a function of the number so X is
just a number that you're interested in
and multiplied by a factor which is
basically it depends on the numbers of
paintings sold okay so maybe with a
little bit more of a table to show this
it will be easier to understand so let's
look at the painting 42 as an example
the base value is $1,000 - minus the
number so in the case of 42 it would be
nine fifty eight dollars and then
there's a discount which depends on how
many paintings have been sold so far
okay so the first hundred 100 paintings
had a discount of 90% so they were
pretty cheap and then the second hundred
paintings would go for this come 80% and
so on and in the end you will pay the
full price
oh so right now because I've sold 780
paintings were here still a decent
discount but if you would buy number 42
now that would be the price and so just
some stats they started about two and a
half years ago a little less probably
780 paintings sold so far I've shipped
paintings to 26 countries which was
quite amazing it's essentially my first
art project more of half of these
paintings have been sold in the u.s.
there was a crazy crazy moment two years
ago and I sold 322 paintings in 48 hours
5:24 was the first number to be sold
don't ask me why 420 was the first
number to be shipped to the US you
probably know more about this than I do
the highest price so far that's been
paid on the second market because people
resell these paintings has been $3,000
for number 6 and the current highest bid
is $5,000 so that's just a little bit of
the stats so that's a very short
introduction into the project what it's
all about
okay and so how did it start or how how
did I come up with the idea what's
what's the concept behind it everybody
seems to have you know his or her own
idea which is good which is what is all
about but I want to give you a short
introduction how I came up with the
project so this is a picture of port and
Portugal where we my wife and I were
having a vacation and we were you know
walking down the streets and visiting a
couple of art galleries there are lots
of art galleries and most of them sold
paintings you know with flowers and
landscapes and such which intrigued me
because I mean these paintings were
really expensive like five to ten
thousand dollars of
you know a flower of local artists and I
was wondering why would people paint
flowers these days and and at what price
would they would they sell it and why
would people buy it and so this is how
it all started
so the entire project is essentially a
project about the art market so in my
view this project is all about the meta
content okay so let's let's briefly go
back in time and think what people have
been painting or you know why they have
made art I guess you know these these
paintings here these are from the
Lascaux caves and in France this is a
horse probably and it's probably about
16,000 years old and of course that is a
represent a representation of a real
object the horse right and then if you
fast-forward
that's essentially what people date but
over time it became more and more
abstract so I guess all of you have seen
dollies and Picasso's and whatnot where
it's still a little bit representational
but it gets more abstract and then as
you go to the modern age of course you
sooner or later stumble over Czechs and
Pollock here in I think in the MoMA
probably which is purely abstract right
so the content went from a
representation of an object into purely
abstract stuff
and now it's kind of hard to think you
know how much would you pay for that or
for how much would he sell it if he
owned it and I think this became really
really interesting I don't know if you
heard about this fractal debate there
were even some some articles in nature
about that a couple of years ago a guy
in New York I think found a couple of
paintings in a storage locker that
looked awfully like like Pollock
paintings and he he had good reasons to
think that these are actually Jackson
Pollock paintings because you know his
parents were friends of Jackson Pollock
and so there was a debate
are these really Pollock paintings or
already just you know forgeries or just
fake paintings and I think some
physicists started exploring if you
could possibly by any algorithm tell
whether Pollock painting was a real
Pollock or whether it was a fake and I
think it had to do I'm pretty sure it
had to do with fractals but I don't
remember the exact details you could
look it up on the nature website but so
I mean the fascinating scene the
fascinating thing was they're birdies 10
or 20 or 30 paintings if they were real
Pollock's right they would be worth
millions if they were not they would be
worth nothing basically the exact same
painting
and so if you think about this say you
have a painting like this this could be
a Pollock but it's not it's it's made on
the website Jackson Pollock or which is
really funny can just go with with your
mouse and draw that so I made that in
about five seconds so if it was a
Pollock right it would be worth millions
if it wasn't it would be worth worth
basically nothing and that's kind of
funny if you think about it I mean it's
the exact same content but it's a huge
difference and the only difference is
information about the painting
information about the artwork which is
which essentially the definition of you
meta right it's something about
something so what I wanted to do in the
first place I wanted to remove all
content from a painting and just be it
should just be about meta content now if
you remove all content from a painting
what do you end up with this is a white
canvas it's not so funny plus it has
been made you know people have known
that before so another thing is that I
was thinking about is if you have just a
print what a lot of artists do these
days right they they create their
artworks on a computer and then they
have a limited edition of prints which
is fine if you have a copy or there's
copy too but if you have millions of
copies it becomes sort of useless and
basically worthless so the limit is
another extremely important meta content
that influences the price and so I
thought well let that be the content
right let let the limit be be the art
basically so all I wanted to add to this
white canvas was the number just as
Jason put it like you know you have
these paintings where it says it's it's
on the back it's numbered 17 of a
thousand so instead of the back I just
put it on the front it's just just a
number
now I also thought you know if I have to
add content which is not what I wanted
in the first place well let me then turn
that into meta content - right let me
let me also influence that the price and
so that's how this formula came up
basically a thousand - - the number and
also because I'm interested in in the
art art market I wanted to build in the
supply and demand mechanism so if you
buy early it's cheaper if you violate
it's more expensive and that's
essentially then how how I came up with
this project so you know the number is
basically the art but it's also the
limit and it's also the price so how it
spread I think this is probably for me
personally the most fascinating part
about it I started as I said two and a
half years ago on February the 9th there
was a small small newspaper where I was
living back then who had an article
which was which was nice and so I sold
20 paintings I mean they were very cheap
at the beginning right and then so
people started blogging about it
36 paintings a couple of days later and
because paintings were cheap probably
some people which is by why not it's not
not much of a risk but then it slowed
down dramatically at 61 painting sold on
made at first and then for almost a full
month I sold one painting I thought okay
I have to do something about it so and
what I did basically was was this
website was a chairman work play with
the a href tag
and that's that's how it looked like I
don't know if you have seen any of these
but this is just a graphic
representation of HTML it's very simple
right
so I mean you guys know all about that
but every web page is HTML HTML so there
is of XML so it's hierarchically
structure and any hierarchy can be can
be represented as a network so which is
parse which is parse the HTML content
the the Dom structure essentially and
you know put that out as a as a as a
graph so this for example would be the
Economist various colors have various
meanings so blue means links
green means Tiff's I think yeah that's
actually quite funny so this is rather a
modern web page whereas for example
etsy.com which is a very cool art web
page red is table so this is all table
based maybe let me quickly show that
because it's it's kind of funny how it
unfolds
since bed right yeah
does it work
so it you know reads the the HTML and
then starts starts blowing it up
physically because you know every
particle tries to get away from every
other other particle I mean yeah it's
relatively simple but I put that on the
web and people loved it I mean everybody
almost each blog which is you know parse
his blog make a screenshot put it on the
blog and it was really really love fun
so this is a little slow but that's
essentially how it works so yeah if you
want to do it check it out it's that bad
website and so what happened then is of
course I had a link to the paintings
project so as I said not much happened
until May 25th I put that applet online
on on May 25th and then the next day I
had five sales which was great then the
the next day I had almost ten sales and
as it spread it really started picking
up quickly and um one day I would even
sell 21 paintings which was quite
amazing to me and I thought you know
this is nice now maybe it will spread
then something happened which I didn't
anticipate at all
Boeing Boeing blogged about it Marc Fran
Felder said so it was at the point where
I sold 128 paintings he blogged about it
I don't know why he did it he will never
ever answer my emails so it will be you
know a mystery for the rest of the time
so what happened is on May 29th as I
said I had 106 paintings sold the next
day I was up to 225 and then the next
day I was up to 421 so yeah was probably
the most amazing 48 hours I have ever
gone through because it would just be
you know reload reload reload and every
time the counter would go up
yeah and at end of qu and I was at 5565
naturally things slowed down which is
normal also given given the price right
paintings are more expensive now I mean
the say 200 paintings here up to 780
were more expensive than all the
paintings sold up there so it's it's
only natural that it slows down which is
built-in in the algorithm and also then
of course people picked it up damn pink
from Wired picked it up which which was
quite fun there's a German art investor
magazine we thought I was making a joke
but they still they still um wrote about
it this is Brazil's biggest art journal
called Bravo
and also people got really excited about
it they started sending me you know
pictures of the numbers why they chose
different numbers I learned a lot about
numbers I mean every number had its
personal story it was really quite
amazing
this person even printed out the website
if something has think used to work at
Google even this is a guy in Switzerland
who has other similar artwork people
started talking about it at conferences
but just just which is quite interesting
there's a guy who's really interested in
pie and so he bought the first numbers
that were available you know for pi
3.14159 and so on yeah lots of people
sent me in their stories there's really
really interesting stories
I usually blog about these so you can
you can read some of them on the website
really interesting stuff some people
bought multiple that's a cute one this
kid was born 2004 2006 2008
this one was at Google for a while
so now to finish this off let me also
point out a couple of related projects
which I find quite interesting because
they sort of go into the same aspect one
is 365 special days from a guy Brad
Brazilian guy
Fernando Luis Lara who lives in the u.s.
teaches in the US I think and it's an
interesting idea he says you know the
year has 365 days everyone has a special
day and any of these days and so he just
draws the day I mean you would submit
your story he would draw it send it to
you and then we will collect that here
on the webpage until you get this really
interesting collection of of drawings
over time you think they're quite cute
for example this one was was a woman I
think yep who said you know April 24 we
married we love sailings but we had some
cloudy cloudy storms but we say through
and now we have three children so this
is his representation this is
interesting because I think it has this
community aspect about it I mean part of
what fascinates me a lot about these
projects is is this community aspect
that you know for example I know there's
780 paintings spread throughout the
world I mean that seems almost
impossible without without the web right
and it's really funny to travel around
the world which I did and to to go visit
the people and see and see the paintings
in their specific locations another one
which is which I find interesting is
place of places so this is the
relatively famous artist in in
Switzerland and Europe and he he signs
these metal or he creates these metal
signs in different colors and then the
idea is you put it up somewhere you sent
him the picture and then you got
this place of places that's when I find
pretty funny and true other ones
illusion crisis pretty interesting
there's another aspect which I find
extremely interesting which is in the
art market I mean by now you know this
project was all about the reflection on
how the people value things especially
things that intrinsically have no worth
right I mean a painting is just canvas
and some color so how do you price that
how does the market work Anthony white
is an Australian artist who whose who
just paints you know a currency and a
value and sells it at face value we've
got four series like a dollar euro pound
he has an Australian dollar and what's
interesting is that you know if you're
interested in one hundred and seventy
pounds you can't just go and buy it you
have to wait until 106 is sold and of
course this guy has to wait until 105 so
he starts with one two three and so you
have to wait until your numbers
available which is which I find quite
intriguing I think he sold about a
thousand so far it's really cute
actually
I went to visit Anthony in Australia and
he's a really interesting guy and so we
thought we should get together a little
bit and do some art together and we
wanted to have a project that sounds
like like a financial institution
because we were it was should all be
about the market right so we we said we
we take our names which is what
financial institutions seem to do for
some reason right there they're called
kleiner and Perkins and whatever
so the idea here would be this would be
the first painting of the series so
again no content except the contract and
we which is pay back that amount if we
get the painting back at that time does
that make sense
well I think it does because the only
the only definition of value I think is
simply what someone else is willing to
pay right I mean that chair if that's
worth $50 you know whatever it's only
worth $50 if there's really someone
willing to pay $50 otherwise it's not
and so how can you know how do you do
that when you when you when you sell a
piece of art I mean it's difficult to
say this you you might sell this later
for that in that amount it's impossible
the only way around this is basically
you have to agree you as the artist have
to define I will I will pay that amount
of money back and so this painting was
really worth a thousand and sixty three
dollars we sold it on eBay for more and
it never came back we sold that for less
that was number two and let's see if
that comebacks
that comes back I hope I hope it comes
back because I really would like to pay
back the money and build up some trust
but also because I really like it and
this was the third so he's coming over
in to San Jose next month it's gonna be
a lot of fun this is the website and
finally let me close with this
which I find really intriguing that's
from Justin guy in New York and he has
this website once for sale and that I
think that's pretty cool
he paints what he wants but not only
that he I mean the painting will be the
price at which you know he can buy what
he paints
so sound complicated so say he wants an
iPhone he paints an iPhone
he will sell the painting for the exact
price as you can buy an iPhone and he
will buy an iPhone so that's a complete
new definition I mean that's I think
that's the best definition of a value
for a painting you can come up with so
recently I went to Vegas sold the flight
to Vegas some good luck
they went really fast money for
blackjack
you know tonight in Vegas money for
craps strangely I don't know what he did
about that you know money for slots all
he can eat money more money I think he
mostly needed money some aspirin it
seemed showgirls and then fly home and
also something I find equally
interesting his needs for sales so not
only does he paint things that he wants
but things that other people need so
here for example there's a charity
called Habitat for Humanity you can
donate say one hundred and fifty dollars
they would buy a door for one hundred
and fifty dollars you know to build up
some some houses or whatever for people
who don't have the money so he would
paint the door you would pay a hundred
and fifty dollars he would get one
hundred and fifty dollars would give
that to Habitat for Humanity which then
pays the door $450 it's really
interesting
all right I think that's about it let me
let me finish this here so I want to
thank Jason and Google for the
invitation people who made this possible
who don't even know that they did for
example as I said this guy Seth gold in
the market guy who blogged about it
Daniel pink from Wired who really pushed
the project to my delight and surprise
and and my wife without whom I think it
would not have been possible so yeah
maybe I'll take a couple of questions
now if you if you if you have any if
you're interested
the night
yeah it sort of does but but I mean
there's nothing you can do about it
right I mean I can't really say you know
this should not mean anything to you I
mean they just do it but it's it's
really it's really intriguing to see why
people bought numbers I mean yeah
absolutely mind-blowing I you know you
have the trivial stories where I'm not
even trivial but trivial in the sense of
technically trivial that somebody would
say hey you know I by 712 because I live
in 712 and other people had like
life-threatening accidents and that
would be the date at which they recover
stuff like that yeah it was really
interesting
no questions usually in Europe people
ask me how much money do you make people
not talk about this here that's good but
technically it's actually quite
interesting because a lot of people were
interested in you know what would be the
maximum amount of money you could make
because if people would start buying the
cheap ones and then the more expensive
ones and so it's actually pretty short
range I not exactly sure how what the
range is but it's pretty small but it's
it's a bit fascinating to me culturally
because I've talked about this a lot
back back in Switzerland and in Europe
in general and their people a lot of
people would be extremely offended by
you know me think or by an artist
actually earning money or even you know
take the money into the art I mean this
was just you know two separate things
that you should never bring together
although of course it happens all the
time but you should you should never
talk about it
so I've always been open-minded about
this I mean everybody can go to the
website and see see how much how much
money I made I I spent all on it I spent
all on taxes material it's extremely
expensive to buy a thousand canvases and
then I was travelling for ten months
last year which is pretty good so yeah I
have nothing left but it's it's it's an
interesting discussion I think
and also some I often hear the question
like is this some kind of a you know who
are you fooling is this some kind of a
joke and and you really mean this or
actually people even think this is not
real you know this doesn't exist
nobody has paintings spit like the
million dollar home page where people
argue that it's actually not real
which I write it could be not real but
um this is real as you saw with the
pictures yeah
yeah
yeah I think there would be so yeah the
question would be if somebody copied it
would that sort of destroy the value or
what would be the difference something I
didn't show here but on the back of
every painting there's actually a
nineteen digit number which I have
created just with an algorithm which is
basically your password right and then
you can go check it on the website so
you can't I mean this is like usually
people give you know certificates
when they sell art and say this is real
but that's easy to fake right so I
wanted to have some sort of password
mechanism so you can't really fake it
unless you you own a number and you know
you know the password you could make a
copy of that but I I think that would
that would probably still not work but
people nobody has really copied it I
think but a lot of people have made some
derivatives let's call it like that
which were awfully similar I mean there
was there was a project which basically
copied the website one-to-one and which
is put initials you know like a a a b a
c the same pricing system everything
exactly the same but yeah I mean if you
I think it's a good sign if you get
people who copy you means you did
something right but I hope it's not it's
not gonna happen here and I also don't
wanna I mean you people usually ask when
you paint a thousand to two thousand now
or you know another color you know no I
will not I mean this would this would
destroy the value of that project right
which is essentially the point
they do so
yeah I hope I mean I have time you know
when I started this I I thought you know
100 paintings in a year would be like
amazing and so I think 10 years should
be fine I was I didn't expect that to
happen and also I think there's this
this is probably the hardest moment now
because I mean the paintings are are
expensive I mean they're not really
expensive but they're more you know
price here that than they were and so
once it you know whenever it will pick
up again at one point you will you will
come to the point where you see it's
really gonna sell out and then I think
it has another effect again I think
that's what you observed a little bit
with the million dollar home page like
in the beginning people are yeah this is
fun and then it sort of stopped and then
when it became clear that this is really
running through to the end everybody
jumped on it but I don't really care I
mean I'm extremely glad how it went and
I'm I'm pretty sure it will do the other
two hundred twenty dollars will go to
its I just don't have a timeline for
that
what so what's next present
yeah I do have another project but it's
pretty preliminary and it's it doesn't
really have much to do with that so it's
more about what really fascinates me is
what you talked about the meaning that
people were giving to this project and I
love the entire community aspect and all
that but when I step back for a moment
and think about it I think I made I made
the project not flexible enough I
defined the prices from the beginning I
defined everything what I really want in
the next project is that the project
itself changes as people as people you
know buy stuff so the content will
essentially depend on when where and why
people buy and not only the content of
the painting that you buy but all future
offspring sort of it like an
evolutionary dynamics into the project
but it's a little bit tricky
from the computational side I mean this
was easy write a little script but um
this is gonna be a little bit more
complicated but I'm that's that's the
aspect that I want to have in the next
project and I want to get it really well
done so I mean I think that was
important I think to a lot of people
when they when I asked them you know
when you saw the project and you liked
it I mean what made you really buy it
and a lot of people said you know this
looked like really well made and you
know good quality and good design it was
not just something that you would do
overnight hack it in and put online so I
think that's something that it's
important so I'll take my time
do you have a question
sorry yes yes but I use I use stencils
and all kinds of technologies so it
looks pretty looks it looks good in the
end
I mean people that's that's another
feedback I think that's even the most
frequent feedback that I get is it
looked better than what I expected
because somehow people expect me taking
a brush and going one to seven whatever
you know but I mean it takes yeah it
takes a long time to to make these
paintings I mean I had to my wife helped
me a lot and we had to take like four or
five months off when we had this you
know boeing-boeing phase just just do
all the paintings so yeah they're all
