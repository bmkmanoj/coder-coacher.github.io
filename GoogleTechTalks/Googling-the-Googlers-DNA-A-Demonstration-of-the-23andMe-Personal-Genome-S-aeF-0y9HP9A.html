the introduction so I won't be talking
about any of the genome stuff so first
of all who today is going to try this
fits the spit thing just carry a show a
show of hands and we don't know you
might change your mind after the
presentation as well we're really really
excited to have 23andme here this is
just we think it's going to be a really
fun experiment basically hear more about
the company about their technology and
you know jealous to see what kind of
interest Googlers have and finding a
little bit more about your genetics so
without further ado I want to introduce
Linda AV one of the co-founders from
23andme there's two co-founders right
and then the second one is I think
everybody probably knows is Anne
Wojcicki right there Sergei's white no
conflict of interest this is something
we want to do independent that the
relationship with Sergei okay so so the
end they're going to give a brief well
they'll be a talk this is the tech talk
part and then the spit opportunity and
QA and they'll go through the whole
thing you may have noticed there was
asparagus and some of the cafes today so
hopefully you you ate some of that that
may be part of this as well okay Linda
all right thank you this is working
Thank You Stacy and thank you to google
for having us today we've been talking
about doing this for so long that it's
so great to have it finally happen so
what I'm going to do is just give a
little bit of background about 23 and me
and then go through a little bit about
our personal genome service just to give
you a bit more flavor about what we do I
think we sort of take Google for granted
that you guys all know about us and
we're over off bayshore doing our thing
and I think it's probably a wrong
assumption for you for us to think that
you guys know exactly what we're up to
so we'll go through that in a bit more
detail but Ann and I met I guess over
two years ago and came together with a
lot of the same ideas about why we
wanted to do a company like 23andme and
a lot of it stems from frustration that
we both had with the lack of progress in
using genetics to really improve health
care it's a really long way away
from us being able to go to a doctor
present our genetic information and have
our doctor say okay check check you
should take this drug you shouldn't take
that drug you are allergic to certain
things and you definitely should avoid
certain types of exposures and we really
want to get to that point someday and
everyone talks about personalized
medicine but it's just going to be too
far off we think and so that's why we
wanted to start this company to get
genetic information into the hands of a
lot more people and then get them to
share that information if they're
comfortable with that so that we can get
to a point where we know more about our
genomes so with that oh and then just
really quick I noticed some people are
eating and if you do plan to spit today
you should wait about 30 minutes between
eating and spitting when we were at
World Economic Forum giving a lot of
kids away that wasn't the case and we
ended up with some pretty gross samples
so so just to get started this is a
rendering of the DNA molecule that of
course everyone knows we have coursing
around and coiled up in our cells and
because we're human beings we have 23
pairs of chromosomes typically not
everyone but most people and that's why
we all walk around mostly on two legs
have two arms two ears two eyes and nose
that because our DNA is about ninety
nine point five percent the same but
it's really the these snips as we call
them that make us unique individuals and
this is these are the points or single
nucleotide polymorphisms that that are
unique to us and so what we do as a
company is we measure about 580,000 of
these markers in everyone's genome and
then we are able to take that
information and give you a lot of
context about what do these snips really
mean what information can we learn about
ourselves through studying these snips
so because we use the technologies that
are also used by the research community
and these tools have been in their hands
now for a couple of years we're starting
to see a flood of publications coming
out so there are snips now being found
to be associated with a variety of
diseases and it's a really exciting time
our scientists a lot of them are in the
back are reading up on the literature as
these papers come out and what we do is
we translate the information coming from
these publications and give you this
information specific to your genome so
we do give put the right caveats around
it that this is just new information
it's not clinically validated yet but we
do find that from early reports from our
customers that they want more and more
information so we'll get into that
further here so it's really all about
human diversity that we're interested in
celebrating and exploring and so this is
really our journey together as a
community to really start looking into
what do all of these snips mean so what
can you learn about you when you join up
and become a member of the 23andme
community well for one thing we don't
know if this will happen or not but we
think that you know people obviously
know based on their birthday what their
sign is maybe we could change from a bar
scene to someone asking your sign to
what is your haplogroup and in this case
we're looking at a maternal haplogroup
page that is part of your account when
you sign up and because we've put
mitochondrial markers in the panel that
we create for you this genetic
information includes these markers from
your mitochondria and of course I think
most of you probably know you got your
mitochondria from your mother she got it
from her mother and all the way back to
your maternal line so what we're seeing
on this map is basically where the h3
haplogroup where people with this
haplogroup were living about 500 years
ago so this is my haplogroup assignment
it gives a lot of wealth of information
about this we have stories about these
if you click on these tabs and then
there's a tree of all of the maternal
haplogroup so if you know what other
haplogroups people have you can see how
you relate to them potentially we're
very lucky to have hired joanna mountain
from Stanford who joined us from the
anthropology department at Stanford
she's a population geneticist and she
and her team have been doing an
incredible job of really building out
this information we have write-ups I
think on over 80 haplogroups now so it's
really a phenomenal resource and really
fun to read all of this information
about yourself the other thing you can
see here down in the lower right this
thing isn't quite working are a list of
names and what this is our people that
I'm already sharing my information with
that's another thing with 23 in me is
you're able to share if you choose
certain portions of your genetic
information and we have two levels now
of sharing the first one being the
ability to share it more of a basic
level where you might have a lot of
friends who you find out or also in 23
and me and you might want to compare
your haplogroup versus theirs there's
also extended sharing that I'll show you
later on that gets more into the health
information that you might want to share
with your family members the other thing
we do along this line is we have
paternal haplogroup swear if you're a
man and you have a and you have a Y
chromosome which should be most of you
you can learn through the markers of
your Y chromosome that you got from your
father this same type of information
where your paternal line might have
originated from so we don't just stop
there a lot of ancestry companies focus
on these two components the
mitochondrion the Y chromosome but we
take it to the next level and we just
added a new feature recently that we
call ancestry painting and what this
shows is basically chromosome one at the
top down through chromosome 22 at the
bottom and we're looking at an
african-american man right now and based
on this this view of his genome and the
way it's painted he shows up to be about
sixty four percent European thirty-three
percent African so the indication could
be that he's probably half European and
it could you know one could argue that
this might be what Barack Obama might
look like if we painted his chromosomes
and then you compare this to a woman who
is Native American and you can see in
this case the color orange represents
Asia and she's about eighty-three
percent Asian so again we have
explanations about how we go through
someone's genome and make these
assignments of which chunk should be
colored which way and for people like me
it's unfortunately sort of boring it's
pretty much all European so if you
looked at my chromosome painting it
would be pretty much solid navy blue so
we're always ecstatic when we find
people who have these beautifully mixed
backgrounds and their chromosomes paint
so wonderfully like this so in addition
to looking into your ancestry then as I
mentioned earlier you're able to share
your genome with other people to a
certain extent and in this case what
we're showing our two siblings who've
been compared to each other so these are
siblings who have shared their accounts
and these are actually part of
demo family that we have if you just
want to set up a demo account you don't
want to sign up yourself you're able to
do that now and look through the eyes of
the Mendel family at their genomes and
it's a real family but we've just
changed their names to protect the
innocent but in this case we're
comparing Aaron and Ian Mendel who are
definitely siblings and you can see that
now in their genomes the way they
compare the dark parts here are where
they're a hundred percent similar the
light blue parts are where they're half
similar and then we're there you see the
white gaps here that's where they're not
similar at all so even between two
siblings you can see where they look
like they are very similar so then the
other thing we allow you to do is click
on certain clusters of genes and in this
case we've clicked on the immune system
compatibility which shows up on
chromosome 6 and that's what these red
arrows are pointing at and in this case
these two this brother and sister look
like there are a hundred percent similar
in their part of their genome that
dictates their immune systems we don't
know that this there would be utility in
this information yet of whether they
could be donors for each other but it
does raise a provocative question and we
will continue to pursue this to see if
that is indeed the case so if you click
on other parts of this bitter tasting
that will point to different parts of
the genome that you would be able to see
do I have the same taste as a sibling or
not so it's actually a lot of fun I've
done my entire family including my three
other siblings my parents and my kids
and it's just been a really interesting
time to look at all of our genomes
together so beyond this then the other
area of course that we get a lot of
questions is you know what does this
mean for me in my health and we when we
launched last November we had our
scientists had gone through the
literature and found about 14 really
solid genetic associations that we wrote
up in the form of these gene journals I
don't know how well you can see this but
this is a printout basically of
different phenotypes or diseases or
characteristics that we know some of
something about the genetics and when we
first started out we had 14 that were
what we considered established research
which is this category you see here with
four stars so you can see some of them
within this alphabetical list right now
but the early response we got from our
customers as they wanted way more
information so we sort of opened up what
we were willing to share back with our
customers based on genetic associations
that didn't quite meet the criteria for
established research so we created the
second category called preliminary
research and the way we differentiate
all of these different publications
coming out has a lot to do with the
study sighs of course a lot of this is
all about statistical power and if you
have a very small population that you've
been looking at a particular trait you
may not have a lot of confidence in what
you're finding and so our scientists go
through this process of deciding which
category this should go into and then
how many stars it should get so for
example avoidance of errors only has one
star but because of the phenotype of
course people are very interested in
that I know Sergey had a lot of problems
with this particular one but it's it
shows up in the New York Times because
the people are so journalists find this
stuff intriguing so they want to write
about it so we feel like it's our way to
to give you a little bit more
information about this particular study
to say yeah it's interesting but it only
gets one star and anecdotally we've
already heard our customers saying oh
that's a one star I'm not going to pay
attention to that one so that's exactly
the idea that we want to start educating
people about what does all this mean and
how seriously should you really take it
so I'm just going to dive into one of
these in particular because type 2
diabetes is just such a problem globally
we have a gene journal written about
this so the way we organize the
information is we give background
information about the disease there's a
lot of of tabs that you can click on to
get more information information about
the the disease the timeline for when
and it's fascinating to read about these
some of these diseases have been
characterized back from I think the
1600s or even earlier so it's it's just
kind of interesting to know that people
back then we're dealing with some of
these same problems we have an MDS
perspective for some of these where if a
doctor was confronted with a patient who
had printed out information from their
gene journal how should a doctor react
to that and in some cases what we do is
we just work with a physician who also
has a very good understanding of
genetics and they might do research they
might have a clinic and a lab md PhD is
often and so they are able to write
to another doctor to a colleague to say
look this is really early information
there's not a lot we can do about that
but that's okay to tell the patients
that that they should know this is early
research so then the other thing we do
then and what we're doing because we're
logged in right now as Greg Mendell
we're looking at his data and right now
we have a pretty good understanding of
nine genes that are associated with type
2 diabetes these have been studied in
large populations they've been validated
and replicated in other populations so
we're feeling that these nine genes are
going to stand the test of time that
they are going to continue to be known
to be associated with type 2 diabetes
the different colors represent the
versions of the genes that Greg has so
in his case he's got seven of the nine
that show up with the green coloring
which means his versions of these genes
don't increase his risk versus the two
that do which show up as red so we try
to make these visualizations pretty easy
for people to interpret but if you want
to dive into more information if you
click on each one of these boxes it
gives you information about the gene
references to the publication's where
the studies were you know where they
found these associations so we really
let people dive in as much as they want
about the information behind it so
taking all of this into account then
what we do is we can give you an odds
calculator based on these genes and
their there's a lot more work to be done
as far as really knowing how do these
genes work in concert we don't know if
they act independently or if some of
them are in the same pathways so there's
a lot more to be learned about these
particular genes but in Greg's case as
you can see his risk now based a
compared to average is about 5.6 out of
100 versus an average of nine point four
out of 100 the thing to keep in mind is
that you do have to assume some things
in this case a European ancestry if
you're from India these data may not
apply to you so you need to remember
that a lot of studies are done in up in
European populations and that's
something that we really want to try to
address and I'll get to that later on in
the presentation about wanting to open
up research studies into other
populations do you have a question
it's somewhat arbitrary your games are
just people water database yeah well it
has to do with the haplotype structure
that you have in your genome and that
has been it has sort of migrated over
time so that certain clusters of people
like Europeans have similar haplotype
structure and people of Asian ancestry
also the more information we get about
distinct populations the more we'll be
able to fine-tune these these data
points but right now we just don't
studies aren't really conducted in
unless you're from Iceland where there
are you know there are studies going on
in that very isolated population but
there are some assumptions that we have
to make but in like I'm saying this is
all beginning it's all in the early
stages and hopefully we'll be able to
dive deeper into specific populations
with as we get more people enrolled
question in the back gather information
about no medical conditions of
make that available in an anonymous form
to be sure to researchers yeah that's a
great question and I'll get into that
further in maybe if I just get through
the presentation and then well but yeah
we definitely plan to do that so really
quick then just finishing up with oh the
other point I want to make is that with
type 2 diabetes and it's only about
twenty six percent genetic so your
environment obviously hasn't a much
bigger impact on whether or not you're
going to get this disease so that's the
other thing to keep in mind that we all
know we should work out and eat well and
all of that but we are finding that some
of our early customers who have found
out that they look at like they're at
higher risk for type 2 diabetes have
indeed taken that information into
account and even though they are in
really good shape they're really keeping
a better eye on their diet and how
they're taking care of themselves so we
take that as a really good sign that
people can use this information in a
very positive way so the way we've built
23andme is that we take security of our
customers data to the highest degree and
I think I'm speaking to the choir here
that you guys are very much of the same
mind and all of our systems have been
built to protect the information for
instance we keep your genetic
information completely separate from
what we call your personal information
which is if you order online you'll give
us your credit card and your address
those are kept in completely separate
databases and I think we have a couple
of Engineers here if you wanted to get
more information about this we'd be
happy to go through that specifically we
have a privacy policy online and one of
our lead engineers is probably one of
the most paranoid people in a very good
way that I've ever met and he is you
know he himself said you know I'm not
going to do this service until I know
that we have a privacy policy in place
and so we felt like he's the perfect guy
to really be leading up all of the
security and privacy of our systems so
we just feel like we wouldn't have a
solid company and we couldn't gain the
trust of our customers unless we built
this in the right way so why did we do
this now so when Anna and I met a couple
years ago we felt like the Stars had
really aligned in such a way that it
made sense to to try to bring personal
genetics to the world and one of that
had one of the factors had to do with
the cost of genotyping
affymetrix is a company down the road
Illumina's in San Diego they've created
these genotyping arrays where the cost
has dropped phenomenally over even the
last five years what we're doing today
probably would have cost almost a half a
million dollars even five or seven years
ago so now for a thousand dollars you're
able to get 580,000 data points which
gives you a really good coverage of your
genome and that's why the researchers
are using these tools now in what they
call the genome-wide Association studies
so we felt like you know a thousand
dollars is still a fair amount of money
you guys are getting a great deal today
at 499 and we'll have information about
how you can go about ordering the
service if you want to do it here today
the other thing that we do then in
addition to working with the research
arrays is alumina is the platform we've
chosen because they give us the ability
to develop a custom set of markers in
addition to the research markers that we
have and what we've looked what we
decided we wanted to include are things
like drug interaction jeans because we
really want to start collecting
information to the question in the back
we want to find out what drugs people
have taken that have worked for them
drugs that they've taken that haven't
worked for them are you allergic to
certain antibiotics all of that wealth
of information that people have that
even their doctor may not know about
them I know my doctors don't know that
I'm allergic well it's in my record
somewhere but every time I go in they
say what are you allergic to they don't
seem to really have a good system for
keeping track of all this information
whereas now it will be in one place and
then we'll hopefully be able to do
research studies if we get enough people
who say I get a stomach ache when I take
advil we will have all of the genes well
covered that that influence how your
body reacts to a drug some people can do
really well in on advil and some people
get horrible stomach aches and we want
to know why that is so the other thing
we have coverage as I mentioned before
is the ancestry genes we also have
really good coverage of genes that have
been known to be associated with
different types of cancer and then the
HLA region as well which is really an
interesting part of the genome for
immune base diseases and then of course
especially Google is aware of what's
going on in the whole next-generation
sequencing space so we're very excited
and keeping a close eye on how that
field is moving forward and we're very
excited to transit
our service to whole genome sequencing
at some point but we think it's still
far too early for that and we're talking
with a lot of these sequencing companies
to see who's going to win this this
grand horse race that's going on right
now and then the other great news is
that Gina which is the Genetic
Information non-discrimination Act has
now finally passed both the House and
the Senate and our wonderful present
president has promised to sign it it
might be one of the last great things he
does in his presidency so we're really
thrilled that this after 12 or 13 years
is finally getting to a point where it
will be against the law for a company to
discriminate against you based on your
genetics or for a health insurance
company so that was one of the big
hurdles that we felt was holding people
back from really wanting to get access
to their own genetic information and so
now hopefully this will give security or
give people a better feeling about that
so one of the other reasons that we felt
like the timing was right for launching
23andme is really based on what we're
seeing happening and it's it's really in
younger generations but people who are
now willing to share information on the
web through things like Facebook YouTube
MySpace all of these websites that allow
people to really share their information
and this is the phenomenon that we want
to tap into now and so within the next
couple of months you'll see new features
through our service that will let you
fill out surveys so we're going to have
a variety of surveys that will put out
and by answering the information in
those this is how we'll be able to start
collecting information to give us the
ability to do our own genome-wide
Association studies we're going to be
announcing some partnerships very soon
in specific disease areas where we're
going to go out and recruit people to
come into 23andme so that we can start
these studies very proactively so in
addition to the web two point oh we're
starting to see this now in the
healthcare space with companies like
PatientsLikeMe and thermo patients like
me is a social network for people with
specific diseases they started out with
Lou Gehrig's or ALS and have now
branched I think into about four or five
other disease areas but it allows people
to share their information online in a
very open and public way about the
progression of their disease and it's
proving to be a really successful model
and then sermo is a way for doctors to
share information with each other there
was I saw their CEO give a talk where
there was a picture of a finger with a
little saw through it or something and
that he put posted the picture up on
sermo and another doctor came through
with an idea of just to cut I forget
what some piece of plastic that you put
in to pull the blade out I mean it was
just gross but that wasn't the solution
came through sermo of how to treat this
person's finger so it really is
fascinating to see this phenomenon
happening and what's interesting is what
they tell us at sermo is that the
doctors that they're finding signing up
are not necessarily the young Doc's
coming out of medical school but it's
doctors and practices in the Midwest who
are really isolated and on their own and
now suddenly they can use the web to
really open up their practice and open
up their experience level so that they
have access to far more information
which we think is phenomenal so this
leads then to are branching out into
this new field of what we're calling
research to point 0 because now we're
taking these elements together the
technologies to do the genotyping and
the web and enabling people to share
information about their health so that
we can start doing these studies we will
collaborate with researchers but we
really find that the the bioinformatics
capability that we have at 23andme will
be something that the research community
will find very useful there are not many
researchers that you talked to really
know how to write algorithms and do
these queries of databases to come to
answers to questions they have about a
disease they're studying so that's the
expertise will have in-house and then
we'll go to researchers and say look we
have 10,000 people in our database who
have Parkinson's disease what kind of
questions would you want to ask of them
and so we can help or get help divining
the surveys as well as help on what kind
of questions should we be asking of the
data and then hopefully be publishing
our own results in the not-too-distant
future so this concept really is what we
call 23 and we and we are very excited
about this opportunity and will be as I
said putting out some press releases
about how we're going to very
proactively start down this path
so finally the other thing that you guys
might have been reading about or some of
the questions coming up from the state
of New York and the state of California
about this whole new field of personal
genetics and so we're constantly in
discussions with all of the stakeholders
in this in this new brave new world that
we're in and you know there's the
acronym of LC which is the ethyl legal
and social implications of this and so
we do take this very seriously and we're
very engaged with these different
departments of health and the federal
government about how do we regulate the
space in a meaningful and positive way
but don't stop the innovation because
that is something that if the
regulator's put to form of a hand on
this we feel like it could stop it in
its tracks but there have been
publications out that say that the
genomes out of the bottle and it's
happening and we fully agree with that
so but for today we've decided it's
we're going to take a little bit
different approach to LC and this is now
going to be the Eric Larry Syria
investigations so so we're excited now
to do the next part of the presentation
and Anne is going to join me here we
have to switch computers so we'll need
just a second to do this
but
if you're in the comments
so we've been very fortunate to have the
the pleasure of actually having access
to Sergei Larry and Eric's genomes and
they were actually so kind enough to
entrust us to say we can investigate
them thoroughly and actually present
them to you so because your legal team
wanted to do a legal review I've had to
give you the PG version of what we could
have actually presented there were there
were some there were some really great
photos I was going to use but but I
really want to have a good relationship
with Eric so so so yes so so what we've
done is we've just kind of taken
interesting little tidbits from the
account anyone who wants to come up and
play with the account more and see how
we got to these things you're more than
welcome to but I think a lot of you who
are sitting on the chairs you can see
that you had a one page and we're really
going to make this interactive and make
this actually as a survey to see how
well you know your your fearless leaders
so one of one of your fearless leaders
came from doggerel and and we want to
know how many of you actually know where
doggerel and used to be it's a very
educated crowd so I actually didn't know
this either yet but it's it's it turns
out that's actually England over there
on the left and France below but they're
actually used to be the English Channel
used to be blocked by this land and so
let's guess Sergei how many people think
Sergei came from this area Larry and
Eric oh you're wrong
it was Larry okay you saw the chromosome
painting so 22 of the individuals came
back very blue absolutely no diversity
but one person actually had a little bit
of Asian so let's do it again Sergey
Larry and how about Eric oh you're right
looks like Thomas Jefferson wants to
join your board so so someone in this
group actually shares their haplogroup
with Thomas Jefferson the paternal
haplogroup actually yet with Thomas
Jefferson so again we'll do it Sergey
Larry and Eric oh I won't even give you
a clue this time do they look similar
what feature is most similar so we know
brussel sprouts are very popular in this
crowd so we actually have one of our
gene journals is about bitter tasting
and it makes sets you know some people
absolutely love things like Brussels
sprouts and some people really don't so
someone in this crowd is less sensitive
to bitter tastes and therefore might
love Brussels sprouts so let's do it
again Sergei Larry or Eric I don't see
either Eric or Larry voting looks like
eric i actually was going to try to make
the little Brussels spouts into the
balls that are all over here but not
that talented so I know that this is
also very athletic group so if you had
to choose either Sergei Larry or Eric
this is not from burning man if you had
to choose either Sergei Larry or Eric to
be on your sprinting team who would want
Sergei who would want Larry and who
would want Eric
why oh and it turns out Larry actually
larry was very impressive Larry is
homozygous for the fast twitching so
this is a gene journal that we have
which is associated with vast twitching
muscle and Larry actually is homozygous
I mean he has two copies of it and Eric
I'm sorry you don't have any but you
could still be a really great
long-distance runner oh so Eric actually
was so oh well so don't challenge them
to any endurance sports yes you're
learning that so this this this one I I
i personally feel this one should be
really obvious one of your
one of your fearless leaders is not
sensitive to sweaty odors okay let's
let's let's guess Sergei
Larry and Eric so so who refuses to
change out of their biking close sorry
sorry I did this post so willingly so I
know that there's a lot of meetings I
have this problem some time at home
sometimes I say things and there's
absolutely no memory so you have a
meeting who is most likely to actually
remember what you said in that meeting
this again is from a gene journal
article its preliminary research its
early stages still but there might be
some some ideas that you have so Sergei
I concur with you Larry and Eric oh very
good Eric I heard that something you say
a lot I also i could only find very
serious pictures of you online but
you're always looking like you're
listening it's good so I know that
there's a lot of dairy in here I've
always been very jealous of your
it'sit's we actually want a special
order to but who you know there's one of
your leaders who cannot actually process
dairy who's if you see actually eating
and it sets you should clamp down so
Sergei Larry and Eric not a lot of
voters here seems like you don't know
they must all eat a lot of ice cream so
Sergei has actually been complaining
about this at home that he's you know
lactose intolerant but it turns out that
he actually he is so now I have to give
him a little credibility
so last as some of you so some of you
might have noticed we have we actually a
lot of us here to have the t-shirts
about the peeing and and this gets a
little bit into the research two point O
concept that Linda was talking about is
that there's some of these really basic
questions that we don't know the answers
to so we don't we know there's there's
great thought thinking that this is a
genetic trait but we actually don't know
somehow no one has ever gotten an NIH
grant to study this but but this is a
project that 23andme wants to take on
and one of your fearless board members
art Levinson from genetic from genentech
was also very interested in this area so
you can see that over time this is an
area we might actually start asking you
questions about so I haven't gotten
confirmation from Eric actually on this
but i do remember asking once before and
I don't think I got the traditional like
what are you talking about response so
so let's ask the question now Sergey
Larry and Eric oh and they actually all
can so again this is one of those great
areas we've had a few priceless moments
where we start talking about it and
people stare at us like why are you
asking me about my pee so again this
gets into the 23 and weak concept it's
something that it's a fun example of it
but we really are you know Linda and I
have been you know criticized for being
a little bit too idealist but we really
think that we can change the world with
something like 23 and we and we think
that this is just an example of
something that everybody in this room
can relate to where we don't know it's
such a basic concept but we don't know
and questions like this you know even
starting to get this information from
people and the information from you you
know what drugs have you taken what are
you most interested in what have you had
adverse events for we really think that
we can change healthcare and we're
personally very vested in this I want it
changed in five years it just it's it's
we've had we've spent you know I've
spent a decade in at linda's spent 20
years in this it has to change and
that's all what we're about so I think
we'll open it up now for questions we
also have a very educated team of
scientists
and engineers here so as we need you
guys will just call you up so I've heard
that a lot of the potential for
variation but among humans is actually
in copy number variation and not only in
snips do you've any plans for looking
towards that in the future yeah this
thing on um yeah we're definitely
looking to win sweet on part of what we
can do with the snips that were
collecting the information on you can
actually start looking at copy number
variations so one of our scientists is
starting to look at those analyses and
if we do find that within the data sets
we're generating for our customers that
we can start reporting back copy number
variation findings we will do definitely
do that but there are new array designs
that take into account more copy number
they have the ability to measure copy
number more directly than through snips
but it's it's definitely a very
interesting area and we're starting to
see publications coming out thanks
how often do you change what would you
look for
the same which juice
so we were genotyping people right now
on a standard array 550,000 snips plus a
custom panel of 30,000 and right now
where we feel it's a really robust tool
that should be useful for a long time so
that's the platform that we're using as
new research comes out which is weekly
we update our site so right now we've
been on you know a bi-monthly schedule
with there's new articles or there's new
information that's coming out we're
updating it continuously so you get
580,000 data points not all of them can
we guarantee are going to match with the
research but a very good percentage of
them will so at some point you know we
definitely like when there was a was
talking about at some point we
definitely want to go down the path of
full sequencing it's a questionably do
we have the mic yeah hi um where do you
stand on data portability with regards
to my sequence information Oh as far as
you being able to take your information
or I'm sorry yes yeah so you can
download your file right off the website
so that we have a a place where you just
click and says download your data so you
get your full data set unfortunately
some early customers thought that meant
where that's where they got their data
and they'd end up with this big file
that they had downloaded so we're making
it more clear that that's where you
actually get this string of A's geez T's
and C's but yeah you absolutely can get
it but it'd be great for people who I
mean again this is an engine crowd we
realized there's a lot of creative
things people can do with it so any of
you who want to download your data and
and create interesting programs with it
you're more than welcome question over
here okay so as you discover new things
I mean is that somebody figures out that
oh look at that this gene means you're
going to fall over dead in three years
will you be sent you know sending out
alerts to people like by the way
have this chief
yes we will do google type alerts yeah
it's you know that's one of the things
too that we find that people before they
get their data are a little hesitant and
a little trepidatious about it but then
once they get their data they realize
this is so many shades of grey and
especially the the research that's
coming out now is mostly an multigenic
disease which typically also has an
environmental component so even with all
of the genes that gets tacked up that
are known to be associated your overall
risk profile in a lot of cases
oftentimes doesn't change all that much
so this does is not definitive data that
that will give you that black and white
of information one of the things that we
often compare it to is cholesterol so
you know you might find out that if you
have high cholesterol it's a risk marker
for heart disease but it's not going to
tell you you're not going to get a
Google Alert if you have high
cholesterol that you're going to die of
a heart attack so we might find that
there becomes a marker that's associated
with something and we will update that
with for you so earlier in the
presentation you mentioned that I think
like several years ago seven years ago
this sort of process might have cost
like a million dollars or something for
a person's that right so if it's now a
thousand dollars what are you expected
to be in five years and the reason I'm
wondering this is you know with the 23
and we concept I mean that's that sounds
fascinating and if you can get this down
to a price point we're really just you
know it's it's free or ten bucks for a
person then I expect that kinds of will
really take off we're pushing in that
direction I mean I think that's one of
the great things about 23 and me and the
other companies that are out there is
that we're all creating more demand and
we're all asking for lower pricing and
when the problems when there was only
one company is that there was not
competition and the other thing is
though that will switch to full getting
more information so that what we're
doing right now will absolutely drop and
so in the future we may be able to offer
what we have now at a very low price but
we think that people are going to want
to get their full genome which then
might be a thousand dollars so there
there there is a lot more opportunity to
get more data to see question right here
okay the keys in my hand yeah you
haven't discussed anything about error
rates and I keep thinking of the movie
Brazil and so what's they like what's
the probability I feel like one single
site being you know I flipped wrong or
doing any other data or measure yeah and
the the one great thing about the
genotyping arrays is they've been shown
to be very reproducible and the accuracy
of the data is very high and that that's
another reason that we felt like it was
a good time to be giving people their
own information because we have very
high confidence in the genotype calls
that are made but that said it is you
know there is an error rate and people
need to keep in mind that these arrays
aren't being designed right now as a
diagnostic tool so in the future we may
build in a lot more redundancy so that
even if you have a failure in a snip
call if we're calling it many times over
we'll be able to take that into account
so it is it's a really good point and
but that you know we on most of these
arrays the the the concordance with
other platforms and those sorts of
things about 99% so it's very high
yep so I have a question by the way
thank you for coming I have a question
about a HIPAA and research first it
seems pretty clear that HIPAA is
obsolete it's also it's also been
detrimental for getting research data so
what I was wondering is basically on the
research side what what are you doing to
sort of standardized data formats and
data entry types and on the HIPAA side
where do you think where do you see
things going given that this I mean it's
completely falls outside of it and just
yeah just what do you view is where
should where should things be in terms
of health privacy yeah so right now we
are not we do not need to be HIPAA
compliant we you know again we take the
data security because we recognize that
there's some people who are not worried
about their privacy and some people are
very worried about it so we we really
want to give people that choice and we
do everything we can to protect the data
and really give people options about it
that said I think you bring up really
good points that there's not a lot of
standardization here if we are working
with a research group you know we need
to comply with their you know the data
security policies with that but you know
but again people are signing a 23 Emmy
consent form and we see a lot of
researchers who you know for right or
wrong actually see us as a way around
some of these systems and actually are
very excited you know oh this is a whole
new way of potentially doing research
because these individuals have consented
they threw the 23 me process we can now
then tie in researchers may be more than
yeah and it's um it's something that
we're actually really excited about what
Google Health is doing because that you
know I think having a big company like
Google and i have to say Microsoft
taking on the challenge of getting
information out of emrs and into P hrs
will really enable a lot better
collection of the phenotypic information
that we may need for studies so that
that's something that you know we talked
to Ronnie in the group about what
they're doing and it's it's just really
exciting when someday we'll be able to
merge a person's health record with
their genetic information you talked
about how your company is a very careful
about security and you also talked about
the Gina act being pass it passed
nevertheless one can imagine some people
might be on
herbal about the service have you
thought about a way from many people to
use the service anonymously at first
maybe join the social features later on
as they become more comfortable yeah you
know we actually we were working with
Brad Templeton early on at eff and and
and he was very you know he was
advocating exactly this point you know
had someone just come and totally
anonymously have no records you know pay
by paypal or I don't know if Google
Checkout would work with this but um you
know and it's something one of the
things that we've realized is that the
majority of people signing up are not
that tight like most those people
actually want to connect to other people
and they want to share and the sharing
part has been so compelling so you can
sign up for an account and you do not
have to share with anybody so it's only
because we've opted to share with people
and we give you that option we give you
the option to never be contacted and to
never be searchable so so right now
we're trying to we're trying to do as
much as we can within sort of the realm
of real reality of who's likely to be
signing up even for the service question
over there um so i have i've seen a lot
of absolute numbers on these slides and
like some of them for example like
twenty six percent chance for diabetes
single and that doesn't mean anything if
i don't understand the exact definition
of how that is defined so i think it
would be way more interesting to see if
i choose some population out of your
database how much more of a chance do I
have than those people maybe my friends
or you know just the people that I
select white people whatever you know
somebody I think that would be a way
more interesting because and that also
avoids that people misunderstand the
numbers right yeah it's really complex
information that we're trying to get
across to people and even that number
twenty-six percent you know some
diseases when you look through the gene
journals the range was anywhere from 20
to eighty percent you know we don't even
really understand what the genetic
component is and so as we get more
people in the database though we would
like to be able to share back with you
how you stack up against people in 23
and me so we definitely have plans to
start doing those sorts of things but it
just we're at the very beginning
okay how do you see people working with
their doctors with this information that
they have I'm picturing people are going
to want to use all this information they
get and I'm picturing people marching
into their doctors offices saying i'm
twenty-three percent predisposed for
this and 66 predisposed to that so when
people when all this raw information is
in the hands of the patients but all the
knowledge of what to do with it is in
the hands of the doctors do you see that
causing a problem in the same way that
like all the prescription drug
commercials are causing that sort of
problem how is that going to work yeah I
think people are definitely going to
walk into their doctors offices with
this information and so a big component
of what we want to do is educate
everybody that's you know anyone who's
interested in learning about this to
this new field of personal genetics
we're really encouraging doctors to sign
up because I think if they have their
own information it's a really great
great way for them to get educated so
that if a patient walks in and says hey
doc I've got my genes your own report
here they can say oh yeah I have one of
those too it's really about everybody
having information at the personal level
that we think will push people in the
right direction of learning about it but
it's it's it's going to be a process but
if we waited for the medical community
to become educated about this it would
really we just think it would be a
hundred years from now
hi I wanted to ask in terms of the
service the discount you're giving us
great but I wanted to see will there be
a subscription service following on like
a monthly fee because it sounds like you
do follow up and contact you're going to
add more features as you learn so I was
just curious about price right right now
we do not have a subscription fee so
it's 999 for you know getting access to
your information and at least a basic
level so what you've seen now is what we
really consider the basic level and that
you should always get access to that
there might potentially be you know we
talked about copy number variation it's
always possible that there could be
other services that we offer that are an
additional fee but right now you will
always be entitled to a basic level of
your service hi I noticed she did the
haplogroup distribution based on 500
years ago and I'm curious if you are
also going to since these are very
ancient concepts can you see ancestry
going beyond 500 years oh yeah in fact
the tall guy in the very back Chris if
you could find him if you want to talk
to him about that he came he came with
joanna from stanford wave chris that'd
be a great question to ask him but we
definitely want to build out more
information going all the way back and
that that tree actually I didn't show
you that but the the haplogroup tree
really shows it going all the way back
to Washington on the Hat on the maternal
side the mother of all mothers in
African on the father's side the father
of all fathers so Chris would be a great
guy though to talk to about that hi
thanks for coming i hope you do really
well have you thought about what's going
to happen to your data if you go to
business or if there's a hostile
boardroom take over from somewhere up
north
we we actually have thought about a lot
of those things you know and again we
recognize that we have really sensitive
information from an individual and we
need to be really responsible with that
so a couple things if in the unfortunate
circumstance we went on a business you
could either get a downloaded copy of
your data and we would just end up
deleting everything or in the
unfortunate circumstance if there was
some kind of hostile takeover you know
we have you know we would give people
that option of deleting their data so
again it's one of those things that will
always be transparent we've tried to
protect similar to some of the things
that Google has done we've tried to
protect against against any kind of
hostile takeover so it's actually one of
the reasons why we do not have any vc's
on the board we only have Esther Dyson
and us Linda and I control the majority
of the company so it's it's one of those
things we've structured the company in
such a way because we personally are so
vested in this and we really want to
change healthcare that we're not into
this for maximizing we want the company
to extremely well and we want to be
profitable but fundamentally the bigger
picture of changing the world with
changing healthcare is what drives us
can you talk about the law enforcement
landscape for a bit so what companies
like yours be go to resources
perspective scans of crime evidence that
sort of thing you know I think what are
our policy and our you know how we look
at our customers data is that it belongs
to our customers and we're just really
the caretakers of that information and
we will protect it tooth and nail and I
think maybe similar to how Google
responded to requests for going through
data we will be responding in the same
way that unless they're borrowing
something that we can't avoid we will
not allow that kind of thing to happen I
think one of our guiding principles is
that fundamentally there's no business
if we can't protect your data um so you
talk about you know walking into the
doctor's office with you know huge stack
of report are you going to be able to
filter things like you know just show me
the part that has to do with heart
disease related stuff for etc yeah you
know on gene journal now we have a
search function so you could type in
something like heart disease if you
wanted to we recognize that gene journal
gene journals going to go through a lot
of evolution over the next nine months
and one of the things that we recognize
people want the data served up in
different ways and it might be that you
only want to see where you really are an
outlier in terms of from from the
average so there's a lot of those things
that it's exactly what we're working
with and again Andrew and Aaron who have
been leading up a lot of the gene
journal write ups they're back there you
can go to the gene journal table but
there's a lot that we're hoping to
redesign because we want to be able to
allow people to look fine data in
whatever way they're interested in
looking at it so unfortunately I think
we need to to stop the Q&amp;amp;A portion but
we're going to be here so if you have
questions we're happy to take any that
you have and again there's a lot of 23
and mirrors in the back the other thing
we wanted to mention is that you can
order as many kits today as you like at
this price so we're not limiting the
number of kits if you want to get them
from family members friends whatever
please feel free to do that so thank you
so much this has been really fun</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
