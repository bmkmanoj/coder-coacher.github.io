in the process that so last year it took
us I don't know a few days to get the
videos up on YouTube we actually have
some of them up already i'm just not
going to tell you where they are yet
yeah i work for a search company so i
can find them but we are we are going to
be posting them a lot faster i think i
think this year and when we announce
when we announce next year's gtech
you'll find out why and let's see the
android app so that the total damage
that you all did on our our little
android app was 7 bugs total we took all
the bug reports they came in through
Twitter and lots of duplicates I hate
duplicate bugs and we fix six of them
see if you can find the one we miss you
can go to gtech got biz and download it
again if you'd like no more prizes man
come on you guys have completely sapped
me of pens and everything else when the
way we people have been asking a few
questions like how many presentations do
you get we get presentation proposals
numbering well into the hundreds we pop
them in a spreadsheet and we get a whole
bunch of Googlers to you know watch the
videos go through the slides comment and
we we sort through all this and try to
figure out how do we get good speakers
you know the best the best around and
this next talk of all the external ones
that came in got the most votes right
you know from the first time through is
like yes yes we want to hear this we
want to hear this we want to hear this
so I want to hear this I've also heard
Simon Stuart mentioned sauce labs once
in his talk and Simon you know only
occasionally says stuff that's stupid so
I'm thinking that this is probably going
to be probably going to be a pretty good
one unfortunately it's a it's a start-up
you know and we forgot to tell the guy
you know don't take it too seriously
this is not a formal cut and so he's in
a three-piece suit so you can you've got
to overlook you've got to overlook that
Adam Christian the well-dressed man is
here please welcoming I I really wanted
to wear a three-piece suit but I've done
that at conferences before and
shockingly nobody took me seriously so
this is what I wound up with so i work
at sauce labs this was a complete side
project that I worked on till you know
three four in the morning for a few
months and sort of a hobby but it's
something really do to my heart because
I've been working on crazy testing tools
for quite a while now so I feel really
home here at gtech I this is my first
one I've been to I really didn't know
what to expect and the conversations
that have had with a lot of you been
pretty incredible compared to a lot of
the other conferences I've been to we're
testing is sort of just like this this
side thought this has been really
awesome and sort of reminds me a little
bit of the selenium conference but even
more sort of into deep ideals behind why
we test and how we do it and a lot of
people are so interesting which is
exciting to me I write mostly JavaScript
at sauce labs so I'm a I'm a web
developer turn tester turn back to web
developer and so so this talk it started
out as a raw technology talk and now
it's sort of turned into a technology
and my beliefs on how we should do this
sort of talk so bear with me as I sort
of switch back and forth a little bit of
the history of this whole thing is that
in 2007 we announced the project called
windmill which was a sort of selenium
competitor but all written in Python
everything was test for in Python we
made a lot of decisions so this is how
you have to do it and the one part of
that project that just got so much
pushback was the fact that we made
everybody right there test in Python we
wound up bolting on a whole JavaScript
framework on to that
and at that time I went wow interesting
people really care about this so I guess
what two years ago no jazz appeared and
the first testing related thing with no
Jess I saw was soda from learned booths
no drives browsers and I want wow this
is really interesting because I like to
write everything in JavaScript how so I
played around with that but that was
selenium one and then webdriver comes
out they start talking about things like
mobile and I met Simon and all this
stuff no one this has a lot of steam
this is pretty exciting and then then i
saw jay is dom which is a library for
node which allows you to have
essentially a browser a Dom structure
inside the v8 or on top of next to v8
and how that communication would be
really fast and I thought that is really
cool not actually having a browser there
were things like that but the
performance is starting to look really
incredible so I realized all of a sudden
that if I write a test in JavaScript
each of these different platforms that I
want to deal with I have to write a new
test for each one because they act a
little bit differently and I thought hmm
I should put a layer on top of that and
this all grid of that so the idea was
essentially standing in a shower going
why can't I write one test that works
everywhere and and as I'm working as a
developer I launch browsers like crazy
and I really wanted a super fast way to
launch and interact with browsers from
the command line without really having
to install or run anything on my machine
so the breakdown is the what does my
JavaScript work there and there is all
kinds of places now there's a new
JavaScript platform announced every day
and the beauty is that javascript is
continuing to grow its reach every time
I turn around there's some new
interesting device that has you know a
JavaScript interpreter on because so
many smart people were working on making
that fast and so my conclusion was a
common JavaScript execution API and
you'll you'll see a little bit more
about what that means so this is
actually a totally new thing and I was
thinking with all these awesome new
technologies that are coming out why am
I ever going to need a desktop app I
mean as a developer
you can come up with a lot of reasons
but I think for a lot of people at some
point this is going to be what your
desktop looks like and I really hope
that's the case I think we're moving
that direction I use browsers as apps I
have you know multiple instance of like
five browsers open all the time and
having a lot of instances of the same
browser open they start to act a little
bit weird and they're not really
designed for you to have a whole lot of
instances of them up and obviously we
know that app shouldn't crash each other
so why should browsers crash each other
if I have five windows open and firefox
dies well or chrome dies or Safari dies
I'm really frustrated because the one
problem caused all these other things to
go away which I was in mid-stride was so
I want to have multiple instances all my
browsers so so I that's sort of just a
call to action we need to think about
this is the way we're going and how do
we solve these problems because I don't
want a desktop icon on my an icon on my
desktop for every web app I use we had
another realization which may seem
counter to do because I work for a
company that basically makes its living
off of this but uh clicking and typing
it's brittle and I find it frustrating
there's a web developer I don't I know
how my app works I don't need to pretend
to be user simulating events for
clicking on things I know exactly what
function they're going to call so how
does this fit well jellyfish you could
say it's a standalone nodejs web
framework that does all this crazy stuff
or if you are really concentrated on
webdriver you can say it's a really
simple nice nodejs API for white driving
webdriver and we've seen the web drivers
going all kinds of places so everything
they add I get for free so I got a
little demo for you that sort of
demonstrates a little bit of the mindset
that went into when I was building this
and I call this the browser dance and
this is just sort of a consent
conceptual idea here so I i run a node
script and you see a bunch of Firefox
and so I thought well I can pretty much
manipulate everything about these
instances now on so what I'm actually
doing is I'm using multiple inches of
Firefox windows to spell letters so
that's Jeff for jellyfish and now by
moving them around the screen with
JavaScript i'm going to change it to jas
I now write ridiculous but that's the
thing we can do now which is so cool all
right I'll get a little more serious on
you here so what are people using it for
local browser scripting I like the idea
that i can bring up to Firefox's and log
them both each into different gmail
accounts and do various things I've
actually gotten emails from people
saying well I have you know multiple
Google Apps accounts and I want to be
logged into them in the same browser I
don't understand why I can't do that I
have a I have an jellyfish grip that
brings them both up and it's a pretty
nice experience so people are using this
for running functional tests but a
really other interesting recent use
cases people have been doing their
JavaScript testing Jasmine foo unit
qunit because give this nice
communication between the browser and
the server side and then I said parallel
browser instance testing when I when I
bump up to running more than probably
ten instances of a browser on one
machine really strange things start to
happen so here's kind of the picture i
implemented what I needed at first and I
have a lot of hopes of adding additional
additional stuff here but uh you know
the three big browsers I can talk to
webdriver pretty nicely talk to sauce
labs transparently and then I
implemented zombie j/s which is the
headless you know server side java
implementation of a browser and then i
was looking a little bit at ljs test
also which is conceptually very similar
in pretty cool so I'd like that a driver
for that we all love mobile mobile is
awesome the concept of the
project works just fine with anything
that can run JavaScript so I'll just
show you real quick or webos
don't we love I movie it's so much fun
so I basically just have an emulator and
you can see that I this is video so yeah
so that's the webos emulator and I have
a command line there where I'm talking
directly to the JavaScript on the page
and the internet connections going
pretty slow here but simply I'll tell
you a little bit more about the
architecture but I basically have this
pipe dolly between node and the the
JavaScript running inside the browser
window so I can just sit on my command
line and just run JavaScript the API
lets me run you know JavaScript from a
URL JavaScript from a file then any
local JavaScript that I want to run so
the Android situation get into that here
in a second and then you know equally on
iOS
I'm just writing a little JavaScript
here providing in a call back and then
when that's returned it'll it'll
asynchronously give me some results sir
so you get the idea I really want to
spend a lot of time concentrating on
Android and I've been looking into the
situation and the new android drivers
stuff is pretty cool but it still sub
flow and so recently I've been hacking a
little bit on android x86 because when I
want to run some j/s and Android I want
to do it now you know so if anybody has
ideas on how to make this fast please
come talk to me so how do you use it
it's pretty simple you install nodejs
you type MPM install jellyfish and then
you from the command line can run
jellyfish and then the target all of
these will give you a shell and you can
directly interact with the browser from
there so here's what a really simple
script looks like this is a headless
zombie script the API looks a little get
a little bit familiar because it's
influenced by you know a bunch of
projects that you've probably all used
now I use the built-in assert require a
node which does some pretty nice pretty
nice stuff there so so webdriver when I
started this project I couldn't drive
webdriver from node and so now I've seen
the webdriver jsapi that's pretty cool
stuff but at the time I created a small
project just called w DJ s and it does
the really important parts of webdriver
which is go to a web page execute some
code and kill the browser which is
really to me what matters because I want
everything I do to be in Jas so there's
a lot of different projects on github
sort of now that are focused on driving
webdriver from node but I think this is
really clean and fast and small and if
you just want to run JavaScript I think
you should check it out so the overall
architecture of the project is there's a
super lightweight note HTTP proxy and
this is the only part that I really
don't like but the fact that note is
super super fast the proxy works really
really well and
it is the piece that gives me this sort
of tentacle into the different browsers
when I started the project I tried to
name everything after stuff in the ocean
and now when you read the code it just
seems ridiculous but oh well we've all
done things like that so so there's
environment definition so for each of
the things that I want to run JavaScript
in I just define how to start it on the
system how to stop it and how I run
JavaScript there so the basic API right
now is browser Jas environment JS JS
file or j/s URL which is nice because if
I'm trying to run this on an ssh
connection and i want to run it in
zombie real fastest to make sure my
javascript isn't broken i can put all my
tests in some HTTP location i can run
them with jellyfish on that machine
somebody pointed out in red and said
well why don't you just make jas figure
out what's being passed it and then you
only need one method and that's a pretty
cool idea so working on that should be a
pic you soon so here's their
architecture picture you've got node and
it talks to jellyfish jellyfish either
runs the service directly starts it and
then starts running code directly or
bring supper proxy and points the
browser through the proxy the main
problem is that we're kind of hacking on
the HTTPS implementation which brings us
back to like windmill and selenium one
land but the difference is is that that
stuff is actually coming a lot faster
node and is working pretty nicely so
I'll give you some demos of the stuff
that I've done with this locally which
that was a little bigger there but
you'll see when browsers start flying
around
so I bring up a whole bunch of instances
of Firefox and I'm going to have these
each row and some local javascript and
java script from a remote URL so you can
see it's really really fast it launches
you super quick gets a proxy setup for
each of them individually and especially
when you have something on localhost
it's zooming fast that whole thing took
you know 10 seconds however five
Firefox's is pretty cool but multiple
environments is even cooler so here I'm
launching Firefox Chrome headless and
I'm talking to a webdriver server that's
running locally to do Firefox also so
those are speedy fast web driver is
relatively fast and then I also have
another plug-in where you can do you
know up to 500 or whatever on sauce labs
as well as these so you can get this
really interesting cross section of
running tests from a bunch of different
places all at once
and the last demo here is having many of
each running all in parallel on
different environments a lot of people
say that the sort of perfect place to go
for load testing is to run a ton of
headless as well as normal browsers and
try to get the normal browsers to fail
in the ways that they would under huge
load and this is actually pretty easy to
do that with so you see that all my
local stuff finished obviously then then
webdriver kicks in and starts doing its
thing so what's here try to keep all
this straight in my head and I start to
get dizzy so if you want to build a
jellyfish driver for a new environment
that comes out it's actually really
really simple it's one file that you
drop in to the project and jellyfish
environment target spells jet so
naturally that is a awesome acronym that
I have to use and and you need a way to
evaluate JavaScript so if there's if
there's no way to talk directly to it
you can point the browser in the
environment or the any part of the jas
environment through the HTTP proxy and
then as a requests are made it's going
to automatically start talking to the
server and asking what should I do so
you need a way to start it way to stop
it and a little bit of JavaScript chops
so when I did my first windmill talk in
2007 at PyCon we had spent months
building the same doing all this really
cool stuff and as soon as we're done
with the talk everybody sort of came at
the stage and said why isn't there built
in reporting and I was like I didn't
even think about that so I didn't want
to make that mistake again so we have an
if CouchDB is running locally it creates
automatically a new DB and we start we
store all of the I'd you know the
different content for each of the test
runs and actions in that database so you
can go back through and look at
everything that happened it's a
one-liner you just call a
the doc coughs method in the in the
callback so the future I would like to
get as many environments as possible I
would like to be able to say every
different place that I write code that I
want to use on the front end on the back
end in this environment in that
environment on mobile I want to be able
to write one test that can run in all of
those places so that's a lot of work and
I've had some really great people
contribute on github I've had some
pretty cool patches already for fixing
local proxy stuff and so that's really
encouraging but the plug-in architecture
is really really simple so if you have
any interest in hacking around with it
you should definitely check it out as I
said HTTPS is a project that's being
worked on on both the node side and on
the jellyfish side and I hope to have
that pretty soon and note on Windows has
come a long long way so in the very near
future that was the main group of bugs
that were logged when I first launched
this is please give us a window support
works on mac and linux pretty soon them
and i have something that works with no
DX e which is really super exciting the
main issue there is that I'm windows
obviously browser girls and stuff are a
little bit different on the local system
the browser pass and I would like a way
for you know firing events in navigating
through the browser to automatically
generate some JavaScript code that will
run in all these places and so is having
a conversation here yesterday and Google
bite looks actually pretty cool I
haven't spent a whole lot of time trying
to generate JavaScript from user
interaction usually there's another
layer there where we tried to go to the
Python or whatever with you know like
selenium IDE or builder but i would like
to really i'd really like to get to the
point where I could interest I can
introspect enough to the ast that I
could generate some pretty cool
JavaScript tests from not a whole lot of
work on the user's part and the other
thing is use jellyfish were good so it's
really easy to get a script up it's
really easy to get stuff running in
parallel and of course when I presented
this OS bridge twenty minutes later
somebody was already
tossing the Wi-Fi so you use it for load
testing but in you know a good way it's
it's a great tool for app testing please
use it that way even JavaScript
intermittent analysis sometimes it's
really hard to get a bug to repro and I
can pretty much get them every time if I
run it with you know ten of three
different browsers will happen once and
I and I I do that frequently to fix
things on the sauce website and also you
know go ahead and use it to upvote your
pictures on various services I know
we're all looking for a way to do that
so back to the point of the whole thing
is I literally want us to be able to run
JavaScript everywhere and making that
easy and happen whether you do with this
tool whether you do it with webdriver
whether you do with whatever you're
doing of it we should all keep in mind
that like we're dealing with one common
platform here there should be an easy
way for us to know that our code works
there so help me make jellyfish awesome
or you know contribute to the cause and
whatever way you can this is a big part
of the future of our industry and also a
sauce thanks you because we try to get
back to open source and throw meetups
and have fun things happen in the
community and everyone has been so
awesome about it the the Google
promotion of testing which I didn't
notice you know back in two thousand
seven when I was going around the
country trying to talk about how you
should test and people thought I was
crazy all of this attention been given
to it and all of this very professional
seriousness is really really helping so
we need to keep doing this I know of the
massive input from people I don't have
to preach to you guys the testing is
important you're obviously here but
everywhere we go we have to keep that in
mind because it's really important for
our quality and our experience on the
web and as developers and all the
webdriver work is obviously really super
cool that's driven by Simon and you know
we really appreciate all his efforts and
everybody who's contributed to that
I personally really believe in the
automation standards dream when I
started working on browser automation my
first reaction was why isn't this
already a thing built into all the
browsers so seeing that moving along is
really super exciting this isn't
actually a shameless plug it's kind of a
shameless plug but we did a lot of
talking about what documentation should
be like because and browser automation
documentation is this really frustrating
thing it's never quite right it's never
quite intuitive and and even the hello
world's don't really get you up and
running so we built something
conceptually we think is how the doc
should go so so we have a UI that has
the different languages the different
versions of the testing tools and the
different operating systems that you
might want to run those on and this is
how easy we think it should be for you
to get up and running with a test
obviously this is the Python version we
just easy install selenium and then we
have a one liner which downloads you a
test configured and get you up and
running so as selenium tests for sauce
are you know one line different in terms
of the target URL than a selenium tests
you know we'd like to sort of make this
the example of how easy it should be for
you to get up and running because a lot
of people who are qas and moving into
you know QA dev have a really hard time
with it so obviously it's a really super
simple webdriver test but you got to get
started somewhere
there we go so I think we should all
keep that in mind I don't think people
talk enough about documentation we're
all here building these really cool
tools they're very interesting and
complicated but there never is easy to
get started with it you think so I think
everybody needs to keep that in mind so
i zoom through that pretty quick there's
a lot of content there I wanted to make
sure that I got through all my slides
but I'm happy to answer any questions
I'm going to be around for the rest of
the hanging out with my laptop anybody
who wants to come talk to me or whatever
let's do it all of this is up at jelly
do as a sort of splash landing page but
all of the code and all of the wiki docs
that I've written that's all up on
github it's free used and I've got a
Twitter account so I tweet whenever I'm
places doing stuff with that so yeah get
in touch open source do it thanks so
much
alright we have time for a few questions
thanks a lot for a talk I just wanted to
ask you main differences between jelly
and jasmine we use jasmine for jobs yeah
Justin so Jasmine and foo unit and those
frameworks are designed for building
test Suites and sort of constructs for
knowing if your JavaScript unit tests
works assertions and stuff like that on
the client side so they jellyfish
actually works really nicely with those
because I don't try to provide how do
you design the sweet how do you design a
test case those are loaded on the client
side so what people are doing is they're
using jellyfish to you know throughout
whatever route you want to bring up the
browser and to append a script tag to
the page which has your you're Jasmin
test and start that running and
jellyfish axes sort of the
Communications bridge saying is this
done yet give me all the results stick
those in couchdb and the way I like to
think of it is there's going to be lots
of stuff like that people want to do in
the client you want to do you know an
out page coverage analysis you want to
do all this other stuff I want to be
able to run that JavaScript and
everything that I did in that session to
be stored in a DB that I can go look at
so it's not really competing I'm just
wondering what your thoughts are on
coffeescript and dart and sort of the
future of JavaScript interesting
question this is had a lot of heated
conversations about this I think that
JavaScript as a language has has some
work to do ah the way that I want to be
a part of that is by pushing improvement
in the language of JavaScript itself but
i do think for people who are coming
from not a programming background into
sort of a QA engineer roll coffee crib
CoffeeScript is a little bit easier
understand it's a little bit a little
bit less cryptic and its inheritance
model etc so I think
if you were going to bring in a new
group of people and try to train them
into being a test developer CoffeeScript
wouldn't be a problem and that compiles
is garbage into JavaScript and and I
don't have a problem with that I mean I
really want people to be as productive
as possible and so that's sort of my
goal in terms of Dart I don't know that
much enough about it to really throw
darts at it but I was at the JavaScript
conference in Berlin about three weeks
ago and we all kind of stood up and said
this is not something we should be
fighting if we can make the browser
experience better the application
experience better we need to do that so
let's not be negative about this it's
not because traditionally engineers are
very nitpicky about things like this
special when something new comes out and
I think that's something that we should
all do is really try to be positive and
and help all these projects be as mature
as they can any more questions hang on a
second so the question I had was nodejs
jellyfish any plans for remote
capabilities being able to kick off jobs
remotely to load up a web page etc right
so there are some projects happening in
node right now that are for
communicating back and forth between
different machines running node and
ideally my concept would be that I would
like different jellyfish nodes to be
able to talk to each other if I just
installed it on three different machines
I'd like to be able to talk you know
over to that other machine and have it
run 10 zombie tests well while this is
all going and I really want to make that
nice out of the box so I'm spending a
lot of time thinking about how that
should happen but essentially when you
install it on machines you have access
to you should be able to set up some
keys and just communicate within each of
them like it's local so yeah there are
plans to do that I'll keep everybody
posted okay Adam think we've got another
one in the back over here Bonnie
I just want to ask as far as the context
in which the JavaScript that you run is
running is it as far as like the
security model and stuff like that what
are the caveats and what are the sort of
gotcha choose when you got choose when
you run these tests and the sending kind
of goes with with zombie like what's
your experience with zombie as far as
test that maybe run in a browser but
don't run and zombie or stuff like that
yeah so obviously there's there's small
differences in each of the execution
engines and so actually zombie right now
has segfaults every time I push it too
hard that's why I want to get some of
those other projects up for headless but
as long as so I have some code in there
that checks to see if there's a window
object because a lot of you know the
browser depends heavily on the window
object and if there isn't one I can use
Jess Dom to fake one or i can i can at
least not make it fail when it's trying
to access a window object if you're
trying to do a lot of things like firing
events on text boxes and stuff it
depends on that environment but my main
goal is if I have so using the driver I
can flatten it out right I can say if it
has some sort of a dom environment i can
i can make sure that that works enough
with the API so that that test can run
there but sort of going to be an ongoing
thing but this sort of tested I'm
thinking about our more like not exactly
unit test but if I have a blurb of
JavaScript that are like helper
functions and those should run anywhere
in JavaScript land that that's really
what I'm focusing on this other stuff is
just cool and additional so if i was
going to structure how i would build out
a jellyfish test set it would be all of
this sort of basic helper stuff making
sure that their unit tested correctly
maybe some UI stuff with jasmine or foo
unit or something like that and then the
last that would be actually functionally
interacting with the events in the Dom
okay Adam this all think Adam that was
an excellent
