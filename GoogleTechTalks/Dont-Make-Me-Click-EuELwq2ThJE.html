Talk
I'm Irene au I run the user experience
team and I'd like to introduce to you as
of Raskin
I also gave his first talk on the user
interface at age 10 for those of you who
don't know he is Jef raskins son and Jef
raskins one of these you know user
interface gurus that most of us in the
industry know about that
anyway we're in good company so at 17 he
was talking consulting internationally
at 19 he co-authored a physics textbook
because he was too young to buy alcohol
and 21 he started drinking alcohol and
co-founded humanized and two years later
as I founded songs Oh calm it was a it's
a minimalist search music music search
engine that had over a million song
plays during its first week of operation
and after humanized he was sucked into
Mozilla and he's now head of user
experience for Mozilla labs and in
another life he has done Dark Matter
research at both Tokyo University and
the University of Chicago what you don't
know is that he graduated with honors in
math and physics and when not working he
enjoys music playing playing music and
punning so without further ado I'm
pleased to introduce and he's going to
talk about don't make me click
thank you for that uh I'm embarrassed
but um I will say that when I talk I do
pontificate thank you yes okay um that
one's I guess being recorded that's
gonna go on the internet right so don't
make me click so how many people here
actually design interfaces cool how many
people here have never made a website
the same group Wow that's unusual
normally everybody sort of raises their
hand sometimes slowly when they're Geo's
cities people because most people
anytime you make something on the
computer right the human uses you've
made an interface you've designed an
interface so you sort of you need to be
versed in the ideas of what makes an
interface good so I'm here to talk about
don't make me click which is a sort of
play on the they don't make me think by
Steve Krug and well I'll just get into
it so oops see if this is there we go so
since the very beginning of the web
right way back in the primordial soups
of mosaic there's been a fundamental web
tension right on one hand wow this
doesn't work very well there we go on
one hand there are pictures of your pets
and pictures of your children which are
possibly the most boring thing possible
to other people possibly the most
interesting interesting thing possible
to you so in one hand of the fundamental
web tension where your website fits
someplace in between there is boring and
on the other side there's the Taser the
gnome games right
I've tasered that gnome I don't know how
many times in my mortgage rates still
haven't gone down but that's annoying
right so the fundamental web tension is
on the boring versus annoying thing
right your website Falls someplace in
between these two polls right so just a
matter of where so I certainly seen a
lot of boring a lot of very annoying and
someplace in between
oh right as I said I do all my
presentations in in Firefox because I'm
now at Mozilla
and you know we had this idea for the
blink tag so long ago and you everybody
knows what the marquee tag is right
so do you know that you can put the
marquee tag inside of the blink tag yeah
it's pretty cool actually you can put
images in there too and you can put in
the background so your entire background
of your screen can be scrolling right
which is like and the thing that gets me
right is that some engineer probably a
whole group of engineers not only had to
write this but they have to write unit
tests or this right and they spent I'm
sure days weeks like working on making
this just you know so I'm glad that
we've gotten rid of the blink tag more
or less so right in between boring and
annoying that's just right fine and
that's where you get websites which are
actually useful so we're gonna figure
out what what exactly that is and you
sort of you know Google good job there's
Facebook there's the iPod I think
Firefox does a very good job of sort of
getting something which is very useful
but isn't boring per se right people go
there and use it and it isn't annoying
right so there's sort of a move right
now to cinematic user experiences I
don't know if you guys have been sort of
following this or the Pandora thing
where things are zooming around apples
getting very fond of gratuitous zooming
effects and that sort of that's moving a
little George annoying so the thing I'm
most fond of saying is that to the
interface to the user the interface is
the product I think this is really
important and I have a little parable
which I've sort of shortened down about
Digger 2.0 otherwise known as a shovel
and this is the specification right and
so that means there's a lot of time
spent making the shovel which is the you
know back in the thing you invest in die
titanium plated with diamond bits and
then and then you have the UI which is
just the handle and so what you normally
get of course is that when you actually
release your shovel looks like this so
this is sort of funny I guess but the
the weird thing is is that you know most
people especially marketing don't
realize it they think hey you know it's
all about the features not really about
the experience the product so bill
Buxton has an incredibly good example of
this right about the to the user the
interface is the product right and he
takes a picture of a bicycle and he puts
it up he says this is not a very good
advertisement for a bicycle they shows
another picture of bicycle and sort of a
cute pose and says this also isn't this
is slightly better you know it has it
look sort of Pixar ish but it's not a
great marketing tool right people aren't
gonna buy your bicycle just are seeing
this sort of picture and then he shows a
picture of a guy rushing through a
stream water everywhere right mud
everywhere you can't even see the
bicycle but boy do you want it right
that's the interface right the whole
getting on doing it that's the product
has an experience right that's what's
important to the user not the fact that
it has no graphite leaded things on the
inside oh that's important too so we
come to the question of what is the best
interface right we've just seen what a
bad interface for travel is so what's
the best interface and I'm going to be
particularly bold here and say that on
the very next slide I'm going to show
you the best interface not just for a
shovel in fact I'm not going to show you
the best interface for a shovel but for
every product out there right it's a
pretty bold statement so I hope my gear
your memories prime them it's this I I
always am tempted to put a this slide
intentionally left blank but then it
isn't I always think it's sort of a
meadow quandary but this is the best
interface right is no interface if you
don't even realize you're using
something that's great and it's a little
bit ironic where interaction designers
and the point of our job is to get rid
of interaction like when we do our jobs
very very well nobody even knows we were
there sort of like they these are not
the droids you are looking for a style
of interface design but it's true if you
notice the interface that means you're
thinking about the interface and not the
thing you're trying to do so this is the
best interface
so what's better than this oh by the way
so um about the the blank screen
Brendon Laurel whose research designer
and interface research designer no
designer and researcher calls it NFI and
I don't swear normally but I guess I
take this opportunity and she calls it
no interface like that is the
best interface right is it's pretty cool
so what's better than this mat a hole
right if anybody ever invents a shovel
that's just a hole where you want it
please get me one I really wanted but
we'll come back to this right we'll come
back to this
so the point of what I want to talk
about today like the heart of it again
is this don't make me click don't force
me to do things and it's about
interaction seduction it's about us as
designers falling into the trap of
making things go whiz-bang pop having
gizmos and gadgets on your desktop
having to click on things to get
information having icons instead of
words it's about the desire to make
things look fancy right
that is the seduction of interaction
because it looks cool it looks awesome
and if you follow this path what will
you get you'll get those annoying sort
of splash screens everybody remembers
like the flash splash screens that you
like wait wait before you can see the
content please watch as I animate my
title and morph it into somebody else's
name right like this is not useful but
that's where people sort of go right
that's the seduction of interaction sort
of the television style of designing so
this probably looks familiar to some of
you I don't know if you've heard of it
and it's you know it's nice but maybe we
can do better right let's let the
marketers in this needs more interaction
right let's let's follow the interaction
seduction so what does search really do
right we have all this stuff wrapped up
in search we can calculate track flights
track packages search discography find
movies maps restaurants locations stock
finance surgeons there's a couple I'm
missing I'm sure whether I think
although you're not indicating that to
your user right you um you need to sort
of get out there show all this sort of
wealth of information that you have
sitting inside of that box so let's
redesign it a little bit right so now we
have search in there a whole bunch of
times google in there so this is great
for SEO I mean this is beautiful right
and now the user clearly can see the
wealth of information in there but guess
what that's really web 1.0 so let's say
jacks if I right let's use our toolkits
and let's see what we can do
check it out ready I'm pretty proud of
this one
watch yeah thank you right well this is
clearly less usable but you've seen
websites that look like this right right
this is a scary thing I've just tried to
take the worst thing I could possibly
imagine and wrap it up in just a little
bit of interaction seduction and we get
this and people do this all the time
right because you give people a really
easy according in widget they will use
it and people will try to market it
right that's how we got that that silly
Vista thing where you have that sort of
3d rolodex that was them saying we need
interaction we need to do something that
is better than or at least looks as
fancy as expose we can't copy expose so
we're gonna do something interactive and
you get something that's the analogy of
this we analog of this alright but
there's still too much text right let's
let's really give in to that interaction
seduction so here we go I have replaced
on the top your legs with beautiful
iconic LaFave
iconography I can't iconography thank
you and now not only is so a lot of
people say that icons are great because
you know then you don't have to localize
but what you're really getting are
something like this sort of universal
language which is equally unintelligible
across every culture and you know there
are lots of examples were like this in
English means stop and someplace I think
India it means something not so good so
that sort of false even there right
there's lots of dangers here but even
worse just from an interaction
standpoint what does this require well I
don't really know what this glow means
and you I made these and I still can't
remember what they are and now you have
to mouse over them before you see
anything right so what we've done is
we've removed content we've lowered the
density of information on the screen
and this is all part of that sort of
interaction seduction falling into it
all right it's still too boring let's
see what else we can do right I have
this awesome toolkit I can do fun things
and the marketers still want something
cooler one thing with more pizzazz so
check this out okay instead of having
that boring bar along the top and that's
not extensible anyway what happens if
you get like 25 products well we can go
like this yeah exactly
ooh so now to find anything we have to
have to subscribe and we can do our
little searches here and we've got the
marketers paradise right and again this
looks sort of cleaner maybe who knows
but we've all seen sites that look like
this Yahoo right but this is interaction
seduction this is bad
and yet it happens all the time now
actually interestingly not so you see
these this little like widget here
firefox 1.0 had tabs where were you
Apple and woven more and more and more
tabs they would just get smaller and
smaller and smaller and smaller and soon
you couldn't really read them but that
was okay because you'd remember that
your tab was someplace up near one and a
half inches from the left side you had
this sort of mental mapping Firefox 2.0
came around and they introduced these
little buttons on the left and right
side so that as your tabs got smaller
they would stop at some point and then
you could scroll left and right this
meant you never really knew where your
tabs were because they'd always be
hidden off the screen they'd introduced
interaction into their system and it was
bad and in fact you look at the data
people open the same tab many more times
with the new system because it's much
easier to open up a new tab type in the
URL than it is to find the original tab
right so you know you this this looks
sexy and cool and it's animated and you
know that it's a bad idea when you see
like this but when it's just offset just
a little bit into the real world you
know it becomes so easy to fall
to that yeah we'll just add this little
interaction when you always need to be
thinking about hey how can I remove
interaction what's the other way so
actually I started a design competition
and we got something like 160 entries
into it and I'll show you later what one
of the solutions to that tab problem was
that I think is pretty cool so what I
like to say is that this is you know
people call this a are ia or rich
Internet application might I disagree I
really think this is an mi a meaning
it's a materialistic Internet
application I also like to say it's an
mi a because I really wish it was as I'm
missing in action and what we really
want right is the CIA or Zen Internet
application and what's the thing about
then it's act without doing anybody to
use as quicksilver will we'll see this
sort of similarity popping up and I
don't know if you guys know but the
Quicksilver guy Nicolas is here at
Google so you can go seek him out he
doesn't like it though so we want to act
without doing right so that when we come
back here and look at Google and you can
type into that little box and there's so
much functionality hidden in there well
that's really cool this is sort of like
an oasis of interaction right there's
nothing to do it's like you've been
crawling across the desert full of the
Hulk's and like the the rusting
carcasses of web 2.0 companies with
their Ajax frameworks you are like ah
just a text box how nice
well can we simplify google at all can
we try to figure out how to take that
interaction and make it go away anymore
well it's going to be hard to do it for
your actual search box so you could get
rid of I'm feeling lucky that's or like
a cultural icon it's great for April
Fool's jokes but what happens when we
search maybe we can go the other way so
here's here's a search looks nice I like
your your your colors
is there anything we can do here first
let's give in to the interaction
seduction go the other way for a second
here's a little mock-up I did and it uh
you know you you have your like your
related and videos and your you can
search more you get a big nice image
when you hover for detail and oh yeah if
you don't like your search results then
you can you can go to previous or next
not not so good oh I wonder if I'll have
time how long is this talk supposed to
be one hour okay I guess we'll do a
brief aside into random access
interfaces everybody here knows what
random access memory is rather people
that don't make some sort of noise cool
well so there's sort of two ways of
designing interfaces for things like
spell check and search spell check if
you look at how word does it when it's
not doing the little red underline it
sort of pops up a dialog box and moves
you from one misspelled word to the next
to the next to the next right
that's actually not all that nice
because you know if you've ever tried to
spellcheck code you know that it's just
gonna highlight all the ones you don't
want in fact you can't jump over any of
them it's sort of it's it's pulling your
locus of attention with it right and
there's the other kind because you kinds
you have in Gmail where you know it just
highlights the words that are misspelled
you can go through and check them well
this is a difference between sort of a
linear search and random access you can
go anywhere so why do we hate voicemail
so much it's because you can't like your
ears aren't random-access your eyes are
so your ears you're forced to listen to
the whole thing and you can't change
with your ear what you're listening to
with your eyes when you're reading
something you can skip over the parts
you're not interested in so this is the
difference between random access and
linear access interfaces and why this
sort of previous and next is so gross is
because this is linear access right
you're forced to go from one to the next
to the next to the next whereas when you
can just sort of see all the lists you
can you can jump through them anyway the
random aside
all right so Oh back to the hole what
would be better than yours current
search results well if you could just
have the answer there already right you
type it in and actually you guys do this
I was hoping to like fault you for
something but couldn't get there if you
type in weather it will actually just to
drop the weather in right so that's cool
that's actually getting towards the not
giving you search results but actually
giving you the thing that you want in
the first place that's that's the whole
the lower interaction so we'll come back
in just a second to exactly what you
guys can do to reduce interaction on the
Google homepage but first why is
reducing interaction good right it's
because when interaction goes up
information density goes down and when
an information density goes down content
goes down and why are you users at your
site in the first place it's the content
right they're trying they're going there
to do something when I was talking about
that boring versus annoying in that
center that useful bit was because
people were presenting content in ways
that wasn't getting in your way right
that's why people spend so long on
Facebook so your content goes down and
when your content goes down your users
go away this is why reducing interaction
is a good thing because it's
fundamentally getting back to making
your users able to do their product
making your interface invisible yeah not
it's not a good thing that happens
so we want to Xia right for that that
search result so we come here and what's
missing right we come down to the bottom
and now I have to do something I've seen
the ten results and I have to click on
these little links right and they're
actually semantically meaningless they
just mean go someplace further into the
search history right and in fact I
actually have to do something and if I'm
looking for a research result I had seen
before and I know I'd done a search and
was just someplace in there it's really
hard to find most people I'm guessing
here I've had the thing where they've
searched found something they couldn't
find it again but without clicking a
whole bunch they're like was it in seven
was it in four was it in three right so
maybe there's something we can
that's better there maybe we can
simplify it so you know the thing about
Zen interfaces is the just act without
doing and so here's the maxim don't
force users to ask for more content just
give it to them it really couldn't be
simpler than that
hey so here here's an example a number
of years ago I guess it was like two
three years ago now I decided that RSS
was too hard like all those silly
readers with like the lots and lots of
pens on the side and the idea of that
you're reading your RSS is email I
thought it was silly because I don't
care if I've missed a whole bunch I just
want to sort of keep up to date
generally and so I made this as RSS
reader as sort of an example of how you
can design and I was struggling with the
this sort of how do I go back and
history problem and this is now called
the river of news style though it wasn't
named anything back then and the basic
idea is that as you use the site you're
just reading along reading along yeah
you see what's new can't yes the thing
that you see is interesting here you
keep looking back right there's more
more more right now it certainly didn't
load all of this at the beginning it's
just sort of this infinite page I don't
know if you can see this but it will
watch the scrollbar as it gets near the
bottom it's just a little bit more so
about the time this came out I I spent a
while trying to convince your your blog
or people that you might want to to
implement something like this and Google
Reader did something that's very similar
to this but I think can be used in a lot
more places I just wish I'd like
patented before Google readers started
using it actually this is a really old
idea right it's not something like I
reinvented it but it's been used way
back when right in fact one of the most
depressing thing is about interface
design is that it's all been come up
with before everybody know graffiti like
thing to use on a pump Island well that
original Ike if you go back and look at
Mikey I think it was this 1500s I can't
exactly remember where the Spanish
sailors used a shorthand for
communicating and it has something like
an 85 percent overlap with graffiti for
because they're just doing it really
short so it's like nothing you do is new
but that aside a lot of stuff that
people do is really bad so we can
improve it so this just keeps going
right because there's already a semantic
meaning we'd scroll down and that's go
backwards through time right there's
already a semantic meaning if you're
doing slash thought of going down that
means go backwards through time right on
Google it's the scrolling down means
give me things that are less relevant
right and you never have to stop and ask
for more content so what do we see we
see people looking at more and more
things in fact I think on Google there
is like a thing we're at the like the
number of clicks people get per search
result starts out with the first result
getting lots and sort of dips down you
get this sort of tail back at the last
result number ten this gets rid of it
nicely it just actually flattens
everything out so nobody tries to game
the system you get number ten and
actually I spent a while talking - okay
- one second talking to the New York
Times people to see if we could get
something like this on their site and
because right now you know they sort of
they paginate their results so when
you're reading an article you'll get the
first page then the second page and the
third page and the reason why they do
this is twofold one is because that sort
of makes the page load smaller that's
not really a good reason since they're
putting flash in there now and lots of
other big images and - in the real one
is because that way they can get more
add loads but here's the thing if you're
doing this via Ajax you can just load in
a new ad anyway when you get a little
bit further down so I think that's just
a silly reason and the thing is is that
they say a huge drop right the number of
people look at the page one number
people look at page two right because
it's just there's a cognitive break you
have to think about it and what happens
when you implement something like this
it looks like this right you just get as
the article gets more boring people
leave but there's no huge break so you
get a lot more users looking at your
content so they're actually
missing a lot of the business here sorry
so you had a question well here's the
thing we just it's much faster to scan
right you just sort of start scrolling
down you're like oh I remember things
that were near there because that's how
people's brains work like ha that's
where it was that's true I mean then you
have the bar but also you can use insert
in page search right you can just hope
command ctrl F and then start finding it
so it's it's much faster in that sense
and if this were of more advanced system
you'd have things where you could be
like hey put a big star in the
background here so I can have visual
landmarks as I navigated but if we never
got there so oops
sure
so if you've done a search before now
you're back there and you're on the
first plate page and you do control F
but it has to scroll way way down
does it load and find it no it doesn't
but that would be pretty cool that would
be cool
good idea
feel free to implement it so a friend of
mine so I wrote about this and I said I
was going to do this and I did it and
people were complaining about the the
scrollbar bouncing up and down and
moving around and thought that people
wouldn't find this natural and so a
friend of mine Pete pored over a ton
space did this but he used it in a
project and didn't tell anybody who's
doing it and when he stopped taking data
there had been 16,000 people that looked
at his site and only one of them had
noticed and he had blogged about and
said it was awesome and so that's great
right it just it disappeared one of the
scary things is that I was giving a talk
very similar to this at the Ajax
experience a little bit ago as the
keynote and I got to this slide and
somebody raised their hand to me on it's
like yes he said I'm that guy and it was
scary because in that moment I realized
that people from the internet were there
right so when your interaction goes down
your content end-users go up this is
this is cool that's what I'm talking
about with the New York Times so good
interface design you know like sometimes
it's hard to go convince the people
above you that interface design really
matters well when you have when you're
sort of so we have tools like this you
can do that you can go back and say yes
we in fact are going to get more users
looking at the content that you're
spending lots of money making we get
more people looking at the ads if that
one doesn't work right and it's all
about making me don't click so this is
sort of that one mantra that sort of
follows through so what else can scroll
simplify right we have this neat
interaction what else can we use it for
so I talked about the tabs before a guy
named Breck Victor wrote back and it was
a little bit embarrassing for me since
I've been a big fan of saying
everything's just being one long page
and he said well why not just put tabs
in one long big page and he was exactly
right
so here is his solution right you come
down here and you open up a new tab oops
I did it wrong I have to hold down a key
no other key this is by the way running
in a virtual machine because max can't
do fullscreen and I do as I said I've
done everything in Firefox and it also
and I was unable to do it's the only way
that I could actually get Firefox to go
fullscreen is to run Firefox inside of a
virtual machine and full screen that so
any right now all the Winkies are messed
up so anyway right here we go we now
what happened when I opened it up a new
tab it just opened the tab right below
so that's really cool this is sort of
like the coveted read later feature is
funky again you just get all of your
tabs in one long page and once again you
get that great ability of today we'll
just move around between them that great
ability of being able to do control
laugh across everything that's currently
open on your system right it's much
easier to find things you don't actually
have to teach like your grandmother
about a new tabs concept because it's
just there right it's already sort of
obvious it's just below there's now a
physical thought process in like
where your pages are and even better it
solves that whole obnoxious problem of
not having enough space to write out the
the the the tab name across the top
because you're using that space wisely
right so you can actually now just write
everything out so this is pretty smart
normally around here people will ask me
how does this fit with the thing I've
shown before where the page kept in a
longer and longer and longer and that's
a good question
so I don't know I think this is pretty
cool I am actually right now working on
getting an extension to make this happen
in Firefox and see what we can start
doing about getting this out in the real
world because it's just it's such a neat
solution to the problem right it's
clever and it's using something you
already know how to do this is about
reducing interaction so we've actually
gotten rid of a lot of interaction here
that's cool actually the iPhone could
sort of take this example right you
right now have to zoom out like press a
special button to go see your tabs why
can't you just if you go keep going to
the left
why doesn't just show you your other
tabs right there already have this like
awesome physical space and then they
break it in weird ways they could make
it actually much easier to use if they
sort of embraced the fact that they're
working around in a physical space so
take take your take your metaphors and
run with them so that's if you want to
go learn more about his stuff go go
there the other point I want to bring up
is that lowering interaction doesn't
actually have to mean they are making
your site boring right I'm not talking
about just having lots and lots and lots
of text that runs all the way to the
edges of your screen there's other
things you can do so I don't know how
many people have seen this I think it's
pretty cool that's fine Chicago and all
it has is a zoom in and zoom out it has
I mean clearly does less than your
Google Maps but on the other hand it's
much the interface much similar it's
just a zoom in and the zoom out that's
all of
and annoyingly enough you can change the
direction of the of the compass which
rotates which i think is one of the
silliest features i've seen because you
can go like this i hope you all are
enjoying your lunch or were but i think
that's cool right
it's and this is the first example in my
sort of list i think i have three here
of sort of zooming interfaces where it
just uses this analogy of you zoom in
zoom out to get some place like where
can we take that analogy it's very
similar to scrolling but sort of in the
third dimension right can we simplify it
so I lived in Chicago until very very
recently like four or five days ago and
I would always commute from around here
to up there near the near Belmont and I
had used the trip planner on their
website
the CTA website to find my bus or my
train and it told me to take the redline
so I did and it would take me something
like 45 minutes to get there because the
redline was under construction and it
wasn't so great I was also really cold
so I just would get on it and go and try
not to shiver of course here I guess
like the definition of bad weather is
the Sun went behind a cloud for a little
bit I sympathize with you guys
it wasn't until I looked at a paper map
that I realized there was a bus that
went right for my door right to the door
of my work and it took 20 minutes right
and I'd been doing this for the last ten
you know I don't know a month month and
a half so there's something missing
right all that interaction involved in
selecting my destination my my ending it
just it had actually destroyed my
ability to actually find the thing that
I wanted so I was like okay well I can
do better I'm just going to take that
physical map we had and translate it
onto the computer right and I'm trying
to do it in the most dumb way possible
so if I want to go see more of Hyde Park
which is where
Chicago is and I just move my cursor
over and I get to see it zoom sitting
zooms out automatically right and
sexually it's it's quite nice if I want
to come look downtown I just move my
cursor over here I see it
that's where I used to live move outside
it's hard to control from this weird
angle and there we go right just taking
that really simple thing of zoom in zoom
out make it a little bit automatic and I
actually get a map which is much more
useful than the thing that they've
created which if you look at it you have
to like you get a little image and you
have to click up or click down and click
in zoom in and zoom out right it's just
making things less interactive and yet
it's not really a bit boring so what
else can we do in zooming and I'm gonna
come back to this because I'm going to
hold you guys for task 4 for calendar I
don't know who here is responsible for
it but I think you might not want to be
shortly so here here is a way of doing
calendar that uses the same sort of
zooming metaphor right so we can we can
come over here and see like hey here's
March here here's February and I want to
zoom in and see these particular things
you can zoom out by doing this awesome
little gesture here and zoom in by that
and all of a sudden you know I get to
see as many things as I want per day
it's it's sort of cool right and it's
very clear what I want to do when I want
to see more I just zoom out a little bit
right here's 2008 want to see a bit more
as you mad a little bit more
right now if this was a full feature
thing you could see everything and now I
don't need those sort of today next week
you know next year I don't need to click
on those little buttons left and right
in Google Calendar there's like next
year next year next year next year next
year right when I know it's far away I
can just zoom out zoom in it's a very
simple metaphor that has a lot to it and
to get back it's quite fast right so
anything on that calendar in the entire
21st century could be accessed almost
instantaneously as fast as I just did
back to get to the 29th of February of
2008 how cool is that right what I
actually just clicked on the thing I
wanted to zoom in on this by the way is
made by a company called social helix
and they're doing some really neat
things with this sort of zooming stuff
and I should have put it up on a slide
with their with their addresses but it's
social helix comm and they have a whole
bunch of neat features like they have
this sort of like counterclockwise
spiral thing with your with your mouse
which lets you zoom out which I which I
quite like it's works very well on a
tablet PC and zoom in so that's pretty
cool and you know what's even cooler
about it when I make the screen smaller
like to fit on a mobile device guess
what it works just as well actually you
can you can go pretty far in here
not so useful so I don't know I think
taking this sort of really simple
metaphor which I started showing you
with zooming in and zooming out and sort
of exploring where you can go with it
you can get a lot it's not boring but
you've reduced a lot of interaction so
keep this in mind let's see how much
time I have as I sort of continue on
into the into the Google Calendar stuff
so these are Zen internet applications
what aren't cia's and I'm actually going
to use I think my favorite UI insult I
have I have two one of them isn't so
much UI it's just that oh yeah well
you're not Turing complete but my
favorite UI one is your personality is
nothing but a thin veneer over your
underlying implementation how many
people here have ever worked in like
enterprise software at all right so
you'll probably remember seeing that
you're like your interface is a very
small shim over your database right it's
pretty much it's just like they're forms
in your database and then you have forms
in your interface all right this is not
a great way of designing right people do
not think in forms right if I asked one
of you like no you what is your name
what is your birth date where do you
live
you know and you went down this subject
what is your phone number um then you
know that's not a great way of
interacting it's even worse when I like
have to ask you like to talk I know to
talk about your boyfriend or husband or
significant other and talking about him
for I don't know say mm 15 seconds
without mentoring mentioning their
gender or anything that would like
indicate their gender can you do
oh right okay well a lot of our
interface is actually go through this
sort of process of entering forms sort
of making that assumption where you they
won't like know or talk about it's a
very inhumane sort of dehumanizing way
of interacting with people right so I
don't know this this is part of the your
thin your personality is nothing but a
thin veneer over your underlying
implementation and we'll see that you
get to use this right here right this is
not a very good way of entering data now
you guys do do better with your like
quick ad box although there's another
company that does better which is thirty
boxes and I'll come back to that but if
you also stop and think about that sort
of my point of interaction seduction
well there's a lot of interaction that
goes on here a whole bunch and not all
of it most of it in fact is stuff you
don't care about right one of my other
favorite adages in the interface world
is every time you ask the user to make a
decision they don't care about you have
failed as a designer my favorite
favorite example of this is Windows when
you do a search right and the first time
you do a search on your windows box a
dialog box comes up and says hey user
guess what you have to make a choice
would you like check this out
would you like to do a search that is
slow but takes up lots of hard drive
space or or right that's one choice you
can do it wait slow wait sorry slow but
doesn't take a part drive space or you
can make it fast but it will take up
hard drive space so slow but use your
but slow or use your hard drive space
which one choose right now you're like I
am a user I don't care just just work
for me right like don't make me choose
between the worst of two evils because
those are your only choice it's sort of
like when you get those things it's like
would you like to know
restart okay cancel your like cancel do
so right so this is this is bad right
this is a lot of interaction and it
looks just like your database and there
are better ways to represent forms so
the first one actually I think will come
back to this in this yeah so one way
here is that to do almost everything in
30 boxes you type into this little box
right and that's that you can just say
you know the 7:00 p.m. dinner with acj
so that's similar to your guys but you
can do something a lot more you can then
start typing in somebody's email address
and that'll add them into the box right
and then you can you can then share that
event with them and I'm trying to
remember all the other really neat
things you can do inside of here you
know probably if you start typing about
whether it'll or putting in a date will
tell you about the weather it it has a
whole bunch of functionality that's all
wrapped up inside of this little search
box sound familiar
and even so so one of the things that I
think is fundamentally wrong with with
the Google Calendar is besides the whole
having all those little buttons you have
to click back and forth on is that I
type in 7:00 p.m. dinner with AC Jason
it misinterprets me because natural
language processing is hard that's okay
what's not okay is that then to fix that
mistake I have to go through that full
form right I have to not only click on
the event and then click Edit then I get
brought to a new page which brings up
the form this is a lot of interaction
that doesn't need to be there right then
I have to go figure it out it's an
entirely different form of information
than I had before which I just typed it
out why can't I just edit that original
field that I had and it tells me what it
thinks I've typed right that'd be a much
better way of doing it it's just taking
it essentially you're making a tight
feedback loop of what I type in a box
put the computer things I'm doing so I
can fix it right because natural
language processing is in fact hard and
this is all a part of a theme that I
talk a lot about which is natural
language interfaces or natural language
command lines and it's something that if
you go to my site humanize comm you can
see that we we have something which
works across all your applications to
let you do things like you know adding
Maps or
our spell checking or translating to
German in the same way that you disagree
Google thing you type what you want to
find your type what you want to do so
there's a lot to be explored here but in
particular right it's always about
reducing interaction
I guess there's there's one more example
that I'd put in here before I get to
this slide and that is have you guys
seen the BART planner the BART trip
planner the website have you seen the
widget for a dashboard now that I'm on a
Mac I really should have installed it
but I didn't think of that so the trip
planner you have to enter your
information start time drop down list
any time you know drop down list if you
don't know exactly what it's called or
you have no it by a different name you
can't find it if you're new here it's
very difficult to find there's no sort
of spatial reputation there it is pretty
inhumane but it's really easy to code in
forms so what the BART widget does and
this is another thing by Brett Victor is
that it gives you a map with a - and the
from button and you drop it on the ones
you want to go to then it shows you a
list of the the trains that are coming
in and a great sort of Tufte style way
and it's so easy right it feels like
there's nothing there again there's
almost always a better way to represent
a forum whenever you see a forum that's
generally lazy design so we're back here
the fundamental web tension with boring
and annoying we figured out the answer
to this is like looking at content right
the answer to making some is not boring
that's not annoying the answer
making interfaces by focusing on content
and by focusing on content getting rid
of interaction so do not make me click
right why is Google search great it
doesn't make me click why is Google
Calendar bad it makes me click all the
time right it's a really simple metric
to determine how well you're doing so
here's my shameless plug you can come
talk to me and that's it
so feel free to ask questions to badger
me sure the great doc first of all it's
sort of curious about the speech is a
natural way of providing input for
anybody like it's not more natural for
me to see what I want the resident in
scroll through a long list of pages and
find what I actually wanted so why has
it like speech actually evolved as a one
of the natural ways of impotency
divining was user interaction around
speech so let me see if I can understand
what you said you're saying that speech
isn't a good form of input or that you
don't find that natural it's very very
natural but it's very don't see a lot of
innovation around it even certainly and
I think it's because two things one it's
hard and your technology is getting
better and the speed is getting better
and two it's because people sort of lose
their head when they start thinking
about speech as a form of interface and
they immediately jump to speech is a
good form of input and output but we
know that speech because it's early
speech as output because it's not random
access isn't good but whatever reason
people like to combine those two and
they sort of go that way and so all
those attempts before to have speech
based interfaces use it for something
that's good at but also something it's
really bad at and nobody seems to like
realize that just input would be great
right and then having output on a visual
display that would work wonderfully and
that's actually one of the things that
we've been playing around with that you
can type and as soon as you have sort of
a I can type to do something it makes a
lot of sense to then have a I can say
something to do the exact same thing and
so I guess I guess that's the answer to
your question sure one of the sort of
tenets that were ingrained with is their
recognition is easier than recall right
and that seems to be a direct
contradiction to the idea of a command
line type of interface and you know you
listed what you can type into the Google
search box and said well maybe I missed
a couple what can you do with 30 boxes
you know you sort of you can think of
them all offhand that's right so the
ones you do know and if you take the
time to learn you can fly through it
right but if you come into it fresh and
you don't know what you can do you don't
know if you're using 90% of the features
or 1% you just don't you don't know what
you don't know to paraphrase or the
right rate leaders know that's this
great point and definitely deserves to
be talked about so I guess there are
three answers and we'll see if I can
remember all three by the time I've been
talking one is that word right has you
know what the top ten requests aren't
sorry at the top what is this statistic
ninety percent of the requested features
for word our features that are already
in word which says something which says
that this problem even if you're going
the full-blown graphical route with
visual minders is not easy but also says
that perhaps the way we do our graphical
reminders right now are not very good so
that's that's number one number two is
that when you do is the sort of the myth
of designing for beginner and expert is
that most people think like you need to
have one interface for a beginner and
one interface for expert and they sort
of like gooeys are for beginners command
lines are for experts but I think that's
that's sort of false right that if you
design really well then you can have the
same interface for beginner or for
expert so in the case of Google or 30
boxes like your beginner won't use all
those features but they'll still be
using the same interface and as they
learn in a linear fashion how to do one
thing at a time then they become experts
in the system but there's no like
there's no distinction between I'm using
a menu and I'm using a keyboard shortcut
right it's the exact same interface so
which is to say that there will be a
linear learning process for an interface
of that functionality and the last one
to answer your question quite direct
is that you need to take advantage of
recall sorry uh Wow my brain is dry
recognition recognition thank you
and so you have to give people hints as
they use the system I wish I had and so
running right now so you could see it
going but you need to do things like
autosuggest so as you start typing spell
check SP it'll list all the command
names that have to do with SP like spell
check right and as you start typing
along well in the 30 boxes calendar
there we go as you type long in the 30
boxes they do do things or they'll give
you hints Oh like you might want to do
this thing now and it doesn't get in
your way it's not like clipped was like
I see you're making a law cat let me
help you write this one instead is just
sort of tacit ambient help as you go
long so you need to take advantage of
both of those so I guess the part answer
is one is that yes there will be a
learning curve and nobody will or
somebody won't know everything at the
beginning but - that's okay because you
can sort of step them along one thing at
a time and there's always just one thing
they have to learn not a whole new
mechanism excuse me you make it seem so
easy
in my experience maybe I'm just stupid
when it comes to graphics design it's
really hard to just implement all those
very sensible suggestions you're making
I'm wondering if there's there isn't
something you can do by providing
libraries or toolkits because the
existing toolkits all sort of emulate
the bad way of doing things that's
unfortunately right and something I
don't know exactly how to solve because
we have this sort of cycle we saw it on
the web right where originally we were
doing our desktop stuff and we had these
very large very powerful tool kits that
may doing this thing you'd already done
very easy right we had this sort of what
I call the the toolkit straitjacket and
then we hit the web and all of a sudden
we didn't have powerful tools
to make website so we saw hoping to
people trying to do all sorts of new
things because it was as hard to make
something new as it was to make
something that they'd seen before so
people felt that they had the Liberty to
make it this is why we see that there
are great interfaces in games because
they have the Liberty to make new
interfaces and to do the thing they want
because it's just as hard they have to
code it from scratch anyway and sort of
my answer is is yes we need better
toolkits yes we need widget libraries
like jQuery which makes doing things
easy but a lot of this in the real world
comes down to realizing that you have to
do a lot of your UI development really
far upstream that if you wait till the
end to try to do visual design if you're
not doing it during requirements
gathering you're as a product is just
not going to happen so unfortunately the
answer is no it's not easy at the moment
it really takes work and it really takes
dedication but I think the rewards are
clear and they they pay off well and if
you do it upstream enough it becomes
possible to do to get a good designer
involved really early on one who doesn't
just choose color blue so none I wish
there is a silver bullet but but there
isn't hopefully I mean actually the web
is great because it really does make
making all these things much faster and
it's much easier to do all the kind of
stuff I have been here on the web and
not in the desktop world so we're better
than we used to be so on the theme of
reducing interaction so on the search
box when I'm looking for an answer to a
question whether you're in Mountain View
today I totally agree with you right
provide answer and write a link which
gives you the answer but what about
exploratory tours like traveling to
London and I have so many different
things I want to look for I want to look
for tickets I want to look for a hotel
things to do and even one of those like
things to do maybe museums it might be
London Eye it might be right so forth
right there's a hierarchy of things and
I want all of them it's not like at this
point should one so so what
I think they're actually two sort of
fundamental modes to interacting right
there's searching and then there's
browsing searching is I know exactly
what I was that I want right so if I was
redesigning sort of the Expedia of the
world I'd be like well I just want a
search box and type I'm going from here
to there
on such a day search done right I don't
want to interact grousing is different
browsing means I don't really know what
it is I want to do it's in that case
you're gonna be using lots of visuals or
lots of sort of more interactive things
being like hey well we buy interactive I
mean not lots of clicking but a lot more
sort of processing of information to get
to where you want to be so I mean
ideally I guess the thing you'd want to
do is to have somebody to say like
here's your itinerary what don't you
like about it but it's it's that's not
gonna happen and there are two choices
right you could have a placard page of
it okay here are things to do and here's
information about tickets information or
hotels blah blah like six different
boxes in there sure you have like six
lines did you mean you wanted to look
for things to do what did you mean you
wanted to buy tickets that's right
either of those neither of those seemed
very optimal it's not right so I don't
know I think that's that's exactly right
so you're gonna have to design for those
two different things you're gonna get
two different looking interfaces - comma
date them just like you get a well
essentially the difference between
moving around in that zooming space and
just typing to find where I want it to
be
hi I have a question about scrolling
versus clicking so I totally see your
point about offering content when it
comes to maybe content that could be
interesting that says health content
specifically and you're offering
specific say you have a fire you use
Firefox or use IE whatever other browser
i say user for example i would i don't
care if you know what is the content
about IE
if i use firefox right so i can see the
advantage of using a link there so you
know do you use IE click here go to the
ID information rather than scrolling
through the whole page you know and read
the whole information what's what's your
take on that
um well to one you should auto detect
that anyway but abstracting from your
particulars in general i think it's
better to have it all in one page anyway
so you can you can find it faster right
to have all of those questions
highlighted so you can use control f and
then do clever hiding like just have
people if you want to draw people into a
tune what are they called an anchor
right to that part of the page like
putting in from em either there's always
a tension between hiding information to
make it easier I mean that's what
Wizards do but everybody just hits next
next next next anyway
versus giving people information
overload and a lot of that is sort of
intensive information architecture and
figuring it out so it's I don't know if
there is like an answer I can just be
like this is the answer but I generally
find that people skew far too much
towards the you have to click to go
someplace rather than the I'm gonna give
you enough information on one page and
so I that's more of the point that in
this interface design it's always a
exercise of of compromise but there's
that skew so I don't know if that makes
sense
I have a question about the the control
F issue you're talking about that a lot
as an answer that people can just use
the control F but I don't think my
grandparents know that that exists or
would ever possibly learn that that
exists I don't think my dad knows that
exists I mean other than kind of in this
industry and we're not sure how people
how you expect people to find that and
use that as an alternative to scrolling
sure so I guess I would put it two ways
one I think that's a failure of the
browsers right like we need to do a
better job of getting people to use and
to make it easier to find ways of doing
in page search because it's such a
powerful tool the other thing I guess I
say I had in my mind a second ago is
that just because it isn't like visible
or obvious right people talking in this
world a lot about affordances right has
to be visually there otherwise people
will will miss it yes
well I to take one really simple example
the iPhone people sort of hailed it as
this awesome bit of innovation which is
incredibly intuitive ie familiar that
nobody knows that everybody knows how to
use instinctively you pick it up and use
it but that's not really true nobody
would pick it up and do this sort of
pinch thing that's not a natural thing
why does everybody know to do that why
does it feel familiar it's because guess
what they spent millions and millions
and millions of dollars running
advertisements strong people doing this
so that by the time you got one of
course you knew how to do this
so remember when they're testing the
mouse originally they sat somebody down
in front of the mouse this is a story
that my father would tell me they set
some down in front of the mouse they've
been using she'd been using the command
line for four years at that point and
after its use it right didn't say
anything this did the thing you do in
interface design which is you sit back
and you try really hard not to tell you
your user that they're dumb as they
can't use your interface and so what did
you do she first she picked up the mouse
and tried to move it around right and
that didn't work then she flipped it
over it's like oh hey look it's a ball
all
I'll roll it of course it had
disconnected from its sensor so that
didn't work she tried putting it on the
screen that didn't work she even did the
Scottie things you like hello computer
that didn't work right and she gave up
she's like I can't use this then all it
took was somebody moving the mouse a
little bit for her and then she could
use it right so perhaps what we need to
be doing in the browser side is a little
bit of outreach right when you'd be
doing that Apple thing doing that thing
that games do where we have tutorials
right that lead you through like this is
how you do things I think that's the
answer that search is such a fundamental
thing preaching to the choir is such a
fundamental thing that perhaps we need
to be teaching people how to do that in
the page and that's a worthwhile thing
to do and I can I can add something to
this please yeah I remember from the
human interface book Jeff describes the
computer called cat or something like
that in which to search something you
just press a key on the keyboard and
then start to type in what you need to
search so it's like kind of incremental
search implemented that's exactly right
and so he's right if I had my way if
Jeff had had his way this sort of that
search would be the intrinsic thing for
getting around on the computer would be
a fundamental action right it was pretty
cool right like if you do test it takes
3.5 seconds to move your cursor to a
screen like to a character on the screen
and click and go there right with
something like this incremental search
what he called leap you just hold them
key type where you want to go so we want
to go to the V and over you type V he
and it'll be there
that takes 1.5 seconds that's for
on-screen so if you multiply that
actually by the amount of time you saved
by the number of people or per hour
times the number of hours in a day times
the number of people in the US and then
you calculate the average cost of
employing those people for that time
just by saving that little bit of time
which gets multiplied so much that would
save the US if you fixed it more money
than spam cost us right now right
because it's such a fundamental action
so I think that's a really good point
thank you for reminding me that
we're smart about it and we made search
into a fundamental thing then we don't
have that problem anymore just really
quick since you brought up Jeff I when I
when I when I was coming here I hadn't
read the synopsis and didn't know who
you were and then you I saw your name
was like oh Raskin what if that's Jeff's
son and sure enough I looked you up on
Wikipedia and he he spoke here in this
very room almost four years ago so it's
really neat seeing you up here you're a
brilliant speaker and did a great job
thank you yeah it's it's a thing before
like when I was young I got carried like
most kids got carried around in a
stroller I got carried around in the
original Macintosh carry case so I was
like not really a choice sort of like my
destiny to do something like this I
