we have a zero ask in here with us today
as a tech talk speaker maze has done a
lot of thinking in the field of
human-computer interaction and I've
heard him speak in the past and thought
it was quite inspiring as far as
thinking about new and innovative user
interfaces so we're really glad to have
him here at Google today and please
welcome ISA oh hello so I guess started
a small software company humanized to
bring some of the ideas of my father jef
raskin person who I guess started the
Macintosh project at Apple actually out
into the world so I try to strike a
balance between thinking far into the
future and actually like doing pragmatic
steps of what makes better interfaces
palatable to people now so I hope you
all have had the opportunity to not
follow the instructions on the screen
most people have trouble with it that's
ok Google people probably can't fall
instructions anyway um but I mean this
brings up a point because I don't think
people here actually had a choice in not
following the instructions up here and
it's not because you're bad at all
instructions but just because there are
some things that your fundamental about
the way people work that are taught
illogically true that are the same
whether you no matter what language you
speak no matter what context you're
working in which are true and when
you're designing interface you have to
take those into an account so I wanted
to tell a really brief story about how I
got into doing actual interface design
um and the it's not your fault story so
like you have to remember i was i was
born into a family we're thinking about
interface design was truly essentially I
was brainwashed from the youngest age um
I think I learned to program were really
young age that's actually the millionth
Macintosh right there that I was playing
with that's what that little plaque says
I mean I was carried around inside of
the like Macintosh luggable case instead
of most people have strollers I was
cared around in that so there was no
help but for me it was my destiny to
become a geek to become a nerd like it
was just written in stone which is fine
but this is actually a problem because
in interface design well this is what
would happen I try to help Jeff or my
mom or grandmother use the computer and
they'd want to know how to print and for
me it was simple i could think the way
that engineer's thought our programmers
thought and go ahead and do all sorts of
manipulations hit controlled p left
elbow and work and I get really
frustrated at them for not be able to do
the same thing it's simple why can't
they do it well he was around I think
maybe middle school or high school when
it finally dawned on me that I was
thinking about it the wrong way it
shouldn't be that I should get
frustrated the computer i should be
getting or at
the person i should get agitated at the
computer so if people are having trouble
using it it's the computer that's at
fault so that's that's sort of the
rallying cry behind humanizes that it's
not your fault so how can we go about
making sure that the computer works the
way that people do well so Jeff spent a
lot of time after working on the Mac you
always look back at the mac as sort of a
a nice first step but never enough and
he went into the cannon cat and after
that he worked on his book think main
interface for a while to figure out why
the interface is he designed he's sort
of good into it actually worked well he
wanted to change that sort of
wishy-washy guru ism of interface design
into an engineering discipline where you
could have numbers so a lot of this
stuff is done up in cosmetics the most
people here know that yes no okay so
cognetti X quite simply is what
ergonomics is to the human body
Cosmetics is to the human mind so it
tells you things like I don't know how
many things can you hold in your
short-term memory seven plus or minus
two if you click a button how fast you
have to have something happen so the
user doesn't click again 250
milliseconds can you actually multitask
no you end up doing tasks switching and
you lose time in between so it's these
sorts of things which cosmetics helps
you understand and when you're designing
an interface they sort of give you a
very good base for making computers
which are humane that is computers which
are cognizant of our needs and help us
with our frailties so actually I mean
how many people here design interfaces
okay a good amount um-hum how many
people here know about say GoM's
modeling know roughly the same that's
the first people okay this one for here
should probably be really good how many
people can do logarithm base too yeah
more how many people know how to
calculate say information entropy
I really like this place um okay so
there's this wonderful tool that
actually Jeff helped come up with it is
called information efficiency of an
interface and you can actually calculate
given the number of bits required input
over a number of bits required output to
figure out how well your interface does
on a grand scale which is even better
than GoM's modeling which only tells you
how fast is going to be so there anyway
the point is that they're all these
really cool tools out there that many of
the interface designers aren't aware of
for instance just one simple thing that
comes up is habituation people habituate
that means we get habits and it's a good
thing right that means we can walk and
chew gum at the same time or at least
most people can i'm not sure if i can um
and it's just how we work but if you
take that as a precept then when you're
designing interfaces you won't make some
common mistakes and one of the most
common mistakes out there is the are you
sure dialog boxes because what will
happen is that people will habituate to
them they will get in the habit of
always clicking yes or always cooking
down whichever way they choose Lily do
it so I mean how many people in here had
that unfortunate experience of closing a
document it says are you sure you want
to do this you click yes and the split
second after you're like oh it's not
what I meant to do right but we knew
that that was going to happen because
people have bitch away so I mean I don't
really mean to point fingers on google
calendar
google mail does this absolutely
wonderful thing when when you delete
something it says oh you can undo just
puts it along the top calendar doesn't
do that so I mean just knowing these
things help you avoid those those sort
of standard pitfalls that have been kept
around by social momentum so you know
one rule that you can come up with is
never use a warning when you mean undo
so that was my those might like
introduction into interface design is
that it's not your fault if you have a
trouble with an interface if it loses
your work it's not your fault it's the
computers fault you need to think about
how to make the computer better but
we've made a lot of progress right
that's what computers look like back in
1977 with the z rock star and you can
chart the progress all the way up to two
thousand seven thirty years you can see
the immense amount of change that's
happened why is this why haven't things
changed I'm going to make the argument
that there we have something called the
toolkit straitjacket people generally
take the path of least resistance when
you have to sit down and come up with a
new product or come from the new
interface you want to get it done fast
your manager wants to get it done fast
so even if you have a great idea saying
aha this will make it so much better to
use if it's easier to do it some other
way you'll end up doing that because it
takes less time and less money it's
already proven and so what's happened I
think is that very early on programmers
like making these abstract tools that
make doing what they do much easier and
they made these so we have these amazing
GUI tool kits that make prototyping
things really fast but they also make
everything the same some mount of
consistency is good but you cannot be
better without being different and so
there's a lot of power and toolkits but
there is also a lot of danger there in
particular I think right now we've seen
a lot of innovation on the web a lot of
great new interfaces one of my favorites
is that
you know the ubiquitous search which I'm
clearly talking to the right audience
and even better is that gmail has
finally integrated with their chat so
because what is chatting but just an
email without a subject line so these
are great but we are now seeing these
toolkits start forming Yui you guys have
a toolkit dojo has a toolkit and making
things is becoming easier and easier and
easier making windows in the standard
GUI paradigm is becoming easier and easy
easier and people fall back on these
they don't they stop innovating because
they say ah this is probably already
solved may not be the best solution but
I can just use it let's go so this is
just a warning that if we don't want to
get stuck with what we had before and if
we you have to be very careful about
your tool kits you always have to make
sure that you have the freedom to move
forward it's a it's a very difficult
line to walk yet another absolutely
great caption so I just want to talk a
little bit about interfaces and their
importance I said a shovel this is the
important part of the shovel this is
your algorithm this is your this has you
know like carbide blade with diamond
encrusted titanium this is the most
important part this where you spend
hundreds of millions of dollars doing
your your research into an RD and this
is the interface of the shuffle this
part yeah you wait till the very end of
your development cycle to do and you
know you don't spend too much money on
it you just slap a nice color blue so
this is the interface that you come up
with you end up with a shovel which
although it has the latest technology
isn't actually all that usable this is
ten much of designing with say starting
with a chip and saying I'm going to
design a computer around this chip which
is what people used to do for the idea
that you should start with the computer
and design alright start with a person
and design around them
and here's Microsoft solution um you
know mousepad wireless into an antenna
oh oh yeah that's that's the shovel okay
but this is amusing right but it's
actually Microsoft it's not all
microsoft's fault um and i'll get back
to that so just as a mantra Jeff was
very fond of saying this to the user the
interface is the product again google
has done very well at this so the
general way to start is by making sure
that you keep simple things simple um
Einstein I think said you should strive
to make everything as simple as possible
without going any further I really don't
know what that means but it certainly
sounds nice um so here we go my favorite
example the analog versus digital watch
to illustrate just how bad the digital
watch is why were I think it was Douglas
Adams that talked about how pleased we
all were for having digital watches but
we shouldn't be here I went to the Timex
website to get the manual for the for
the digital watch and this is what it
was went all the way from top to bottom
simple right you should be able to
describe that over the phone there
should be no reason why somebody has a
problem using that watch until you look
at the exact same manual before the
analog watch
so whenever I'm designing an interface I
often like to start with the manual
because if you start with the manual and
you realize that you're having trouble
describing how your system is going to
work that probably means your users
going to have trouble using that system
and again why if it's so much easier to
use an analog watch why do digital
watches still have such a bad interface
because of social momentum because
that's the way it was done that's why
it's easy that's the way that's cheap
it's just four buttons those are the
toolkits you have and coming with
something better really takes work okay
so some other things that aren't simple
cell phones I mean they're a long way to
go it used to be that taking a picture
on a cell phone was a laborious process
where you have to go through digging
through many menus for if you get to the
right thing you click a button that
you'd have to save it before you got
another picture so normally the thing
you're trying to take a picture of had
long gone just sort of left you're
taking doing a portrait the person get
fed up with you cameras had this great
invention they're called a shutter
button it took a long time for shutter
buttons to make it to cell phones and
there are many similar things on the
cell phone which should be migrated out
of this sort of morass of menus but
because it's so easy to make menus
people just keep putting new features in
your under a deadline you just put it
someplace and you don't think about the
overall cohesive experience some other
than simple things that aren't um again
not to point fingers at anything google
calendar is this you guys have a great
feature which is that quick add I think
30 boxes also has it where you type what
you want to add to your calendar and it
goes really great because you don't have
to think about the mental model that the
programmer had but after you've done
that quick add you can't access it in
that way anymore that information that
you inputted goes into this form that
looks much like everything else and
editing that is actually pretty annoying
if you watch people try to use it they
get sort of confused they click around
it's not at all as
of transparent as just entering a
sentence and generally when you find
yourself putting things into forms
you're putting things into a that are
easy for the computer to understand
really easy to make but not necessarily
the best for humans so there's a great
paper by a bread Victor so I recommend
people read but he went through the
exercise of redesigning the bart quick
planner and this is what it looked like
before where you choose from to the date
you're leaving you hit submit if you
didn't know where you're going to or
from you'd click the view system app
bring you to an extra page bring you
back it's sort of like the standard HTML
model for doing these things really easy
to program but not so nice to actually
use and he said well what information do
you really need well you need to know
when your train is coming so you have
these you um this is the present this is
the past and you can't really see it but
it's grayed out so you can with a very
quick glance tell when your train is
coming and this map was even nicer it
actually zooms so as you drag the two
and the from around it'll zoom out if
you're getting near the edge zoom in so
you only see the the minimum amount of
information that you need and it just it
works wonderfully there's none of this
like choosing from to is this where I
wanted to go to it just works um I mean
this takes a lot of design inspiration
from from Tufte because there's a huge
amount of density of information here
and if you were to go back and look at
old books or whatnot you'd find a
presentation of information that looked
a lot more like this so why do we
constantly get interfaces to look that
or that look like Google Calendar
because it's so easy to make it's a trap
that we shouldn't fall into just because
it's easy doesn't actually mean that
it's usable so don't don't stop thinking
other simple things that aren't so
Google again has a wonderful spell check
and their Google who will talk or in
there
google mail gmail but you don't have a
spell check in the subject line so you
have to copy it from there into the main
body and back again or move it someplace
now it's it's not it's it's a burden to
me have to program that everywhere you
want to use it so it programmer is often
abstract away and you'll have some sort
of class and you can apply it to that
area if you guys saw the need but that's
not really an extensible system that
means you have to think every time you
want to text box where somebody could
possibly want to spell check you need to
put it there a program has to put it
there shouldn't there be another way a
way which we can sort of somehow now
we'll be presenting this in a bit
somehow take functionality and move it
outside the realm of one particular
place where the programmer says it has
to be here and somehow move it to more
globally so that if you need a spell
check some text it's the text your spell
checking and not the text field
and finally another simple thing that
isn't is just any slightly complex task
or involve task in this case I'm
choosing making a web page to actually
do it you need to have proficiency in an
HTML editor an image editor a browser
ftp for uploading possibly shell
depending so when you stop to think as a
beginner what you had to learn to tackle
the process of just making a simple
homepage for yourself there's a lot
there now there you know I think Google
has them and a lot of other people that
try to make this process simpler but
never taking a unified approach they're
always trying to solve that one problem
making all those pieces come together
with this problem is universal on
computers you are always having to move
information from one application to
another to get the functionality that
you need it's just like taking that text
in the Google spell check or in the
gmail and having to move it around to be
able to get that spell check
functionality so it's quite complex
actually and when you have to teach
somebody for the first time this is why
it's so daunting so why where does this
problem lie I think it lies at the very
fundamental very fundamental building
blocks of the way we've been using
computers up until now and that is
applications you can imagine
applications to be like walled cities
each one has its own infrastructure each
one has its own idiosyncrasies and
customs and whenever you want to do
something that can only be done in one
city and not the other you have to go
move over there to the other one and now
all those customs and new infrastructure
really confuse it because it all works
just slightly differently so that's
that's sort of the mental model for for
applications and what you end up or
getting things like this you have word
Photoshop and mathematic on your system
say in word you can't remove redeye in
an image but you might want to so you
have to copy
place else do that move it back now
you're in Photoshop you're adding text
to is your captioning something you want
to spell check it no can't do it there
you have to bring it over to word or
someplace else spellcheck it bring it
back you're in either one of those two
applications and you want to run up your
grocery bill you can't do that
calculation there because they're not
equipped to do it you have to copy to
excel or the Python prompt or to
mathematica to do it something's wrong
here you should just have whenever you
have content you should be able to act
on it so what happens well in word that
means is Microsoft wants to get more and
more of that n tail that long tail to
get all of its users wishes the program
has to grow and grow and grow until
becomes this giant portamento of all
possible features and of course that's
not their core competencies so the
things that are out on the fringe are
going to be implemented poorly and be
hard to use and Photoshop simile has to
grow and grow and grow it has to include
a text editor because you need to add
captions so it should include a spell
check and it should include all those
different pagination bits so it has to
grow and grow and grow and same thing
with Mathematica it also includes a
spell check actually I went recently
encountered the number of spell checks
on my computer and it was eight
different implementations with different
interfaces in eight different copies of
the English language and a number of
them know my name but I think half of
them still don't so Mac does a pretty
good job right they include a universal
spell check and a universal dictionary
and that's a great start but it's only a
start so it's it's bad from a user
standpoint because they have to learn
all of these different things and they
have to relearn them at a lot of the
agitation and the like the hesitancy to
learn a new application or to learn to
do one new thing is not having to learn
that one new thing is having to learn
that entire range the entire new Gestalt
for doing things in that new application
so you get a lot of waste
and that's why our computers are
becoming bloated or have become bloated
so it's not microsoft's fault that
everything has become monolithic it's
because of this need for people to have
functionality without having to move
around that's why these applications
keep growing large and larger and larger
and why we build shovels that look like
that right so this is this is the
equivalence do you prepare dinner and
assemble your furniture with a Swiss
Army knife no you want to use tools that
are specific to its need but we end up
building monolithic applications because
you sort of want this Swiss Army knife
right you want to have all that
functionality at your fingertips but
there's no way to do it in an
application centric model alright so
what's the solution and since i'm
talking at google how does it fly to the
net first i think that language has a
lot of untapped power we saw the start
of this revolution on the web with
searching and it got brought back to the
desktop where you now type what you want
to find and that's that's great it's
really helped sort of ease the pains of
the bloated file systems that we use
with these hierarchies which i'll come
back to why hierarchies are bad in a bit
so semantic length you know the game
pictionary this game where you have a
little card you get these either
concrete or abstract idea and you have
to draw it and get some deals to guess
it it's a fun party game but there's no
reverse game right there can't be a
reverse game because once you have the
word it's done so language has a lot of
power and the GUI are that sorry the
command line used to be sort of the deja
right and people have moved away from it
in some ways or at least the mass area
of computing has moved away from it
because it's somehow scary but I'd argue
that that's not because there's
something terribly difficult inherently
with command-line interfaces but rather
that there's something inherently
difficult with the names they chose for
their commands in their particular
syntax I mean for me trying to remember
what command line options come after
tart to make it unpackage ezip is
something like I don't know mmm trying
to Bob for apples in a cement mixer
right it's not a pleasant experience so
why can't you use language to bring the
functionality you need to you so if i
wanted to spell check this why can't i
just type spell check and have it bring
up a spell check and then come up here
right why can't I do that why can't i if
i have a calculation wherever I am just
type calculate there we go that by the
way was my favorite approximation for pi
if anybody thought to go by so I think
this is Oh show you exactly what I was
doing in a little bit but I think this
is the power of language that instead of
having lots of little icons all over the
place to do one for every possible thing
you could ever think of which clearly
won't scale you have to start harnessing
the power of language so the first and
simple solution before we get more
complex is the idea of getting to
content on your computer before we truth
we try to solve the problem of bringing
functionality to you so command-line
interfaces are great for getting to
content because you type a couple
keystrokes and you're there don't think
I need to convince anybody of that but
it's interesting that there is actually
a command-line interface that almost
everybody uses or anybody that uses the
web and that's the URL bar if you think
about it you used to type in in UNIX RC
to go to your news you type pine to go
to read your mail well now you type and
y x com to see your news and you type
gmail to see your mail it's the same
thing people are getting used the idea
that you type to go where you want to go
now imagine if you had to pull down out
of a list one out of the possible I
don't know 100 million websites that
exist right ludacris it would take
forever um that's why the bookmarks bar
is is or the menu is so bad because you
soon get too many you start having to do
hierarchies and it's just not a good
solution much rather have something like
delicious where you could or even just
Google where you can actually find
things really fast anyway
so typing gives you a lot of power um so
a lot of so command-line interfaces I
really think are in a way to a comeback
with search and I think it's going to go
further and further that thing in gmail
or in uh in google calendar where you do
a quick add that's a command line if
restricted okay otherwise getting to
content spotlight Google Desktop Search
whatever that thing is in vista and a
little plug the humanized and cilantro
is another way of getting to where you
want to go you type where you want to go
so for instance if I wanted to open up
notepad you could simply type open
notepad notepads open if I wanted to
open up a calculator like a type open
calculator if I wanted to go over I have
down here a whole bunch of tabs one's
open to the long now foundation if I
wanted to go over there I could type go
long now foundation if I want to switch
tabs i can simply type go / don which is
over on the left I'm over there right
this is the power of using language to
move around your system because you all
you have to do is think where you want
to go and you're there um so you know
gds does a little bit of this it doesn't
do moving and manipulating windows but
it certainly gets you to the application
or the file you're looking for which is
which is they set a really great start
um by the way what I'm doing so i'm
holding down caps lock and while I'm
holding it down i type so it just kept
slock and then go want to go to the new
york time so i start typing times and it
brings me there um
so it's a it's a powerful idea one of
the nice things is that using systems
like this lets you integrate your idea
of bookmarks and folders and files so i
don't think i've learned / don i haven't
so i can say go over here to slashdot
and then teach n so something learn as
open / don open / old is now command so
if i close this and i say open slashdot
it brings me there but why stop there
well let me hide all these things here
is a an image that I have on my desktop
and if I wanted to always open that I
could say learn as open and then a cool
image just think it's now a command so
matter where I am I can type open google
image and opens it up right so all of a
sudden accessing in the same way that
that search lets you access any type of
information just by typing in one place
and going there things like this let you
access any type of information on your
computer all in one sort of unified way
and it wouldn't be possible if you
restrict yourself to purely visual means
because you just it doesn't have the
same sort of power that language does so
let's go back to here
often went away I start this
presentation is by actually force
quitting the desktop and then using n so
to get around but I didn't do it this
time okay so that's part of the solution
that's sort of this simple bit of the
solution the next part is that you need
to bring functionality to people you
need to get that spell check somehow to
wherever the content is that people are
or the people are manipulating and I
think there are two big points to this
to sort of has one is the idea that's
really taken off with mashups and
whatnot on the web the idea of services
when you come up with a piece of
functionality you need to be able to
publish that so other people can take
advantage of the functionality
applications are like world cities right
so they hoard their functionality we
need to give it away so that other
people can use it wherever they are may
be charged for it too but the other bit
is you need a universal access interface
so you have services right you have this
huge range of things you can possibly do
you have you know a map you have
searching you have calculating you have
doing integrals rendering to lautech the
full range of things on your computer
that you can possibly do now accessible
to you anywhere well how do you make it
accessible anywhere right that's where
the power of language comes in so you
need a universal access interface so
services quickly let you know stand on
the shoulder of giants if you mash ups
interesting enough I think this is the
first interesting point here is that
they give you a separation of the UI
from the back end so this makes it
really easy for other people to say aha
these people have a great map but on the
front end sucks so I'm going to steal it
and make it better and you get this
wonderful symbiosis where the
marketplace can flourish because
everybody can sort of stand on the
shoulders of people have gone before to
make the product which is best arm in
course and everybody down at the bottom
of the pile can still make a lot of
money because everybody's using their
their backend
and so the point I want to make is that
these services up until now have really
been for sort of the developers right
google makes a whole bunch of these api
is available for free but it's not
usable so much by the end user as by the
developer making something for the end
user I think we need to go that next
step and make them somehow available for
the end user so access let me give you
before I go on a simple demonstration
I'll read this first um more
applications I try to I found this one
slashed off the more applications i
tried forcing into a tab web and bi
model under a mat the more clumsy gets
they aren't in my doc they can't be
Apple tab through issues like this
really frustrated myself as I find
myself wanting to use more web two point
O Ajax see fancy-pants programs it's a
problem that Google is certainly having
you have those list of possible
applications along the top of your
account but that's not really a scalable
solution this is starting to look more
and more like separate applications on
your computer when you really want to
have all that functionality available to
you at any time for instance going to
open dojo rich text editor which thank
you a spent a lot of time working on
actually um and i'll just point out that
this is on somebody else's server so
this is sort of a no tricks up my sleeve
moment it's just a standard HTML based
rich text editor which you can type in
well say this was gmail and say you're
sending an email to your friend and you
want to tell them to come to your office
in Chicago and you wanted to add a map
right now there's no really good way of
doing that you'd have to take a picture
and upload it Google can certainly
implement something but that takes a lot
of burden on Google to think of all the
possible things they'd want to do why
can't you do things like say let me find
my cursor hello
there we go why can't you do things like
here is a map of Chicago and then say
add map right why can't you do things
like that why can't you do things like
say here is an aerial plus or minus
spelling the photo of Boston
thank you
um
well I PS that's an aerial photo of
Boston um there we go
so why can't you do these things well
the reason why they haven't been done
already is simply because there are too
many possible things you could possibly
want to do to make it feasible to add
them to your interface without making
them really cluttered and hard to to
confront or started to start using but
if you harness the power of language
that you start enabling all of these
features all of these ways of calling in
other people's applications into your
application without you even having to
implement them which is pretty cool
actually this functionality is entirely
there despite the fact that the people
who develop this didn't think that they
wanted this functionality I think to
implement it so this is the power of
combining services with a universal
access interface where you can do things
like this or calculate here or even
let's see open up excite you guys have a
great translation tool it's awesome the
problem is that when I'm surfing some
site I don't want to have to think oh I
want to go translate this now if I'm
there I want to translate it right then
so why couldn't I just go from Japanese
um absolutely clear
alright so this is what i mean by access
this is what i mean by not following the
models that have gone before with the
sort of application centric view point
so the current methods are not scalable
right and i'm talking to you in
particular bookmarklets because you know
if you start using them they just end up
clutter and they're too many so you know
this sort of thing where you type works
really well that thing i was talking
about before and that has grown quite a
bit since i last took a screenshot um
that's not scalable the URL bar is
limited and so you need this fast
semantic method you need some way of
taking all these features and bringing
them to you or to the user and I've been
showing off and so they're there a
number of features that it actually has
like you can you can define words or
spellcheck open files go here and go
there we have two products but it's the
important thing I think really is that
it's a framework around which you start
thinking of these sorts of ways of
accessing information and modifying
information of course the cool thing is
that once you do things like this you
stop needing new interfaces to navigate
around it becomes much simpler because
if you wanted to go define a word now
you can eat you know it just works okay
so this marries the power of gooeys with
command lines and interestingly enough
now that this has been out in the real
world for a little bit this Enzo thing
we've gotten a lot of testimonials and
our goal is to make a program which
would work just as well for beginners as
it does for power users and it seems to
have cheese achieve that when I do tech
supports and seance for four people and
so we constantly rotate around so the
only one person has to deal with the
dumb users um you know we answer the
phone and I've answered the phone for a
70 year old southern man who is using
our program my favorite testimonial so
far has been somebody who said I the
geek love it but my wife the technophobe
loves it even more the point I'm trying
to make here is that command lines
aren't necessarily scary if you present
them in a nice way if you use sort of
the newer thinking and newer interfaces
to give people help as they try to use
it if you give them really good help
systems because it also marries the
command line interface with semantic
language so you no longer have to
remember these are kaic very very short
command lines and know that kill really
sends a signal so it's only kill minus-9
that actually kills and kill minus 7
does I don't know just says hello to the
next process and then I think the most
important part is that you take all of
this power I'm able to access your
information or your content manipulation
and you marry that with the idea of
services so that you don't as one
company has to develop everything you
can open these things up and give
anybody the option to develop a new
front end and in the end with interfaces
I think it's important to keep in mind
that content is everything it's
everything you do on the computer is
either manipulating creating selecting
or navigating or searching content
that's really it everything else you're
just fiddling with your computer
everybody here knows Isaac Asimov's
rules of Robotics right probably don't
need to reiterate them but robots
shouldn't harm people robots shouldn't
they should avoid ebay people and a
robot should protect its own existence
there's a corollary actually over in
interface design which which Jeff
started in the night added one is that
interface will not harm your content or
through inaction allow your content to
come to harm which seems simple enough
right seems like we do a pretty good job
of that if you stop to think about it we
don't currently when you're typing away
on your your you know desktop
application document or whatnot it
defaults to throwing away your work you
have to explicitly tell it to save
that's backwards Google does a pretty
good job but not all the time
innervation not waste your time required
to do more work than is strictly
necessary it's pretty good but once
again computers do waste their time
often um they ask us unnecessary
questions every time you get a dialog
box that comes up and says some things
just happen and you have to click OK
that's wasting your time because you
have to do something when no input is
required an interface shall not allow
itself to get into a state work not
nipple a content is a cute story where
somebody thought they'd come up with a
absolutely foolproof interface um which
is silly because somebody will always
invent a better fool and in this case
somebody very intelligently became a
fool and anything in this interface
could be customized which meant that um
you could change the color of the text
and the background change them both to
white and it was unusable like the whole
interface with just this white screen um
see but there are lots of other times
that uh the interface actually lets
itself get into an unusable state so if
interfaces followed all three of these
things we doing really well so actually
I'm going to stop here for a second and
see if there any question
about what I was talking before about
that universal access stuff anybody have
any questions that sprung up or what is
that I'm typing on screen no
Oh
so you've introduced a new command
language and we'll assume you've done it
perfectly it's the exact right one but
as soon as people decide they like it
fifteen other companies will be have
competing languages for similar commands
and you'll be back to thee which is will
be back to the command line which Mac
interface did away with originally
pretty much for that reason that's your
reaction to that so it's a good question
so for all the people that wouldn't hear
he's asking what happens when other
companies jump in on something like this
and then you end up with an explosion of
different different command names that
all do the same thing we actually
already have the exact same problem I'd
argue with applications right you could
have made the argument while ago that
every application was going to have a
similar name for the ones that we did
photo manipulation um and that you get
this burgeoning and you wouldn't know
which one was waiting to get very
confused I would guess that in the
marketplace it would very quickly become
clear which ones were dominant and
people would use those there'd be a big
fish in a small pond that's my guess the
problem of finding the correct synonym
for what you're looking for is I think a
corollary and I think what that requires
is a really good method as i said before
of help to find what you're looking for
in the first place if you can't find it
of giving a suggestion sort of that did
you mean sort of thing to get you to the
right spot um but I don't really know
what'll happen if I well I do know what
happened one would emerge and that would
be the one that everybody settled on
any other questions let's pass that
around
hi this this is great stuff so actually
I think about 10 years ago maybe was
brad myers group at CMU yeah did
something similar where they were
talking about connecting like sort of
breaking down the walls between
applications and their major comment was
that if we want to add more services and
do more cool things that we want to
what's really hard is you don't
programmers aren't gonna want to do any
more than they have to like they don't
usually develop api's unless there's
some impetus from outside develop an API
so you know your services are gonna I
mean you can only do so much right you
probably can't access everything in word
that you might want to do I might want
to do cool things from Photoshop that
just aren't possible with your tool
because you don't follow shop doesn't
have the api's I mean what sort of what
do you think about you know getting more
services and making enabling more things
right that are really service-based how
is that going to happen the lovely thing
is that right now it truly seems that
people are thinking a very
service-oriented way that's like the
current buzzword so that means you can
leverage all this wonderful
functionality that already exists around
the net realistically I think you have
to get to a certain size of commercial
success before people are going to start
wanting to write for your tool and I
think that's if we ever want to see a
system like this truly take off you need
to make it large enough that people
start developing in such a way say for
instance that you're went to Adobe
you're like if you add this to your
system not only does your system become
faster but now since you just bought
macromedia you can now integrate across
every one of your applications at once
and reduce training time because once
you know one you know all the others
even though the underlying interface
hasn't changed that much I think things
like that where you get this idea into
the consciousness and make people really
want to develop for this is the way to
make it because programmers are um I
mean a little bit magno maniacal right
they like seeing their stuff work out
there used so that's I think the real
pull of it of services right because if
you put out your service and then
another hundred people develop something
on top of your work
your work is still getting used so I
don't know those are sort of like a bird
shot approach dancing your question
very cool UI by the way I liked it it
strikes me that what you've created is
kind of a search engine for services
there they met they happen to be local
services on my computer but it's and
it's very search engine II like I want
it to I want it to find whatever it is
that I meant where I have tagged it
before or not so power came to web
search engines when they stopped doing
hand called directories and started
doing automated processes for extracting
the meaning of web pages that could
could scale better have you thought
about how to automate this so that you
know in the grand scheme of things it
goes and finds the service that I mean
rather than me having a tag adore
somebody else having had Ted I'll tag it
so another way of saying that I guess is
that with web searches you type what you
want to find with this you type what you
want to do how do you make typing what
you want to do as semantic as possible
so that you can type whatever it is that
you want and it happens or if it doesn't
know how to do it finds it and you can
leverage the fact that there are 20
other people typing what I want to do
and that they if they don't find what
they what they wanted they actually
perform the action so it seems like
there's a machine learning you know in
an abstract sense there there's a
machine learning problem there or
something that you there certainly does
I haven't done much thinking towards
that end since we're still on the one
computer one person sort of model but I
I fully agree that using that sort of
power to figure out what people do is
would be great
and this is more an observation but
actually within google search and within
the search box already there's already a
lot of that sort of command line
interface and this is what i want to do
like you type an expression and it will
calculate it for you you say convert
money to money and it will do that and
there's quite a lot of those and i think
already some of our users and starting
to experience problems and with that
because they forget the exact syntax
like if you want to convert money to
money you have to say convert i can't
remember what the keyword is if you try
it in German or French it hasn't been
internationalized properly or at all but
but nevertheless that model is starting
to to come through in Google search so
it's more like Google do this right one
of which things is search so I think
it's kind of interesting that i bequeath
google Oh kind of getting there already
the thing is you seem to have it all
over your applications that possibility
but I just thought I'd point that out
know exactly I mean um we're really
pleased to see when Google started doing
that because I mean it's good once you
start typing you just you start wanting
to have that functionality there yeah
well it's necessary otherwise people
have trouble remembering where they're
trying to go or what they're trying to
do which is why all those autocompletes
on the web that's like a new innovation
in computing which is a little bit cilix
and we've had autocomplete for a very
long time and in particular right now we
try to help that problem of having too
many syntaxes one by doing it this way
but also by always having a like noun
verb sort of thing you always select
some content and use a verb on it so
you'd select something and then say
convert to which is a little bit easier
than the problem of typing the whole
thing out and then hitting go at the end
because you get some of that that
feedback any other questions or okay you
might want to uh
so I had a related question regarding
how do people know what features exist
on the machine so you know whether you I
address you can put it up so you can
make them focus on these are the
features that and that exists and people
can see it and realize that that exists
if it's all come online base how will
they ever find out what what what are
all the features on the machine so I'm
going to turn that around just a little
bit and say when you want to find a new
feature in Photoshop how do you find it
generally it's by wading through a huge
mess of menus right and it takes a long
time even if you already knew it existed
it takes a long time so the problem then
is one of visibility the way I'd argue
people would use this system wouldn't it
be great when you're using Photoshop
instead of buying that whole massive
thing you know you just want to do some
simple editing of photographs you want
to change histogram and whatnot would it
be awesome if you could just download
those features just pay for those so in
the same way it would be great with Enzo
and the way we're sort of doing our
business model and an approach is it
instead of giving people this monolithic
thing people go I want to do this they
go download a package or find a package
which does that and then they learn that
so it's a very linear learning curve you
only have to learn one thing at a time
and that's the answer is that I don't
think you'd ever be confronted um just
with learn everything at once because
even in UNIX that's not what you do you
start by learning one thing and then you
need to do something new and you learn
that one thing and if you make it all
very consistent that linear learning
step is very small so you go get a
package cooler in that package and
you're done Plus as I said before you
need a really good help system or you
can start leveraging the power of
multiple people using it to figure out
what people actually want to do so
that's how you do it um and to point out
we aren't a lot of people accuse us of
hating the mouse we don't it's just you
wouldn't want to write a novel with your
mouse in the same way you wouldn't want
to paint a picture using only the
keyboard their tasks that are suited to
one another so we're certainly exploring
how to use the mouse and get it will get
these affordances to be a bit more
visual but for now this is this is
enough
people seem to be able to use it I
regret to say at the moment it's tied
our goal is to port it um one of the
coolest things as a little anecdote is
that one of our developers develops this
thing on a Mac but in a virtual machine
um and when I went to use his computer
it always messes me up just moving
between mac and windows because my pinky
doesn't know where to hit the right ctrl
key anymore just for doing copy and
paste well when n so is involved it was
always with the caps lock so I was able
to use it identically on both systems
even though the hardware was slightly
different and our goal is eventually
port this to mac and linux and then you
write a program or a service for Enzo
and then it's immediately ported to all
three so the Enzo launcher is seems in
many ways a spiritual successor to Canon
cat and whatever was the thing that came
before it Apple to extension yeah and
that was 20 25 years ago I was wondering
what you think are still the main sort
of changes for things like Enzo and
Quicksilver to become really mainstream
and what you're planning to do about it
to overcome these challenges well I mean
the first thing is that you have to
convince like n so n Quicksilver are
both absolutely great i think the guy
develops Quicksilver sitting right there
but they're both of them are still
add-ons you know to make it truly
universal it needs to get included into
an operating system or conversely if
you're just going to do it for the
browser it needs to get um go upstream
so that it's just always available
really i think that's mainly it you just
have to get people to change start
having services and once i mean
essentially the mac OSX service menu
hours txt extension it's sort of like
what both of these things do right what
sort of like what n so does but it
doesn't have a good interface so if you
married that to spotlight you'd have
something much closer so i think things
are so you can sort of imagine people
feeling around in the
and every once in a while going a step
forward but they don't know where
they're going and I think this is where
people should be should be heading so
that's what I think it needs to take to
get this really out there
so
so the question is can you bring in sort
of machine learning to make the computer
clever enough to guess what the user is
trying to do I won't say authoritative
Lee no but I'm always very wary of the
computer suggesting going far out
suggestion because oftentimes when the
computer is clever it's actually really
dumb just like clip is um so it's a very
fine line to walk and I'd rather error
at the moment on you explicitly telling
the computer what to do if that's really
easy than having a guess and you have to
tell it no that's not what I want but I
think there's a lot of machine learning
that can be done like back in that Bart
example the author had done some work so
that depending on the time of day and
what day it was and show you different
schedules based on what it had learned
and that worked great so yes I think
there is a symbiosis that can be had but
i am very hesitant to go too far in that
direction because otherwise you'll end
up with things like microsoft's adaptive
menus which we're always running away
from you
so it appears that I've gone for an hour
which is too bad since this is only half
of the talk um what is the sense in
terms of people's schedules of whether I
should quickly go on to the next cool
thing or whether you want to stay here
what I don't know how long you can sit
in these chairs for anybody want to help
me I think it's a up to what you want to
do we could obviously no one's uh forced
to stay here so when I want for a little
bit weekend well if you like the sound
of my voice that much um so I guess I'll
move on to the other side of where I
think interfaces need to go um and I'll
try to move a little bit more quickly
than I was before um but the point is
again the content is key and if you stop
to try to break down an interface I
think you can break it down and always
into four things creating content
navigating content selecting content and
transforming it and so I was showing you
with Enzo that i would first select
something always and then I'd run a
command and that transformed it in some
way or I would not select something and
transform the system state and navigate
essentially so the name of this talk is
sort of a way with applications the
death of the desktop what dooms the
desktop in the traditional sense what's
because if you think about it it's not
about content right what work do you get
done here none this is all the time that
you spend any other all the time you
spend here is time spent getting the
right application open or the right
webpage open to actually do your work so
that's why I think this concept of the
desktop is should be out but I'm not
being exactly fair the desktop does do
something what does it do lets you get
your computer into state where you can
enter content as I said so with things
like Google Desktop Search and with Enzo
or Quicksilver I think that problem is
solved getting there fast
is more or less we've seen the solution
but it does two other things it lets you
categorize content and lets you navigate
content and those are things which and
so doesn't help as much with you can
certainly tag or do other things and it
ends so gives you way of actually
performing those tasks but it doesn't
give you sort of an overall view so what
is the solution for those two things
well there are better ways faster ways
and actually the web i think is doing a
really good job of leading the way in
particular in categorization you've
learned two things one the tags work
really well do you have a picture of
your uncle bob at the fourth of july
party you should be able to put it in
both areas you shouldn't have to put in
the folder for one or the other that
makes sense and the other idea is that
search actually helps you get rid of the
need to categorize if you have a really
good search then you don't need to spend
the time to categorize your data as well
so I think these two things combined
sort of go to form the death of the
forest hierarchy that we see all the
time with our file systems on the
computer um okay navigation I'll go
quickly through here as well so I think
when you're coming up to come up with a
replacement for the desktop you need to
let content be content people are in the
HCI world are really fond of saying that
things are have direct manipulation that
when you're moving a file around you're
moving a text file around but that's not
quite right you're actually moving an
icon that represents the file around so
it's not quite as good we should let
content be itself the best file name for
a file is not something short that tries
to summarize you know 20-page document
it should be the document itself to let
search be searched don't categorize when
you don't need to let 2d content be 2d
content this one's important people are
really bad at navigating 3d first-person
shooters are hard walking through a maze
is hard looking at it from the top is
much easier
our current system where we have windows
that hide behind other windows they're
actually in 3d well 2.5 d and people
have a lot of problems navigating
through here a lot of the time you waste
on the computer if you get a computer
and new computer screen rather it's much
larger than your previous one your
productivity goes up between you know
five to twenty percent i think the apple
nielsen says 10 to 15 why part of that's
because you just you can make your
windows larger and general and see more
but all of it's because you're doing a
lot less manipulation of your windows
windows aren't getting hidden so you
don't have to take that mental step to
figure out where it was and react
llamate yourself becomes true that where
things are on your screen is what they
are and finally don't let the don't do
anything to the user structure don't
force any mental model on them just like
when you're doing the quick add you're
not forcing a mental model because the
user can just type what they're thinking
there's no translation process you
shouldn't have to force people to do the
same thing with folders on their
computer so I'm going to ignore this
thing the important thing is I think we
should take advantage of people's mental
model their ability to have really good
2d spatial awareness and use the where
it is is what it is
I news the idea of zoom so by the way
this or the visual or the camera people
is where needs to switch over to video
um whatever they told me to say that um
alright so here here's the basic idea
you have to control zoom in zoom out and
three controls pointing and an almost
fanatical devotion to the Pope um so it
gives you the instructions here um just
click and point so I'm gonna click here
and says the phone introduction is here
so i zoom in and hey look I can now read
all about the whole thing that talks
about direct manipulation talked about
what to look for zoom out again want to
go take a look at my pictures of San
Francisco okay let's take a look there's
a nice market picture we'll go over to
San Francisco here's a nice map I'll
zoom in come down look ah I've embedded
my pictures exactly where they were you
have multiple views on things the point
is that content is always always
represents itself and it's always
immediate where you came from and where
you're going to there's no force
hierarchy you can lay everything out
exactly as you will and the amazing
thing is that you always know where
things are in relation to each other you
always know that your pictures are up
someplace to the left and that the
documents are some over over to the
right people turn out to be really good
at this Jeff worked for a company called
a purchase for a little bit to help them
try to figure out how to do for nurses
their medical charts and it there was a
simple problem you have the medical
chart which the nurse would write on and
they want to put that on the computer so
they didn't have to transfer that at
some point um and it used to be sort of
looked like Excel with lots of tabs
along the top and the bottom and it
looked exactly like a computer program
it took nurses three days to learn how
to use an intensive seminars
he went to something like this where is
literally just the medical chart they
are used to seeing but you could zoom in
zoom out when you got close enough you
could start editing it took nurses went
from three days to 45 seconds and
they're fully proficient and it's just
as fast the funny thing is that the
nurses that um that were already trained
in computers and we're really savvy took
them a minute and 20 seconds learn how
to use it well because they had to
forget something first and unlearn their
previous knowledge so it actually works
really well and then they realized hey
you don't have to stop just a dumb at
the medical charts what happens if you
zoom out from there why can't you see
the medical charts for everybody in that
room zoom out everybody in that ward
zoom out everybody on that floor zoom
out everybody in the hospital zoom out
your chain of hospitals right all sudden
you have a very easy metaphor to help
people navigate around mind you this is
only navigation and not search because
you need search too because navigation
is always slow so one of the really nice
things actually about the zooming
metaphor is that it scales very very
well we make my windows smaller to
screen size so let me make this the size
of a cell phone um sort of like your
your google map stuff when you have this
really tight feedback loop and zoom all
of a sudden this entire world is not
just as usable but almost as good takes
a little longer to go read things but it
works on any size its display and the
map this sort of visual data works
really well because the zoom out zoom in
again I'm probably preaching to the
choir here but it's still zooming is
very very nice and as you know the press
is often fond of saying that that's one
of the best things about a google earth
although assume there is a little bit
funky so you can start doing lots of
other cool things like um say you're
you're coming into this picture
of the Golden Gate Bridge well I have a
whole bunch of things that are related
to that picture here's an essay that I
wrote about the Golden Gate Bridge
Japanese um I really hope nobody here
speaks Japanese because I wrote this
long time ago and the grammar is awful
um about my favorite building and here
are a whole bunch of words that I used
in that essay why couldn't I just have
that application sitting there go and I
could use it right there's no good
reason you can now start having anything
that's related anywhere you want it so
there's a lot in this demo you can look
around one of my favorite things is is
this which is a review of Jeff spoke a
little bit about it but what is the
definition of amazed amazed is a series
of interconnected rooms connected by
doors where you're in one room you can
see the exits but you can't see what's
in the next room once you go through
that door you're in your next room you
can't see where you came from what is
the web whoever's a series of pages with
links and once you click on a link you
can't see where you came from before you
click on you couldn't see where you're
going there's something similar wouldn't
it be great if you could sort of fly
over the whole thing just like you would
to solve a normal maze on look at it
from the top down so why have a link
when you could just actually have the
page let content be content so here's
the review and you'd be there or if
you're trying to actually integrate this
you could come in here and there'd be
there'd be amazon
so integrating this with the current web
is something of a nightmare but it's
definitely a direction that I want to
get people thinking in so actually let
me let me show you something else which
is uh which is sort of fun let me see if
I actually have it up some things so
and drag this over here
so remember before when I was talking
about when I was talking about oops
there we go um the problem of doing HTML
editors right and that you had to go all
these different places just to make one
simple web page imagine if you're trying
to solve it in sort of a pragmatic way
um where you say I'm not going to
reinvent adobe photoshop for now I just
want a product where I can make all
these things work a lot better together
um well you can use the zooming metaphor
there too so here we are we're starting
this is just some JavaScript code um I
could edit this then I could zoom out I
could zoom out there we go um and you
have all the things that are related to
the global section of the human eye
sight it has heroes the JavaScript this
is uh this is the CSS this amount here
are the images can pan around and so you
can just do the manipulations right in
place where they say fully functioning
instead of just the demo then you can
just use n so too you know zoom in to
this thing and say select it and say you
know flip horizontal and it would flip
it you could you could start doing all
of your manipulations in place so this
is this is good and you could you could
zoom out again and you could say oh yeah
there are all my files and folders that
I'm currently working on in the main
section and down here i am have all the
communications that i'm currently
working on with when talking to other
people so all the sudden it becomes
really easy to keep track of all of
those things that you are doing because
you're taking advantage of people's
spatial mapping where it is is what it
is things never get lost with the reason
real reason why I bring this example up
is because I wanted to show you that
navigation as I said before is slow
you need something else there you need a
search you need some way to go where
you're going fast um those are the two
parts so you need to be able to say well
I know that I want to go up here to my
CSS thing so I do a find for CSS it
finds it and it zooms in um then I want
to go over to the JavaScript so I check
JavaScript and it brings me there I
wanted to go down to I have a chat with
the Andrew so i type Andrew really fast
and we're this not written in JavaScript
it would go much faster and it just
brings me that right so you need those
two things you need that ability to get
where you're going really fast and you
need that ability to always have a
really nice mental model sort of this
this zooming area where you can see
everything that you're working on and of
course you know you can name these
things like monkey and then when you're
you're moving around you can also go to
certain areas instead of just one area
or instead of one window so this is the
sort of way that I see the desktop going
on that you'd come up to your computer
originally and it would have this sort
of blank canvas we could start putting
content and once the content was there
you could start manipulating it using
any of these services and this is sort
of like my end goal for I think computer
should be gone
so we have a unique opportunity to break
away from the desktop metaphor
especially now with the web bringing
some of these ideas of universal access
and different ways of presenting
information I think we have we have a
great opportunity we need to always be
thinking about designing the big picture
otherwise you're going to end up with
all those separate applications that go
across the top of the Google homepage
and they're going to fall the follow the
exact same fate that befell all of their
typical applications they're going to
grow and grow and grow and start looking
more and more and more like their
original inspirations or I should
probably not say inspirations but the
original like you they're gonna start
looking like Microsoft's products
they're going to start looking like
Adobe's products because you're going to
want to pander to more and more people's
needs and they're going to keep growing
to meet them and they're gonna become
monolithic so you need to think about
the start thinking about the big picture
now and I've given you my solutions or
some of them but I challenge you to
think of other solutions and there are
others you know Enzo's mine
quicksilver's is his and there are lots
others out there so I really challenge
you to do that so the take-home message
to think about content harness the power
of language really use services even in
your own applications to bring
unification and that's it
and as my shameless plug I'll put that
up there any questions now that I've
gone even more overtime
I noticed in a number of your examples
you had a very short sequence of
commands that you could honor to get to
whatever it was you were doing I think
at some point the realm of possibility
of computing leads to some very complex
big language do you anticipate
disambiguation as a solution or very
complex commands to reach places which
seems to be what what makes the command
line in a shell relatively powerful but
difficult well I think the command line
sort of started off on the wrong foot
and people continued on with by naming
things to be as short as possible
without semantic things because we can
talk and name any one of the huge number
of things we can possibly do making it
always short as as you say is going to
be difficult so disambiguation will be
part of it but you don't want to ever
get in the case where it says you mean
one of these five things every time you
do it right in the same vein I see if
there is a market place and a bunch of
competitors are offering similar
services how do you negotiate that on
the desktop and also compensate the fact
that sometimes I want services offered
by different parties I don't want to
select and lock in well so instead so so
one I think verbs are going to be the
big thing so you essentially when you go
to make something you think about what
verbs what actions you want to do and so
this you know and so isn't a full
language like natural language processor
so that really does restrict and make it
much easier to make your commands really
short because at every step of the way
it's sort of helping you along um and
makes our problem much more tractable my
imagining for how this would work in the
marketplace is that companies just like
they're making photoshop now or
Mathematica or in a comment and say I'm
making this product they're going to
give their set of verbs and those indeed
might conflict with other people's sets
of verbs but you're probably only going
to have one of those you submit the same
time or you'll have to have
disambiguation
Sims where it's prepended or appended by
the company's names in the exact same
way that when you're going through the
start menu now you can have five things
named paint do you imagine the the
suggest features that you have today
possibly being contextualized probably
yeah okay I mean it's in the suggest
features that when they're not forcing
the user into doing something that a lot
of I think machine learning can come in
really handy so that if you don't get it
the first time the computer knows what
do you want the second time I see so
you've thought a lot about the desktop
interface but if you look at most the
world now especially the developing
world and a lot of Asia it's not on
desktops it can be on mobile phone yes
and means speech interfaces are one
discussion of where to go but so do you
have any thoughts or like you have a
little compact vision of what you think
mobile phones might might be the right
thing to do there so the main problem
with mobile phones is the small screen
size voice is fine for input but
horrible for output because with our
eyes we can sort of track around the
random access ears are not active for
not random access so I don't think as
output audio is ever going to replace
the visual media otherwise we're going
to dub with voicemail systems my guess
is that for for cell phones as they want
to access more and more data you're
going to need some sort of metaphor like
zooming so that you can go in easily and
out easily with some sort of really good
search they're the same problem on the
desktop as finding your data and looking
at it just slightly modified for the
small screen but I know it's it's an
interesting and hard problem actually I
think gaze tracking is going to be one
of the big innovations at some point
just because it's so small pointing is
really hard that once point it becomes
really easy pointing and typing become
easy then a lot of our problems are
going to be solved and when even though
you're working on a cell phone and
actually I had the privilege of trying
suming at one point with the gays
tracker and it was the most effortless
I've ever done because he just looked
and you're like I want to go there you
were there you look over there and you
were there um so I don't know maybe
maybe that so i have a small question
about the zooming interface i did some
experiments a couple of years ago and we
had we didn't have searching we had just
you know zooming in and out we tried to
make it as i said its tried to make it a
little bit more efficient so we actually
had a total that you could you know zoom
a little bit or zoom a lot quickly and
we had a nice big screen and many people
loved it but for certain percentage of
people it made them just queasy and
sometimes literally sick because you
know a lot of stuff moves in and out
very quickly I was wondering if you
experience that and if you have any
ideas on how to UM every once in a while
I we haven't really tested it with
really big screen so you get I've never
really seen it where the entire world
seems to be moving around you which I
could see being disconcerting oftentimes
with prior research in Zooey's people
start with just the standard zooming by
the way this is this is an old idea just
like the command line a lot of these
things are really just revamping of old
ideas um so people generally give up
very quickly on MIDI of just using
zooming and start adding lots of other
things like the fish eyes or what not to
try to solve some of these other
problems which I think can be solved by
search and that certain I think makes
people queasy I haven't so far noticed
that people feel queasy with the very
simple zoom where you you're not doing
anything very clever but it may well be
a problem smaller screens though I think
will always be a solution to that
problem hey nice talk I was wondering if
you have looked at thing called a shoe
yes so are you walking towards
integrating I mean the way I see it it
has like tracking system so that he can
type text input and it's it looked kind
of intuitive to me
so that's just one thing if you have I
mean I played with it and it's it's is
definitely great it's intended it clear
will never replace typing like this what
I mean I I always bulk at the word
intuitive because intuitive generally
just means familiar and familiar is what
we've seen before but it was not hard to
pick up typing things that were not
normal like I tried entering Japanese
into it just and it didn't like that
very much yeah development going on in
that I guess and it's the same problem
with the predictive text input on cell
phones and that's something that almost
always happens when you try to do
predictive things when the user does
something outside the realm of what's
predicted which actually happens fairly
often when you're doing anything
pathological like typing in another
language they often fail so I'm always
wary of things like that I think people
might be wanting to try and line up this
session not that I'm speaking that
you're organizers but I but this is sort
of a meta comment really which would be
there's a lot of my colleagues i'm
outside google who I'd really really
like to share this talk with and I'm
wondering if we can't share this talk is
there some way of you giving us a link
to other talks that you've given like
this so the people outside Google can
take advantage of this thank you um
maybe maybe it's possible to make this
one publicly available think this one is
going to be on google video okay cool
great so yeah who talked thank you
so is that it then my off the hook
