Brian Burchett I'm the site director for
Google Seattle and I'm really happy that
we're in a position where we can sponsor
this conference on scalability and more
happy that you all took time out of your
your lives to come and spend a Saturday
here so I want to welcome you all there
I'm going to do something that I'll do
later and you'll see why I do it but
you'll understand what it means there
are about 500 people registered for this
conference but i'm going to say hundreds
and hundreds of people have registered
for this conference and you'll see why
you'll see why i do that in a minute
they're about a third of the third of
the conference attendees are from
academia and about two-thirds are from
industry that's actually a really good
mix which I'll mention I'll describe why
in just a moment but I want to give you
that mix something else although this
conference was initially conceived of as
being a local event locality is kind of
different in the 21st century we have
five countries represented both in terms
of the audience and the speaker so we've
got Australia Canada France Germany and
the u.s. so I'm pretty pleased by the
number of different the number of
different countries represented here
just as a little bit of background the
conference was started last year was the
first one this is the second instance
the conference was started by Googlers
because they recognize that they looked
across industry publications or the more
academic publications that there was
really an absence of solid material on
scale you could find it in the papers
here and there but as a single theme
that the concept of scale was not that
well represented in the materials that
were available to the community overall
and the Googlers felt that there was an
opportunity to really bring people
together and have a conference focused
on that single theme of scale with very
few restrictions on what other topics
one could discuss so it could be
scalable programming languages scalable
storage systems scalable scalable
networks it didn't really matter as long
as the theme was scale the idea being
that with that theme should come some
valuable lessons and an interesting
things to do go forward last year's
success was what last year's conference
was pretty successful idea was to do it
again this year and now you're
part of that want to mention why scale
is important to Google and give you just
a few statistics to give you a sense not
only of where we are but where we think
we're going not so much to talk about
what in particular Google is doing but
to talk about where the industry is
going I don't have statistics from
Microsoft I don't have statistics for
Yahoo but I do know where the industry
overall is going just looking at at
search we're servicing about 600 million
unique people every month so that's 600
million different search different users
come and try to do a query against
google data centers trying to learn
something on the one hand that's a lot
on the other hand 600 million is only
ten percent so if you think about if you
think about it from 10th from the ten
percent perspective there's a lot of
work left to be done to deal with the
other ninety percent of the planet and
so some of the technologies that you'll
see today on the one hand may seem very
compelling on the other hand they're
going to be a little underwhelming if
you think about it in terms of six
billion how do we get to that as we
moved away from search which is a very
transactional kind of relationship and
have delivered more and more
applications things like male talk
social networking we're really still at
the very beginning and the kinds of
infrastructures that that we in
microsoft and and yahoo have been
building for search are really starting
to stress now that's a stress that's
coming out as you get two numbers of
users on the order of 10 to the hundreds
of millions substantially fewer than the
number doing search but it provides but
you need to do things that are not so
much transactional but interactive and
long-term and we'll see some
technologies today that address the need
of interactive long-term activity one of
the other things that's happened over
the last couple of years and and
probably everyone in this room has used
has used YouTube is that video has
become a new means of information
distribution on the internet there are
about 70 million people in the US who
use who use YouTube on a regular basis
that's about one in four people are
using YouTube it's pretty substantial
for a technology that's all or a product
that's only been out there for a few
years
more compelling youtube doesn't own most
of that most of the overall video market
so that so YouTube is responsible only
for about a quarter of the videos that
people watch out on the internet two
things to take away from that one is
there's lots of opportunity for
diversity and how we deliver video over
the net and the second is at 60 to 70
million people using it just in the u.s.
today there's a lot of people who aren't
using it so it's likely that the
solutions that we and the other
companies have built are not going to
scale up in their current instance we're
going to have to think of new ways to
deliver video to the six billion people
on the planet we're at the very
beginning delivering video over mobile
while there may be 70 or 80 million
people a month using YouTube from a
console it's just on the order of
millions small numbers of millions who
are doing it today on mobile that will
change that will change the requirements
of the back-end infrastructure again
scaling for video will create new
problems going forward all of these all
of these new technologies are these new
products are our driving companies like
Google to think very hard about how we
build systems that scale in the future
and that gets now back to the goal or
the rationale of the Googlers when they
put this conference together thereafter
there after a forum which two things
could happen the first dissemination how
can we get people together and and have
them talk to one another about the
scalable infrastructure that they're
building the scalable technology is that
they're building so that people need not
reinvent the wheel so the first the
first real goal of this conference is
dissemination and the second goal of the
conference is inspiration presumably
people will get together and discover
that nobody is working on a particular
problem yet that particular problem is
looming and then people will run off and
think about how we're going to solve
that problem going forward so great
conferences have these two attributes
dissemination and inspiration and what I
want to ask you when you leave at the
end of the day is what is it that you
learned ask yourself and what is it that
you want to go do next that you didn't
want to do before you got here and I'm
hopeful that each and every one of you
will come away with something that you
learned and something that you realize
you needed to do next and if so please
come back next year and invite your
friends and if not thats that'd be great
feedback that that we should get as to
how we should improve the conference to
increase the quality of
the information here so that there's
better dissemination and better
inspiration</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
