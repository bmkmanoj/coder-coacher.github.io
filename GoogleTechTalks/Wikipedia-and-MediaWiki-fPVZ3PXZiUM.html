from the Wikimedia Foundation and he's
been with Wikimedia for about four years
now and during what she's seen pretty
staggering growth he's going to talk to
you today about the current state of
affairs on Wikipedia a little bit of
trivia up until recently Brian was the
only full-time paid employee for the
engineering side of things that just
kind of gives you an idea of just how
many volunteers are working on Wikipedia
related things also as another note this
is going to be published on Google video
hi so probably most of you have heard of
Wikipedia in case you haven't it's this
crazy website it's theoretically at
least an encyclopedia where people
around the world can add stuff which
hopefully is accurate to it and so
that's our crazy thing that we do and
obviously we have software and servers
and all have to support it so we try to
make them work but we keep Media itself
is a bit of a strange creature it serves
sort of two groups of people both the
public at large because it's trying to
be a serious reference site for people
around the world in many languages
across time into the future but it's a
resource that's freely available and
freely reusable under open content
licenses which are of course kind of
tied in with the whole open-source thing
and Creative Commons and all that stuff
and also because of the way it's built
materials are always up to date current
events etc are immediately filtered
right into the encyclopedia but also it
serves the community of editors and
users who are actually at being on the
side and to them it's almost more like a
online game in that it's a community
where you hang out a bit and sort of
work through and do something that's a
little bit of fun you whack some trolls
you build some material etc but all this
sort of makes it complicated to work
with because the site is very
dynamically changing which means that
things like caching and serving updated
data is somewhat complicated but we do
our best through the last four years
most of our effort on actually the tech
end has been just dealing with the
growth in use and this is a graph from
the Alexa internet rankings showing just
last two and a half years or we've gone
up from the tiny little site to big huge
percentage of all internet views which
is kind of frightening but all of that
is the kind of growth that we've been
going through going from about a half a
dozen maybe a dozen servers at the
beginning of that graph actually the
beginning of that graph it's more like
four servers to over a hundred now just
keeping up with that level of growth of
both people reading the side and people
working on the site but there's yes
there's somewhat of complicated things
with that and that we have to deal with
database replication
that's nothing terribly complicated but
it is something to deal with we have
probably the only wiki software that
were aware of that really is explicitly
built for scaling because we check for
lagging database slaves we have a whole
second caching layer of data which
generally isn't used on a small site and
we very explicitly work with our proxy
servers to maintain
cached data across continents but that's
all very boring really so assuming that
all the simple technical problems can be
solved which of course they can given a
sufficient manpower what other things
might we be doing we can integrate more
with the rest of the web improve user
experience have all our little Ajax
goodies we can improve what happens when
something's goes wrong if there's a
transient error in the network or in
some server and of course we can make it
a lot faster because everyone likes a
fast website in our development a recent
change that we've made is to sort of
move forward with very active
development instead of doing a release
every couple of times a year which we
used to do now we're very actively
pushing side pushing updates immediately
to the Wikipedia site we're doing more
testing updates and changes and new
features are going live very soon
we're working in subversion sort of CVS
which makes a lot easier to do those big
slow work projects in separate branches
and then the media weekly releases which
go out to all the thousands of third
party users using our software are now
on a quarterly schedule which helps to
get those features into the hands of
other people a lot sooner as well so now
that we're actually really working on
things it's time to think about what is
it that makes that vici interesting and
what is it that has to be changed for
not just the technical issue of scaling
which is that we have a lot of requests
that need to be served but also the
social issues of scaling which is that
we have a whole lot of pages and a whole
lot of people and how do we get
interesting material to people who can
review it and how do we get
interesting people - material they can
work on so a question that I get asked a
lot by journalists and people who don't
really have any idea about the Internet
is so how does a week be different from
a blog they've heard of a blog
everyone's heard of a blog but they
maybe haven't heard of a wiki obviously
the biggest difference is that blogs are
more popular but I also like to say the
blog's exist in more of a temporal
dimension you have a series of posts one
after the other when there are comments
made on a post there again in a
serialized temporal sort of monologue
with comments but wikis exist in more of
a spatial environment you have many
different materials both in ideaa space
and in physical space each page is a
separate entity but that entity is
constantly changing constantly being
updated the conversation as it were is
in the actual content of the page
instead of a series of separate comments
but it's not just ideas space and
physical space it's also people space a
blog is mostly a monologue it's one
person then other people respond to them
whee-hee is a much more collaborative
environment you have a whole bunch of
people with different interests working
on different parts of it and also
working together on the same parts of it
they're not just publishing at each
other they're publishing with each other
so if we have space and we have time
what about space time
there's a very strong time element in
wikis as well which is important there's
a series of changes which happen to the
entire system the traditional recent
changes view is the general way of
seeing what's going on in a wiki what's
the overview of it any particular page
has a whole series of changes to it
that's actually not an original part of
the wiki concept the original wiki that
Ward Cunningham created
had only a single version at a time and
he only later added additional versions
for recovery of from vandalism but in a
lot of wikis and especially in in our
wikis in media wiki we very strongly
maintained every version of every page
which of course accumulates so you have
George W Bush it's edited hundreds of
times a day on Wikipedia you can see
just the last ten that it covers a few
hours and if you keep clicking that view
next 1000 you could go for quite a long
time the problem with time is that
there's not enough of it there's too
much space in too much time you can sit
there watching all the changes on
Wikipedia and be completely overloaded
by it so how do we look through that how
do we actually manage at this scale
dealing with all that material now time
and space on a wiki are of course
strongly related because changes over
time on a page create changes in space
each individual sentence each individual
word on the space of the page was
changed at some point in time by some
person so you definitely want to be able
to keep track of time if you're trying
to keep track of the content so when you
have so much material in so much time
you need to do a little bit of
compression the same way as we take
redundant data in the actual data
transmission we gzip it it downloads a
lot faster when we're looking at data
that a human wants to look at we want to
throw away redundant data stuff that's
not important stuff you don't care about
in general search on the web is a sort
of filter and it's a sort of compression
in ideaa space you have a view of the
entire web the entire internet with
bajillions of pages and you say I'm
interested in just a subset of it and a
search engine will take out just that
little subset and show you just the
things you're interested in
so within a week II the sort of first
level that we have is a watch list or an
RSS feed of that where you take certain
topics that I know I'm interested in I'm
interested in the page on you know wiki
itself I want to know what people are
asking about it so I want to see updates
to those pages but that only gets you
pages that you already know exist that
you already know you're interested in
and that of course already exists at the
time that you say interested in them so
what if it's a new material a new page a
new article a new concept that maybe you
didn't even know would be there how do
you even know that it comes into
existence you can't do that with the
existing systems so things to think
about in the future that we might start
adding our keyword based watches
filtering based on similarity of pages
certain types of changes you might be
interested in for instance any change
that adds a certain kind of formatting
or a certain kind of external link or
whatever you might be wanting to watch
that sort of thing in addition to just
this is an article I like but also
that's within space but things also
exist within time if you're watching the
live feed of updates which we have
currently on an special IRC server you
can see they just keep scrolling on by
one after the other way to wayy too many
but you want to filter that if you
actually want to do anything with it
what we have today is there are a number
of people who have set up software that
then keys into that
which goes and looks at those updates
and tries to mix him hero suit
determinations about what kind of change
it is if it was just some junk edit or
if it's something good and then tries to
perform an action based on it
for instance if someone's just putting
in blah blah blah this is a test then it
can be immediately reverted or it can be
flagged so someone can look at it but
that's just a start for maintenance
tools it also can be used to detect
things that a particular person is
interested changes on a topic a about a
person whatever and we would love to be
able to put those within the web
environment as well as just IRC and
other external tools because obviously
an external tool requires more user
training more user determination it's
not as accessible it takes a lot more
effort to hop in but a lot of what we
want in a wiki is making it very easy to
hop in with the absolute minimum of
effort someone should be able to jump in
and become a contributor so we don't
want ultimately to have to say oh
download an IRC client for your platform
here's a list of 50 programs because
people are just going to give up and go
away we would love to be able to instead
put those in the browser if possible
some kind of wonderful streaming Ajax
thing who knows we'll see this is all
very sort of upcoming technology that we
don't have yet but we hope to see in the
future in addition of course to just the
web which is the first step there's also
that second step which right now is the
only step we have of external tools
which then brings even to the third step
of integrated external tools for
instance a desktop notification tablet
this kind of thing people have now for
from since mail notification for their
webmail application
they want to know they got mail they
might also want to know that something
interested to happen on Wikipedia or on
their company's internal website or
their on a wiki or what-have-you
so being able to have additional tools
plug into the system
watch for interesting changes and pop
that out to the user that's something
that we hopefully are going to see now
in addition to just published changes
there's also communication between users
on the wiki for each article there's an
Associated discussion page which is sort
of like a forum except really badly
implemented so making that into more of
a real forum system which understands
both space and time being able to bring
new interesting discussions to the top
keeping old materials that have not yet
been answered or become obsolete again
and still keep them visible but leave
settled questions to settle down out of
the way is another future direction that
we can expect to see over the coming
year so once we're done worrying about
publishing and sort of long-term
interaction of the kind of email and
message notifications and such forth
there's also simply the level of time at
which people directly interact with the
website you click a button it does
something hopefully it does it fast
because if it does it slow people get
bored and it go away
the first element obviously is the
software itself if the software is slow
that is really bad because then your
website slow and your website slow
people go away so over time we've been
working on again this is the basic text
scaling problem of software slow profile
it find the slow parts get rid of them
that's pretty boring let's assume that
we've finished that
that everything's done the software runs
instantaneously takes no time but
there's still time because the speed of
light is limited we have to get those
packets from one place to another
we have remain servers in Tampa Florida
and then we have additional servers
elsewhere but we don't have enough for
every person to have instantaneous
communication it still takes a little
bit of time but even a little bit of
time is enough to be annoying when you
click on a button and waiting for it now
caching proxies are the first wonderful
step if we have a user in Frankfurt
Germany and they're contacting a squid
proxy cache that we have in Amsterdam it
doesn't take much time maybe 15 20 25
milliseconds that's really fast if they
can get a cache page it's a very
immediate very quick very pleasant
experience but we can only do that for
static page views because of the way the
caching is limited and if you're stuck
with a dynamic side where you are logged
in you have special permission special
options all that has to go back to main
servers across the ocean and in sort of
the best case here we're looking at
across the Atlantic from Europe to the
east coast
that's only you know adds 115
milliseconds but that's a tenth of a
second a tenth of a second is long
enough to click and notice that there's
a little bit of delay just barely and
that's our best case our worst case is
something like Asia Australia across the
Pacific where it can get a lot less
pleasant it takes a third second half a
second even more so another future
direction that we can see is making
those caches smarter and that's going to
be some hard work in terms of keeping
data synchronized properly but hopefully
we'll figure it out it's ultimately not
a totally impossible problem
because once we have the ability to have
local databases and local application
servers then suddenly you've got that
short 15 milliseconds all the time
except when you actually have to go back
and make a change which is pretty rarely
only when you say save something then it
goes back takes another hundred 15
milliseconds so what you don't even
notice it expect it to take a little
longer but it does mean that we have to
continue to improve our architecture to
be able to make that distinction of
knowing this request is going to be slow
because it has to make a change this
request is going to be slow because it
needs very very current data and our
local data is a half a second behind
making that determination it's not
always very easy because you don't know
if something just changed half a second
ago on another continent because it
takes you that half a second to get that
information recorded copied over and
then applied to the local database but
hopefully we can figure it out yes
what's your ratio of free traffic versus
right
ah that's a good question I actually
don't know offhand but our squid proxies
currently take about 70 to 80 percent of
the total load and those are virtually
all read traffic and those are people
who are not logged in and then we also
have people who are logged in who are
doing primarily read traffic so I'll try
to get actually statistics for that
sometime because that's a good figure to
have yes question is if you have to find
out what the maximum number of Rights
happen concurrently to a particular
article what would it look like what is
it week but it's just as many people
editing the same document and what
yeah well for each document there is
conflict control because if you make a
change and then somebody else started
editing before you and then they save it
then the software says hey wait a minute
this babe changed in the meantime
and it's kind of like a CVS check-in it
checks to see if there's a conflict
cease if it can automatically merge it
if it can then it goes ahead and save
significant then it requires a user
interaction to resolve the conflict so
generally there is at least some degree
of protection there of each individual
page has a is basically limited to the
rate at which people can resolve their
conflicts so hopefully at least it
doesn't get to multiple per second
usually in the worst case it might if
people actually are added in different
parts of a long article really really
rapidly but usually no generally on an
individual page you'll see even if
fairly active times it'll be an edit and
then maybe a minute later another edit
so usually on an individual article the
rate isn't very great but the rate
overall keeps going up all the time and
right now it's at something like one per
second more or less of total edits on
thankless language Wikipedia site which
is our biggest but we can expect that to
double over the next year probably
it's very interesting to go to for
instance an article like Hurricane
Katrina or the London bombings last year
or other kind of major news events or
they would get a huge number of at its
per day but still at on an overall
database perspective it's not that much
it's just a few thousand but a few
thousand is still a lot if you wanted to
sit there and review every every
individual edit on those articles on
those hot days when they were the thing
to do you you know sit there and
download a 100 megabyte file of each
change and go what that so it's very
exciting sometimes yes so your pay this
much attention to
while you probably capacity everything
received amazing
especially on
we haven't totally solved it yet but we
can expect this gonna improve a lot
we've made huge improvements in the PHP
so far and because our program is
primarily in PHP but we're eliminating
bits here and there and it's here and
there and eventually it's going to get
down very small but even now in under
the best cases when load is not too high
when the databases are humming smoothly
you can get a pretty short processing
time on the application server of 10 20
milliseconds and then having to wait 300
milliseconds for that page to get back
to Australia becomes a noticeable chunk
so if we can hope that we can get to
that point where we're always 10 to 20
milliseconds then it's really going to
matter as far as making that experience
really nice and the other thing that it
gets you which i think is even on my
next slide is that if you have that then
you can fail gracefully everyone smile
we'll have a problem with our central
database our server cluster we had a
couple of power failure failures
recently when a circuit breaker failed
and then it failed again and then they
replaced it and that you know took out
our whole main data center for a couple
hours while we had to reboot everything
and during that time if you hit the
European or the Asian squid proxy and
you had no cookie and you hit a page
that had been previously viewed then you
could still read Wikipedia but if you
were logged in you got an error page or
if you wanted to look at a page that
hadn't been seen before you just got an
error page and said can't contact the
server so sorry but if we could have
local copies of the database and local
application servers that are able to
show that read data then they could
still show everything with no difficulty
at all with the central database offline
that's not just having the data center
explode it's also transient Network
errors for instance our European servers
are hosted at no cost to us which is
very nice but they're on an educational
network which is kind of experimental
and sometimes the network goes down a
little while because they're upgrading
something so then you know part of their
network works so they can contact the
outside world in Europe but they can't
contact our servers in the United States
and then all the European users come on
to our IRC Channel and say Wikipedia
doesn't work and we say it's working
here but if at those times they still
had that local database that was able to
say well I can't go back to the main
server but I can still show you what's
current right now they would still be
able to read the site see what's been
going on recently make their plans of
what they're going to do in five minutes
when everything comes back on so
certainly being able to improve the
failure modes is a very attractive
option
any other questions in there because I
think I'm actually near the end chair
yeah a little more if we get to the
point where MediaWiki is fast enough
that it can serve a lot of things we
probably still have squid in front or
something like squid to serve you know
even a little bit faster
the totally anonymous views but being
able to then still serve most of that
other 30% that can't be served by squid
on a local server with much lower
latency is very attractive so hopefully
that's something that we can swing
slightly depression the most people keep
the beach back from the moment they
click on edit and luminous they say
is that long duration or a short
duration it it depends it can be very
short if you're for instance just making
a spelling correction or something then
you you know click in scroll down types
on the end hit save it can take a couple
of seconds but it can also take a half
hour or an hour where you're writing
some big whole article from scratch or
maybe you're doing some research in
between or such worth so for instance if
we wanted to hold locks open on a page
that's something that would be a little
bit scary because someone might just
click Edit because they want to see what
it looks like and then they never
actually changed the article
okay one more there's a big that GPM I
mean what happened somebody by
significant MediaWiki software is
entirely GPL so it's all open source I
think there's a four core to that one or
two people actually use but most people
seem to basically just use our software
or modify it a little bit with their
custom extensions primarily we target
media we our Wikipedia itself that's
what it was written for and that's the
main thing that we go for and for
instance all these scaling features are
things that most sites don't need a few
other sites also can use them for
instance there some third-party sites
running MediaWiki that are fairly large
we heat travel is a third party side
that people often confuses one of ours
because it starts with week II and it
runs our software but it's run by
different people and they've customized
it in certain ways but they're still
basically working from our updates and
they also contribute back with new
features and fixes and such worth as far
as people who are using it internally in
corporate environments for instance we
generally don't hear too much back from
them but there's certainly a lot of
people using and we want to try to talk
to them a little more and handhold that
market a bit as it were
Oh mostly the lessons of everything to
our people say I hate this about
everything to don't do it
but also people say I love this about
everything to please do it and then we
look at it we say oh that sounds
terrible so I guess there's certain
matters of opinion in it I haven't
really examined it in detail
so I can't say too much yes she talks
about the design goals was enabling
people to get in something as easily as
possible so it's barely conscious
decisions to not require people to
register
they're honest trade-offs right it's a
trade-off there's a sort of continuum of
making it really easy to edit and making
it hard enough that people who aren't
going to be productive don't bother and
making it hard enough of people who are
going to be productive don't bother so
traditionally we've aired on the very
low side and in a few places we've
bumped it up just a little bit
for instance we do require a
registration to upload multimedia files
because otherwise the vast majority of
pictures uploaded are some of these
photos of their party last night or some
photo that they downloaded off a website
and because on the internet it's free
right or you know they're a porn
collection
so we do have a little more of a bar
there and recently we raised the bar a
bit on creating new articles in the our
largest site which is the
english-language Wikipedia where you do
have to register first but you can still
edit an existing page without
registering maybe we'll keep that
forever maybe we won't certainly as the
site continues to grow and to mature it
becomes to a certain degree less
important to produce new content and it
becomes more important to tend to the
existing content which changes a bit the
the kind of community that you want and
the kind of behavior that you want from
people joining but to a certain extent
we're also going to handle that by sort
of layering a review system a sort of
versioning version freezing or tagging
system on top of saying this version of
this article is no good it's been fact
checked it's been reviewed by someone
who knows what they're doing and des
little research and checked the
references but there's also new versions
that you can look at so our kind of
long-term goal is that
when some random person gets on to some
random article they should see that it's
either a been reviewed and checked for
accuracy or B has not been and therefore
they should give less credence perhaps
take it with a little more grain of salt
obviously anything you read on the
internet you have to take with a grain
of salt and you should never use a
single resource if you're doing serious
research and you should never ever use
an encyclopedia as your sole source if
you're doing serious research and
encyclopedia is a starting point even if
it's a Britannica but we still want to
have accurate information obviously we
don't always want to have you know
George Bush is a big jerk as the top of
the article
even though some people would say it's
true that's not the sort of language
that we probably want in an encyclopedia
obviously you're sensitive to the
do you think it's been overblown well
because it's been a lot I think it's
definitely overblown but at the same
time it is real and it's something that
we maybe need to pay a little more
attention to how its perceived because
most you know spam or junk either no one
actually really saw it because it was
gone immediately or no one actually
really saw it because no one actually
looks at that article articles that are
really solidly paid attention to that
people actually look up and will tend to
get cleaned up right smack right away
but because on those lesser seen things
they often do get left for a long time
that is something that we want to look
at as far as being able to say you know
this is a less viewed page it is a less
reviewed page you know take it with a
larger grain of salt if there being lots
of sorts of abuse lead necessarily
predict
how do you feel personally when you've
written all the software and then see
the way
well there's I guess two kinds of abuse
there's personal abuse and there's
technical abuse the kind of abuse that
horrifies us is when we write some cute
little feature for having template pages
where you can have a specially formatted
table and use it multiple times and
people try to turn it into a calculator
with you know a big set of slide rule
templates where the template for the
value 23 is 24 and this is the add one
template so when those things to happen
we kind of have to sit down and figure
out well what's a better way of doing
that so people don't make us cry so
recently one of other developers Tim
Starling put together a an additional
extension explicitly for handling little
bits of arithmetic or little simple if
death kind of chunks in a way that
actually works correctly and performs
well instead of having to load five
different templates so that's something
that we can at least work with by
working with the people who want to do
something productive and then the other
kind is you know spamming or people
signing out on multiple accounts and
saying and trying to abuse some other
user harassment there that exists to
some degree for instance if someone has
become an administrator on the site
where they can delete junk pages and
block IP addresses that are used to
vandalize those people sometimes get
abused by someone who is a total jerk
and just wants to harass anyone who is
actually trying to be productive
and that's more of a harder issue of
course because it's more social issue so
those are harder to deal with in that
you know you can try to ban having lots
of exclamation points in a username when
you know these are names are all
so-and-so is a jerk
so-and-so is a whatever but that's
obviously not gonna solve your problem
they're gonna use a 1 instead of an
exclamation point so that's something
that maybe it's harder to figure out and
yes uhm there actually is a company in
Germany that has been doing this I
unfortunately didn't bring them in here
with me but I have a copy of a couple of
things they have a dvd-rom Edition with
an offline reader of the German language
we HEA pedia that they publish a couple
of times a year new updated versions and
they have a whole bunch of the articles
they've done some a difficult
fact-checking and formatting and they
have a little search tool and it's a
multi-platform ebook reader kind of
thing it's pretty exciting and they also
do some published books of extracts of
articles on a certain topic like video
HTML or meaning is it static it is that
be content but is it yeah it's what's it
called something did you bit reader or
something it's a program that exists for
handling sort of large ebook content and
they have a format in this format and
they have the reader for it for Windows
Mac Linux pong Pocket PC it's a really
impressive list on this thing but
currently they only do a German language
Edition now we don't have English
version yet we've talked a bit with
Mandriva the Linux publisher about the
possibility they might include some
English French Portuguese versions I
don't think that's finished yet I don't
know if they're still working on that or
not but we do publish regular sort of
raw dumps of all the content from the
site and our software is free so if you
have the will and the money I guess you
can take that and publish it in whatever
whatever form you like as long as you're
working with the license and some people
have taken advantage of that to produce
some cool stuff and others are still
kind of talking about it what's the
economic model for the media
will it sustain the kind of growth
you're looking for well what we have so
far is a not-for-profit corporation
primarily funded by donations we were on
a fundraiser drive a couple of times a
year we also kind of put out feelers for
grants and things so obviously we don't
get a huge budget from that but we do
get enough to make it work surprisingly
well our yearly budget this year I think
is something like a half a million
dollars for you know several hundred
servers and like three staff and yet
here we are serving thousands of pages a
second at a sort of level of traffic
that multi-million dollar companies may
be some multi-billion dollar companies
are sort of next to us in the rankings
we're very much using open source
software we have some free hardware and
free network where we can get it some
discount stuff other where otherwise but
we are still an independent organization
which is committed to producing free
open-source open content material and
have it be possible to then take that
and be reproduced for for instance third
world things like the you know $100
laptop project things like that maybe
we're not serving everybody yet
obviously primarily we only serve people
who have internet access so that's only
a portion of the world but the theory at
least is a sort of a charitable act of
creating all this material for the
public via a lot of sites that clone
your content and support themselves
within
what there are some feelings up there uh
well what are you gonna do it into not
doing advertising yourself for the
moment we'll see where it goes
eventually because certainly at our
level of traffic we could make a pretty
fair chunk of money from ads the
question is do we want to and what would
that do to the community that has been
built if we do that but we might end up
doing that just because it's would be
the the most obvious way to bring in a
large chunk of cash to then grow the
organization further so it may happen it
may not it depends on sort of what the
ideological stance is
if you google absence
possible obviously this company called
Google I heard about its it's got an ad
program that's pretty good so but not I
mean not in the immediate near future
because we're still at the moment not
doing ads but if we do you know
obviously that G company is a pretty
obvious choice to talk to you so what
does that mean but it was a advantage
for the users to put it on your service
people are putting data because it's
less exactly one of the questions if you
know but then a lot of companies get you
know reams and reams of user-provided
material under very restrictive licenses
and have you know ads everywhere but so
who knows
questions better
they don't question but how are you
funded primarily through personal
donations two or three times a year
we'll run a fundraiser drive we just
have a little message at the top of the
site that says hey if you want us to
stay online in long term we do need a
little bit of money it's kind of like
you know PBS NPR or something every
month while they run a fundraiser during
you know your favorite program they
interrupt it and say please give us
money or we'll never play your program
again and you go fine here's some money
shut up so that's our primary income
from now but we're also you know feeling
here and there for grants but they tend
to be more at specific individual things
so for instance working on some
particular feature for some particular
site sometimes somebody'll get a grant
to work on that but not sort of towards
the general operating budget yes yes we
are a 501c3 whatever have you
and theoretically at least are
tax-deductible in the US the actual
information for that should be on our
site which is Wikimedia Foundation org
a lot of his money by all means who
would love to have it yes yeah the next
slide is gonna be something about that
ubiquitous acronym
and it's wondering hey how much of a
barrier between welcome Adrienne says
how much of a barrier is there to learn
the wiki markup language
this are you interested in
aggressiveness
as far as our our wacky markup languages
certainly a very hot topic these days in
the wiki world is WYSIWYG editing a
number of commercial wiki's have already
done this for a while a number of
non-commercial open-source wikis have
experimental plug-ins for it there been
a couple of people sort of experimenting
with this for MediaWiki at the moment we
aren't doing it quite yet because to
really do it reliably requires really
fixing up our markup to actually work
reliably our parser in our software is
sort of a mess of regular expressions
that have been mashed one on top of the
other for four years and they mostly
work most of the time but there's a lot
of undefined behavior there's a lot of
oh that shouldn't happen and the general
way that WYSIWYG editing works is you
produce HTML you toss it into an HTML
editor widget and then you send that
HTML back and try to convert it back to
your internal markup and that gets
really hard when you have complicated
things like we have embedded images with
captions formatting templates where the
content of some page might actually come
from another page all kinds of horrible
evil things which if we just took the
HTML and send it back all your pages
would break when you edit them so we're
kind of worried about making sure that
we do it right and compatible and not
break things all the time so that means
we have to figure out for our you know
hacked-up syntax how it actually should
work and then sort of make the
differences between how it should work
and how it does work known
and then we can fix those parts that are
broken now and just have it break once
and then it's not broken anymore and
then we can start doing both WYSIWYG
editing and also a lot more conversion
export being able to produce docbook or
open document or PDF printable versions
in a much more reliable way and being
able to have materials that are just a
machine readable in a much more useful
way so hopefully we'll get that done
this summer where you kind of have it
scheduled because people keep yelling us
at us about it and they say we want
WYSIWYG we said yeah but we need this so
we'll do this so hopefully that should
be ready later this year
I could do with some of their related
projects like I think that's in the
addiction
we have wikipedia the encyclopedia
Wiktionary the dictionary I always hate
saying that because it just sounds so
silly to put the words together we have
wiki books which is a collection of sort
of textbook materials that can be
reproduced freely a wiki quoted quote
database several other smaller ones that
I probably forget and then sort of the
more exciting ones are week immediate
Commons which is our multimedia
repository for open content and freely
licensed and public domain photographs
video files sound clips current we are
support for video files isn't as good as
we'd like it to be hopefully we'll find
someone for Summer of Code to help fix
that up and also the wiki news news
project which is certainly an
interesting experiment so that's most of
them I hope if you go to Wikimedia org
you can see them all in case I missed
some okay ah so Ajax yes this was in the
context of caching and I only have three
minutes left which is good because I'm
two slides from the end no I'm left
three slides from the end so we'll just
ignore Ajax because it's lots of cool
stuff but we also are gonna start doing
identity integration and we're gonna
support open ID in the next month we're
merging our internal login databases
which have been separate and so all
those you know fun bloggers on
LiveJournal will be able to use their
live journal ids to log in and also as
far as integrating with both client-side
bought tools for you know maintenance
and such but also mashups and taking
media content
in a convenient way and all that stuff
we're gonna be adding more web services
API is in the vein of Google and Flickr
and all those fun places and that's
basically what I just covered and yeah
that's it so last chance for questions I
guess because we're almost out of time
and no one has any more questions no
Firefox extensions to basically just put
your cursor on the word and actually
show the public to begin and that makes
a big difference for users yeah you know
transparent cool little you know click
on something there it goes would
definitely be very exciting there are
some experimental plugins for doing
things like when you hover over a link
it fetches the first few paragraphs of
the article so you can preview something
very quickly that's you know pretty
similar to a lot of my sites like
Netflix for instance it's pretty similar
to that but there's all kinds of really
cool experimental things that even users
are doing we have a system on the site
where they can plug in their own
JavaScript for their own login which is
kind of similar to what
greasemonkey for instance provides but
with any browser because it doesn't
require an external plugin so there's a
lot of exciting work being done by users
and other people and hopefully we'll
sort of be able to push more of that out
okay a little bit yeah but hopefully
that's the kind of thing that we can
cache very effectively in which case it
becomes much less of a load
and you're ready for listening to our
cool stuff and by all means visit the
site you know say good things about your
company but don't you know cheat on your
article that's no fair so okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
