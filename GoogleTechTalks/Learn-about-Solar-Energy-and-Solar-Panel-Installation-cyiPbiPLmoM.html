right
great okay thank you so much for having
us that's really appreciated all right
and the technology works okay first of
all before I start let me ask um a
little bit about you all how many of you
know absolutely nothing about solar
energy or just okay how many of you know
a little bit and are interested
potentially in solar energy for your
home ok fair number how many of you know
a fair amount about it pretty extensive
and want to ask you know want to quiz me
pretty extensively all right ok great
excellent ok so a pretty good range
that'll help me in terms of how much I
spend time on different things this is
what we're going to go over and feel
free to ask me questions will be time
both at the end and during my
presentation this is we're going to
cover kind of the basics of solar energy
we're going to focus on photovoltaics
basically solar electricity for your
home today I'll touch on some of the
other technologies the process for
installing a system on your home and in
that context things to ask questions to
ask and things to look for when you're
thinking about solar energy we're going
to go over some examples focusing on the
economics of solar and they're going to
go over some interesting solar energy
myths or some things that people think
about that may or may not be true and
then of course we'll have time for
questions and answers there are two
basic types of solar energy there's a
lot of talk in the marketplace about
solar technologies and it's really a
fascinating area if for research and
development today which was one of the
reasons what makes it so interesting and
just to give you a little bit of
background about myself I actually
learned about solar energy in high
school when I was on the debate team
which is kind of a embarrassing secret
but in order for me to start a company
though I did this as Joe mentioned I
published two white papers I've done an
extensive amount of research and before
I bought our fairly large solar energy
system for our home we have a 16
kilowatt system at my home and that's
because our house is kind of large and
it was built before anybody thought
about the idea of energy conservation or
building a home with the idea of energy
efficiency as you can tell I interviewed
over 25 solar installers and dealers
and believe me if I weren't thinking
about starting a company and getting
into the business I would have I
definitely wouldn't have gone through
that process and none of you should ever
have to do that so and that's part of
the reason why I founded Betty's solar
because nobody should have to go through
that there are two basic types of solar
energy basically they're solar electric
and I break these into two categories
there's photovoltaic crystalline silicon
which is most of the regular types of
panels that you see today and those are
the types of panels that are out on top
of the car ports out in the parking lot
there's a Morpha silicon which is
confusingly called thin film and it's
the kind of flexible panel that often
rolls is roll down on metal rooftops and
so forth and then there's the new kind
of thin film which is either different
kind of element entirely from silicon or
it's silicon mixed with other kinds of
elements and sometimes the benefit is
that it can achieve higher efficiency or
doesn't use silicon because currently
there's a shortage of silicon which is
kind of ironic because of the abundance
of silicon in the Earth's crust but
anyway there are a variety of
technologies many startups which I'm
sure you've heard of that are working on
some of these thin film technologies
which use a much smaller amount of
substrate to create electricity the
problem with the this kind of amorphous
silicon is or the benefit of it is that
it can be flexibly used it requires a
plastic substrate so you don't it can be
much more inexpensively created however
and it uses less silicon however it's
less efficient so you need about twice
as much of it in terms of area as you do
a traditional crystalline silicon panels
so if you have a lot of area it could be
a beneficial solution for you but if you
are have a rooftop typically a
residential rooftop unless you have a
huge house it's not going to work for
you concentrating solar is um it
actually uses photovoltaic cells in a
much smaller quantity and they actually
use parabolic troughs to concentrate the
solar rays to generate the electricity
I'm not going to talk about this at all
today there's also a lot of interesting
startups in this area solar thermal as
you're familiar heats pools also is used
for domestic hot water heating radiant
heating and homes and so forth solar
thermal today for pool heating and
domestic hot water can do
wonders for your home in the 80s there
were a lot of unscrupulous dealers who
put up fairly poorly designed systems
which then broke down and caused a lot
of roof leaks and that's when people
when you hear people say Oh sollars
really unreliable and bad that's
probably what they're thinking of the
dealers that you're that you work with
today for the most part do really well
engineered InDesign systems and pretty
much don't have to deal with that and
you can get very economical and great
payback on these systems they're about
40% efficient which is actually way
better than pretty much any electrical
system of any kind so or not that you're
going to get I'm not gonna be dealing
with that today I'm just going to be
focusing this on photovoltaic any
questions so far
I'm actually interested cool and look
I'm actually interested in both because
we in our new house that we're have a
pool and we have a house right um so I
really want to figure out how to
trade-off between the two um good
question question is um I'm interested
in both I want to heat my pool and I
also want electricity and that's often a
question that people have they get
interested in one they put something up
on their roof and then they're
interested in another and that is
actually a goal that a number of solar
companies have is how do we manage to
meet both needs and down the road that's
a product that we actually hope to offer
is a combined solar thermal electric
product that basically uses the same
roof space to provide both benefits it's
a little bit more complicated than it
sounds and basically with some good
planning you can provide both and
basically it's mostly space management
you might end up having to use some of
your yard and some of your roof or just
figure out solar thermal is a little bit
less sensitive to exactly where it's
placed on the roof as opposed to solar
electric and if you find a good provider
or two good providers or somebody who
does both they can give you a good
installation that will meet both your
needs and also pool pool pumps actually
use up a ton of electricity we have a
pool which is one reason why we have
such a ridiculous solar array and that's
something to think about the some of the
biggest drivers of solar electricity
demand are pools air conditioning and
teenager
so I'm just on the electricity side
alone I'm not going to spend a ton of
time is your typical venture capitalist
kind of slide but solar in the u.s. is
growing hugely part of it is because
it's growing off of a tiny tiny base but
there is a lot of demand both because of
people's growing environmental concerns
and the fact that the cost of
electricity is skyrocketing mostly
because we're cluing in like the rest of
the world the cost of energy is
expensive
but there's been a ton of investment in
solar technology because of all these
things and we're seeing a lot of growth
how solar energy works basically you
have solar panels on a roof or they can
be mounted on the ground and your em in
your yard on a roof on a ground mount
rather the solar panels of the silicon
actually when they're arranged properly
in two different layers they create a
semiconductor which produce direct
current which is then converted to
alternating current by the inverter
which is typically mounted on the side
of your house somewhere doesn't have to
be but somewhere near your electric
meter grid-tied systems which is what
which is typically that's what you get
rebates for and so forth they're public
policy reasons for that we're trying to
offload the the load on the grid
basically with distributed power they
allow you to use the utility grid as a
battery why not have batteries well
batteries are a pain in the neck to
maintain you have to replace them every
7 years or so you also have to balance
your electric loads inside your house
very carefully if you have batteries off
the grid living sounds great but it's
actually kind of a pain to to engineer
and live on if you use the grid as your
battery that means that whenever it's
cloudy raining or nighttime you can just
pull power off of the grid and it's not
a hassle at all so and the other benefit
the bat is economical net metering
meaning means you're able to sell any
excess power you produce back to the
utility I have this qualifier up to a
point in California you can sell any
excess power you produce up to the point
that you zero out your bill this is
something that was put in to protect the
utilities from lots of people putting in
so much solar that they were being on
basically becoming individual utilities
now core
all of us don't have the money to do
that so I think it's kind of an
unrealistic concern on the part of the
utilities so what happens then is if you
buy and effect too much solar energy or
too much
you know too many solar panels you're
basically making a donation back to PG&amp;amp;E
or whoever your utility is like they
need it right so that's basically how
solar works any basic questions on this
it's a rule in California and some other
states but it is a state-by-state rule
I eventually expect this this might go
away and it you know it's purely a
political consideration basically and
it's you know it's question of lobbyists
you know and there are there are a lot
of rules like this which have gone back
and forth in favor of consumers versus
the utility this is under need to spend
a whole lot of time on this just
statistic electricity rates in
California on average have increased
about 6% per year over the last 25 years
or so a nationwide it's an average of
about 3% per year in the Midwest for
example where there are other places
where there's a lot of nuclear power and
the grid that tends to bring the average
down but places like the west coast and
the East Coast where you have much
higher average rates of each of
electricity the increases tend to have
been a lot higher which means that solar
energy ironically is a much better deal
for us on each coast let me ask another
question of you all how many of you are
interested in solar energy for basically
environmental reasons okay great how
many well ok I'll get to that how many
of you are interested in solar for
purely or for mostly economic reasons
just how much money you can save okay
and how many of you are interested in
solar for both okay
pretty good and of course a lot of us
it's both right or you know some mix of
the two obviously for you as an
individual it does lock in lower
electricity rates over the next you know
thirty thirty actually even forty years
potentially and it's a very low
maintenance cost you basically have to
hose off your panels you might have to
replace your inverter after about ten or
fifteen years for the individual in the
community obviously it's it's a
renewable resource
it's
it doesn't produce smog or noise it does
strengthen our electrical grid when you
have distributed power meaning power
produced at your location that means it
doesn't produce the need to increase our
just our electrical grid or capacity on
the grid and so forth distribution cost
and in fact in one of the the papers
that I wrote one of the biggest social
benefits in terms of cost benefits to
the taxpayers was the neat the the lack
of need to increase cob grid or upgrade
the grid basically or the ability to
delay those costs was billions and
billions of dollars it's like six
billion dollars which obviously has
taxpayers is a pretty huge benefit or
you know as ratepayers
yes there have been Studies on that
about the you know the environmental
benefit or the energy impact and all of
that and especially when you compare to
other energy methods you know coal-fired
plants and that sort of thing
solar power I don't remember it I don't
recall the exact statistics but the
energy payback is is very positive you
payback on solar panels really quickly
in terms of the energy put in to produce
them versus the energy that they put out
so good question though
and obviously it increases our energy
independence no matter where you are on
this whole you know a rack question the
more energy we produce within our
country obviously the less reason we
have to do stuff overseas quick thing on
market research and trends you know are
the research that we've done for both
installers and builders as well as
homeowners is that we're kind of in the
Model T stage of solar in terms of or
it's like the public better analogies
it's like the PC industry in the 80s
where you know kinda have to cobble
together parts to get a working system
and more and more people are saying hey
I want it to be like an appliance I
wanted to be like a refrigerator or a
hot tub that I can plug in I want a
standard thing I want it to look nice on
my house and I don't want it to be you
know some sort of mystery kit that I
hope somebody can put together
competently on my house and that's where
you know where all sorts of systems home
systems electronics and so forth have
gone and solar energy systems are going
in exact same direction that's all the
market research that we've proprietarily
researched and went and we've seen it
corroborated another third-party
research as well so steps for installing
solar today it's still it's still a
multi step process but we're working and
other companies are working to shrink
those down and make them more
user-friendly first determine if you're
a good candidate for solar some of these
are you really need to have a
residential electric bill and that's
just electric not electric and gas
combined of $75 a month or more the
higher that is obviously the bigger the
better candidate you are for solar
it should be an unshaded you should have
an unshaded roof area or area in your
yard if you're considering a ground
mount for at least four hours a day the
less shade you have the better how do
you determine that well you can just
observe your yard if you have time
it helps to look at it over the whole
year well that takes a long time one of
the ways you can do it is you can have
somebody come out with one of these
devices this is a solar Pathfinder and
if any of you are interested at
lunchtime I can show you how one of
those things work it work it it's
incredibly simple but it shows you the
shading over the entire year so you
don't have to you know do a solar study
over a whole year you can just pretty
much determine it in about a minute
which is great because it looks can be
deceiving what looks like is unshaded
now could be completely shaded during
the middle of the summer when you
actually would have most of your solar
production and that's very important to
know but basically as long as you have a
minimum of four hours a day you know you
can do it with solar you want to have a
roof that's faithing facing south or
Southwest next best is west west or
south east a slanted roof is better than
a flat roof although their commercial
roof tops that have flat roofs all the
time a lot of these things if you don't
have these ideal situations you'll just
get a lower rebate which means your
payback time will be longer but it
doesn't mean that you know you're just
completely out of the ballpark for solar
completely out of the ballpark for solar
would be you know trees completely on
top of your house and really it comes
down to your own personal considerations
if you are completely committed to
having solar you know you may get a
lower rebate or you may need a smaller
system just because your house
conditions aren't great but you can
still make it work and I would ask a lot
of tough questions to an installer who
is saying you know you can install a
huge system if it just doesn't look like
it's going to make sense also if you
have partial shade in some area it's
worth it to go with a smaller array that
avoids the shade then go for a bigger
array because the shade will actually
detract from the overall performance of
your of the parts of the array that are
even in the sunlight then consider your
budget that's probably the two things
that are really the biggest
considerations of how much solar you
should buy really are your own budget
and the amount of roof space you have a
lot of companies the first step they'll
ask you to do is say get out twelve
months of your of your electric bill and
we'll calculate all this stuff well
before you even do that think about how
much money do I want to spend and how
big is my roof or my yard space if you
want to put it on the ground because
even if your electric bill is a thousand
dollars a month if you only have a tiny
roof or if you're only willing to spend
ten thousand dollars
that's the end of the discussion right
there and then you need to then you've
after that after you have answered those
two questions then you do need to think
about how much electric how much
electricity do I use and then what is
your rate structure and do you have the
infamous pantyhose chart we've we call
this our our our pantyhose chart or our
fruit of the Loom underwear chart
because um when I was doing my research
on solar the first question I would ask
the question everybody asks is well how
much solar do I need and nobody would
answer this question it was um and we
had long discussed how you know when you
buy underwear right or you know just
like whatever a Target or whatever you
know there's if there's those charts
that have you know like my height is
this and my weight is this right and
then you look in the middle and there's
like you know your size ABCD right it
should be just like that and it's not
quite that simple but we've developed a
pretty well okay it doesn't look simple
at all I know but it's something that
we're working on it but it's a lot
simpler in that once you go through
these steps you can figure out okay when
I figure out how much electricity I want
to eliminate then I can determine okay
this is how many kilowatts roughly I
need and based on that then you can and
it has to do with what your rate
structure is from your local utility now
let me ask another question here how
many people are PG&amp;amp;E customers okay how
many are Palo Alto utility customers
okay how many somebody else like Santa
Clara okay all right so mostly Palo Alto
is a flat rate utility PG&amp;amp;E as we all
know has the tiered utility rates with
PG&amp;amp;E you're really what you want to do
is cut off those top tiers the more
expensive the more you use the more
expensive it gets
with Palo Alto since it's flat it really
you know it doesn't you can it's pretty
much determined by your budget how much
you want to eliminate it with solar but
the idea here is what we've done is
we've decided we will identify it okay
you if you want to eliminate this many
kilowatt hours per month of usage this
is how many kilowatts of solar you want
and we can this is available to look at
and we've got some handouts here for
later but basically once you've decided
that and that's really up to you and
we'll find a lot of installers we want
to push a lot of solar on
but it's really not that's nest not
necessarily in your interest because as
I said before if you buy too much solar
you're and you're making a donation to
the utility which while it's
contributing more solar to environment
reducing co2 and so forth which is a
good thing if you're going to make a
charitable donation you might want to
make that to a different organization
environmentally I mean that's and that's
totally up to you some people do decide
to do that choose your solar vendor and
arrange for financing if you want and
we'll talk about that Elizabeth will
talk about that in a moment and then you
go through you have people come out and
make site visits and you get contracts
and so forth then you have your
installation which typically doesn't
take very long maybe you like a week
maybe two if it's a huge system then
you're into solar energy production and
an important note you do not need to
cover your whole bill to make a positive
benefit for you economically at all in
fact if you're a PG&amp;amp;E customer just
knocking off that top tier of usage
could be a very small percentage of your
actual kilowatt hours but it could make
a big impact on your bill and obviously
if everybody does a little bit from an
environmental standpoint it's like
recycling if everybody recycles a little
it has a big impact and then submitting
the paperwork to get the rebate your
installer should help you a lot with
that and it's you know it's like taxes
it's a pain in the neck but everybody
has to do it kind of thing but your
installer to help with that I've talked
about a lot of this already size of the
system I think I've covered this if you
want to basically eliminate your top
tiers if you're in a tiered pricing
situation cost of a system typically for
residential systems range from about 10
kilowatts to 50 kilowatt $10,000 to
$50,000 or up depending on the size of
your home
aesthetics okay see if I can do this um
No
oh right right right sir okay I'm kind
of a PowerPoint troglodyte here
Elizabeth so training me how to do these
things okay this is um one of the few
plugs they'll make for ready solar but
um a lot of people totally buy into the
idea of solar economically solar
environmentally but you know either they
their spouse their you know neighbors or
whatever just completely hate the looks
and this is what a traditional solar
system looks like and you know it's kind
of it's an economically rational issue
because you know that if your home is
your largest asset which for some people
it is you don't want to detract from its
curb appeal so you know you might want
something that's more aesthetically
appealing you can do something like
these are ready solar systems or you can
do solar integrated tiles which which
are flat they're built into the roof
that makes more sense if you're
replacing your whole roof or you're
looking at new construction which you
know obviously it's built flat into the
roof so you have a much more attractive
you know look of the system which is a
big issue for people so something to
consider the other things are what kind
of incentives you have do you get
rebates right now there's a two thousand
dollar federal tax credit maybe in this
administration probably not in this
administration but hopefully in another
administration there will extend that
federal tax credit to be up to 30% of
the value of the system and also does
your utility offer net metering Palo
Alto and PG&amp;amp;E do then also return on
investment those are your own criteria
you know how important is that to you at
what time scale do you want to earn your
money back and so forth how else can you
invest your money is you know are you
considering that at all and then what
environmental goals some people care a
lot about that and want to do solar no
matter what some people don't care at
all
yeah I swear I don't have an
unauthorized copy of Vista but okay okay
um I think I've covered this as well but
basically what solar enables you to do
is if this is your typical tiered
electric bill with PG&amp;amp;E or another
similar utility you have a high marginal
electric bill
before solar then once you a step when
once you put in your PV basically that
what that does is that lopped off the
top tears even if you're not covering
your whole bill because covering your
whole bill you're actually going to be
paying for electricity that cost less
because the investor-owned utilities are
required to offer that electricity at
actually below market rates but what it
does is that it whacks off that
electricity which is really high
inexpensive and that's where they're
going to be increasing their mark their
rates over the next several years so
your electric bill even though you know
your usage your actual kilowatt hours
might not be that high in that area it's
um the dollar value is very high so
that's just a graphic representation of
what I was talking about before so now
we're going to go through some examples
and I will hand it over to Elizabeth
who's going to talk some more this is
forward and that's back so that will
just go through the bill all right so
I'm going to go through some examples to
give you an idea of what the economics
are associated with installing a solar
energy system so a first example
homeowner number one is a PG&amp;amp;E customer
and as Meredith mentioned PG&amp;amp;E has a
upward tiered rate structure there's
five tiers so the objective for this
homeowner is to eliminate their top
tiers which are four and five from their
their usage they have an average monthly
bill presently of about 120 dollars and
40 cents which equates to a monthly
usage of five hundred and sixty seven
kilowatt hours they have opted not to
use financing to pay for their solar
energy system they're just going to pay
for the system upfront and they're going
to install a system that that will
provide twenty five hundred kilowatts of
capacity the cost associated with this
size system including sales tax
installation taking into consideration
the PG&amp;amp;E rebate and the federal tax
credit is about fifteen thousand dollars
a little bit more decison
whoa this size system will provide solar
energy production of about 300 kilowatt
hours and that's energy that the
homeowner is not having to purchase from
PG&amp;amp;E and as a result of that they can
expect an estimated monthly PG&amp;amp;E savings
of about eighty six dollars and 53 cents
so that's significant and this number is
not taking into consideration the
projected increase in retail electricity
rates going forward so this number would
actually increase with time sorry you're
correct it's it's two point five I stand
corrected
so you're going to see that again
I'm sorry when it what if I can actually
interject is this this is our you were
using our 2500 right oh the question was
um when it's rated at actually I've got
I've got my thing so I'm okay question
was when it's rated at 2.5 kilowatts it
doesn't actually produce that much and
this is an area of significant confusion
with solar because there are DC Watts
and AC Watts DC watch being the direct
current AC being the alternating current
that we're all familiar with the reason
why you'll often see things rated in DC
Watts is because they're a smaller unit
or so if you divide things by that price
looks lower and AC while it's obviously
or more we can relate to in terms of our
own electricity bills
in this case we when you are calculating
the kilowatt hours did you use AC Watts
right so the short answer to your
question is yes you always need to ask
that question is this AC or DC and
typically in order to get your rebate
you have the Installer needs to convert
everything ac
and there's actually the California
Energy Commission which regulates all
this they actually created a separate
rating system because panel manufacturer
solar panel manufacturers were when they
would say okay this is a say for example
a 200 watt panel that was it would
produce 200 watts if you were at 0
degrees C with basically with lighting
conditions producing a thousand watts
per meter squared you know basically
perfect conditions which would never
happen in your yard you know and so what
the California Energy Commission did is
they actually set up separate testing
conditions in which they now subject all
the solar panels to which are sold in
California so anything that you buy has
to be
in order for you to qualify for a rebate
has to be listed on the CEC website and
they have for example if it says for
example the panels that that we sell are
they're listed as 180 watt panels DC but
when they're their actual AC watt rating
is 159 and that's you know based on
real-world temperatures and you know
etcetera etcetera and real-world
lighting conditions and so what we've
done is when we when we look at what
output they're likely to produce we use
the CEC numbers and then they also have
to account for what inverter you're
using because the inverters also have a
little bit of efficiency loss they're
temper you know anywhere from 90 to 96
percent efficient typically it's you
have to multiply your that lower panel
rating times you know whatever the
percentage of the inverter is and that
gives you your Watts and then that's
what you get your that's what your
rebate is based on plus a whole bunch of
other factors you know is your roof
south-facing and all this other stuff so
anyway when Elizabeth was calculating
the rebate in the net cost that's all
included in there is that does that kind
of answer your question is that leave
you more to choose sorry
that's DC that's DC and it's about a
Boop and it's about two point I have to
pull out our price list and look it's
about it's about 2.2 kilowatts DC I'm
sorry what this is doing is a power
number of e4
right
typically that yeah the calculation
would be number of kilowatts times five
or five point five or five point for
whatever typically in this area is to
dually about between five and five point
five and then times 365 days because
five point five is an average for the
year you'll get many more in the summer
and much less than the where Eglinton
so does that so are you questioning the
300 yeah yeah okay did you have a
question okay so move on to the next
example
mmm homeowner number two is a city of
Palo Alto utilities customer and as
Meredith mentioned flat rate structure
my understanding is that presently the
rate is about seven cents per kilowatt
hour and I know we have some some Palo
Alto residents here so let me know if
it's something otherwise the objective
here of this homeowner is to add solar
add some solar and stay within their
fifteen thousand dollar budget
presently their average monthly bill is
is pretty low it's 3969 and that's
because of the flat rate structure and
they're only paying seven cents per
kilowatt hour for their energy from the
utility they've also opted to not use
financing to pay for their system solar
capacity that they plan to install in
this case is one point two five
kilowatts of capacity so again I
apologize for the error there the cost
associated with this size system
including sales tax installation taking
the rebate that the Palo Alto utilities
provides as well as the federal tax
credit into consideration is about seven
thousand dollars and this size system
will provide monthly solar energy
production of about 150 kilowatt hours
taking into consideration that that's
energy that this homeowner actually will
avoid paying the utility for this Homer
home owner would enjoy a monthly savings
of about $10.50 so you can see there's a
really significant difference between a
an upward tiered rate structure and a
flat rate structure so you know
basically same amount of energy usage to
begin with the Palo Alto resident has
opted to install a little less capacity
but even if the Palo Alto resident
installed as much capacity as the first
homeowner their monthly savings would
only be about $20 so you can really see
the difference between the different
types of rate structures and then
finally a homeowner number three another
PG&amp;amp;E customer their objective also is to
eliminate those top tiers and just to
give you an idea tier five the cost per
kilowatt hour is actually 37 cents as
compared to 1111 and a half cents at the
baseline and they also want to use
financing to pay for their system
presently their average monthly bill is
almost $200 which equates to a monthly
usage of about 781 kilowatt hours as I
mentioned they are planning to use
financing to pay for the system they
plan to install 3.5 kilowatts of solar
capacity and the cost associated with
this size system including sales tax and
the installation and they're actually
going to finance the entire cost of the
system up front so the federal tax
credit and rebate are not taken into
consideration here in terms of the total
cost twenty seven thousand nine hundred
and eighteen dollars which will that
size system will result in monthly solar
energy production of about four hundred
and fifty kilowatt hours and by not
purchasing that amount of electricity
from PG&amp;amp;E this homeowner will enjoy
monthly saving
about a hundred and fifty dollars so
that's pretty significant and based on a
couple of assumptions relative to
financing their monthly payment based on
using the financing would be a hundred
and forty dollars so you can see that
they're actually putting the money that
they otherwise would have been giving to
PG&amp;amp;E to take care of those higher tiered
usages towards investing in a solar
system and a solar energy system and and
really an asset and once they pay for
that they will actually start to enjoy
you know something more than a hundred
and fifty dollars per month in savings
especially as electricity rates continue
to increase and another thing I'd add to
that is this is um these uh financing
vehicles are all home equity loans so
the interest that's paid on these is all
tax-deductible assuming you haven't
already maxed out your home equity your
home equity loan I think you are you're
able to take out I think I think it's up
to I can't remember I can't I don't
recall what they what the upward limit
is but you can deduct the interest on
home equity loans so you can also then
get additional tax savings off of this
so your actual cash flow you're actually
much we were actually more cashflow
positive than this appears here
Greece is valuable
maybe up to the amount
the in California right now and actually
I know in California for sure that the
solar energy systems are taxed our
property value exempt so they're not
supposed to impact the value of your
property I mean are you asking um in oh
if you sell your house right there have
been studies which have said that
basically the argument is that if you
reduce the operating cost of your home
by for example putting on you know
renewable energy that sort of thing that
you'll recoup that twenty to one now
that sounds great but however if it's
you know completely ugly on the front of
your house let's face it that's just not
realistic I think it's a very subjective
thing I think as more and more people
are viewing solar as a positive thing if
it's aesthetically appealing then I
think it'll be a positive you know if
it's ugly it's just not going to fly as
electric rates increase it's going to
become more and more important with
people some empirical examples are for
example in the Sacramento area where the
utility up there has been very proactive
in encouraging home developers of
developments to put in solar
developments like literally you know
across the highway from one another
developments with solar have sold out
much more quickly and at slightly higher
prices than developments without solar
so things like that and we're seeing
that in this housing slump for example
homes with solar tend to sell you know
multiple days quicker than homes without
solar not necessarily at a price premium
but you know we're in a rough housing
situation so but selling days quicker
that's you know time is money so I think
as we see more data points because
they're so literally so few houses today
with solar that all those differences in
terms of comparables and stuff it's very
hard to get some good comparables of
homes I don't think there's good data
and I think if somebody comes to you
I've seen a lot of quotes that say it's
going to increase your home value by
forty five thousand dollars or you know
above the cost of the system you know
frankly I just don't believe that that's
also like the person who comes to you
and says you can deduct the entire
value of the solar system because you
know as a business because you have a
home office in the back room you know I
don't buy it
I think it's over time I think if you do
it you know a nicely installed system
and so forth I think it will benefit you
but you do have to take all those things
into consideration
home owner 3 they got $8,500 of credit
to rebase those were actually taken oh
the question was um home owner 3 got
$8,500 of credits and rebates but what
about homeowner wanted to have to come
up with with these two numbers but
because number 3 is financing they have
to finance entire upfront cost because
they're not going to receive the rebate
and the federal tax credit until
sometime later and sometimes depending
on how your installer works sometimes
the installer will carry the rebate so
you might not have to finance the rebate
part okay
against each line you know
they haven't published the question is
do we know the rate of increase of pee
genies rates over the next several years
they haven't published what those rate
increases are going to be they've gotten
a package increase over the next couple
of years of I think it's like six
hundred million dollars but they haven't
published exactly in what rate tiers
those are going to be the warning has
been that it's going to hit large
residential customers the heaviest
because commercial customers have
complained heavily that they're all
going to move out of state and that
they've already been hit heavily they
are legislatively prohibited from
impacting the smaller rates also what
they've done in some cases is the
baseline rate the cheap rate stays the
same but the number of kilowatt hours
that you can use in that rate before you
get bumped up to the higher rate shrinks
so it's still 11 and a half cents but
you only can use you know 100 kilowatt
hours before you get bumped up so
there's lots of different ways the
prices can change if you're ever curious
or you have insomnia you can go to the P
genie website and if you search under
tariffs Electric tariffs you can
actually find the rate schedule and see
exactly read all the read all about it
and see how electricity is price it's
kind of like airline price schedules but
it's pretty arcane but it's also as you
can see pretty complicated and there's
lots of different ways to you know
extract money from selling electricity
so anyway electricity is projected to
increase and they typically publicize
these things they're their regulatory
early required to publish the rate
increases several months in advance then
there's a public comment period and so
forth but usually once that's done it's
pretty much a done deal okay some solar
energy myths Solar is not cost-effective
well it is if you size your system
correctly and I think we've covered a
bad it depends on you know which utility
or you're at and what your objectives
are it definitely can save you money and
be especially if you look at we didn't
cover this in detail but we've got
actually a great article by a gentleman
named Andy Black who's a solar financial
analyst who's done tons of analysis of
how whether or not solar saves you money
and if you look at the rate of increase
of electricity over
and the idea of investing in a solar
system around now you can really see the
benefits of fixing your electric costs
anyway we've got that article it's up on
our website we've also got copies here
today one issue that I think it's
important to address is the idea that
you need to get the most efficient
panels some people will try to sell you
this and there's also you know kind of
this idea that you know you need to get
the panels with the highest efficiency
whether they're you know fourteen
percent or you know some manufacturers
advertise twenty percent that's in a lab
not in reality and really the market is
pretty efficient the higher the
efficiency the panel the more expensive
it's going to be so you're paying for
that and in many cases you're paying
more for that it's like a fancy car and
unless you have a tiny tiny roof you
really if you have you know if you have
a space it's better to buy a lower
efficiency panel because you're just
sucking in sunlight and there is no
benefit to having more efficient panels
you're not getting any more energy out
of it you're just pulling the same
amount of electrons and if you have one
more panel that will just bring in the
same amount of electrons and if you have
one very efficient panel instead of to
medium efficient panels it's much more
you know it's much smarter economically
to have two medium efficient panels that
cost a lot less than one really high
efficiency panel so don't let anybody
sell you high efficiency panels unless
you really really need them because you
only have 10 square feet of roof space
something I've seen advertised a lot is
you know so-and-so has a five dollar
electric bill thanks to such and such
well yeah every time you get a solar
energy system you get for the first 11
months of the year you get a five dollar
electric bill but that's because of how
net metering works you get a net meter
you get a five dollar electric bill and
your regular say PG&amp;amp;E envelope but then
you also get this really arcane
statement comes in an envelope that
looks like this and actually I have to
give PGE credit they've improved last
year when we first got our system going
we this thing was like 10 pages long it
was like it had like you know every
meter tick on it and now it's only like
three pages long but it's it's called a
true up statement and it talks about it
shows like how many what the meter did
and the difference between what how much
went out pounds
came in and you know you might be
tempted to say and throw it away however
at the end of the year in December you
will get a comparison bill which will
then tell you how much you owe the
company if you don't have if your solar
wasn't enough to cover your entire bill
and if you say only have a couple of
kilowatts and you have and your usage
say before you got solar would say you
know 300 bucks a month or something you
can end up owing a few thousand dollars
to PG&amp;amp;E so don't be surprised even
though you had a five dollar electric
bill all during the year and that's just
the way it works and PG if you call PG&amp;amp;E
and say what's this they'll just say
well you just need to put money aside
during a year that's the way it works
that doesn't that's nothing wrong with
your solar your sellers been working
fine that's just how PG&amp;amp;E works and most
other utilities as well so don't be
surprised it's best to wait for the new
technologies this is another you know
with all the press about thin film and
all the startups around here and
everything there are a lot of people who
you know think just like you know new
computers coming out every six months
and stuff like that why not wait for the
new ones well the reality is a lot of
these are five to ten years away and in
fact a lot of the thin film companies
who you know even we're saying we're a
month away from production first of all
a lot of these are aimed at commercial
markets and not residential markets and
secondly a lot of the ones who thought
they were a month away from production
that was a year ago and they're still
not in production because a lot of this
stuff is really you know pretty
different from what's being done now so
if you are looking at getting a return
on your own investment it's probably
wise to go ahead and do something now
you know unless you're just interested
in studying the technology and you know
you didn't buy a microwave until 1990
it's it they really are farther out than
it sounds
covered this you don't need to cover
your whole electric bill to make it
worthwhile even a couple of you know one
or two kilowatts if it fits your needs
that's what you should do also covered
this you don't need perfect conditions
you know your roof doesn't need to be in
full Sun all day
perfectly south-facing etc you might get
a lower rebate but again that's you know
that'll just affect some of your
economic payback if you really want to
go solar
you know you can and then you know PV is
hopelessly ugly chances are you wouldn't
be in this audience if you thought that
so you know that's also you can also
there are different options out there to
make PD look better so any other
questions beliefs or whatever that I
should cover up I'm sorry have the tediz
sales rate over time the efficiency over
the 30 to 40 year life of the of the
cells they are warranted they're
guaranteed by almost all manufacturers
to retain 80% of their efficiency which
sound you know that sound like a pretty
big drop but that's over 30 or 40 years
so they're there it's a pretty slow
degradation curve and actually
interestingly enough there are some
studies that some of the National Energy
labs are doing which indicate that that
curve actually happens like right when
they come out of the box and then so it
drops like 15 percent and then it's like
so but we but interestingly at that
research really hasn't been quantified
yet so you know if that's true that's
kind of bad news when they come out of
the box but then that means it's pretty
steady you know it's almost like a
physical phenomenon that just happens
and then they're just there which might
mean that that is taken into account by
the testing that's done by the Energy
Commission folks and maybe that's the
reason for the drop between the lab
between the you know what the
manufacturers claim and what we actually
get huh
so um there are different versions of
those panels the old ones and are as
good as the new ones and as you said
some companies say we'll have better
ones tomorrow and the tomorrow keeps
moving but I also understand it depends
on how much you're willing to pay for
the panel's so for residential do you
have actually battery panels that cost
more if you have a small roof and then
in this the question again that you can
have half answered is the ones who are
promising better tomorrow's are we
talking a couple of percent are we
talking 10 more percent or so
being significant very good question the
question is um are there better panels
if you have a small roof you know and do
they cost more and then with the ones
who are manufacturers who are promising
something better is it 2 percent or is
it 10 percent in answer to the first
question there are some panels that are
higher efficiency if you do have a space
constrain situation and a couple of
brands that I'll mention our sanyo
panels I think those are the highest
efficiency panels on the market the
reason for that is they actually have a
layer of amorphous silicon as well as
crystalline silicon both types of
silicon in the same panel and you pay
more for that as well as Sun power
panels both those panels are also pretty
nice-looking so you get an aesthetic
benefit as well you do pay more you know
premium for that but you're also getting
a premium in production so if you have a
limited space it's probably worth it to
go for those types of panels the
companies that are saying we're going to
have something better you know soon
those tend to be companies that aren't
in production yet you know it's kind of
the old you know if you say you know
we've got to have a great version that's
coming out you know you don't want to
kill your existing product line having
people wait for the new product line the
companies are saying we've got to have
this great product that's coming out and
it's going to be you know revolutionary
etc etc those are the thin film
companies that are planning production
those tend to be again aimed at
commercial markets not residential so
they're not to be available for us you
know for another decade really and the
companies the companies are selling into
residential markets now are making slow
but steady manufacturing improvements
and those are really you know learning
curve kinds of things they're not leaps
forward in terms of new you know major
leaps forward in terms of technology
it's just we're getting smarter and
better more efficient on the factory
floor sorts of things and you know you
get the same benefits of you know as we
introduce a new model that might be a
little bit better that means the old
models are cheaper for example the array
that I bought I got sharp 160s which
actually D rated 167 s but I got a much
better price on them and I was a ground
that in my yard so I didn't need you
know I didn't have a space issue so it
was much more worthwhile for me to get
160 s that were a little less efficient
I had
a so I put them in I got a better price
so it just made a lot more sense and
allurement in Texas helps a lot so I was
wondering just how resilient are these
panels like else another great question
how resistant or solar panels to
hailstorm because that's a very good
question that people ask a lot solar
panels sold the United States have to
conform to its ul 1703 which is an
impact test so they have to conform to I
think it's a it's a half inch ball
bearing dropped from five feet or so I
don't know the exact parameters of the
test but they do have to conform to that
which is basically to designed us to
simulate fairly substantial hail and
there are when you think about it the
largest solar market in the world is
Germany right now and Germany's latitude
is about the same as the northern US and
parts of southern Alaska which gets
pretty severe weather so they you know
and they sell tons and tons of solar
panels there so they know they are and
also Japan right no no it's all there
all warranted they all have to pass that
UL test and that's an internet and it
also conforms to another international
standard as well so yeah hail is some
they've definitely covered hail cuz you
don't have to be on rooftops yeah
huh why you're saying is the beefer
inverters when you lose grip power they
also take solar panels offline yes in
California with you know
the mercy of the power companies who
decided rolling blackouts on a second
that seems to be creating idiotic
technology electrically speaking there's
no reason for that there's got to be
some cheap effective grid sensing
technology we can automatically pull
here babies off the grid I don't have
power house in our how much right right
but that's a great question the question
is why does why do the inverters take
your solar panels down when your power
goes out we now stay on the safety or
shoot but at the same time if it seems
to me that there's existing technology
that should allowed you to have I
completely agree with you
um yes the the reason why that is a
requirement for inverter manufacturers
is to prevent so-called islanding where
if you have a solar array still
functioning when the power goes out if
some poor lineman is out trying to fix
the problem he does get fried with
electricity being fed back to the grid
from your solar array totally get that
however there tons of people who have
generators which automatically come on
when the power goes out why doesn't that
you know it's because anyway that
there's there two answers one you can
get a battery backup system which you
know they are expensive but there are
good ones on the market if that is you
know a big issue for you to deal with
that although you do have to sighs
what's hooked up to the battery backup
and all that to your point however I
think that's a great it's on my list of
product innovations you know down the
road because it is stupid because a lot
of people one of their big issues in
solar is I want to have to not deal with
this especially in California and I
think there's got to be a way to deal
with the safety issue you know to
isolate the Box you know to keep the
power from going back out to the grid
and allow people to continue their power
so I think and you're right technologies
exist because people do have generators
so it's on our list I think it's like I
said I think it's stupid it's our list
it might be a legal issue and I'm sorry
I just have a question regarding why do
you advocate solar or wind power
um I mean wind power as far as I mean
I've known
about both subjects but it has a much
quicker energy payback as well as
economic payback and this area does have
a good location it has a greater payback
and depending on where you are if you're
in the Columbia River Gorge in Oregon I
think you're totally right if you are in
you know Mountain View it might not so
it wind is much more location specific
or let me just say there are places
where there are I think it depends on
where you are and I think there's a
broader solar resource in this country
and you know me I just happen to pick
solar as the horse I wanted to ride I'm
not against wind at all but I think you
know and I think there's also a role for
many different alternative technologies
in our economy so I'm not like I said
I'm not against it I think you do need
to in order for wind to be successful
you do need to make sure you've got a
good wind resource but I think that's
also good one of the kind of myths I
guess in terms of wind power that it
cannot be used in a lot of areas it's
actually not true it can be and I guess
a lot of people I guess Solar is a big
bugs kind of thing now that people want
to include but right well it's wondering
why specifically you chose right well
one of the reform is startups
perspective we wanted to focus that's
for example why you know why we didn't
focus on solar thermal you know even
though they seem very similar it's
actually you know it's a different
technology from an implementation
standpoint and so forth it's it's
different enough that we decided to just
focus on residential photovoltaic so you
know someday as we grow we might very
well include residential wind and
justjust for now we're just sticking to
our knitting here but it's not due to a
any kind of philosophical optic
opposition to it and I know there are a
number of companies that are focusing on
very small residential turbines that
require very low and can function with
intermittent wind speed kind of
situations which is great because a lot
of people do prefer that profile to
solar and it's up you know which is
great
other presses well an answer to your
question about like why does it go off
when PG&amp;amp;E shuts down you have to have a
lot more hardware you have to have a
transfer switch and typically you know
accepted very rare times of the day you
can't power your whole house so then you
have to be able to shed load within your
house automatically otherwise the system
you know the inverter would trip so
there's a lot it's a lot of wiring and
and I think that it's expensive yeah
you're going to pay probably much more
that for that than the inverter
yes I've been looking at your company's
website so it seems like you sell
pre-made solar array so what's the cost
approximately of one of your module I'm
sorry with the customer what was the
cost of one of Yamuna they range from
about ninety seven hundred dollars plus
installation which is about a thousand
dollars on top of that up to me you can
spend like seventy thousand for a 10
kilowatt you know Thank You mungus
installation so well thank you so much
appreciate your attention and I hope
I've answered some questions and its
really a pleasure to be here thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
