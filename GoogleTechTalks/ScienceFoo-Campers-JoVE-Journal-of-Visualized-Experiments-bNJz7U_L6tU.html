co-founders of Jove the Journal of
visual experimentation I'm cat Allman
with the open source programs office at
Google we are very pleased to have these
two gentlemen with us following their
participation in a Riley science foo
camp held last summer here at Google
they've come today to talk about a new
method of publishing scientific
specifically biological research and
methodology without further ado Moshe
Pritzker and Nikita Bernstein Kamala all
right it's a pleasure to introduce job
for this massive audience today and
especially the half of the audience in
this another way we met before again my
name is moshe Pritzker enjoy I'm
responsible for the science part and
Nikita Bernstein is our computer person
so questions about computers to him
about science to me so job is a video
publication for biological research and
today I'm going to tell you briefly what
you will hear today is about idea why to
publish research on video then about the
execution how to do it our business
model people behind it and why do we
think it can be interesting to Google
since we are here at Google so I will
start from immediately from the
statement of the problem there is a huge
huge problem in biological research
traditional traditional problem existing
for hundreds of years it's very
difficult to reproduce experiments in
biology so usually and without
reproduction imagine yourself to two
different teams at Google when one of
the teams cannot reproduce what which is
what is done by another team in biology
and biomedical research it's typical
both in academia in needles in an
industry in time it takes between few
weeks to few months to reproduce an
average biological
which can be published and described
maybe 10 20 years ago and here's the
best things I mean here's a good example
how it looks in reality so ah this is a
typical experiment in stem cell research
basically this experiment is one of the
is at the foundation of the cloning
approach and it's experiment about a new
creation of mouse or site where you have
mouse or site single cell and you're
supposed to take a nuclear out of this
cell and look at the description of this
experiment as typically given in
scientific journal by the group who
managed to master this experiment in the
lab and now try to convey how they did
it to to pub to scientist position the
metaphase spindle at three o clock and
hold it with the holding pipette apply
piezo pulses to penetrate the zona
pellucida there's the metaphase plate
with this nucleation piper so you can
read it a few times more and it doesn't
matter how many PhDs in biology you have
in general it's very very difficult to
reproduce this experiment and even to
understand this experiment just looking
at this description and so how it is
done in reality in reality this
experiment looks like this so this is
your side this is your to pipette one of
the Pipers goes inside of the cell takes
away is a nuclear and basically spits it
out very simple right it's and that's a
problem in today biology the concepts in
biology is so simple you can take
everyone from the street explain them
what is the cell what's the goal of the
experiment and they will understand it
yet to understand the description and
repeat it in your own lab and doesn't
matter how many your soft rating you
have is very difficult and here we look
at this of the consequences of this
problem so the printed scientific
literature for some reasons I will
describe discuss them
in the middle for some reason does not
provide an adequate description of
biological experiments then we have a
problem and inadequate knowledge
transfer in science well from here we
have low in Ephesians loaf insurance co
biomedical research if we have to repeat
the experiments again and again and
again then you know what kind of
efficiency we are talking about and from
here in the end it leads you to this
high cost for development for
development of new therapies it takes
about 1 billion dollar and 10 years to
develop a single drug not all of this is
coming from this problem but significant
part of it is coming from this problem
so um being myself in the lab for many
years and suffering personally from this
problem I began to think about the
solution just to illustrate the program
once again one day I try to in my lap I
try to repeat the experiment on stem
cells which was published two years
before in very high profile scientific
journal by the group whom I knew
personally and I was not able to do it
no one else in the lab was able to do it
my boss at Princeton where I did my PhD
sent me to Scotland where that lab was
working and doing those experiments and
that's typical in biology today we want
to learn that you really want to learn
the experiment you either spend few
years of your life or you go to that lab
if you have enough money and they kind
enough to accept you and you learn how
this experiment is done and then I began
to think how okay so what will be the
ultimate solution of this problem so the
ultimate solution should should mimic
the process which happens today in the
lab you want to learn experiment someone
has to show you so show in our H means
video so in there the best solution
would be to have a huge database where
you would have one or two videos for
every possible biological experiment and
so if we will have such a database of
videos then we will increase the
reproducibility of the experiments and
increase the efficiency of a biomedical
research across all the areas so ah ok
to build such a day
the base let's think how to build such a
database we have to show a lots of
biologists we have to have a lot so
biologists showing the experiments and
they have to have an incentive to do
that because they're busy people they're
working on their careers what would be
then thank you then I realize we should
not call our database database our
database should be called journal
because you're now scientists we offer
publications all their life is about
publication they get recognition based
on publication professional promotions
and ground and grands based on the
publication so what if instead of
database we will found a journal and so
we came with this idea of journal or
visualized experiments I think it's
better to show you now on the how it
looks in algae
okay so this is our journal visualized
experiments they're basically videos or
we call them video articles because
again we are now publication journal we
are not database via articles published
on different types of experiments for
example this video articles will tell
you how to do immunohistochemistry or in
simple words identification of different
proteins in particular mouse tissues so
let's look at loose just to mention that
all our material is open access and
publicly available online and I will
touch on the whys it and our business
models little later so and basically our
videos very much modeled after
traditional scientific articles having
an introduction and having k Epidaurus
immunohistochemistry is an efficient
means of localizing specific proteins to
their expression compartment in this
video we demonstrate a reliable method
for immunolocalization of protein in the
epidermis which we use routinely in our
laboratory so that was a now we are
going into short introduction where
scientists would introduce hi I'm Tammy
from dr. Turk sins laboratory here in
the low building of the Ottawa Health
Research Institute in the chronic
disease program today we're going to
show you so experiments shown by
scientists themselves by scientists who
know to do this experiments because I
mean they're the best source of
knowledge and again we remodel this
video's are more or less following the
current format of the traditional
scientific publications where we have
where you have introduction you have
description of the experiment and you
have a sort of discussion what's
happening okay and so starting from
introduction is equal facility we go
into the real experiment after receiving
the slides back from the core facility
you can see that the pair of
is present on the slides as a thin film
the slides are placed on a rack wrapped
with aluminum foil just like a baked
potato and incubated for five minutes at
55 degrees so and here you can see how
video is able to reduce all these
complex scientific descriptions to very
simple basically cooking methods as she
just graduate take this slide do
something put it as a potato into the
microwave but it is indeed how science
done in the real life so in a sense in a
sense we give in addition to increase
reproducibility of the field it also
makes sense more accessible to white
public now coming back so few words more
about the journal format so as a journal
you are supposed to have editorial board
so our tutorial board is about 20
professors from Harvard Princeton and H
in others places who basically we are
excited about the idea excited enough to
put your name on our journal for free
the main function is advising and
editorial advice to the journal so ok
how it all works starting from science
again academic journal as academic
journal you're supposed to have a
tutorial board we have it as academic
journal you're supposed to have sort of
review we have it and you have to be in
a pub med so pubmed is little bit more
difficult process pubmed is the database
basically list of journals are
maintained by national institute of
health and in order to be a recognized
as academic journal is supposed to be
listed there but here's the problem they
never had a video journal because all
the journals today in biology I in print
but after some negotiations and talks
and suggestions they now we are going we
are
they're going the review and in June we
expecting the final decision so
hopefully we will be there how this
video is made initially we thought it
will work like YouTube people scientists
will make the cute small videos and
we'll send it to us and show their
experiments and practice it did not
happen for the for the only one reason
in my in my perspective it's very
difficult to make a video on biological
experiment it's much more difficult to
make a video on biological experiments
and make video of myself singing and
guitar simply because our requirements
for editing and and filming are much
higher for complex processes such as
biological experiments so scientists
don't have software to edit the
experiments they don't have time to
learn this software they don't have good
Commerce so what we have to do is to
provide technical help this filming and
editing to the labs but here is a
problem the labs spread across the world
the two biggest hubs of biotech for
example years in California and
Massachusetts so in this situation what
we have done to deal with this problem
we establish this distributed network of
video production where we have
filmmakers who also have certain
experience we screen them so that they
would have a certain experience in
biological scientists and they inside
they would have experience in biological
sciences and they have a certain as a
work with on the contract with us so
every time when we need to film
something we pay them the goals a film
they give it they give the material to
us in edited form it undergoes approval
a reviewers approval in our journal it's
approved by scientists and then it is
published as video article in the farm
in the final forms that you saw a few
other aspects so web technology nikita
took care of the web technology using
the platform developed at the company he
broke before it's called c-max and it
basically graphic based database
platform that allows him to maintain all
our complex
side by himself on video online we all
source our video from V attack for the
business model we initially want you to
make our video articles open source we
wanted it to be available to all the
scientists so in so we could not use a
traditional subscription-based model of
scientific journals instead of that we
are using advertisement based model
where we expect that people who watch
our videos a scientist and therefore our
approach our journal provides provides a
platform for highly targeted
advertisement first of all for producers
of biological tools and equipment and
it's quite a big market so financing
financing came from angels so these are
points a different complex components of
job I mentioned to you signs a video
production as I mentioned to you we have
now video production network established
in 20 cities in your across entire
United States but also in Tokyo Berlin
Canada and other places that technology
Nikita can tell you more about this this
is how the platform looks and how he
implements it the design of our site the
business model again our job I receives
content from scientist and Joe would
receive advertisement from producer
research tools and scientists by
watching job they also get experience
with this research tools as they shown
in video on job and this circle would
establish basis for profitability of our
venture here the statistical data for
the market
okay how now today results vary today
after one year group we publish 200
video protocols mainly mainly produced
by labs at best u.s. and roll
universities from Harvard MIT and etc so
this we received quite a lot of
recognition in the scientific community
for example our articles now cited by
other scientific journals and our idea
again is to continue and we basically
remain a single video journal because
our approach is quite noble and it's
difficult for existing scientific
companies to integrate all these new
components like video online distributed
video production web technology so
meantime we happen enjoyed this position
on the market the team myself Nikita
Bronstein Klaus was our financier and
Aaron calls kanako to care about video
production and anindita christina nana
work muslims a tutorial part all of them
a biological scientists so and the last
part of my talk why I think we should we
can be useful to Google so Google I know
you have a couple of initiatives that
everyone is aware about one of them is
google scholar so what you have in
Google Scholar is a massive repository
of scientific articles now our videos
show methods that are using the
scientific articles so potentially each
of these scientific articles if link to
this video's can benefit because this
video shows how you do the experiments
that they described in the sink if your
car tickles therefore it can make Google
score more more useful and give certain
advantage to us
scholar for scientific community well
obviously connection with YouTube and
Google Video and Nikita would you like
to take to tell few words about
OpenSocial and one of the things that
I'm so sorry um so my understanding is
that there are a lot of initiatives at
Google with respect to social networking
OpenSocial made a big splash and we see
ourselves as a potential channel to
reach the academic and biological
industry audience so we're kind of
curious to find out whether we could
mutually benefit from using OpenSocial
in our context with respect to
advertising just a couple of words to
add the reason that we feel that
advertising model makes a lot of sense
in our case is because of really really
high cost of equipment and the
difficulty for industry to reach their
target market so we are interested in
looking how we can leverage Adsense to
help us connect with the market and
possibly keep our internal costs down
with respect to the advertising platform
yeah just to summarize again we combine
few very different components signs web
technology video online scientific
publishing model in order to create this
new method of scientific publishing
video publication I think we quite
unique in this sense and we are happy
and open to hear any ideas and explore
any possibilities for collaboration
partnership etc thank
