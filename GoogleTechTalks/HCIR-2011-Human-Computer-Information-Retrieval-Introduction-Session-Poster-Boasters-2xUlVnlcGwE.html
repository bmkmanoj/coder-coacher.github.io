to the fifth annual workshop on
human-computer interaction information
retrieval for those that haven't had a
chance to meet yet I'm Daniel tonka
laying from linkedin and it's been
extraordinary adventure to see this
conference this workshop grow from the
first time that a few of us gathered at
MIT for years ago putting via together
whatever we could Scrabble in really a
couple of months i think we had 30 maybe
40 people there and ryan flying in from
microsoft as a keynote we had stolen a
title from gary was going to be giving
our keynote today and at the end of it
wow we made it we're at a reception over
at deca uh and we was like wow so what
are we doing next year uh uh uh looks
like gianna jamie rob was meeting for
the first time and we really didn't
think good what we started this it was
just a really an experiment but uh it's
blossomed and looking at the
contributions this year looking at the
interest from academia from industry
even from press we have someone you hear
today from information today it's really
amazing to see how both the quality and
quantity of interest is grown and last
year we also started by having a a
challenge that we part of this and one
of the things i'm most excited about is
that will actually see this year the
second time a challenge associated with
a problem of information availability
the first time I've seen anything like
that done let me just give you an
overview of how the actually before I do
that I really want to also thank the
sponsors and since we have not not shown
them on the site that i will i will name
them i we we have folks who have
sponsored year after here in particular
endeca microsoft research and in fact
microsoft to sponsor the travel so if
you need to if you have not already
given kathy student travel information
please find her so that you can get
reimbursed I also want to acknowledge at
Kent State University is a sponsor this
year and of course what Google providing
this space the wonderful food we've had
and a huge amount of support so Dan
Russell's tirelessly helps this and I
want to single out his help hence the
coffee so let me just point to a today's
schedule hopefully some of you were at
the reception dinner last night and
enjoyed the recent not your continental
breakfast our supposed to come with
bacon and coconut fritters but no
complaints Savoy nipple confidence
you're in the welcome now what we're
going to do momentarily is invite the
folks who have posters and in this case
really just the folks in the poster
sessions and not the other ones to come
up here and just briefly introduce what
you will be talking about one minute
that's a maximum not a minimum I'll keep
time and really this is just a quick
teaser without slides because I what's
going to happen later in the day after
lunch is that we will have posters on
the walls here you're also welcome to
use that time to show demos and I even
if you are presenting a paper in
particular if you're one of the
challenge participants I encourage you
to use this time for for live
interaction uh but right after that
session at a 10 we'll have Gary martini
giving the keynote an HCI are now the
tricky part will have a break some more
coffee and then the first set of paper
presentations and the the presentations
are actually there think they're on an
unlisted link but we do have the order
here
what you'll see for the presentations is
we have long and short ones so these are
15 minutes and five minutes we've broken
them up into two sessions so 3 15 minute
ones and four or five minute ones in the
first and then similarly in the in the
second section so we're mixing that up a
bit too wanted to get as many of you as
we could uh I want is the 15 minute ones
we will have brief time for questions
after those for the five minute ones
we're going to ask that we hold
questions until after all five minute
one so that we can keep on schedule and
again all the more reason that I
encourage you to use the the poster
session and lunch for ample discussion
the patients from 1130-2 one lunch 12 to
22 34 the posters and demos and then
another session of papers then a brief
break and then we'll have the the
challenge report so those will be the
four teams that have challenged entries
will come and they will present tasks
they've done we've held a little bit of
the details and varying levels of
secrecy till the end to make this
interesting so I want to fill those in
now when the folks come up they will get
to pick their choice of two tasks to
present what I encourage you to do is
instead of just giving high level
overview of your systems to in the
context of presenting your tasks talk
about how your systems work and I'm sure
Gary will emphasize this in his own
keynote but please bear in mind this is
not for for you how smart you are in the
ability to do the tasks but how the
systems support you as an expert in the
process of finding information which is
of course the whole theme of HCI are
because this is at the end and we don't
want to wait for recounts in the state
of Florida to figure out who won we are
going to hold the voting by this great
American experiment of democracy I guess
the Greeks came up with it but we'll try
it ourselves and and that will be by a
vote here so if you want your vote to
count I strongly encourage you to stay
until the end of the child section
people
who are submitted challenges should
please recuse themselves from voting
even if they're on the program committee
and and finally we'll have a wrap-up
session where in particular we'll talk
about where we want to go from here
after five years we have some
interesting questions which we want to
actually engage all of you in terms of
where we move with the workshop so with
that I'd like to go over to the poster
session and another poster session sorry
to do the poster boasters if you will
and let me go to here and what I'm going
to ask is a look to see where you are
going to ask you briefly a one person
who is going to be representing each
poster to come up here and spend up to a
minute talking about what it is that
you'll be presenting feel free to
introduce yourself as well so I jaywalk
if you want to start us off and for
those of you who are not going first
please note where you are in the order
will scroll down as we go let's keep
this moving smoothly Thank You Tara so
actually it's a very complicated task to
analyze the log data of exploratory
search systems and especially when it's
combined with personalization we have
transparent user model and we have a
rich set of user interaction log data so
we propose to use a visualization based
tool in this a specific study we used a
system collide flow which is sequence a
event visualization system it's a very
preliminary story study and I'm very
much expecting your feedbacks to improve
the quality of this study for the near
future thank you hi I'm Scott Bateman
from the University of Saskatchewan and
I'm powerfully unprepared for this but
basically my poster I'm telling you
about my
a PhD work and for the purpose of the
poster I call it a collective
information-seeking and why did that was
because I want to make a distinction
between two other well known techniques
or in information seeking social
navigation where we kind of visualize
the traces of people's interaction
history that uses guidance and also
collaborative information seeking where
we work together to on explicitly
usually to you know perform a task or
completed information seeking task
collective information seeking is kind
of a combination of both of these things
and if you come to be my poster I'll
tell you about it and the why that it's
important is because a lot of the
situations where we need help don't
arise in the ways that social navigation
or collaborative information seeking
kind of address okay thanks
hi I'm Myesha Goku from City University
London the work we're presenting today
comes from a project that is based on
photographers and media agencies use of
images and what we're trying to explore
is whether there's a potential for a
high-density image retrieval interface
not your 10-ranked order not your 30 max
but maybe trying to push that a bit to
see whether that might be an initial way
to understand the space of images to
help the further interactions so if
you've got any better ideas for user
experiments which were in the process of
doing and learning please come and talk
to us Thanks good morning everyone I'm
Mallinder I'm a PhD student in Calgary
and actually currently interning in
Seattle with Microsoft and my poster is
titled exploring growing information
spaces and with this poster we're trying
to advocate for camp away from this over
emphasis of text information seeking
interfaces and explore novel uses using
interactive visualizations to expose all
kinds of facets that we have in growing
information spaces and kind of show
different perspectives on digital
information and i will have a couple
demos running to kind of illustrate our
kind of point they were taken with the
poster and I would love to talk to you
about it so I'm Quebec foster hi good
morning everyone my name is Roberto
Gonzalez Yvonne yes i am from rutgers
university now our poster entitled a
method to evaluate the synergic effect
in collaborative information seeking we
basically propose a method to evaluate
the idea that 1+1 is greater than 2 in
the context of collaborative a it is
scenarios English people engaging
searching the urge task so we invite you
to come to our poster session to present
and explain this more in detail but
than eating this morning everyone my
name is she a sec vistaca another poster
from rutgers university with Michael
Cole do you know what happens 200 okay
that's what happens but I'm not going to
any answers here so do you know what
happens to user search performance if
you saw a result overview just next to
the results list and do you know how
different cognitive abilities affect the
effort that users are willing to invest
in search please come to our poster to
learn
you have anyone here from the making
sense of time poster then let's move on
to the user user evaluation of music hi
everyone my name is Xiao who I'm an
assistant professor in the library
information science program in
University of Denver and during my PhD
study I was focusing on music
information retrieval and after finish
that I think it's a very nice the
extension to involve users to evaluate
music information retrieval systems and
as it turns out there are very few
studies existing in this area so I very
much wanted to get included from this
community that um to help us figure out
how to better evaluate music information
retrieval systems and regarding to user
interactions and for this poster of
weighted user experiments and in
preliminary results show some surprising
patterns and do you not want to know
what's surprising come to a poster thank
you
good morning everyone I'm a tune from
singapore management university so you
see this work we focus on how we can
better select that centipede
publications so can give in a
publication what may want to ask so um
um so how much interest does is the I
our community have on this work and when
did such interest in marriage and how
fast was the increase in interest
emerged so into work we were trying to
answer these three questions I put by
proposing a Trinity discovery process so
if you're interested in what we have
funds so please come to our poster thank
you
morning everyone my name is Jeff Wong
from the University of Washington my
posters about page level interactions in
improving search so page level
interactions are your behavior on the
search results page where it's generally
data that's not being collected by the
searching and things like when you're
moving the mouse cursor scrolling and
using tabs so this is a large set of
uncollected data that I think I believe
has a large importance in improving
search so come to my poster and we can
chat about that my name is chell genuine
ago is jenny from you albany demica sub
is my PhD student and she is quite sick
so she couldn't come on to the h de ir
this is a study this poster is it based
on an independent study we did together
when she last year and it is the purpose
of this study is to try to find out how
mobile users using use their devices and
what are the topics topics and interest
and how the search when they use their
small screen devices so we are now
extending the study to more
comprehensive picture of the whole study
and and we are trying to extend the
study and where we got very good
comments from HTC our reviewers and we
are trying to do more on studies based
on a diaries that diary study to find
more about mobile users behaviors so
hopefully it can be extended to a very
high quality journal paper thank you hi
everyone I'm need a community from
University of Maryland Baltimore County
and the poster will talk about how
searchers search in their native
language and in a foreign language what
the differences are in behavior and in
search quality results a search result
quality and we're very early well I mean
we analyzed some of the data but we're
still analyzing
some other parts of the data so if you
have any input to that or made also
planning future studies or if you know
about any related work that we haven't
found I would love to talk to you the
poster thank you so I don't see Jonathan
here and is a colleague I'll take the
liberty of advertising his poster he at
LinkedIn is one of the largest faceted
search sites on the open web so it's
very interesting to see what what facets
people actually use in the various
search as they do how they use them in
refinements so if you're interested in
seeing what that looks like on a corpus
with over 120 million users doing people
search please come and see Jonathan's
poster during the session thank you hi
my name is Abby I'm a data scientist at
LinkedIn the title of my poster is is it
time to abandon abandonment so I'm
talking about abandonment rate which is
a very commonly used measure of search
performance and the purpose of my poster
is to highlight some of the challenges
and issues related to interpreting
abandonment rate and other similar
click-through based measures as
indicators of the user satisfaction
websites so if you want if you are
interested in our robust ways of
evaluating using click-through data and
some of the lessons learned at LinkedIn
please stop by
hi Tess allow from IBM Research in San
Jose what I'm going to be talking about
today is the future and we think that in
the future everyone's going to be
talking to your computers I'm sure
you've seen movies like Star Trek maybe
you've seen Knight Rider maybe 2001 you
know about how well or maybe even you've
had a chance to talk to Siri Apple's new
personal assistant or maybe you've seen
some of the blogs that talk about all
the things that Siri doesn't understand
so we know we're not quite there yet so
you know going back to two thousand one
it would be great to have something like
how that can understand what you're
doing but it's now 2011 and we still
don't have that what we do have though
is the web and we think that the web is
going to be the basis for the
conversational interfaces of the future
so come by my poster and i'll tell you
how that can happen if Michael Madison
is not here do we have anyone from the
following custard
i am callie kabali from Microsoft
Research India and the work that we are
presenting the poster today is with Ravi
was here and monkey Chaudhary it back in
Microsoft Research India what we present
here is actually a user study that looks
at the navigation and search patterns
that uses employ for different tasks
mainly if they're giving the given
textual clues and if they are given
visual clues we think that the main
problem lies in the fact that for visual
search tasks where you're given visual
clues the users have to interpret the
picture to be able or the image to be
able to you know complete the search
task more effectively if you come by the
poster we will talk to you about the
study and will tell you what I mean
findings are thank you
hi I'm Eric Myers I'm from the
University of British Columbia today my
poster is called supporting inquiry by
design I'm going to talk about my study
that I did it's an experimental study
with over 200 middle school children in
their science classroom and let's face
it middle school kids are not very
effective searchers but when we put them
in groups of three we found out that
they actually did worse it exacerbated a
lot of the bad habits that they do when
they work all by themselves surprise but
from that study and from the qualitative
data that i got from some of the video
search logs i got some suggestions for
how we might possibly make the classroom
situation a little bit better and
possibly turn search engines into
inquiry engines so come stuff I my
poster and we'll talk about it Thanks hi
my name is a GD I'm very opposed to hear
on my PhD work with Marty her steady
c---berkeley and it's entitled boards
here he's boring languages and literary
texts and so the question you all have
now is why literary text i mean what 50
manatee skull has ever done that's
interesting right and my answer
my answer is that you know that they
quite a lot actually and there's a lot
of really cool questions especially that
they have to ask of large collection to
text questions unlike the questions that
you know business analysts and
government intelligence analyst path
they're interested in tracing characters
identifying themes you know identifying
stereotypes and so I'm presenting an
interface system that we've created to
support that kind of humanistic inquiry
on on large data sets so come by my
poster find out all about it since it
doesn't seem like somebody is here from
hitachi and i will received regrets from
the folks at on deck a soon to be known
as oracle that they couldn't be here
today so are any of the folks from from
our myth here to present their poster
yeah moving moving along Kathy I am
Kathy sniff at Kent State University
we've been working on developing a new
version of the Lemur korea logged lemur
query log toolbar to make a more robust
a system that people could download that
we can do client-side logging in other
data collection and my poster is about
the fact that it's very hard to convince
people to accept the download and
installation of a tool like this and for
studies where we have a very dispersed
population it's essential that we have
some way of convincing people that our
research is something they should trust
and if they should trust the system
download it in and let us collect their
data so the poster is about that if
you're interested in these problems
methodological problems just come by and
talk
yes a good morning to all my name is
Julius Overstreet check come from Kailua
and that's the University in Belgium so
what I'm here to talk to you about is
that in certain domains people follow
the same creates constantly so you for
example if you search for news you would
search every week for a specific topic
you're interested in and in this posture
we developed a kind of a framework for
evaluating different interfaces in this
task and if you're interesting to come
and see also the results of our youth
studies to place comments yeah foster
love Daniel Tonka line and social
navigation is is an interesting phrase
it if you actually go back it harks back
to the days of the information tapestry
work at park that really looked at what
was then what we'd now call
collaborative filtering as the notion of
social versus semantic navigation but if
we fast-forward to the present tense we
see potentially very different metaphor
of what social navigation is namely
that's the notion of giving the user
control over the social lens through
which you content if you come by our
poster you'll see examples of this in
the context of Commerce of
user-generated content and media content
the latter two including live demos of
the LinkedIn signal and today's sites
that do those so please come by and meet
me my colleagues from Lincoln showing
you this thang
shouting you again and this is this
poster is derived from federal funded
project and Nick Balki is a consultant
to this project and also with
co-authored with my student and some
other collaborators and in this project
we propose that users will be able to
give you we are able to elicit it more
clear information needs from a spoken
language interface instead then a
general search interface which one we
provide you with keyboard input if you
agree with me come to my poster if you
don't we can discuss in front of my
poster too we got a lot of nice comments
from bassist for this preliminary work
we're now in the pilot testing part and
there are a lot to do for the next
couple of years just if you have any
interest come visit us thank you hello
I'm sitting above the soil from Savannah
University stumble Turkey and up the
topic is about how to understand the
context of a conversation and improve it
with some videos online videos so it's a
criminal work and we are with my
students we are trying to solve and
attack this problem there are many
issues from you I and to artificial
intelligence so if you want to discuss
on those topics please visit our posture
thank you hello my name is yeah John and
from University of Texas at Austin and
my poster well eighty-three percent of
the American doubts looking for
health-related information online and so
in the past few years this consumer
house sites was blossoming but we still
don't know what works and what doesn't
for for users and I truly believe that a
good interface should be able to support
consumers search for health information
at every step of the search so the first
step I did is try to reveal
18 very popular consumer health sights
on a web or particularly on there are
such interface and so this is my first
step and in the future I'm trying to
study well what works and what doesn't
so come by my poster and we can discuss
further so believe it or not that that
rounds up the the set of posters and I
think much the collective shock of the
committee here we're ahead of schedule
so this goes to show that if you plan
for excess capacity in your systems
sometimes you actually have it you know
what we've done the previous conf
workshops was to actually have everybody
in the room introduced themselves I
think that's impractical if we try to do
that within 25 minutes but uh what I
would like to do since we have we took
the liberty to put everybody is
presenting posters on the spot is to
actually do the same to folks on the
committee especially from folks who are
here for the first time you might not
know the folks have been doing this for
a while so I wanted if everybody can
come up and just briefly introduce
themselves so you know who are the sort
of the go-to people not just for the
duration of the day which I hope you
really enjoyed make interactive but also
throughout the year there's actually a
year typically between these workshops
and part of the reason we make this in
the format that we do is to foster
community I one of the also amazing
things about putting this in Silicon
Valley is that I think we're seeing a
whole lot of new folks particularly from
industry and from startups showing up
here who might not be quite as as tied
into the academic community from which a
lot of this arose so if we could start
off maybe Dan you do the honors that was
actually our King out last year and our
gracious host so I I've gone as was
pointed out to me last night I've gone
from keynote speaker to local
Arrangements chair
which means next year you won't let me
in so I'm a user experience researcher
here at Google and my remit is basically
to understand how do people search why
do they search and such bizarre ways and
how can we help them be better searched
so I'm interested in elementary school
kids at ministry interested in
librarians imagers did in adult learners
i'm interested in basically the universe
of people searching and my job here as
Daniels pointed out is basically to make
all the physical arrangements happen
Thanks hi I'm Bill coulis I'm an
assistant professor at Catholic
University I have been involved with HCI
are since the first one I guess and
after the hello paper a poster or
something at the first one and then I
made the mistake of sending out to
Daniel say hey if you need any help next
year let me know and I've been involved
ever since but it's I really appreciate
the opportunity to come and you know
just sort of share formative research in
this kind of a venue and i hope you get
that out of it today to my research
interests are in the areas of search
interfaces faceted search and some of
the related areas there i look forward
to talking to a lot of you over the
course of the day hi I'm Rob capra i'm
an assistant professor at the university
of north carolina at chapel hill and
kind of like bill i came to the first
one and i made the same mistake I i
asked the annual i said you need any
help next year and he said sure but no i
think this is a great community one of
the things that i really value about
this community is its great place to put
ideas out there and get some early
feedback and so I think the posters are
a great way for us to do that interact
during the day that's one of the things
I value the most out of this community I
do work in faceted search interfaces
I've recently been working in
collaborative information seeking and
I'll do some more personal information
management it's been interesting for me
as I watch these posters though there
seems to be a resurgence of interest in
speech recognition which is great
because in a previous life I used to
work on voice user interfaces so I'll
come talk to all of you anyway I look
forward to meeting you the rest of the
day hey um hi i'm ryan from MSR and i
also gave the keynote of the first HCI r
and workshop and after that i agreed to
the co and host the event in eight at
MSR my interests are within an
interactive information retrieval and
we'll do a lot of work with and logs and
you know we have our access to art of
war so I know I am I'm a particularly
interested in how people behave on as
the web edit the form web and search and
logs are a great way to serve do that so
good morning my name is jingle Shinsky
and I've been coming to these workshops
since the first one that Daniel
organized I didn't make the mistake of
volunteering for these on until this
year so many of you have interacted with
me were over the review process and I
hope that the outcomes were satisfactory
my interest in this field some
interactive information retrieval and
lately from in collaborative search and
trying to understand how to build
systems and support people's searches
when they're gonna have shared
information needs and i'll be presenting
on that later today i welcome you all
and I hope to talk to you about your
work thanks
hi I'm Nick belkin from Rutgers
University I've been working in HCI are
since the 1970s when it's been called
interactive information retrieval and
I'm kind of enzyme interested in all of
the things that Dan's interested in two
in particular understanding why people
engage in information seeking behavior
and other kinds of interactions with
information and then how best to support
them in those interactions the recent
work has been on personalization using
in fact Jeff page level interactions and
as shall John pointed out working on a
speech interaction for information
seeking Thanks I am Kathy Smith again
still I went to the second HCI our
conference at MSR and then I think the
subsequent year made the mistake of I
think you go can I help next year I'd be
happy to so I was local Arrangements
chair last year at Rutgers and if any of
you volunteered remember moving all the
chairs in and out of all the conference
rooms but we made it we got that done my
word i'm at kent state university now is
an assistant professor and my work is
focused on search expertise and how
people acquire search expertise through
training in in library schools primarily
at this point that's what we're focused
on and it's sort of the other end of the
spectrum I'm working on how the the
processes people use for thinking about
words they're using inquiries and using
words that appear on a spring either
