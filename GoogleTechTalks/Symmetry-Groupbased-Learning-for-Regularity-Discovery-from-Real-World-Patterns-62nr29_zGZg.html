radiology department of university of
pittsburgh dr. leo is the co-director of
the laboratory for perception action and
the cognition at penn state her research
interests span a wide range of
applications in computer vision and the
pattern recognition computer graphics
medical image analysis and your bodies
today she is going to present her work
on symmetry group based learning for
regularity discovery as welcome thanks
May so I'm going to walk around a little
bit better I just want to have a control
time right so before everything
acknowledgement this work I'm going to
talk about actually not just by me so
there's lots of people may be some way I
even forgot and also supported by
where's sponsors also there are some
really great mentors that have worked
with okay start with where the
symmetries I often be asked to this kind
of question potato in particularly in
computer vision community because nobody
sees symmetry nothing is perfect just to
give you example since I just came back
from nips usually that's the only places
i go is where the conferences are so for
me it's just things just jumping out
things like this you do see regularities
symmetries this is a ECC v although you
today disappear in man-made structures
but you can actually also observing
things that's natural in particular i'm
in this marseille they have some kind of
a very awkward special geographic kind
of phenomenon as you can see we can
immediately pick up something repeating
something straight and layered etc this
is another cvpr even in this kind of Y
or the place you do see structures
well this is AC cv once again just all
kinds of modern and traditional
structures well anyway I think that's
enough to go back I would like to point
out is that sometimes the regularity
appear in places maybe we we don't even
see in our daily lives such nice like
this I don't know anyone want to make a
wild guess what this is yeah louder fish
skin alright this is actually not too
far is actually human muscle but
magnified many many times and this was I
teeth somebody's teeth this I guess the
hint is is not steak on the grill but
someone just came out back from the
cruise right so this actually iguanas
skin well and this actually tremendously
regular some of you familiar with fish
my know this actually is the eggs listen
to something I'd random stuff at pick up
from the internet anyways so indeed if
you look this kind of regularity or
symmetry is indeed ubiquitous you can
actually see them over the place very
small things like the gene to very large
thing this actually is a pattern of
dying star when at the end of the I
guess die death is actually read these
old energies and it actually appear in
some kind of regularity regular form and
this is also another interesting
discovery publishing nature which is
observing the firing field of certain
grill in certain cells in the rat spring
and turns out some kind of hexagonal
structure so what is symmetry anyways I
think this quote from this very
well-known book kind of summarize it so
I think initially we may have some kind
very intuitive
feeding some kind of balance some kind
of proportion correspondence and
ultimately come to the math that is the
automorphism of of invariants so it's
really capturing what is invariant under
certain type of transformation and that
is what we usually call symmetry
symmetry of symmetry groups just very
quickly the symmetry out Richter you
basically apply a transformation to some
kind of set and then you ultimately get
a setback but it is set by Z invariant
not necessarily polarized environment
and why this is relevant so I want to
come right down to White's relevant to
computer science in particular computer
graphics this is one example that I
personal experience so I just want to
use this as a motivation some of you may
be all of you have heard textured
synthesize this is a very hot topic in
computer graphics and uh I guess less
than 10 years in the past lesson 10
years it had it like very big progress
has been made but before that to traders
doing procedural tech businesses but in
2001 siggraph for example this paper
show give an input like this just like a
little image and going through the
algorithm can generate output like this
and this one as well this one we're
familiar with is like flowers this one
I'm not so familiar but this supposedly
to be some type of cheese look like but
they look pretty believable right I mean
but before this time for example
textures like this will look like that
at the output so obviously this kind of
texture I picked the particularly has
certain properties that you and I human
in particular able to recognize and very
quickly a tool to pick the problems if
there is any and in this paper image
quilting this actually when the slice
they used you can see they showed input
like this and then you get all the other
algorithms output and then this is the
article from the proposed algorithm
just take a closer look at the input and
output now everybody's love this of
course this is a big progress from what
could be done before that I just want
you tell me how do you like it if you
have a wall for your house would you
like a wall like that so this is the
input and this the output local is it is
great and all the details is very well
captured realistically looking anything
over there okay now stable why is not
stable when this was published I think
my daughter was like I don't know two
three four and she was counting this way
she say big SMO big SMO big SMO big SMO
and this big SMO big SMO big SMO SMO so
that's not good so for a child's eyes
for example this is just like regularity
really that's what she said enumerating
and that's exactly what you are saying
here so this kind of output indeed would
make I mean of course when we think of
this from very practical point of view
but indeed just as faithful to the input
that's already somewhat violates this
expectation and I I would really want to
thank actually the author here who did
this also for me in particular so this
is the problem and also even this other
paper Wang tiles arrogant algorithm very
fast however even from this little input
you can see the regularities about to
approximate orthogonal directions
however in the output you can see indeed
they are lined up this way but this
direction is all kind of messed up
another can regularity people usually
don't pay much attention to is
geometrically they can be deformed but
this color white side to that is very
regular alteration this almost like a
green thing with a yellow dot versus
another big and this alternating
whenever you take this part
rupal unit of them and of course none of
the synthesis algorithm would greater
acknowledge this kind of regularity at
this at least during those pay for 2004
so what's the problem computationally
this kind of algorithm a today's are
kind of statistical process that is a
good algorithm have this assumption of
local markov property basically saying
if i started with a little patch and i
found in the original image some
neighborhood that is similar to my
neighbor to my boundaries then i just
picked that patch and kind of quilt
right that's what's this image creaking
is about to start to put patch by patch
together and then the boundaries because
they are similar so I can do some little
tricks use dynamic programming such that
they really look nice that's basically
what is this algorithm is doing that's
why it's so intuitive quick easy to code
but you pick that patch is that some
standard or principled way you can say
what's the size shape of that patch out
of real like just vacation let's just
pick a square patch and the size of the
patch is user to determine so then as a
user you can for different kind of
texture you basically just that and see
what's your article lichen you twice few
of them and one of them look good so you
put them in the paper and that's what
it's doing but the fundamental question
is supposed to be and that actually
affect the output in a very crucial way
later on this is something that result
from our work I just want to show you
here to see 22 to show to demonstrate
that indeed that patch that smallest
unit that perhaps we call sometimes text
on sometimes textile textile that's
indeed very different in size shape and
orientation so what's really happening
here is lacking at least those kind of
Markov property based algorithms is
understanding of this this non local
property although each patch is a local
thing but it's really determined by some
kind of global property a structural
property of the texture so there are
several myths about this text instead of
thing one thing is people think if you
choose that window extremely big then
you don't have this problem right I mean
because regularity of you true that too
small so you you kind of cut off your
information but if you choose the big
one then you won't have that problem but
when they demonstrate this when the
authors demonstrate you being in the
ICCB paper in 99 you indeed see the
window bigger and they look more regular
but look carefully the original input
has all this same sized bricks in this
case but in Apple you can see this
alternating the small big small big but
the reason is picking that because when
whenever you have an interlock texture
you have to cut it somewhere whenever
you cut you always have a small break at
the end and since you're doing local
things sometime you just include that as
one of your neighbors you can't exclude
that wherever it doesn't matter you make
this big small you always have this
phenomenon because when you look locally
that little part half or a little one
quarter of that brick always be part of
your input and of course this is
repeated here on this color image as
well so whose regularity were repeating
that's the question and I think even for
this graph cut synthesized algorithm
take basic take the whole input you
can't be bigger than your input and that
remains to have this problem of
regularity understanding and second one
is all maybe just we don't have to worry
about this generating this
tiles well the unit differently perhaps
we just tell them and that's of course
also not the same when you think
carefully about how you should put
things together versus you just simple
tithing so now you've tiding will give
you results that's boring that's no
variance and obviously you can tell the
difference and the third point is people
just don't care right i mean what do you
use this 40 in video games that's so
fast people don't even pay attention to
whatever on the wall so we did some kind
of kind of specific study user study
basically to first of all to evaluate
how many of this what we call an
irregular texture able to find more
formally but no skin texture has some
texture I had some structure how the
algorithms do on this and ultimately
actually use human users reevaluate this
we publish work as CBPR 2006 this
actually have one of you sitting here as
a co-author as well contributed to this
work I think we compared four different
kind of algorithms and let the user to
do the comparison and the results that
typically definitely telling us very
clearly people do know the difference
between the algorithm that faithful to
the regularity versus those
general-purpose texture synthesis
algorithms so how to do things right and
I would argue that ultimately we need
understanding not just local properties
and you have a statistical signals we
also need we actually have to understand
regularity and that will lead to
symmetry and asymmetry groups and
perhaps more precisely will be a
marriage between symmetry group theory
and a statistic theory step back people
look at texturing different ways so i
would like to present them in terms of
their regularity on the one and you will
have all this perfect things like
mathematicians you really deal with like
wallpaper patterns and on the other
there's a very typical kind of pattern
particularly early graphics research
they have all this so-called annoys
models they have I mean all kinds of
mathematical and the generative
procedures to generate those stories but
there are things in between there are
lots of things in between actually more
things you see when you just take
arbitrary image even around here you can
see the CD even your your carpet has
regularity they're basically the
arrangement here also it's really not Oh
extremes most things reside in the
middle in particular the part that's
near the regular most regular form it's
actually quite common around us in
particular in man-made or you've been
not man-made cases so we propose the
idea of near architecture with
understanding that some things you see
there is undeniable structure regularity
there but of course it's never be
presented perfectly as oh it has this
noise or some kind of sensor arrow
systematic or random and that however
has been has not been treated properly
computationally in our view and that's
why this kind of thing we observed in
Tetris and size results existed so we
started by proposing let's just see for
those geometric somewhat regular but
kind of photometric wise or color well
I'm in this case each brick will be
different this can texture what kind of
things we can do to fix this so the
first thing we will say confidence stand
the regularity and the regularity in
this case in particular is a kind of
underlying lattice and this actually
ready to the troop of the pattern and if
for whatever using whatever method we
can recognize that and immediately you
can basically build a lattice structure
and then so this would be the analysis
step a synthesis our task that is you
then can simple this input texture in a
very particular way that is
take the basic unit and perhaps for the
since that purpose you just expand that
a little bit so you can basically send
poll two sets of tiles if you will from
the original data but they are
overlapping in certain way and then
during the synthesized to that but you
say say okay so I don't know where what
this texture supposed to be but I do
know they should have follow some
structure and first lay out the
structure then trying to put the tiles
back this of course can be as big as
possible you can read them to pick one
then start to run them pick from the
other ones to some kind of similarity
metric and then trying to minimize the
differences and this way the lattice
structure guarantee that regularity
geometrically is spatially at least but
on the appearance wise you still see the
variance because you randomly choosing
from your theta so this is the one the
results and then if we put the input in
there as you can see they do not really
jumping out at you this is just another
results just to show it indeed to follow
the regularities of the input so when
the texture is somewhat deviating from
regularity now I'm going to show a very
short video I hope the sound works just
to give you an idea now things going to
deform near regular textures are common
but difficult to synthesize we
demonstrate methods to faithfully
synthesize arbitrary amounts of near
regular texture such as this brick photo
and manipulate the regularity in the
synthesized texture one such
manipulation is text a replacement
imagine that you have a photo of a
textured surface but your director wants
another texture on that surface by
capturing the departure of this texture
from its regular origin we can extract
the geometric and lighting deformations
and apply those to any other texture
without knowledge of 3d scene geometry
in this real-world example we replace
the original brick texture of this
building with a number of different
textures while preserving the lighting
shadowing and apparent curvature of the
original surface by using sequential
video frames for the replacement we can
achieve a video
texture replacement ok so just Congress
is to show this you really can put
anything on it after understand whatever
the deformation is of the original
texture so what are we really seeing
here there are two things lead to this
kind of algorithm first is this so we
take a picture and suppose this is some
kind of near regular texture instead of
looking this as is we actually can see
this simply a snapshot of something in
migration or is a dynamic process so we
can see this actually originally coming
from something complaint regular like
regular in a sense of mathematicians
what paper patterns but going through
has gone through already some kind of
deformation both geometrically and
photometrically and if you understand
this deformation we actually can
manipulate this matter this towards even
more irregular and so even go to I think
completely become a pie of things on the
ground maybe if I mean what we choose to
do that so one inside of this work is
that indeed we can treat all this
deformities non regular stuff as has a
regular origin and the second thing is
the non regularity or the deformation
from from regular regularity is actually
happening in all kinds of dimensions
modalities and dimensions so it can
happen geometrically in the lighting and
in other things this only shown three
here but this definitely not limit so
conceptually then we can express this
basic saying okay I don't care what kind
of things in the world even something
far away from regularity I can still
express it as a mapping from something
purely regular through what we call
defamation field to be whatever it looks
like now
and in this specific work we did a see
graph so basically they can post this
deformation into the lighting the
geometry as well as a color so basically
this becomes a simple functional
composition so here instru very quickly
this algorithm that we are kind of
proposed to synthesize this deformed
version input data supposedly for using
whatever method we found underlying
lattice then this underlying lattice
becomes basically a 2d lattice with
Delta X Delta Y at each lattice point
okay then we can do two things first we
can straighten the lattice right so to
its nearest regular form that's actually
you can find closed form solution and
that can be easily done and the second
thing we can do we Delta X Delta Y
instead treating them as geometry
transformations functional life why
should I treat them as a descriptor of
color so now you're deformation field
become a piece of color texture and in
this kids with specifically using HSV
color space so this is your defamation
field now we've got two pieces of
texture one is a color texture which may
not be has all those regularities that
we have talked about and there is
existing algorithm to synthesize that
and then there is this purely regular
texture that we have straightened out
the from the original deformed texture
then this one we can easily just tie
with it up right because the regular we
really understand it very well and this
one we can just synthesize it using
local property now we do this do do 0
product property of this basically
switch this back to its functional site
because each color indeed has a physical
meaning of moving things around then we
basically mapping at into your regular
version so this is completely followed
our basic understanding and reasoning
about indeed with impose that
information on the original data such
that we actually have this synthesis
results in this case particularly
geometrically follow what input
how are supposed to follow if the
synthesis process indeed preserve the
statistical variation of original
texture and a preserve the neighborhood
in a sense this color alteration that
has originally observed in the input the
data and we can also start to modify the
gain to make it more irregular or less
irregular any case so this is one of the
brick walls waited and once again played
a trick or putting the input there did
you see it okay take the include out and
put it in put there so a same can idea
applied here where we actually use some
kind of PCA approach to figure out
what's the mean tile and then do
deviations on that anyway and another
things we do is we take a picture then
we can immediately like the little movie
show separating the deformation the pair
of deformation field once geometry ones
lighting then we basically turn a
geometry into color texture antenna
lighting into yet another texture then
we can synthesize this geometry as we
wish using existing algorithm the
question here is what's the color
supposed to be and as we all know
especially those of you have
communication backgrounds that the
geometry and the shading field have some
kind of corresponding property so here
we basically use this idea about image
analogy to do defamation field analogy
so the same kind of principle applied we
can generate yet another shading texture
then using this larger pair we can apply
this to any texture so this one as you
can see this is completely fabricated
texture with reasonable lighting and
geometry coupled together when you see
this you definitely know this is
synthesized we has nobody people to wall
like that so furthermore we can actually
with this can idea of near regularity we
can actually quantify this basically we
can define a geometric deformation
measures or geometry regularity
basically that's the
can be obtained from the deformation of
the lattice once again this is a closed
form solution you basically find out
what's the nearest regular form is and
you just compute all this distance and
sum them up together and once you have
such a lattice like in here you
basically cut your texture into this
little pieces now you basically have a
tire a pile of your tiles and then you
can observing the corresponding pixel
and see how they bear it if you think
you have a complete regular wallpaper
pattern then corresponding pixel should
all have the same color than your
standard deviation around that column
vector will be zero and that deviation
from zero would indicating how much the
appearance variance that you got so now
you put 2d space of regularity
qualification and you can put all your
textures that you have distributed in
this space and then you can further use
this as a quantitative measure of
texture synthesis results so instead of
simply like another person look at your
resilience I all look good look not good
you actually can be more objective and
it's following this kind of measurement
and place a dot in this space and see
how far away you are from the input
texture and when the undergrad student
actually from CMU took this even further
he actually contact original author of
the nature paper and God oh they're
rat's brain firing field data and used
this quantification and cluster two
types of cells from those grid cells
data and published paper on proposing
there are two types of them and one is
setting up the regularity of the room
because they led the rats ruined three
in the room and the other one setting
the orientation so what I've talked so
far is really address this recognition
of regularity and it being deviating
from that and tree that as the real
world patterns model that modeled real
work patterns deviation so as Frank
Zappa said we better know what's that
Norm we're deviating from so briefly I
just want to mention about what's the
math behind all this it is too boring
just raise your hand and I will just
fast forward so back from deviation what
we're looking at here and when I use the
regularity very loosely actually have
implied very formal and well-defined
concepts in there what symmetry of
symmetry group is about is really all
kinds of transformation that keep
whatever said you are looking at it
sideways invariant and if you collect
all the symmetries together they
actually has a algebraic group structure
and this is basically similar group of
whatever the object you are looking at
and the types of symmetry groups in
Euclidean space in particular that's
we're concerned with right now has a
hierarchical structure from the top the
complete euclidean group to the atom a
group and in the middle you got all this
other groups and subgroups relation and
in particular those red ones are
interesting those are some age groups in
2d and / tickets interesting for
computer science science i think is it's
it's attractive to very efficient
algorithms this kind of mathematical
categorization of symmetry is complete
it is proven to be complete and there
are only finite number of those and is a
constant number for the sum of this
varieties and that constant is small for
example in 2d space we got basically
four types of symmetry groups of
symmetry patterns I was really excited
when I learned this when I was a student
although I couldn't really use this
because I was reading robotics but the
thing is if you take nothing out of this
talk I think this may be something you
can remember and tell people about at a
party or something so basically about
100 years ago the question was raised an
answered that was 40 cans periodic
patterns in any n-dimensional euclidean
space if we use and this of course is
mathematical mathematicians way of
looking at
p Odyssey and the geometry is that use
groups use symmetry groups like
characterize different types of periodic
patterns the question is finite number
of those or their infinite number of
those different periodic patterns and
the answer is they're only finite and
for different kinds of and there are
different kind of this number of
finiteness is different for example 1d
this is a customer follow the tradition
is called crystallographic groups 1d
means patterns that repeating along one
dimension there are only seven of those
so those are code seven freeze patterns
seven phrase groups and this are there
if you just without loose of generality
just put them horizontally then these
are different kind of different types of
symmetry they associated with and that
this is the interrelation between those
seven in terms of their symmetry groups
they are not a flat structure they
actually have hierarchies and 2d that's
even more relevant to the texture I'm
talking about there are only 17
different types so this is all
mathematically proven and the underlying
letters that's one of the things
actually I use quite a bit in my work
with my students is doesn't matter how
this wallpaper patterns being deformed
the underlying structure is always
quadrilateral so degree for graph that's
all you need the structure also in
particularly interesting that has oldest
from simple translation only so that's
obviously subgroup of everybody to very
complicated internal a translational
rotation reflection Clare reflection old
types of different centers so in inter
between them yet again it's not a flat
structure it has very interesting
interrelationship from the purely
translation to this two are the most
largest super group of others and but
they do not contain each other so this
is basically a graphical interpretation
will presented in his book so what we
have done with this just a recap in kind
of time older don't we start to saying
okay how about we just write algorithm
and give me any image let's just tell
let algorithm tell you which group it is
because there are 17 choices than we did
that so this although the image it
doesn't have to be perfect but
geometrically spatially its record is
somewhat regular therefore the lattice
is really a periodic lattice and there
we basically use the autocorrelation
trying to find peak strength find a very
stable way to avoid wrong Peaks so this
some the results were published then
there are some interesting things based
on math and also very interesting for
human perception or machine perception
that is once you find this lattice laser
that can be float on the pattern
wherever it's anchored down you can cut
a tile then you just use this
translation basic this is the generator
of the transition subgroup then you can
generate the whole pattern it regardless
this tile or that how they actually
generate the same pattern however indeed
this tile says something to us right we
feel more natural and why is that
mathematics speaking if we look at this
one simple unit this is the internal
structure of one of the wallpaper
patterns all this diamonds indicating to
folder rotational symmetry and looking
at one of them we can ask the
mathematical question what is the open
of this that means is there any element
in this image group that can transform
this guy to any other two photos asian
centers and that the answer is no there
isn't any so it has its own orbit
however those four yellow ones the
actually can be transmitting to each
other and get again those blue ones can
very simply just use a reflection those
two guys will be then given this pattern
with this amateur group then we can now
locate the so-called a motif which has
highest order of rotational symmetry
Center systematically and in a
principled way and exhaustively and
there they are so basically we from
reasoning we know there are only three
types there's no more no less and we
and a trade rather algorithm and find
them out and we're to do this for all
the 17 groups and even more
interestingly i think more that in
particular once again communication
people will be able to appreciate this
is you never really look at the pattern
face on you perhaps look this way that
way I mean whenever take picture is
always some kind of oblique view of the
original pattern and if we use our fine
camera model so that basically means
your pattern going through a vent
information and the question is we
already know from mathematicians there
are only 17 choices right and the ALPHAN
deformation keeps parallel line parallel
therefore it remains to be a repeated
pattern therefore it has to have as one
of the 17th what they were grooves as
its image group and the question is
which one is it so this is mathematical
formalization basic your group going
through a congregation and your pattern
going through a transformation and here
is one thing I thought was quite useful
for most of us who are interested in
patterns that is you can see this tree
pattern red green and this facet from
MIT some building they all start with
this kind of symmetric group p 2 however
if you allow any kind of transformation
to be applied to that pattern the most
metrical form the red one can go to is P
6m i will show you where it is and the
Greens p4n but this guy can not go any
further than p MN what does that mean
pmm is weight in the middle and those
two guys are way up here okay so this is
really what we use this symmetry is
really a hierarchy of regularity that is
this has much higher regularity than
others and the punch line here is is
already built into your pattern once the
pattern is being designed regardless how
you deform it so that's why I called
this potential symmetry that is I don't
care how you look at this pattern if I
allow all kinds of and transformation
the potential is there or not there it's
encoded is like the DNA of that pattern
already
and this is very useful computation like
that basically tell you is you don't
have to store a huge database of this
pattern one is enough and there is a
canonical form okay all kinds of
applications we can do first of all for
vision people again once you got a
pattern you always say oh but its
perspective distorted I can't do
anything about it of course we can
always use the algorithm to rectify back
to up to a fine now under fine we can do
this kind of things buildings in
particular these are very repeated
pattern and everything repeating and
appearing like repeatedly can causing
ambiguity but once just like what I said
before you come back to its canonical
form and then you're pretty much able to
tell what group it is and how you
measure the smallest unit the motif then
you can determine uniquely whether they
are really indeed the same pattern or
not text replacement so understanding
the texture actually provide a mean to
do automatic segmentation of the texture
and do fun things like this you
basically can separate the geometry from
the lighting another thing we didn't do
which got criticized a quite a bit was
in our cigarette paper we didn't say we
automatically extract the lattice when
the data is totally deformed but that
almost was purposely done we want to
demonstrate indeed once you know the
matters you can do lots of making things
with it therefore fighting lightest is
important so subsequently published work
on automatically giving image to find
that matters using a spectral method
actually the first time this is a
basically treating discovery of
regularity as a high order
correspondence problem to building
basically finding the generators about
building locally and gradually spread
out the whole image then we oh yeah and
this is application actually
collaboration with Georgia Tech so the
intuitive fact they have this database
for of both 2d and 3d so to the images
of the city and the 3d models of the
city and the
the images can be taken actually from I
don't know 40 years collection of
different images and then some actually
something buildings just disappeared
some new buildings come up and they
really want to match imagistic
orientation with the 3d model the urban
environment is highly repetitive as we
have seen already so using our method of
finding lattice first then finding this
motifs of the lattice and using the skew
symmetry group idea of rectified into
it's original canonical form than the
mapping matching between from 2d to to
the image of different views and the to
the image to 3d models becomes extremely
visible and so this has been done in
this paper and then match back to the 3d
world and then they also have the ground
truth so they estimated what the arrow
cost through this matching and it's
actually quite amazing in particular the
accuracy on the orientation so I'll
currently using this idea further to do
segmentation so basically finding
letters from urban scenes you you basic
and divide your image into different
kind of that as different parts of the
image will be segmented automatically 3d
reconstruction super-resolution because
once you have a repeated image basically
you have lots of windows they are the
same thing and you want to make someone
look better then you got lots of copies
of it and compression actually that's
one of the fundamental things symmetry
can really help another thing we do fun
things with this is to defensing so give
them an image for those of us have kids
you really shut that you stay at
baseball you can't really on the
baseball field so you took a picture
outside but you do want to see your kids
or whatever Tigers then you can just
erased the lattice so this basically
there's a learning process there to use
repeatability as the cue to learn a
foreground background the classifier
then use in painting
um than our recent work this is this
year we further develop this idea of
deformable lattice extraction I would
given time not say too much but the
basic idea is random a mark of random
field and using this mean shift
algorithm a very efficient version in
belief propagation just to show some the
results indeed the works here's movie so
this one we actually tested on quite a
bit of images quantitatively because we
have an aggressor label all the ground
truth and then we actually have
algorithm to compare the output from the
human and output from the algorithm and
then compare the difference in every
pixel every texel so like this is very
challenging image actually the
regularity only appeared on the fence
and the black and white image and
there's quite a clutter behind it but
algorithm can still reliable a finding
the repeated pattern pacing it as
defense okay let's move on so this are
just quantitive results we have the
original data set that we use in the
2006 paper eec CV and then we have this
new type of data that all the
see-through structures and then we have
a big set from at your Georgia Tech
which oldest urban scene structures and
the quantity results as you can see SS
means both success first failed FS and
the second success by the way the newer
version never failed in a case that the
first earlier version succeeded so
that's not one of the cases but they do
both fail on certain very small number
of the images where the repeatability at
today is higher frequency than what rate
is so these are those more examples
and also we have done this
quantitatively because like I said we
actually deal with real I mean real data
and with real guang truth so you can see
the newer version of the algorithm is
double that accuracy well the speed up
is like 10 times faster another
direction we go is dynamic that means
videos this yet another thing Inc
provision tracking whenever you're
tracking something that's repeating like
this whole piece of cloth repeating this
is very hard because I mean when people
do octave local approach and look as
canale whatever very traditional classic
methods you basically looking for
something locally similar similar across
frames and in this example for example
this is water disturbed water by the
patterns under the water so all this
kind of physical it's very hard to model
actually motion blur highlights etc
causing tremendous commutation of
challenges as well as occlusion and this
one's oh the polka dots all over the
place so the idea here is just to
rephrase is so when we did what women do
perfect regular texture that means the
tiles really all over placed the same
but when you do near regular basically
saying the tile is a functional location
but now we're near architecture so
basically it means that's not only a
function of the location but also a
function of time therefore once again
markov random field but now we just also
has add another dimension that's the
time and treating this as a sprint model
and boast following with the appearance
model as well as this kind of underlying
structural model so instead of following
each of this little piece we're actually
tracking a structure and that's where
the robustness coming to play there's
just some comparison with optical flow
and lucas kannadi so this is how we deal
with occlusion so this is once again
inferring from the appearance model and
whenever it's being considered occluded
it will have a black
texel okay also deal with tracking human
this I don't know why they walk this way
back to this a piece from DARPA this is
actually quite challenge because of the
lighting and all the shadows and not
everybody's head it look the same over
and comparison with the multi target
tracking work done by other people so
this is the kind of thing we can do once
again just like in the cigarette paper
it except we're doing this on video and
we keep a temporal consistency so our
original data and all this texture being
replaced so you guys think in a physical
effect except different color and this
once again from a movie we do something
to the texture yeah then so you can do
fun things like that maybe I should have
put Google there or tell me in any case
so on this we basically can further
right now dealing with even more
challenging things than sin penn state
where everybody talking about football
games i only watch the band because
they're nice near a texture and you can
have all this interesting patterns
happening the geometry the topology can
be changed as well so we can start to
merge and a separate those different
patterns this just for the fun of it but
i think i'll show the culture to see if
they can use this for them validation
evaluation purposes then also people
from medical field also start
interestingly these are like human
hearts then you do this gated things
that they have a data like this they
appropriately put the letters on the
heart and then they see how the lattice
deform that we actually can track that
so we just got a grant last year about
crowd tracking i guess and then i just
want to point out this this is once
again the spectrum again so from that
and we really start from varied regular
form up to here to the near regular but
dynamic then to the more adaptive local
topology form and then
some kind of crowd Wow loosely they made
locally or temporarily form certain
lattice structure to thousands and
millions of people hopefully we can
still help but for me this is just a
disturbed piece of wallpaper anyway I
think I'm running out of time well few
minutes this not disappear like the
things that you think is useful
sometimes you use things that may be
somewhat unexpected so this is a piece
of well video about people walking and
then if you do something very simple
just do correlation with different
frames along the time axis so this
horizontal vertical just friends in time
sequence then if you do correlation if
something happening on the video is
happen to do some kind of repeated thing
then you basically get a piece of
wallpaper then immediately you use all
the computational tools about fighting
letters fighting groups finding the
motifs same thing then you basic got a
piece of tile this guy walking and it
has certain symmetry and that actually
says something about that guy's motion
because if you do this to a dog and the
dog this match will be like this at the
time when I did this actually I didn't
have a dog and I didn't realize when dog
runs when they run real fast they don't
do it bilaterally maybe horse the same
thing kind of gate is one leg always
before before the other leg so they
actually run like this so the symmetry
actually reflected in this tile and you
can see the human penetra walking and
dark running actually indeed differ in
terms of symmetry or regularity so at a
time as CMU we have this database mobile
database everybody's walking on it as I
don't know you are not on a harmony
right I'm not either but then we
actually can do fun things with it with
very simple things you once you can get
a silhouette you can just drop it on the
two directions X and Y and immediately
you just get a histogram and that's just
one line one green line right so when
the high is a brighter color brighter
intensity
and then Winslow is darker so each frame
is one line and since you have videos
you have lots of frames then you form
this lines of patterns and that actually
if the person does something repeated
repeated and this is a freeze pattern an
interesting thing is when we observe
avatar however it has fries pattern from
different orientation actually show
different symmetry groups so this also
true not just in artificial situation
also in real video basically you see you
have a fixed camera you have this guy
walking around and you basically
equivalent to watching this guy from
different angles then a different street
segments you can actually see a freeze
pattern that varies and we also compared
with male female and this computer model
turns out you will have the sixth camera
set up they look from different kind of
height and different angle and when you
look at this pattern although there are
different subjects they actually have
the same symmetry group regardless male
female or whatever if they looked from
the same angle so using this as a cue
we're actually propose to use symmetry
group freeze pattern in particular as a
way to estimate from where I'm looking
at this person and the first thing is we
got to determine which too much group it
is so here we come actually extend the
group idea beyond just discrete groups
as a Canadians feature because patent we
can actually measure distance we can
define a well different distance for
each given pattern is not necessarily
perfect freeze pediment nobody walking
around say I'm going to walk symmetry
group number three or something so it
always has irregularity but that's nice
because then you can measure distance
between that pattern versus all the
seven but the thing is has to be very
careful to do model selection here
because they are now the flat structure
remember original have pulled out they
have a higher IQ structure to actually
use the on attorneys geometric AIC
trying to do the make to make the right
decision about which group is most
similar to any
that's being used actually application
estimate orientation and further on to
use this data to do a human
identification from gates and got
reasonable results in any case this
group idea basically carried through
from the texture from Street just trying
to edit a web patterns which group to
analyze of under different information
what pattern happens to texture
synthesized thats everywhere I started
with and to the gait analysis and some
more stuff we have been doing okay i
will start with this one the bad news is
we actually have done a quantitative
evaluation to so symmetry detection this
is a big piece of work in computer
vision the effort started when when i
trace back like 40 years ago the first
paper actually even predate computer
vision but it's an algorithm to find
symmetry any case we actually did a
survey and not just a request to the
quantitative evaluation of existing
algorithm and given a set of images and
how good are they compared with each
other and this is the bad news if you
can see this okay let me see this more
carefully basically unreal image with
multiple symmetries the best algorithm
can do is about that can accuracy 32 so
these are two different algorithms and
26 but if you count the false positives
and that's almost complete this one
basically wiped out all your faults are
you true positives and this one
basically bring you down to what 19 so
it's pretty bad okay so I want to just
show some of the recent work we did very
quickly on rotation symmetry detection
and I go back okay so this is about
finding symmetries and the interesting
about this one is instead of looking in
the spatial domain is actually going for
the frequency domain however it's not
doing the way that you think
is doing it's actually figure out where
the potential center is and spin around
actually each Center and abuse this
freeze pattern so basically building a
relationship between rotation symmetry
and the translational mystery okay so
what this once you just so happen you
spin around with a real center then you
will see a patterns really truly freeze
or very close to freeze and then you
just go line by line row by row
basically then you find the highest
frequency then everybody voting for the
same part then you're basically found
rotation symmetry so this is alternative
way of finding rotation symmetry that
has not been tried before and this
actually went my student did this really
tested on lots of images it's actually
amazing to be able to do all this stuff
that some of this cactus is like a 30 to
37 of those folds that usually when you
can t tell Oh confused but automatic
aware she can use algorithm like this to
figure out very quiet very quickly and
accurately and this idea of relating
symmetry rotation with translation and
also radiating frequency with spatial
domain also turns out to be very robust
so I'm almost done okay then smooth fall
and then another things appear very
frequently in nature is the symmetry
never like I said appear perfectly and
lots of natural stuff just like oldest
curved stuff out there and this is
another more recent work we have done
basic able to discover all those kind of
symmetry axes it's really not the so
called a medial axis at all I mean look
this is the zipper this Exodus axis of
reflections way off from the boundaries
because it's really after the texture on
the body of the of the of the lizard and
this one is spying image it turns out
there are lots of this kind of image out
there for analyze people's spying
problems or whatever natural development
and we given this kind of method which
we can quantify what kind of difference
and may help dr. today to make diagnosis
well this is really small but i just
want to point out translation symmetry
so what happened talking about remember
that initially I showed you what kind of
symmetries are there in 2d you got
translation rotation reflection
reflection so pretty much like the
recent stuff we're doing is already done
something with rotation and reflection
because we generalized reflect as part
of collateral faction and the
translation part also as you can see it
has been evaluated on 260 images and we
got about eighty-five percent accuracy
and the speedup is still 10 times faster
than the best algorithm out there okay
so basically we now have a good the good
news is we on a very solid footing at
least we have a pretty much a good idea
what's available and what their
capabilities with real patterns and we
have already existing proof that group
Theory press the statistical learning
theory which I have no time to detailing
right now but we have results to show
that it works and of course we are still
challenging with all kinds of disguised
and bayard symmetries and I would just
end here there are some promise thank
questions yes my questions okay which
one are you asking about the regularity
measurements of the letters so one place
I can i can think of these dumb we
define a pair of regularity measurements
and one of them is about the letters
deformation right that's one place where
used it to measure distance right here
yes so basically this show is that the
red wine is the regular version and the
black one is whatever is being deformed
to so those LML k basic is the diagonal
and then this Li LJ is the two edges so
here basically because it's a
quadrilateral form then you can take the
derivative and you can find max min
whatever then you have a closed form
solution so this t1 t2 is the regular
version that is well defined now once
you find them you basically just measure
the distance between the corresponding
edges a why you're creating distance
that's a good question that's the most
convenient and most intuitive so far but
certainly I would be open to any other
alternative distance of course yes do
you think there is alternative better
one
oh ok capture Oh can recognize yeah so
that's what they form the version of
what they're supposed to be right yes I
would think the basic idea would apply
just the the things they are will be
actually much more specific this one
we're looking for regularity in very
general terms and that's very specific
like a letters or numbers yes I think so
yeah
a website a link to this talk I don't
have one yet but you can email me yeah
that was question with it are you you
have finished your three questions okay
thank you but i do want to know this
distance measure you're talking about
later yes yes that's a very interesting
question so the question is about
fractals I've been asked this question
like n times also that's very into this
oh ok so back to mass the definition of
symmetry and symmetry groups usually is
defined as rigid transformation the
retransmission exclus scaling right
however of course this can be extended
to be on rigid but so far what we are
doing here is following the classic
definition of symmetry groups and of
course we allow deformations and all
that stuff and that's really go beyond
what's the math saying but that
direction is definitely we would
ultimately want to go to is the inner
skating space as well as additional
dimension and apply all this a periodic
like a Penrose hiding
sorry I didn't hear the last part yeah
yeah are you saying in this spectrum so
we are still on an irregular set but
there is yet another set that's it's
proven unpredictable or is it just
commented as unpredictable I would love
to have that reference yes yeah but
that's definitely somewhere which we
want to cover the whole spectrum that's
the goal yes thank you yeah Eric yeah
yeah so that's also I show some of the
results here for segmentation so that's
one of the things we are doing already
so the algorithm doing is the first face
of the algorithm is proposed hypothesis
proposed lattices so what's this
proposition is doing is proposed oldest
t1 t2 generators and actually if you
look our algorithm like step by step I
don't have the like a first phase what's
the output is you you have all these
things on each one of the facet maybe
more than one on each one of those so
then if you enumerate them then that's
what's happening here actually I don't
know if you can see some of this
actually have multiple letters on the
same facet that because in the proposal
stage a tree there is more than one
proposal and then there should Oh
so kind of follow-up stage that is to be
able to recognize although I propose
this vector this way but then another
vector actually different but this
ultimately is actually generating the
same lattice and this actually we can do
mathematically there's no no problem
algorithm make clay basically it's
trying to figure out what is the most
promising one and started with there
with that start expenses basically it's
growing a lattice almost like biological
it growing yeah okay it's definitely
true the same pixel can have more than
one lattice but thus the inverse is not
sure it's not the same lattice I mean as
long as it's complete the same lattice
cannot cross like different regions of
the of the pixel so the same pixel have
the same different lattice it actually
can be resolved relatively easily
lattice the group stuff we're talking
about basically there is a way to find a
unique kind of way of determined that
since we right now with a lot of
deformation if you have a rigid form
actually that would be very unique the
lattice and since because the
deformation has multiple lattices but
they actually can be transformed into
each into each other this basic just
different generators and you can
actually verify they so there should be
which I'm now showing here a merge
process as a post-processing if you will
and then that will be ended up with one
set of pixels associated with it unique
lattice agreed-upon lattice basically
yeah
yeah hey
I think you basically characterize it
correctly we're starting from the
regular end so we're pushing two words
and what I have indicated here is like
for example we started with this
somewhat regular stuff and then we're
pushing files I'm how recently we're
dealing with this crowds data so that's
more I mean that's maybe as far as we
are right now towards the more sarcastic
side of things and the other things we
do for example originally we started
with like a picture I have one piece of
lattice and then with the crowd case for
example is before this case already
started like we can have multiple
lattices in the same image so in a crowd
case even in a video frame in a video at
different frames we don't necessarily
have one simple that as you start to
have a stochastic behavior of this
lattice is appearing may be disappearing
next because people just diverse go
different direction then they will
disappeared and then reorganizing then
you may have a new lattice so that kind
of behavior will be closer and closer
towards how to merge this okay so yeah I
I all met one slice somewhere but let me
just draw something that's right I made
sorry show off my tablet also i can
actually draw something here
so this is actually one of the reasons I
well well motivations i went to nipson
discussed with some of the machine
learning people there ok for example so
what if you talk in the Bayesian terms
so what were really doing here is
suppose this is the group and this is
the data we observed and we can say ok
we're trying to find this posterior
probability we try to determine what
group is of course the things become
complicated because I just use F here
the data deformed right and another
complication is the group also being
deformed in a sense that it may not be
the original groups like what we're
talking about in the Alpha in case for
example so the interesting becomes that
if we want to write this out so this is
some kind of normalization term but if
we put this in a complete faith in kind
of framework then we're really talking
about trying to find the like food and
the prior say this is G or H E whatever
that's the deformation so what's what
I'm writing here is lots of things
actually happening first of all we have
a very strong interest and ongoing work
on what do we do with the data the data
itself actually we have basically there
is a mapping is a feature extraction so
called everybody using different kinds
but this actually make a big difference
from the original data to work on a
symmetry pattern you ended up with so
this is involves lots of perhaps
learning and all kinds of validating
cross-validation stuff and then for the
group side the deformation this a I just
read it in a very general term it could
be actually a very general group at
is the most general group that means you
can do all kinds of deformations with it
and this basically not like the most
group I have talked about basic is a
discrete group or it's a infinite group
but they Co finally generated but it can
be a manifold so basis is the lead group
or some kind of all the possible
manipulations you can have on the group
so that can then easily introduce some
kind of probability function so
basically saying disconnect information
is more common than the others and
another thing about prior is also it's
actually very interesting by observing
Atlanta Georgia images it turns out for
all those high rise buildings is not all
kinds of group up here equal 0 can
assume each group appear equally likely
well actually observe three kinds appear
a lot that actually I really want to
talk to some architect how they design
buildings really they have certain
symmetries they appear in the building a
lot about others not so all these places
all this statistical statistical this
actually basically involved building a
statistical model of even look other
buildings or buildings or if you want to
look at a zebra fish that there will be
is something completely different but
all this is basically can be framed in
this kind of static learning and the
statistics whatever randomness or
regularity can be embedded in here so
that's the plan ok ok basic around the
people
