myself am Patrick gross debt i'm working
as a product manager at Cisco I've been
the first product manager at Cisco
covering ipv6 on iOS first I would like
to thank you for the invitation and the
second thing is I can demonstrate why v6
is working I'm currently getting to
visit connection from my provider in
Paris and at least one of them is
working since that this is what I can
see from the the window of my house over
there so at least you have the
connection with one of the provider but
he looks like one of the Pyrenees not
working with the other one that them so
something interesting when i started at
cisco arm i used to work for digital
before walking at cisco and i went
through the deck net away side story and
when i took responsibility for v6 i say
oh by the way I don't want to talk about
transitional migration I already I
already or the story so that the reason
the marketing message from Cisco is
about integration and coexistence and
the reason is you will integrate ipv6 on
your ipv4 Network because your
application your business is still
running on g4 today and we will have to
make v4 and v6 existing together so now
the problem is if i look at the ER tcp
mother or the OSI stack it's very clear
definition of an Slayer but if i look at
reality of what means ipv6 for
deployment today this is the full scope
of the deployment so that's say oh by
the way you can look at what's about the
application and you got some
demonstration how to run the a picture
on top of v6 and that need you need to
do something here to modify your
application at the same time you need to
look at what about the devices oh by the
way we need to do packet filtering seh
OS multicast and provide all feature
routing protocol but you also need to
look at what are you will call the
infrastructure services load balancer
fire or ideas so that means here when we
are planning the v6 integration we need
to look at the food pictures and by the
way more important how about education
about the operation how do you train
people like for example when you
negotiate a contract we
subpar third party if you don't know if
the people who are negotiating the
contract has no idea about v6 how can
you make sure that the software they are
writing for you can do v6 and the best
example what we are doing today you can
reach most of time are the cisco.com
website using ipv6 and we don't try to
make any public advertise not about that
the main objectives for us is to
understand what do we need to modify on
our part I to make sure we can do
tangible physics and that means some of
the URL are using relative URL and you
are safe but some other are absolute URL
meaning you are using before so now we
need to go to the subcontractor and say
oh by the way here what you need to
modify to make the application running
on top of v6 so when you are considering
the integration of v6 don't look at only
one layer you need to look at the full
picture now the fact is our as it was
Sarah from an end user I really don't
care what you are using our protocol I
want to use by application and take
access to it so the key bread the
tiebreaker is really the naming services
so that mean here dns will return
different kind of address or if you are
using peer-to-peer protocol you may be
using or the link local mill Justinian
reservation protocol the pioneering new
reservation protocol called order and
that how you will get your v6 address
now front that mean when you are running
dual stack like the windows XP PC here I
can go and use firefox and get a v4 or
v6 address and from there I will decide
which protocol I will use to reach the
RPG oil to use the application at the
same time when you are writing your
position you need to take care of
different small item like for example
let's say you want to put the ipv6 on
your IP phone remember on your interface
you may have more than one IP address
let me know you have to display multiple
addresses from a great perspective an
ipv6 address is one or two GI bills
meaning is taking more space look at the
IP phone for example the screen how do
you display your ipv6 address or what's
up
out management let me know from your
network management application you have
to get all the addresses and make sure
you can do the scanning for that and by
the way when you are looking at to our
position you have to on the market
either on Microsoft or Linux or salaries
or any platform that were you to go
through the application to your car and
see what's need to get modified so now
when we are presenting v62 customer the
main question where for them is oh by
the way you want you have interest for
v6 and you want to start now but now the
key question for you is between the
business case identify identification
and the day you will claim oh I'm now
running reseach food production and it
could be equated a question for you at
Google it's how long does it take to go
through all the step doing a network
assessment meaning what do you need to
modify on your equipment to make sure
you can run v6 and from there what will
be the cost analysis and we are getting
the bay the budget for that and then
what's about training what the world
project planning getting the address
space making the planning for the
address doing the test the try starting
to do the deployment and claiming food
production so now if I look at us
mandate from US federal agency they say
in august 2005 oh all infrastructure
should be ready in june two thousand
eight but three years is reno singh to
go through all the step for such
organization so think about yourself how
long do you need to go through all the
step and make sure you can claim success
and that the reason is better to start
now now the fact is one of the first
step for you is to get the address space
and from there that means go to irene
register for your prefix and I'm
pressure it's already done I have seen
the Google ipv6 prefix and you need to
decide what will be the policy
internally 12 to allocate the address
but more important right now a lot of
people are focusing on the upper of 64
bit but what about the low of 64 bit one
of the main difference between v4 and v6
is if i look at v4 you have two way to
assign addresses
we can manually configure you address or
you can go for DHCP v4 and you can do
exactly the same for v6 but in addition
of that for v6 you also have what is
called status auto configuration that
mean I can plug my video camera just
listen the router advertisement and get
the prefix on top of that you also have
privacy meaning when I put my windows XP
PC I will get one address the reef from
the mac address of my ethernet adapter
but i already also read generate a
random number so now think about
tracking some of the people are still
doing packet filtering bed on size 30 to
40 for what's about packet filtering on
/ 10 28 when the address is changing
every 24 hours by default so once again
you need to understand all the mechanism
and set the policy inside your
organization to decide how you want to
use that packet filtering if you are
familiar with v6 you may know that the
one of the main difference between v4
and v6 there is no option part of the
manator the manager for v6 has a fixed
size and that means when you have option
there are option errors and some people
will claim oh by the way v6 will provide
better performance because you can do
physician our way it's a manager it's a
fixed size but reality is how do you
pass all the option errors when you do
packet filtering when you do Q&amp;amp;As
marking or remarking what are you
looking at sphere you are looking at
Susan destination address and you are
looking at TCP port number or UDP port
number that mean now if you have option
errors you need to pass all the option
errors when some people say oh by the
way i can use IPSec encryption newer ESP
nor for authorization remember that if i
look at ESPN are the next header field
to fight the tcp or UDP port is at the
end of the data payload now does it mean
you are routine passing all the data
just to find the TCP port number no way
or don't expect no impact on performance
so that the reason here we need
to do a saline are where we need to be
able to pass all the option add earth
and that means looking at new generation
of hardware with teach em for that and
we had some white pepper routing routing
is not different between different
physics and that's something important
some people reclaim oh by the way v6 is
serving all the internet problem not
true I mean we are just using the same
protocol for v6 as we are using 44 it's
free Benji ospfv3 is is bgp for so that
means here from a research standpoint
there is some good activity to be done
now if you look at the global routing
table it's all it's around 800 prefix
right now some registry are currently
providing provider independent space
which may not be the case in origin like
for example right now in europe the ripe
as not yet decided to allocate p I space
but what is more important it's
education if I look at the current
internet status for v6 today there is
still a lot of traffic going over Turner
and that creating a lot of trouble I
mean you may be running one application
like you want to do FTP and from any
user you don't know which profession of
the protocol you are using and from time
to time you will be getting good
performance and from time to time your
performance measures just search and the
problem now for the network operation is
which version of IP are you using so if
we have the discrepancy at the routing
table layer that will impact performance
from an end-user perspective so that's
something very important for education
you need to look at what kind of
connectivity you are getting from your
service provider now when you are done
with your planning you can pick one does
the deployment scenario and I reading
chair which one you are using when I
look at all the all the customer we have
diploma t6 today the main objective for
them is one provider services second at
the lowest cost as possible they want to
control the cost of the deployment so
here the
we are looking at the deployment you can
look at the core network and basically
at the core network we have two solution
you are running your dad stack core
meaning you have v4 and v6 or we have
people doing mpls and you can put v6 on
top of npr's if you look at the Y I mean
at the access layer once again you have
to kind of services it can be a layer to
access and you can dude well stocked the
only that I link layer today which
doesn't support v6 natively its docsis
before doc Keys three dot all you have
to do turn l for dogs is to load 0 how
do you have to do that now you do turnin
now okay so let me know and then you
when you look at layer 3 for people who
are doing layer three services you will
get managed services and that means here
the service provider most of her visa
services as well and it might be ready
for that now if you look at do at your
compass you have two way to do it you
can go for our stack doing v4 and v6 or
you can do v6 or via on air and it's
what we call rise it up and by the way
you have transitioned mechanism like how
to do v6 over V for Chanel when you
don't want to do native v6 or you can do
translation as well and this is where
you can use not peachy now the fact is
not pity means you go from 96 only
device to an ikea for any device and if
I look at the reality today there is no
single stack which are coming by default
with this it's only of it I mean 44 any
sure but not v6 only if you want to do
that that you have to turn off before
buy yourself a couple of peace fly here
if you want to do physics of our NP RS
one of the key reason we came out with
the visits of rain periods which are now
our AC number at the IETF it's that
people are working on the mpls all over
the service provider we are looking at
the core network can say i don't want to
touch the core network to do v6 at the
same time let's say oh I need to provide
visit connectivity to the people on the
edge so the idea here was to use IE GP
make sure we were able to put label for
v6 between 6p router so what you can do
here
just to configure the edge router and
now we can receive an ipv6 native packet
from the input interface do your lookup
put one label for the remote 6p put
another label for the next hop and on
the output interface which will put it
an ipv6 packet with two labor and the
rest of the MPLS core network can
transport the physics traffic without
any change if you go for dwell stock
what kind of services can you do as a
service provider and this is what most
people are doing are you can do v6 for
you outside internal services and I can
look at what people like entity or free
telecom or other are doing they put v6
on the CP device on the setup box and
they provide services for themselves for
their own customer or if you have
service provider you can do peering and
i will say most appealing point today
can do v6 you can do trotted services
and we have good example of people doing
transit services today like ng T value
and other or you can provide
connectivity to the enterprise customer
and you can provide connectivity to the
broadband user and this is really where
if i look at the war why status we are
missing connectivity there are already
few service provider offering v6 today
for broadband services security one of
the reason we are recommending
enterprise customer to stop looking at
v6 is for security the reason is as soon
as you are getting a new laptop running
windows vista mac OS 10 or linux v6 is
on by default and on any of this
operating system you can do v6 of a v4
turner so that mean on your firewall if
you don't know what kind of traffic go
over protocol 41 you are opening your
security so the first recommendation we
are making to our service to our
customer is at least you should be
monitoring the v6 of every four protocol
and make sure that you can block it if
it's not already done
that the first recommendation and from
there you can start using it the second
one is ipv6 is not identical to v4 so
for some of the rule like packet
filtering you need to understand the
protocol and you need to make sure that
you will apply the right security rules
for that and it's true that if i look at
the market implementation today we are
still missing figure like IDs for
example there is a big hole here in the
market management the other
recommendation for management we are
making is you can split management in
three category the first one is you can
do management / v6 but so what I mean
remember that what you'll be managing is
the dual stack network you need to
manage both v4 and v6 so the first
recommendation just to decrease the
learning curve we are making its you can
keep your management over before but
what we need to provide we need to
provide instrumentation for the v6
traffic and that mean here we have to
work on the mids we need to work on net
flow we need to work on SLA we need to
work on all the instrumentation feature
you may want to use to understand what
kind of traffic go through your network
and then the third category it's what
about the management tools that means
you need to look at your product and
make sure that your product calendar or
the v6 address displays a v6 address and
provide some capability like topology
mocking user tracking another and you
need to get support across all the
element if you really want to migrate
everything to a native ipv6 network
management now what does it mean to go
to our stack on a networking device
remember that you will be sharing the
resources of your device between both
version of the protocol v4 and v6 that
mean here if I look at the memory size
you will have the routing table for both
be 406 even though the v6 table is small
today from a cpu standpoint you are
adding
additional process like what about
ospfv3 it's a new process what about the
address family for bgp or four is is
what about any application you are
putting here for v6 and from a
performance standpoint i mean if i look
at the out way forward in your software
forwarding i don't care any platform
today can achieve rag right 46 or before
but the reality it's more about the
control plane let's say for example you
have fast convergence 44 and you look at
fast convergence for this exact routing
protocol which one will converge first
and what will be the impact on your
application that what you need to
understand and what you need to evaluate
when you are configuring your device
with a dual stack approach if i look at
what we are doing at cisco just to
provide some element so we attach the
cisco network to the six bone in 1998 we
have our own prefix registered to Aaron
it's like 32 and what we are doing today
we don't provide visa connectivity for
any Cisco employee we are really
targeting the v6 connectivity for the
engineering side for the support
organization and for some people like
myself or other who are testing the
application so what we have here we have
native ipv6 and tunneling deploy
internally id3 dependent of your
location where you are we can do v6 over
VPN so that means the way we do it we
have the VPN client for v4 and we are
using either tap as a turning mechanism
so that means here even from us from the
google side i can connect to a cisco
location and I'm keeping my visit
connectivity Francisco and from there we
are also looking at how we can provide
connectivity with the internet and we
need to pair with the service provider
so this is where we are right now so
just to conclude our the first one from
a market perspective v6 is coming but it
will be a multi-year transition period
from a software developer you should be
IP agnostic there is no reason today to
write an application which doesn't work
on both these foreign v6
from a network manager perspective you
you need to make the upgrade get trained
do the configuration and from the
end-user perspective who cares I mean
you just want to use the efficient and
services thank you for your time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
