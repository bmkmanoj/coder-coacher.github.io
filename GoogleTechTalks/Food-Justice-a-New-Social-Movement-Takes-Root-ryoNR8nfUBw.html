and environmental policy and the
director of the urban environmental
policy institute in Los Angeles he has
authored over 12 books including food
justice which is a topic he will present
on today other books include food health
in the environment reinventing Los
Angeles nature and community in the
global city and the next Los Angeles the
struggle for liberal whole city he's
also a co-founder of the National Farm
to School Network a program that
connects small local farmers to school
lunch programs nationally throughout the
hell that Google speaker series we've
heard a lot from doctors on how to
improve our overall personal health
through diet exercise and other
lifestyle choices professor Gottlieb
comes from a different perspective
rather than looking just at personal
health he strives to answer broader
questions such as what are the social
economic and political forces that have
brought us to this point and how can
communities come together to fix
problems like hunger malnutrition as
well as how justice plays a role
throughout please join me in welcoming
Robert Gottlieb to our campus
I understand that in talks like this we
get always lots of feedback so that
would that be helpful I think in terms
of what I want to share with you let me
start let me do a couple of things tell
you a little bit about the program we
have at the urban environmental policy
institute which includes a number of
programs around food issues everybody's
looking but over there there there we
are and and then I'll kind of scituate
that in terms of this book that anupama
Joshi my co-author and I knew puma is
actually the director of the National
Farm to School Network and both what we
mean by food justice and then how we
illustrate that both in relation to the
issues and problems around food in
justices and then some of the stories
that we've identified of groups and
movements and individuals who are trying
to bring about system change so the
urban vinyl college alyssa was a student
of mine and very engaged in food issues
as as are a number of other folks at
Occidental the institute's an
interesting mix it's kind of a hybrid
between kind of a research and
educational entity and one that involves
engaging in action and policy change and
as a hybrid we not only try and identify
some of the issues and problems but how
you start bringing about change so in an
illustration of that would have been
when we started the farm to school
program which I'll talk about in a
little bit we wanted to get it inside
the los angeles unified school district
and so we presented the research we had
done to demonstrate where it first begun
in in a smaller school district and
in southern california and how it could
be applied to the second largest school
district in the country and we found a
lot of resistance within the school
bureaucracy within food services and so
we decided that what we really needed to
happen is a policy change in order to
get a policy change we felt we needed to
really reach out to students and parents
to be part of the process of bringing
about that change and what happened in
fact was some of the key issues we
identified were not only what was going
into the cafeteria but where the kids
were going in terms of getting food that
is known in school food language as
competitive foods namely the the vending
machines where you had the sodas and the
junk food and that became the
alternative to food that was not
considered very appetizing in the
cafeteria so we focused on that and we
hired some some parents to be organizers
to reach out to the both the kids and
and to the parents and started a
campaign and the starting point really
was the vending machines and getting the
sodas out and identifying for example
through our research the average amount
the sodas consumed in the sugar
quantities involved in Matt of soda that
a teenager would drink in the course of
a week and it was a mason jar full of
sugar and that became the symbol of the
campaign if that's what this is back in
nineteen in 2001-2002 and out of that
campaign and out of the work we identify
the issues the LA Unified School Board
passed the first really major change
that took place around the sodas and
bending machines by banning so it is in
the vending machines and having a
student constituency that was engaged in
the issue that became really important
part of the process so that's the kind
of thing that we do
and in our Institute we we identify
programs we do research we do organizing
and we bring about policy change and we
operate in multiple set of issues we we
basically have a social justice mission
we deal with issues of immigration and
housing and transportation but our
largest set of programs are in the area
of food and amongst those we do this
farm to school program the idea go
regional food grown by local regional
farmers into school cafeterias and other
institutions like Google we have a
program called farm to preschool and we
focus on preschool because aside from
the importance of thing of preschool to
k12 it's also some of the fastest
increases in obesity and waking are
happening in the 0 to 5 population so it
becomes an important way of thinking
about how do you change the way kids
think about food and what kind of
program to develop in order to bring
about that that change in perspective
and attitude and and connection to food
we have programs that deal with women
infants children program we call it farm
to WIC where we are going to places
where WIC coupons are used like these
stores that only sell whip products and
trying to get local food into those
stores fresh produce into the stores
that the people who have the WIC coupons
the who qualify low-income women with
with infants can have access not only to
fresh food but local food that is going
to be that much more appealing we have a
program that deals with the connection
with food and transportation the whole
area around food access is really a
significant one because as you can you
can urge people to change their feeding
patterns in terms of what they will eat
you can
them to go to a farmers market or two to
go to a market that sells fresh produce
but if it's not in the community if you
don't have access to that then you've
got significant issues in terms of
changing the food culture and that's
particularly important in terms of
things the people who are most
vulnerable in terms of how the food
system operates people in low-income
communities don't have supermarkets
don't have farmers markets so we have a
whole program we've developed around
food and transportation we also have a
program we call the regional food hub or
food hubs and I'll talk about that in a
little bit also because that would be an
interesting project to describe in terms
of thinking about the needs that we have
to make that operational but the concept
of the food hub in insured is that you
if you have now this idea of making the
connection between people who grow food
locally and people and the institutions
that can access that food how do you
create a system where you can have
multiple farmers working together and
the institutions identifying the needs
that they would have to get that food
and and like in LA we also work with
food trucks for example to try and get
healthy and fresh produce into the fruit
trucks as well and that that maybe they
could use a kitchen facility in a food
hub so it's a it's a complex concept of
making those linkages and making a
system work to support what we would
call a regional food economy or regional
food system so that's what we do lots of
projects we try and innovate develop new
programs we evaluate them we think about
the policy context we do organizing and
our students get engaged in a whole
range of these programs as well so
that's what we do and as part of that
we've really become part of kind of an
emerging food
movement around the country and the food
movement has many ways of addressing
food issues and within that we have
begun to make the argument that food
justice within the context of emerging
food movement is really critical and buy
food justice we think of it in in a
number of ways on the one hand we do
think of it in what we call the food
system or system ways so we think about
if you think of it its supply chain
terms you know from growing producing
processing manufacturing distributing
retail where it's sold at how its
consumed as a system from sea to table
what is the nature of that system what's
happening within that particularly from
a perspective that says are there
environmental problems in that system
there are other issues of disparities
there are are there issues of
undermining local and regional farmers
whether in in this country or abroad
there are are there issues around worker
and justices whether it's in the
confined animal feeding operations where
much of our meat production is now based
and the people who work there subject to
kind of occupational hazard subject to a
whole wide range of exploitation that
goes on in terms of those operations
whether it's in terms of thinking about
people who work in retail or in
restaurants I was just last week in a
press conference in LA for an
organization called the restaurant
Opportunity Center which is an
organization that got formed out of the
bombing the the the World Trade Center
events
9 11 events where the top of the world
restaurant was destroyed and when it
reopens some time later the restaurant
workers were fired to bring in a
non-union lower wage workforce and so
the workers who had been this displays
set up their own cooperative restaurant
but then started advocating for around
the conditions of restaurant workers and
so the press conference that I was at
was related to a relief of a report of
the conditions of restaurant workers
something that food movement might or
might not be addressing but which is
really critical when you think of it in
system terms and these were issues
around wages in terms of Occupational
issues in terms of no sick time where
you'd have people who would be working
didn't have the ability to take off time
when they were sick and they were
serving your food and so that becomes a
kind of a central food justice issue of
how not only restaurants can maybe be
more sustainable and source locally but
also how are they treating the people
who work in those places so food justice
is a perspective on system issues it
also looks particularly at the
disparities within that system where you
have people who are most vulnerable even
as you talk about the system as a whole
creates problems for everyone and I
think there is no better example of that
when we think about the issue of this
the this issue of weight gain and
obesity where you have all population
groups have seen this change taking
place in the last three four decades and
particularly pronounced in the last 20
20 years across the board age groups
ethnic and racial groups income level
but those obesity levels are most
pronounced amongst people who live in
low-income communities people of color
who going back to that food access issue
are most vulnerable in terms of what
kind of food they do access and what
with what are the circumstances the
system circumstances that they
experience in terms of their connection
to food so you have obesity as a
consequence of the way our food system
is organized for everybody it's a system
issue but they're also most those who
are most vulnerable and then the third
approach we take in terms of food
justice is that you ultimately can't
separate the idea of food from other
kinds of social and economic issues that
come into play and constituencies that
are impacted by those issues so another
way of thinking about food justice is
you're also connecting it to things like
transportation or land use what's
happening when we lose farms at the
urban edge and you instead have a real
change in the nature of the kind of the
metropolitan region and all the related
problems that go along with that food
issues are powerful environmental
questions what are the inputs in terms
of how food is grown how is that
changing and as we become a kind of a
more industrialized food system and both
in terms of the production of food as
well as even in the retail sector where
to use a term that an English theorist
called it the kind of industrial food
retail that has really developed where
for example Walmart in 1987 had zero
percent of the market share of food
retail and today it has over a third and
is by far the largest food retailer in
the world and it practices how it
retails food and how its organized is
very much part of this kind of
industrial food retail model so we we
see that happening in terms of thinking
about how these systems operate across
the board throughout the supply chain so
the food justice book was really an
attempt to do two things on the one hand
to document in the first half of the
book how if you do kind of a walk
through the food system what happens at
each stage of that food system that
addresses these questions of food
justice and food in justices and the
second half is telling kind of a
narrative of where and how there are
efforts to change the way the food
system operates from a food justice
perspective so you have a wide range of
initiatives that are taking place around
the country and around the world that
are seeking to define a kind of an
alternative to the direction in which
the food system has evolved particularly
in the last 30 40 years with with these
massive changes that are taking place in
food growing in terms of the
manufacturing and processing of food the
retail side where we and how we consume
our food as well so some of the stories
included there's a for those who have
the book there's a wonderful photo on
the cover of the book of a group in
Holyoke Massachusetts called Westeros
Rossi's and they started about 15 years
ago where
it Holyoke Massachusetts is a very poor
community it's actually the poorest in
the state of Massachusetts it's heavily
Puerto Rican and so a number of of young
people decided that they wanted to do
something to deal with the problem not
only of lack of of healthy food but that
they wanted to connect back to the
traditions of food growing that they and
their families experience growing up and
so they started an herb garden growing
the kinds of herbs that were part of
their cuisine and they expanded to
become not only growing food but
creating what could be considered like a
little mini food hub in Holyoke
Massachusetts and doing a range of other
kind of economic development programs
for the community using food as the
centerpiece so that's the telling the
story of how that group got started and
how it's really mushroomed into kind of
a major player in rethinking food in
western Massachusetts another group that
we profile which we have folks who have
come here from the Salinas Valley is a
group called alibi which has done a
remarkable job and you actually have the
advantage of having some of the Alba
organics produce here at Google Alba
started out trying to identify well has
a long complex history but in a nutshell
it tried to identify the ways in which
people mostly immigrant farm workers in
the Salinas Valley in other parts of
Central California could be able to make
a transition to themselves participating
in being becoming food growers really a
critical transition if you think about
both from
justice perspective of how farm workers
are treated in California in this
country but also in terms of skill and
knowledge and capacity to grow food that
you don't have that opportunity to do
that so that's the evolution of the
organization was how you have some land
that could be made available to farm
workers who can become farmers and it's
part of a broader theme that we talked
about where you are seeing for the first
time a shift where they're more farmers
in the last census of Agriculture than
there had been in the previous census
this was the 2007 census than I think
you will see in the 2012 census of
Agriculture even more striking change
it's not that we've seen a wholesale
shift in agriculture but you're starting
to see pockets particularly Asian Latino
farmers women and young people those
sort of four constituencies of people
who are becoming connected to the land
reconnected to the land of course it
also takes place in urban settings as
well as outside of urban areas and in
the form of the community garden
movement the urban agriculture movement
ways in which people start thinking
about food growing as a culture of
vocation and in fact a way to to have a
sustainable livelihood so that's another
story we tell about and we talk about
the group in in Florida that tomato
pickers in immokalee County in Florida
who suffered incredible abuses in terms
of the the patterns of
recruitment of people coming across the
border to be being sent into the fields
and really being subject to conditions
of near slavery locked up subject to a
wide range of abuses and incredibly low
wages that were provided for the for the
tomato crop that was being picked and
some of the other crops in in that part
of florida and what happened back in the
mid-90s is desire by some of these folks
who were most subject to these
conditions and started started to expose
this kind of near slavery conditions to
think about ways in which they could
given the weight against them of
changing the situation that field how
could they begin to shift make a dent in
that kind of imbalance of power and lack
of capacity of farm people working in
the tomato fields to to bring about a
change so they created an organization
called the coalition of immokalee
workers some of you might be familiar
with them and they decided that the
growers the large growers were not going
to yield at all to the idea of not only
a kind of a wage increase but to
recognize and give some dignity to the
people who were working in the fields in
terms of their representation so they
thought well let's go upstream who
purchases the tomatoes and they started
by targeting Taco Bell they had a four
year campaign to say we won a penny a
pound more and we want some recognition
in terms of the rights of the people
working in the fields and we want you to
agree to that and then pressure the
growers to bring about that change
and they mobilize students around the
country and people of faith who got
involved and thinking about food justice
as in social justice as their issue that
they could engage it then identify when
from Taco Bell they finally succeeded
after four years they went to mcdonough
went after mcdonald's they went after
some of the retail chains and just as
our book was released in october we
would be going around going around the
country and we were happy to say that
they finally got the growers to agree so
great victory limited you know penny a
pound a little bit of recognition
enormous obstacles but a really
inspiring story of people over time
mobilizing getting constituencies to
cook up with them and bring about that
one change that becomes then emblematic
of how that change can can magnify and
develop further in terms of related
kinds of issues in the fields or in
other parts of the food system so let me
end with I'll tell you a personal story
in terms of some of this work and
connected back to Farm to School which
is one of the signature programs that
have developed and farm to institution
we were trying this about 15 years ago
to think of ways in which we could
support farmers markets in low-income
communities there were there was in
particular one market that had been the
very first farmers market in the
Southern Southern California that was
set up in the late 1970s when they made
their revival actually farmers markets
were designed in the late 70s and early
80s as kind of food justice institutions
if you will they were designed to bring
affordable health
the fresh local food into communities
that had lack of access the first
farmers markets were sponsored by a
group called the Interfaith hunger
coalition in LA in places like
Philadelphia in Chicago when they were
started there was a group in and in
Philadelphia called the Food Trust these
were really kind of low income
strategies for fresh food access they
changed farmers market saw Billy
obviously have changed over time for a
lot of good reasons in the sense that it
became very popular and so it became
very attractive in communities and
middle income communities and places
where there might not have been quite
the same food access problem but there
was real interest in getting healthy
fresh local food and there were
community institution so a great
gathering places where you don't have
the that kind of those kinds of places
but in the process you it's not that the
low income markets were abandoned but
they tended to be more limited fewer
fewer farmers were coming to those
markets there were there were the
burdens of how to how to find the
appropriate places for those markets so
we were trying to figure out how could
we support the farmers market in an area
this was the gardena area and reach out
to low-income folks in in the in that
southwest region of LA and we found it
was really difficult we tried our csa
model but one where people would pay at
a subsidized rate and maybe only have to
pay once a week rather than once every
six months it wasn't working so we
thought well what we really need is the
place the places where you can have kind
of this the institutional support for
this and that's that was the origins of
thinking about farm to school and at
that point my daughter was in a school
in Santa Monica
Santa Monica sounds like one of those
wealthy enclaves it actually has low
income on clays within the wealthy
Enclave and the school where my daughter
went had fifty percent free and reduced
student body in other words fifty
percent of the kids qualified for a free
and reduced lunch which meant that they
were hovering near the poverty line so
my daughter would come back and tell me
that you know the school lunch sucks the
they tried a little bit of a salad but
lettuce was brown and she actually liked
getting fruit and even vegetables and
she wanted something different and so
she was going to not eat in the school
cafeteria so that was sort of like a an
epiphany for myself why not go to the
school so we went to the food service
director a fellow by the name of Rodney
Taylor was then the food service
director came out of the food industry
his pictures in the book an industry guy
you know food service industry guy
bottom line considerations you don't do
anything different you got it you got to
have the food that the kids will connect
to so that means you've got to have the
kind of the chicken nuggets you have to
have the pizza you have to have the yet
to also by the commodity foods because
you're under constraints on budget so we
came to him and said you know we have a
thriving farmers market system in Santa
Monica why not get the farms that are
coming to the farmers market to set
aside food that they bring to the
farmers market that can go into the
school cafeteria and Rodney said he
tells the story goes around the country
said oh here was another rich white pair
with too much time on his hand coming
and
length this issue on me and what I'll do
is I'll test it out and I'll show that
the kids will not eat the fruits of
vegetables so he set up a salad bar as
an alternative to the hot meal it says
the way you can some of your school
cafeterias can have these choices be
true the offer and serve system is cool
so he's decided he would have pizza the
first day as the alternative to the
salad bar that was set up with farmers
market produce and the kids came we
hired an organizer to help reach out to
the parents a young latina fresh out of
UCLA and she got feedback from the
parents about how they the kids would
respond you know make sure you get a
slice of lemon or a line that you can
squeeze on the lettuce and you can do X
Y Z in terms of how you show where the
food is and sort of the big breakthrough
with the kids was they did actually have
a school garden and so we did some
tastings and the kids have one that
looks like the food food that was coming
from the farmers market from the farm
local farmers looks like our food from
the garden you know and you know we love
that food from the garden which is never
connected to having food in the
cafeteria so by the time the day came
around and Rodney said out that the
choices seventy-five percent of the kids
chose the salad bar and it blew Rodney
away he said it as he talks about nice
as it changed my life it gave me a sense
of purpose that I didn't have that I
needed to become a champion for the kids
and I could see that becoming a champion
of the farmers was the way I could
become a champion of the kids and that
was the origins of Farm to School at
that point there were only three
programs around the country this is 19
7 the one in santa monica and two small
ones in north carolina and florida that
were designed to support farmers there
today it's in all 50 states it's been
embraced by Michelle Obama it's was part
of the recent child nutrition
legislation that just passed and it came
out of a kind of history of mobilization
and a practice of trying to show why
this kind of approach is creates change
at each level and it really it
symbolizes for us the store the food
justice story because Farm to School is
a system change it's for everybody in
terms of a school food system but it's
particularly when you think of it in the
public school system you have kids who
are a substantial portion in places like
Eloise LAUSD for example is seventy
percent of the kids qualify for free and
reduced lunch I bet you if we go to East
Palo Alto we'd see that kind of not
those kinds of numbers or in Salinas or
in San Francisco in some of the school
district so you're also talking about
kids who otherwise might not have access
to that type of food so it's a also
becomes a food justice story in terms of
those who might be most vulnerable and
it's finally something that allows you
to think about learning about food
differently is also a way of thinking
about a deeper set of issues in that one
comes and encounters whether it's how
you grow food and what does that mean in
terms of environment and what is what
are the economics of food and how is it
operating so it becomes also a teaching
lesson and a way to connect to a number
of different very powerful issues that
we need to confront in our communities
so I'll leave it at that
open it up if you have questions or
thoughts or things you want to share our
folks from Alba here if you want to ask
them about anything I had a an op-ed
yesterday I guess in the San Jose
Mercury News talking about some of the
Alba farmers but also the connection of
immigrants and food is an interesting
article I read and coming up in the
paper in the New York Times this morning
in the food section the dining section
about how immigrant cuisine is changing
suburban areas and places like
Indianapolis the fascinating article and
I think it's part of thinking about new
ways of we're just starting to address
food in our in this country and in our
society so questions thoughts you can
clap it's our first fantastic talk thank
you very much I was just wondering if
you could draw a connection between food
and social justice to justice for
animals what we put on our plates or
what some of us put on our plates
because i think you know you read
umpteen different books out there in the
condition for the conditions for workers
working in factory farms and working in
slaughterhouses and so forth is probably
among the most abominable for all all
workers so if you could just like maybe
comment on that a bit yeah 22 connected
points first in terms of there there are
important constituencies out there that
are talking about what's happening to
animals in the factory farm system
particularly in these confined animal
feeding operation structures they're
incredible environmental issues as well
in terms of the waste that are generated
and the kind of pollution that's
associated with it and there are these
animal abuse issues that are really
important but to separate one set of
issues out from as you rightly pointed
out the issue of work or justice
and work conditions for the people who
work in those places it really limits us
and that's really part of the message of
food justice is to not make that
separation but see the connections
between those those sets of issues
there's there's a wonderful phrase that
Eric Schlosser use talking about the
tomato workers he spoke at a slow food
conference and he was saying look do we
really want to eat an heirloom tomato if
it was picked in the conditions of
slavery and I think so that's really
important that you'd not separate the
two the other thing about what's
happened in terms of the processing
plants we've really seen a big shift in
the lamb that began in the 60s and 70s
influenced in part by the kind of supply
chain issues that led to the feedback to
some of these processing operations how
the meat was being produced in effect
then and for whom whether it was the
chickens that were being turned into the
chicken nuggets and the workforce that
had been in those processing plants up
through the 1960s tended to be a
relatively stable Union workforce that
had relatively decent wages as as
production workers had at that time and
when you started seeing these changes in
the supply chain and the way the
processing plants operated you basically
saw a wholesale shift away from that
workforce a lot of folks were the plants
were moved to different places like in
Colorado and an immigrant workforce was
brought in there was non-union highly
exploited and subject to kind of some of
these horrific conditions that we've
read about in terms of what goes on and
whether it's the poultry plants or the
meat production that the beef production
plan
so yes it's very much connected and part
of part of our argument to the broader
food movement is that it's really
important to make those lengths to not
separate out one issue from the other
cool thank you very much too how do we
get how do we get grocery stores in poor
neighborhoods my understanding is
they're just like reading stores that
it's just like there's no access to
produce or anything reasonable for the
people even they want to get it this
can't get it well it's a really
important question and there are
actually a couple of different answers
to to that on the one hand there are
efforts to say why have the
supermarket's for one of the large
larger full-service markets why are they
not in the urban core areas in the inner
city areas they used to be there was
really a major change that began again
as we see other changes going through
the food system happening in retail
beginning and say in the mid-1960s or
even a little bit earlier where you had
kind of a flight from urban areas to
suburban locations often close to
freeways very parking in car-centric
places so that disadvantage when you
sort of build your market around the
idea of access by car rather than other
other strategies for access you
disadvantage your your urban core areas
where land is actually more expensive
more limited so you can't have that big
parking footprint number of reasons that
we're all part of the change in food
retail markets were leaving we're
abandoning the urban core well there's
now emerged you know a lot of work in
this area saying you know the markets
have to come back in it's their social
responsibility there's also an economic
opportunity this the suburban markets
became saturated there have been
sufficient number of studies out there
that really make a compelling argument
that
food market even with these constraints
around land costs and the income level
of the shoppers you still can make have
significant economic return and those
markets that been set up that have made
that jump have turned out to be very
successful but there's still a lot of
resistance so there's been a lot of
organizing trying to do that not hasn't
gotten as far as it ought the other part
of that is though is to think about
either the alternative kinds of places
to access fresh food black farmers
markets and and making them more viable
be you know increasing their capacity so
a core food justice demand for example
for a farmers market is that they be
able to accept SNAP benefits the the
food stamp benefits and have the system
the the electronic benefit transfer
system that it would allow them to
access the farmers market and then
there's yet a third initiative that's
going on called the healthy corner store
initiative which is looking at stores
the small stores that have historically
been kind of too expensive limited if
any produce making their money off of
candy and cigarettes and liquor if they
were liquor stores that were defining
themselves as food stores and how do you
change that situation what do you do to
really make these more responsible kinds
of community stores and so that there's
an effort and Pennsylvania called the
fresh food financing initiative that has
really created an incentive based
program even as simple as creating
refrigeration in these smaller stores
it's also been bolstered by the fact
that we have more ethnic markets now
that have developed that the kind of
bolster level so there are some changes
that are taking place in in that level
but it's a core problem that it doesn't
go away and needs advocacy at all these
different levels I think you might have
just answered my question but I live in
Oakland and five years that's no it's
definitely not see there were no well
not many great body grocery stores in
the area where time but I've noticed
that recently actually whole foods which
is kind of in and extremes as far as
pricing goose girl has opened up in an
other words aerial endemic nicest and
every time I go there is just appear to
be a great business so is game are
getting stores like Whole Foods or you
know your own price version smaller
versions of atomicity is does the actual
city government tendon Claire what do
they consist of deal with for approach
companies or individuals interested in
this or is it tend to be more organic
individuals everybody hear that okay the
answer is actually both that you there
are ears a role for policy in including
local policy to ensure that not only
that a store comes in but at the store
for example hires locally has fresh
produce and is the other kinds of things
that are important like has culturally
appropriate foods in the in that store
all those kinds of things can lend
themselves to different kinds of
policies that advantage stores who are
doing it in disadvantaged stores who are
refusing to to do certain kinds of
things and there are different policy
instruments that are available we did a
study when Tesco which is the third
largest global retailer and the and that
they're American they entered their
British company and they entered about
five years ago into the u.s. under the
name Fresh &amp;amp; Easy Neighborhood Market
and their target is to sort of undercut
Trader Joe's and so we did a study of
how Tesco operates globally and in that
and you can access it to our website we
listed a range of policy strategies that
you can have to really and specifically
designed in that case with Tesco and
fresh and easy what can you do when
somebody wants to kind of increase their
their their footprint in different
communities and or they're not going
into communities are going into one set
of communities versus another so there
are a lot of there a lot of policy
opportunities but ultimately can't make
change unless you have people who are
advocating and mobilizing and seeing
themselves as part of a movement to
bring about that change and and there
are examples illustrations of when
that's happened when people have
mobilized where they brought about that
kind of change so when another question
and then I have a question for all of
you what would be the top two things
that Google can do to be the most
forward-thinking for corporation of this
size we are almost twenty thirty percent
supportive of small farmers and local
farmers like our relationship with Alba
we do have a really high food values
high in sustainability book but if we
really wanted to push it what should we
be doing great that was actually what I
was going to ask all
and I'll give you my take on it but I'd
actually like to hear your take as well
certainly the the role as a major
institution is important and there's a
whole range of ways to do that one of
course is what food is available and
where it's being purchased from and how
you scale that up I understand you have
a CSA for Google employees all those
kinds of strategies are important there
are other things that you might have or
not have that people are exploring we've
been talking with Kaiser for example
about the idea of I don't know if Google
is self-insured or what relationships
they have around health insurance but
there are strategies to two advantage of
for example your insurance premium goes
down if you're a member of a CSA sort of
thinking about how you incentivize the
change that could take place so as an
institution there a whole range of
opportunities and the partners that
Google has so it extends not just in
terms of this place here and what food
gets purchased but how does you know
where and how does Google operate itself
in terms of other places other
facilities other partnerships that it
has where it can talk about its
connection to bring about changes and
how people relate to food and where it
comes from I think the other piece of
that connection that Google could make
is right now we're in a situation where
some of the stories that we talk about
things like Farm to School for example
are at a stage where they have moved
from having I best put it from from the
pilot stage to something deeper but in
doing that there are both barriers and
chat and challenges of how you make that
happen keeping the the eye on the prize
of the
type of regional food system that you
want to support and the Justice
component throughout throughout it so
this food hub is a great example there
are all kinds of needs now as it gets
this farm to institution model expands
of linking farmers who operate when they
operate individually find that they
can't really be an effective supplier so
you you need to aggregate you need to
connect but then the institutions have
different and there's also land that's
not being farmed that could potentially
be farmed particularly if there were
that connection to somebody who needs
crop X at Point y in terms of their
their needs from an institutional
perspective so there's there are a range
of kind of tech issues if you will of
how to configure a system based on this
hub model where you're you're
aggregating consolidating you're doing
maybe even some process and connecting
and then you're going out to the
institutions and those this is the
beginning where Farm to School was 15
years ago the hub model is today it's
just beginning it's catching on around
the country there are ones in Northern
California that ones in Southern
California San Diego is one emerging in
LA and then also how do you link that
statewide so that it operates so those
are the kinds of needs and there are
other illustrations of that as well
it's an economic model but it's also
it's it's defined not simply as an
economic model but it has a kind of
social justice mission associated with
it but whether it's in terms of support
of the local farm groups and the farm
workers as well as in terms of who gets
you know who can access the supply if in
fact there are issues around the price
points or their schools that don't have
kitchens so one of the things that we
modeled is a kind of a floating salad
bar that could actually be brought to
the schools but there are also policy
changes that you want to bring about so
there are technical issues within the
building the capacity to create that
kind of alternative regional food
economy but also a justice based
regional food economy so let's set up
the meeting we don't have enough land to
for all of our students coming out of
our program and so and then at the K
through 12 level with the kitchen prep
areas and whatnot that was at a meeting
with our congressman and the local K
through 12 in Watsonville area and if
everybody is on board to do more of this
bringing in fresh local produce but they
don't have the area to prep it so in our
case just our growers need access to
more capital and more land so it really
comes down to economics you know money
and how we can find a better source like
that so don't know maybe it grant or
something to help stimulate that just to
get everybody on track well getting back
also to thinking about the points you're
raising how would you identify land that
could maybe may be made available for
food production whether
cluding in urban areas for example as
well as in terms of land that's that's a
lying fallow or is unutilized or is
foreclosed land and what's happening to
it so kind of the inventory issue is
also significant so there's lots of
possibilities and it's you know the food
movement and the food justice movement
is both a new movement but it's it's
very rapidly taking gone really major
both major opportunities and major
challenges we've seen a shift from just
thinking of it in terms of my own
trajectory when I got involved in the
early 90s an enormous shift in
consciousness that's taken place in
discourse around food in ways in which
the the desire to do things differently
around food is out there but the
capacity to make that change is uneven
even as we start seeing some of these
breakthroughs on that note what do you
see as the biggest obstacle to having
that there the capacity be increased I
guess to have this movement be you know
take greater hold well I think we're at
the at a point where there are real
potential institutional breakthroughs
and how those institutions have operated
is the going to be the challenge so let
me give you an example Walmart's
announcement that it wants to purchase
local and organic the argument I would
raise about Walmart doing that is on the
one hand I think it's a great victory
that this food retail this global food
retailer which had only defined what it
would get into its stores is now saying
well the this is important it has to
reach out it's it's it's also it's
vulnerable to the criticism of the role
it's played so on the one hand it's a
great victory the other hand it's at
best cautionary if not dangerous because
of the way in fact Walmart operates is
that it doesn't have that approach of
thinking of Justice orientation it does
put the squeeze on its suppliers it
dictates the terms of it and we tell we
told a story in the book of from a local
Midwestern grower who recounted it to us
of when Walmart really wanted to get
into the Chicago area and so wanted to
kind of scale up its reputation so it
said well we're going to go organic and
we're going to go local to show to
people in Chicago that it it really was
capable of moving this direction so it
decided would highlight local
watermelons in the summer so it
contracted with one of the largest of
the growers still kind of a medium sized
grower and said well here's our supply
needs and this is the price you're going
to have to agree to and here's the
volume needs and when you have to do it
and as a consequence that grower became
a broker and bought out basically the
watermelon crop in a radius around where
the walmart was supplying what that
meant is that there were a no
watermelons at that season in the
farmers market and be the growers were
getting less of a price through the
Walmart system than they would have
through a direct marketing system so
that becomes the challenge as the the
opportunity to change the food system
the way it operates we increase that
capacity we're going to start meeting
these kinds of challenges and then
thinking about how in fact
you're going to continue to build
without then becoming squeezed by who
the dominant players are and how they
operate so it's a it becomes a political
challenge it becomes a social challenge
and it becomes organizational challenge
and we'll see what happens but we're at
that at that point well I thank Google
for setting this up and having some
books available to you and hope we can
continue a dialogue</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
