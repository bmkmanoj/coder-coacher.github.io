Sandberg who will kick us off especially
for our guests Cheryl has been with
Google since 2001 and leads our online
sales and operations organization with
global responsibilities for our work
with customers with our advertising and
publishing products with our consumer
products and with our book search and is
also on the board of Google org and the
Google our organizations actually part
of Cheryl's organization prior to Google
Cheryl was chief of staff at the US
Treasury and prior to that was with
mackynzie and with the World Bank in a
variety of roles and Cheryl of course
for those of you here know her well
thank you certainly not here to talk
about me um but very excited to be here
briefly to UM open this up I'm gonna
apologize in advance for leaving today
is our quarterly AdWords client forums
we have about 150 customers and 500 of
our employees in a conference room in 43
so I just ducked out the back but I
wanted to be here because I think this
is a really important effort and one
thing I found in my time building most
of our philanthropic stuff at Google is
that Googlers really want to get
involved and we have great involvement
with the Google Grants Program we're
starting to get more involvement with
Google org but the exciting thing about
this tech talk is we have real stuff we
need done and we need volunteers for so
it's great to have you guys here and
this is I think a really good
opportunity to get involved so very
quickly and the mission here and of
these people who are our speakers are
going to say it better than I will but
is to preserve and extend the history is
and i dented eyes identities of
traditional cultures around the world
through personal stories the goal is to
have five million stories captured and
shared online by 2010 and obviously at
Google we know the power of developing
this kind of content and making it
available to the world there's a pretty
interesting op-ed I don't remember who
wrote it but it was over the last week
in New York Times it might have been
Nicholas Kristof which basically said
that if you test messaging about what
people will donate to in terms of their
time or money if you send a message
saying you know two million or you know
2.6 billion people
less than two dollars a day and that
means hunger no one responds if you send
a message saying this child you can feed
this child people respond and so I think
that in and of itself shows the
importance of this kind of project
because it is that one-on-one connection
that help people around the world
connect and we all know that there is no
hope for the truly poor on our planet if
people don't feel that connection in a
personal way and try to do something
about it this is a partnership One
Laptop Per child will distribute
millions of laptops to children in
developing countries and that is the
Nicholas newmont a project coming out of
MIT to build the hundred-dollar laptop
we are actually a supporter of that it
was the first thing google.org did was a
two million dollar donation to this
project we are obviously a big believer
story corpse will share their view what
they're doing with us today UNICEF is
here as well and what we're doing at
Google is we're applying our global
technology infrastructure so that they
can upload search and play and Stephen
Chow and our team have done a great job
leading that effort once again this is a
really good opportunity we need Googlers
we need engineering time to help build
the site we need everyone else to drive
a range of efforts and please stay after
the tuck talk to figure out how to do
more and if you can't Stephen are you
right person Stephen Chow CH 0 is the
right person to get in touch with once
again we are looking for volunteers so
I'm going to quickly introduce should I
introduce all three speakers or just one
who maybe we'll pass off the
instructions it's not here yet right
though the others yeah the others aren't
here yet so I'm gonna introduce Dave is
a I say sorry and you would get that
wrong who's the founder and executive
director of story corpse many of you may
have heard the story about this on NPR
and other places they've been
highlighted but David spent two decades
in radio documentary work has 15 Peabody
Awards a Guggenheim Fellow and macarthur
fellow among lots of other prestigious
honors started story corpse in 2003 with
a booth in Grand Central Station New
York City and later one at the World
Trade Center path train to capture 911
stories so this is someone who believes
deeply in the power of content the power
of messaging the power of information
and it's dedicating his life to make
this a reality it's an honor to have you
here and be able to be your partner okay
hi thanks thanks thanks so much for
coming I'm just curious has anybody here
heard of StoryCorps heard StoryCorps
okay some people good well I'm gonna
what I'm going to do today is just
pretty much play a bunch of StoryCorps
stories and then talk about and then
talk about a little bit about what we're
going to be doing with one laptop per
child we're kind of at the very
beginning of this effort StoryCorps as
Cheryl said is a very simple idea we
opened in Grand Central Terminal about
three and a half years ago I had been a
radio documentary producer for NPR for
about 20 years before that and and the
idea of StoryCorps simple we built this
soundproof booth where you come with
with anybody you want you can bring a
parent a grandparent a friend someone
who you pass on the street who you're
interested in getting to know you come
to the booth and you're met by a
facilitator who's someone who works for
us and serves a one-year tour of duty
with StoryCorps who talks you about
what's going to happen during your
interview process and then brings you
inside this booth in Grand Central
Terminal closes a door and you're in
this booth and it's dead silent in Grand
Central Station it's kind of a sacred
space the lights are low and you sit at
a table across from your grandmother for
40 minutes and you talk the facilitators
in the corner in front of the equipment
and you ask anything you want most
people ask the big life questions like
what are the most important lessons
you've learned in life how do you want
to be remembered what did you sing to me
when I was a child at the end of the 40
minutes to CDs have been burned one goes
home with you a second one goes to the
library of congress to become part of an
oral history of america and excerpts are
also played on NPR and we put them on
our website on story cornet so I'm going
to just take you through over the next
half hour kind of the history of
StoryCorps through stories that we've
recorded and I'm going to start with the
story that we recorded very early on
this is in may be the end of 2003 early
two thousand four just after we opened
our booth and it's a couple who
came to the booth his name was Danny
Peraza and he was a off track betting
clerk in Brooklyn and a great New York
character and he brought his wife Annie
Annie is a nurse in Brooklyn and they
came to remember their first date that
had happened 25 years before so this is
danny and annie Peraza at the StoryCorps
booth in Grand Central Terminal she
started to talk and I said listen I'm
gonna deliver a speech ice at the end
you're gonna want to go home I see you
represented thirty four letter word I
said that word is love I says it for
going anywhere going down the aisle
because I'm too tired to second to soy
to do any other damn thing and she
turned around and she said well of
course home area when the next morning I
called it was early as I possibly could
and he always gets up early to make sure
make sure she hadn't changed her mind
and she hadn't and every year on on
april twenty second around three o'clock
i call her and ask her if it was today
would she do it again and so far the
answers been the same yeah 25 times yes
you see the thing of it is I always feel
guilty when I say I love you to you and
I say it so often I say it to remind you
that as don't be as I am it's coming
from it's it's like hearing a beautiful
song from a busted old radio and it's
nice you to keep the radio around the
house if I don't have a note on the
kitchen table I think there's something
wrong you write a love letter to me the
only way to could possibly be wrong as I
couldn't find it so II pad to my
princess the weather out today is
extremely rainy i'll call you at eleven
twenty in the morning it's a robotic
welder and i love you i love you i love
you when a guy is happily married no
matter what happens at work no matter
what happens in the rest of the day
there's a shelter when you get home
there's a knowledge knowing that you can
hug somebody without them throwing
downstairs and saying get your hands off
me and it being married is like having a
color television site you never want to
go back to black and white
the illness is not hard on so Danny and
Annie kind of personified so much of
what StoryCorps stands for the idea that
our stories the stories of regular
people of everyday people are as
interesting and important as the
nonsense OOP oh that's me as the as the
nonsense that were fed about celebrities
from everywhere we look and and the
power and poetry that you'll find in the
voices and stories of the people all
around us if you take the time to listen
Danny Danny and Annie became kind of the
grandparents of StoryCorps they would
come back to StoryCorps all the time to
interview each other to read each other
love notes Danny would bring different
characters who he knew to the booth
major league umpire and undercover cops
all sorts of people he started calling
the office every week to see if we
needed him to come in he'd say I had a
cataract operation last week you need me
to come in and document that and we'd
say sure come on in Danny whatever you
want to do and and we eventually even
started traveling the country because
this had meant so much to them to be a
part of StoryCorps and then about a year
ago Danny was diagnosed with pancreatic
cancer and we actually ended up
dedicating our naming our Grand Central
booth after Danny and Annie and he came
to that dedication and a week later we
went to his house to record a final
interview with with with Danny and Annie
and you'll hear that danny who was about
on he was sure he was less than five
feet tall he was bald he had cross eyes
and he had one or two teeth but had more
romance in his little pinky than all of
Hollywood celebrities put together so
this is Danny and Annie after he's
diagnosed with pancreatic cancer on
their last story court interviewed
together at Danny and Annie's home in
Bay Ridge be the illness is not hard on
me it's just you know the finality of it
and him he goes along like a trooper
listen even downhill a car doesn't roll
unless it's pushed and you're giving me
a great push
the deal of it is we try to give each
other hope and not hope that I will hope
the joke too well after I pass hope the
people would support her hope didn't she
meet somebody in like some she marries
yeah he has everything planned you know
I'm working on she said it was her call
she wants to walk out behind the casket
alone I guess that's the way to do it
because when we were married you know
how your brother takes a diner for
detection time she said well I don't
know which of my brothers to walk in
with I don't want to offend anybody
that's as I got a solution I said you
walk him with me you walk out with me
and the other day I said who's gonna
walk down the aisle with you behind the
cast it you know where to support her
and she said nobody I walked in with you
alone i walk it out with you there's a
thing in life where you have to come to
terms with Diane well I all come to turn
to Italia I want to come to terms would
be ensure that you understand that my
love for you up to this point was it
what surely as it could be and will be
as much to compete for eternity I always
said the only thing I have to give you
as a poor gift and it's myself and I
always David and if there's a way to
come back and give it I'll do that to
you have the Valentine sale under there
yeah my dearest wife this is a very
special day it is a day of which we
share all of which still grows after all
these years now that love is being used
by us to sustain us through these hard
times or my love all my days and forth
happy Valentine's Day I could write or
on about her she lights up the room in
the morning when she tells me to put
both hands on the children so she could
support me
she lights up my life when she says to
be at night wouldn't you like a little
ice cream or would you please drink more
water I notes aren't very romantic
things to say but they stood my heart in
my mind and my heart to has never been
there is that now and never will be
another any Danny recorded that on a
Thursday and it aired on NPR the next
Friday and Danny died about an hour
after the broadcast on NPR and Annie
received about two thousand letters from
NPR listeners which she now reads one of
them a day instead of the letter that
you would get from Danny so I have I
have one that I'll share with you it
says dear Danny and Annie I'm a 22 year
old elementary music teacher in inner
city school in pennsylvania and your
story well let me just say i was late to
work because of the tears falling from
my eyes today was the first time I'd
ever heard of you and I think you may
have changed my life already listening
to the words of people who are
completely unafraid to love each other
just gave me that irreplaceable feeling
of Hope stories say that it happens
books say that it happens songs say that
it happens but hearing your voices on
the radio proves that is does happen
yours is a kind of love talked about in
myths the kind that can move mountains
and hold up the sky the kind of love
that never ever dies you should be
national heroes with metals and
ceremonies and World Records because of
your simple devotion I was so sad to
hear of Danny's illness I wish you the
best I firmly believe that any
separation would be temporary whatever
happens next you too will be a pair that
kind of love means that you're together
forever no matter what you're a living
miracle and that's how we'll always be
I'm praying for you both and love you
very much from Kate bright and that's
the kind of response that we see all the
time from StoryCorps stories our motto
that the facilitators came up with
within a couple of weeks of StoryCorps
opening is listening as an act of love
and that's something that we see over
and over again in the booth when when
people get in the booth and the door
shuts and the two cds start rolling we
often find more often than not that one
of the people in the pair
starts to cry and I think it's just the
fact that in this day and age the act of
just sitting with someone you care about
and listening tells people that they
matter and that they won't be forgotten
and that's really what the core of
StoryCorps is all about I'll play
another interview from kind of early on
a grand central terminal that speaks to
how the microphone in StoryCorps can
give you the license to ask questions
that you don't normally get to ask over
the course of a typical day many of the
interviews and story for
intergenerational their grandparents
being interviewed by kids or grandkids
this is also an intergenerational but
it's not an older person in the booth
this is a daughter who came to the booth
with her mom her name is Caitlin Seaver
her mom's name is Lynne Caitlin's 10
years old and Lynn is a lesbian and
being in the booth with her mom gave her
the opportunity to ask questions that
she doesn't only get to ask over the
course of day-to-day life so this is
caitlin and lynn in Grand Central
StoryCorps I'm Caitlin I'm 10 and
today's the 10th and right now I'm being
interviewed by my mom and I'm also
interviewing my mom too how would you
describe yourself I describe myself as
nice beautiful caring can be stubborn
huh picky about friends what do you want
to see yourself do when you're a
grown-up what do you imagine what would
make you happy I think I might want to
be straight with a nice husband and i
think i would like to travel quite a bit
but of course I don't have any idea what
it's like to have kids mm-hmm cuz i am a
kid myself mm-hmm i have a question for
you yeah how is being a parent change
too oh my god being a parent has made me
be much more responsible and made me
really think about someone other than
myself I mean can I tell you a little
secret yeah I used to always worry about
dying I used to have this like huge fear
of dying a trained dog yeah I had this
huge brain bug annum when you came into
my life the brain bug just flew out the
door bye-bye I know and I think it
really was because I stopped like having
all this focus on myself you know like
me me me suddenly there was you you know
this things are really helping me
because there are some things which I
was curious about and now this recording
thing makes me really think that
whatever you're saying is true yeah well
this is like this is very important this
recording there's no point not to tell
the truth how many partners did you have
before Anita well okay I had male
partners and i also had female partners
i know i just want holman so i probably
had um about 12 girlfriends or
boyfriends before I Melanie though do
you really truly love Anita very much
with all my heart and I won't need you
really truly love me oh my god with like
my heart the next door neighbor's heart
the people are in the corners heart with
everything I have I love you honestly
honestly okay you want to ask me
anything oh and stop it i'll of course i
love you there you go does anybody have
any questions about what you've heard so
far okay we we launched actually two
years ago this week we became a national
project with two mobile StoryCorps
booths that have been traveling around
the country and Airstream trailers going
from city to city recording the stories
of this nation capturing the voice of
the nation and I'm going to play you
something from the first day or two
after we opened we opened at the Library
of Congress in Washington DC and a
grandfather and a grandson came to the
booth Ezra you may his name of the
grandfather he came to interview his of
the grandson he came to interview his
grandfather Sam Harmon in the booth and
and this is ezra and Sam in our mobile
booth in Washington DC throughout my
life you what was the saddest moment of
your life early in the Navy no station
and Norfolk Virginia one day my
shipmates and I decide
to come to Washington to visit the
capital I drove the car I didn't drink
at the time so they always used me to be
the designated driver while they were at
the bars i decided to sightsee I walked
around the monuments all day and was
just tired out and decided that I would
go to movie rest and then picked him up
later it was right here on Pennsylvania
Avenue there is a movie house there and
i went up to buy a ticket there's a
glass there the ticket seller behind it
and off of the glass reflected the
Capitol dome and I just thought to
myself what a great way to end the day
shrinking in all of this democracy I
call for the ticket she was reading she
punched the machine I reached my hand to
get the ticket and lay down the money
and she pulled it back and said you
can't come in here she saw my black hand
and refused to sell me a ticket to
Capitol dome was superimposed on her
angry face angered that I would have the
temerity to ask buy a ticket and I just
walked the streets crying all night
that's a sadist without any exception
it's the most painful recollection of
anything that's ever happened to me that
I have my phone I for us StoryCorps is
really about the experience for the two
people in the booth all of our focus is
on giving people really a sacred
experience during those 40 minutes but I
think one of one of the things that's
going to come out of this is really a
history a bottom-up history of life in
the United States during the 20th and
21st century through our voices I mean
so often history is told through the
voices of you know statesmen and
politicians but this is going to be an
opportunity to really hear what life is
like on the ground we've done about
11,000 interview so far this mobile
booth has been to about 60 cities and 40
States 40 42 43 states since we launched
and it's been it's been an amazing thing
to watch when we what
we launched two years ago we weren't we
were really only known in New York City
and within six weeks after launching
when we pulled into portland oregon
people were honking and clapping on the
streets as the booth pulled in so
there's a real hunger i think in this
country for for for this kind of
connection in these kind of stories yes
yeah StoryCorps is a completely insane
project we are we are committed it is
free we asked for a ten dollar donation
to participate and each interview costs
us about two hundred and fifty dollars
to record so every in every booth every
hour of the day we're basically losing
about two hundred and forty dollars so I
spend all my time running around
fundraising but we're completely
committed we were working or committed
to always keeping it affordable to
everybody if if this wasn't accessible
to everybody and we do a tremendous
amount of outreach into communities in
fact twenty five percent of our
interviews are done with non-traditional
NPR listeners your typical and PR
listener is kind of upper middle class
white and we we put a relentless focus
on making sure that we hit all kind all
parts of the country and make sure that
everyone can afford it we ask people for
donations and that's a stream of income
for us and the rest of it comes from
foundation funding and from the
government yeah yeah we one of the great
things about this I mean this is not
it's a very very simple idea I mean it's
really two people in a booth talking to
each other and one of the one of it one
of the interesting things about this
model of doing oral history or whatever
it is you call it is it because it's a
citizen interview model interviews can
be done in any language so as long as
the person doing the interview can can
communicate even just a little bit with
the facilitator you're good to go so
we've done interviews in dozens of
languages and continue to do them now
the facilitators for the most part won't
be speaking the language of the people
who are doing who are doing the
interview in those cases but you know
they'll they'll see the participants
laughing and crying and talking about
ever language there and having a great
time and
and that's it that's all good for us and
someday and maybe this is something
someday we can work with Google with on
we'll have the capacity to translate
these but right now we're actually one
of the one of if not the fastest growing
nonprofit in the country right now we've
gone we were about five people when we
launched and we're about 60 people now
three and a half years later so we're
kind of just trying to build capacity as
quickly as we can and fight on all
fronts and kind of answers as much of
the need we have an interest across the
country in this project as we can yes
well we have we we put our clips on on
our website on story cornet that these
these air every Friday on Morning
Edition which is the top-rated morning
show in the country and second only to
rush limbaugh for radio audiences and
this is an audio project we basically
that what the what we have with each
interview is this 40-minute audio
interview and people sign a release if
they want this to go into the library of
congress and be accessible when i
started the project i figured that we
get fifty to sixty percent of people
wanting to sign the release because what
happens into the booth is so intimate
it's been about it's been greater than
ninety-nine percent everybody everybody
signs released so so we put it up on our
website it goes on NPR and there are
some other radio shows that carry it as
well but i think that that distribution
on the internet and through cell phones
and getting the material out there is
the future for StoryCorps yes hey they
are we have we when they sign the
release we have the rights to do what we
want to do with these interviews but our
are we look at our relationship with the
participants as absolutely paramount so
even though we have clearance to do
anything with with with these when we
cut these are 40 minute interviews
you're hearing excerpts that are cut to
three minutes so we'll call participants
ask their permission play it for them
make sure they're comfortable with it
and this is if eventually as we've been
talking about with Stefan we put the
entire 11,000 and it's growing
geometrically every year interviews
online we're going to have to figure out
I know how to work with the participants
and make sure that they're comfortable
with this and and that there aren't
identity theft and kind of fraud issues
that come up because what happens in the
interviews are is just wildly intimate
let me play let me move on because I I
only have a couple minutes left as
Cheryl said we opened at the World Trade
Center two years ago also we opened a
booth when when when StoryCorps started
I thought that we would have a lot of
families who had a loved one who was
dying in hospice care come to the booth
to interview them and that's something
we saw a lot of but we also saw people
coming to the booth to memorialize and
remember people who had passed away and
soon after we open the World Trade
Center came to us and asked us to work
with them and it seemed like a good fit
and we made an announcement with the
world trade center foundation that we
would try to record one story with a
family member to to remember all of the
4,000 people who lost her life on sep
tember 11 2001 and had been working on
that over the last year and a half or so
so I'm going to play too quick clips
from the World Trade Center the first is
from John Allen line on who came to
StoryCorps to remember their son Paul
Battaglia Paul worked at marsh &amp;amp;
mclennan he was 22 years old on
September 11th lived at home with his
parents this was his first job and and
his his mother and his stepfather came
to StoryCorps to talk about him and also
to remember September 11
just kept hoping that it was because the
first one had hit vil you know before 9i
just kept hoping that maybe he was still
down in the lobby or no here early
because he had a meeting and he left
whistling that morning he is very happy
he was going to his meeting he's going
to work the fact i was going to ask him
to wait for me to ride the train with
him because i love to sit next to him on
the train i love to smell as aftershave
we had such a happy night the night
before September 10th 2001 we were
joking and laughing and I actually was
so happy when I went to sleep that night
that's the thing that got me afterwards
I had no premonition you think that you
should know something horrible is going
to happen to your child that day and I
was so happy that night thinking that I
had such a nice family I had such a good
life that was truly blessed and then 12
hours later it was very different I
don't miss him until I die yeah Keith
mere Holt's also came to the booth with
his wife gret keith was also an employee
at marsh we also record the stories of
survivors and rescue workers keith was
was on his way up to the hundredth floor
when the plane hit and he was the only
person in his elevated to survive the
attack of sep tember 11 and came to the
booth with his wife to also talk about
September 11th so this is keith mere
halts and gret mere Holtz and Keith
again worked at marsh &amp;amp; mclennan I just
kept hoping that it was someone came in
and into the room and said that the
terror had fallen and then and I thought
that was it I kind of gave up hope
fortunately I didn't wait too long to
call that shortly after you called and I
picked up the phone and you just said
gret I'm alive and I start screaming so
that
buddy in the house would know I don't
even remember what I said yes I do you
said I made it out and have some some
burns but i'm i'm i'm gonna get away and
I just remember screaming just get away
get away get away you'd make it huh how
do you think you've changed how do I
think I've changed it I guess I'm not
really sure I do know that every time I
I I get mad at you or we have an
argument I can think back to September
11th and I can kind of forgive you
anything um and I love you because you
make me laugh even though I always say
I'm fine no way I'm definitely funnier
and then you're my best friend yeah and
it's nice to have a best friend to go
through life with I'm I have a lot of
clips to play but I'm going to just play
one more because we're we're out of time
but before I do that I mean I just I
want to say that um first of all I'm
excited about the possibility of working
with Google to to find ways to get
StoryCorps content out there farther and
wider and and to get the whole
collection up on the web and to do all
kinds of neat things with this material
because two-story court I think I i
think what story court does is it
reminds us of of our shared humanity I
mean we've record recorded stories from
in every language from every walk of
life every age socio-economic group race
and when you listen to these stories
they all go back to the kind of great
two three two or three great themes of
life of existence birth and and your
parents and your parents dying love if
you have kids loving your kids and and
and and dying and out of these stories
come this incredible rainbow of stories
that continue to surprise me every week
as a radio producer I thought that when
we launched StoryCorps I figured that
after three months or four months or
five months the stories would start
repeating how many
different answers can you get from a
grandkid interviewing you know his
grandparent but you know about a year
into the project the senior radio
producer said you know Dave the stories
keep getting better and it's been true
and continues to be true I mean it's
just amazing the kind of stories that
come out of this but when you listen to
these stories you realize that as a
nation and certainly across the world
you'll find the same thing this is this
story kors very much focused on the
United States but that there's there's
so much more that we share in common
that divides us and that if we spent
more time listening to each other and
less time shouting to each other on on
on talk radio and wherever we'd be a
better and thoughtful and more
compassionate nation and that's what
what story cores about making this world
a little bit of a better place and I
know that's what what you guys are
trying to do with Google so I'm excited
to work with you guys Stephan came to
visit me just about a month ago I guess
and we were talking about StoryCorps and
and he brought up the one laptop per
child idea and we started talking and
and and one of the interesting things
about story whores because of the nature
of the questions being asked these
facilitators who again serve this
one-year tour of duty kind of listening
in and helping to facilitate these
conversations are basically collecting
not only kind of history but even more
than that the wisdom of humanity and the
idea that that that Stefan and I came up
with with the microphones on these One
Laptop Per child computers is that maybe
this this isn't really StoryCorps but is
kind of a do-it-yourself StoryCorps
people would go out with their with
their microphone wherever wherever they
are in the world and ask their
grandparent or an elder one question
maybe that question would be what
lessons have you learned in life what
are the most important lessons you've
learned in life and then upload it
somewhere into Google and then kind of
in one fell swoop have collected the
wisdom of humanity which is kind of a
neat simple and kind of an amazing idea
so that's that story course relationship
with this project and we look forward to
to working with with you guys on on the
one laptop and then also on on story
corn in general figuring how to get this
out there because as certainly as a
country we need this very badly and we
are we we are fully intend to build
into a national institution that you
know documents and defines the character
of this nation because when you go
around and you listen to these stories
one thing that all the facilitators come
back and say is that this is really who
we are as Americans I mean these are
this is about authenticity these are
real stories people speaking from the
heart and the you know the bullshit that
you hear the nonsense that we're kind of
fed does not represent who this country
is and we are not a country divided into
red and blue states we are really just
people and if we spend some time
listening to each other I think that
this would be a very different country
I'm going to play one more clip this is
this is an early StoryCorps clip it
speaks to the magic of what happens in
the booth it's a couple who came to the
booth she was 26 at the time this is
Grand Central again he's 25 and and they
came to the booth to interview each
other his name is Michael walnuts and
her name is Debra bruh cars and this is
in grand central terminal so what was
the most emotionally painful thing that
ever happened uh thinking about it takes
my breath away but my father passing
away of course just over two years ago
and he was the closest person to me it
was sudden and he was supposed to pick
me up from the airport in new york and i
got to the airport and i called my house
and my mother said um you know your
aunt's gonna pick you up obviously i
could detect something in her voice
there's no way that you could hide that
and i was like tell me what it is my
mother said I don't want to tell you
like this and I was like tell me you
have to tell me tell me and she told me
that he died in the middle of the night
I stood there and watch the bags go
around the carousel and I waited for my
back and I went outside and I got in my
aunt's car and I felt like no other time
in my life so this is the ring that my
thought I'd gave to my mother and we can
leave it there and he saved up and he
purchased this and he proposed to my
mother with this and so I thought that I
would give it to you so that he could be
with us for this also
um so I'm going to share a mic with you
right now Deborah where's the right
finger Deborah will you please magic of
course so kids this is how your mother
and i got married in a booth in Grand
Central Station with my father's ring my
grandfather was a cab driver for 40
years used to pick people up here every
day so it seems right we were walking
and walk so that's the story of
StoryCorps thank you all for listening
and I look forward to working with you
all in the future to bring StoryCorps
and the one laptop per child
collaboration to the world so onward and
thank you very much well thank you to
Dave and we appreciate all the great
efforts of StoryCorps is doing we look
forward to partnering with them as we
try and take a lot of the kernel of what
you heard about today globally in
partnership with the folks from one
laptop per child I wanted to introduce
next SJ Klein who is the director of
content for the one laptop per child
effort so you spent many years
developing collaborative communities
he's navigate for free universal access
to knowledge and tools and a veteran
Wikipedian he founded the wikipedias
first newsletter and translator network
and organized last year's international
Wikipedia conference in Cambridge
previously work developed software and
supporting communities for machine
assisted human translation and to set up
free education centers and we're very
appreciative Lee come out today a lot of
the folks that you see if come from the
east coast and just sort of barely made
it via planes for for this conversation
today thank you Miss Jane one one thing
I hope we see once we start recording
stories from from people everywhere is
that there may be more than just three
or four basic stories that people tell
and there are some really basic stories
that are embedded in our culture in a
way that we don't think about that much
I'm going to give a brief overview of
One Laptop Per child I know there are
there are a few EXO's in the Google
complex here how many people here have
seen and played with one that's pretty
good rare to find an audience it's that
familiar with them I have a couple here
of course you're welcome to play with
them afterwards during Q&amp;amp;A week even
pass them out long it's worth oh there
we go thank you well I'll for those of
you haven't seen one else I'll sort of
leave you with the L thanks with the the
joy of figuring out how to open them so
I sort of have the sense that when you
get children young children to tell
stories you there's more joy and more
and more enthusiasm and sometimes less
let less seriousness but that might not
be a bad thing so please interrupt me
while I'm talking we don't have that
much time for Q&amp;amp;A afterwards and I'm
more interested in hearing what you have
to say than what I have to say but you
might want to hear what I have to say so
I have a set of slides I'll try and go
through nice thing about slices that you
can edit them while you're talking so I
wanted to present OPC from the
perspective of how you build community
around content and around storytelling
and around education because ours is an
education project another technology
project and we chose laptops because for
a long time ever since the old essays
about Dinah books people have been
thinking about what it would take to
both give people access to one another
let them communicate share their own
ideas as they learn and explore and also
give them ways to create things and
capture their creativity in ways that
that weren't so transient it wasn't just
one-to-one mentoring but there is some
capture you could come back see what
happened later learn from your successes
and mistakes so 11 place to start is to
be bold to do something that's so big
that you can't do it yourself so that
it's obvious that you have to work with
other people because if you're doing
something that is based on collaboration
you should be collaborating to get it
done for us there's the lower case one
laptop per child which is what what the
whole project strives for and in that
sense our mission is to help people for
focus on youth and to focus on
development in education as something
that takes place through the youngest
generation and there's this this global
goal for for the countries of the world
to provide these kind of tools to their
children but Capital One Laptop Per
child focuses on doing this in the most
difficult regions making some of the
initial investment to demonstrate it can
happen and to see what to figure out
what the requirements are for the most
remote places the most power-hungry the
most Network starved places right now
we're launching some trials in Argentina
Brazil Uruguay Peru Nigeria Libya
Thailand and Rwanda I hope you'll
forgive me for using the American
spelling for all those countries OPC
itself is two and a half years old we
unlike StoryCorps which is growing very
quickly we try not to grow we're still
roughly 15 people we recently became a
non-profit and separated from the media
lab they want to know why MIT was going
to start building millions of laptops I
sort of I see this as one of a few new
massively multi-stakeholder non-profit
collaborations and they're kind of
exciting there a little bit addictive
they might not make as much money as
online role-playing games but right now
the group working together to make our
mission happen include all the companies
you see there including Google and
UNICEF and undp and most of the heavy
lifting is done by one of these partners
who were excited with the idea that they
could contribute to the project like
this they wanted to be sure it could
happen and once they were convinced they
said well yes we could dedicate you know
a significant portion of our manpower
and our technology and our ground
expertise to making something like this
work but we can only do our part so
there's the trick of keeping the mesh
together that connects all these
different groups the basic principles
that LPC pushes all of its countries and
that we actually require some sign off
on in agreements with our partner
countries are saturation when laptops go
into a school everyone in the school
gets it at least everyone in a certain
grade all the children and all the
teachers connectivity if there's no
connectivity there's commitment to have
it and there's at least provision
tools for local connectivity within the
town child ownership children get to
take them home starting with young and
rural children starting in the first
grade and starting in the most rural
places at the same time as they start in
urban areas sharing an open source
sharing ideas and failures and successes
and making the tools that they develop
for the product in their country work
for others so no one's doing this alone
and local creation and I'll get to the
last point and a little bit then there's
a trick of connecting people at at scale
at every level and this is tricky one of
the things you need to develop is a
sense of shared purpose and shared
mission and their language barriers in
their cultural barriers and one thing
that focusing on stories does is it
connects people at a very basic level
you don't need to share some elaborate
yes ah that's a very good question well
it has ears so someone here has opened
it can someone to show her give her a
hand thank you that's the that's the
adult proofing at work uh sure she was
asking how to open it and please do
interrupt me with that or any other
question so something about the networks
that we're using they won't always be
connected to a global server that that
hosts stories but there's a tiered just
a tiered content architecture so that
things you have can get backed up to a
school the school has servers and
digital library that can back things up
to a national repository and at least
some repository has to be connected all
the time the rest of the net so one of
the tricks for tools including these
kinds of story activities is making sure
they work well when you're sort of
offline you're with your family and
they're only a couple laptops around and
you're actually 20 kilometers from the
town center but when you go into school
there's some reasonable aggregation of
what you've made and without you having
to do a lot of extra work it works its
way up the network so this is the famous
picture from back during the prototype
stage I want to show a timeline I'll
just I'll tell you very briefly that it
was in 2005 that the first designs came
out this was what one of the first
designs looks like we went back to this
color there
crank was on the machine in about six
months the entire design had changed
about two months after that a company
has agreed to mass-produce the the
second iteration and we only finally had
all the distribution and manufacturing
in place about 12 months ago and that
started the whole timeline for mass
production at the end of this year some
of the networks we have right now are at
the highest levels of countries those
are actually easier to get than you
might think once you start because a lot
of countries want to catch up with their
neighbors but the sum of the grassroots
networks are harder the green countries
here are all trial countries with
classes using laptops right now the red
countries are poised to be next if they
can work out some of the details and the
orange countries are all places where
the heads of state have said they'd like
to be involved but I'm not sure what
that would mean or they have to make
sure that it would be politically
feasible one useful goal is to do the
hard things first and then everything
else seems easy so there are a lot of
other companies that are now thinking
about cheap laptop programs that's great
they can't go into some of the places
where we're going so we're not focusing
on places like the US where it would be
easy for a lot of people to take current
commercial laptop technology make a
cheaper machine and distribute it widely
we made these so they'd work at super
low powers you could power them by hand
the whole machine runs at to watts you
can the screen is readable in full
sunlight I'm sorry I have a thinkpad I
always feel that about this photo
because IBM and Lenovo don't really
deserve to be made fun of but I can't
use my laptop outside and we honor
storytelling in collaboration as much as
possible when we go in and work with
countries and with teachers and we start
telling them about how they might use
these new tools they all they want to
know what it is and they want to know
what the internet is they heard about it
and they hear is interesting and we try
not to focus on that until we've talked
about how they'd share ideas and stories
and what they would communicate with one
another how they could collaborate so
these are some of the different views
that you are native on the laptop every
application can figure out where it is
on the mesh and the bottom you can see
all the people who are browsing together
in one area it must be pretty exciting
people who are painting together and a
couple of different projects here's what
it might look like if you were browsing
the web and also sharing notes with a
few of your friends here's some
collaborative editing
then people who have existing tools we
say well yes what you need to do to make
them work is is make sure you have all
the neck support that's great but then
rethink your user interface try to make
it so it's simple and usable by kids try
to think about so that people could be
doing other things at the same time
collaborating around it and I hope that
when we get a good storytelling app that
it allows you to tell stories around
something else you can have other
context we have a mic of course but we
also have a video camera so there are
questions about what you would want to
include and how you'd want to share each
part this there's a lovely group in
Germany that's that's trying to move
their their literacy and language
learning and comic strip creation tools
and make to make them open source so
that we can distribute them and then and
this is just another good example of
storytelling so I'm not sure which
stories are going to work themselves
neatly into comics but we have some
pretty good comics it across all
different kinds of stories serious and
and also serious so giving people an
option of how they illustrate what
they've done maybe I can come back to it
afterwards would be fascinating and a
lot of fun for them and finally there's
it takes some effort to make change
sustainable it doesn't just happen and
great examples and starting with the
right kinds of projects help make it
easy for people to understand why they
might want to do these new things and
discovery and creation can be so
beautiful and powerful ideas once you
understand them the notion that there is
a taxonomy of species the notion I mean
things like powers of 10 that just give
you an insight into where you live who's
around you at the small and a large
scale that these are things that
inspires someone for their entire lives
change the way they think they should
devote their energies and finding ways
to grab onto that that that don't force
people to rethink what they're doing now
give them entirely new thing to play
with that's that's how I hope we start
the project and as as an example some of
the stories that we tell now when we
when we go into a school and say here
100 laptops we have a great picture from
what why the kids all getting very
excited when they see them I mean the
nice thing about bright plastic is that
everyone loves it
they want to know how what other kids
are doing they don't care what the
teacher says so like oh that's nice can
I see other kids what are they doing and
I I drove out here with a taxi driver
who's complaining that his kids spend
all the time on myspace and he says well
they're not learning it's it's like the
television when I was growing up they're
just wasting their time and one of the
thing that it's one thing it's hard to
do on myspace and on social sites that
aren't really based around telling
stories it's hard to have a meaningful
description of what you're doing it's
easy to find people and that connection
is very powerful and people love to do
it but you have to draw on that a little
bit so as a bonus these are some of the
things that I personally want to want to
make happen I love the fact that if we
get stories from these regions of the
world will suddenly have an enormous
influx of material on the web from
places with no web presence right now
that there will be some demand from a
site that wants to pull from areas where
people don't think that they are
creators they don't think of themselves
as as being able to contribute to a
knowledge economy you don't think about
economies but they don't think about
their personal stories as being
interesting and it's really important
that as they're introduced to the world
they see the introduction as a community
they've already become a part of not as
a place for them to pull things from
people who already know what there is to
know everyone does have something to
teach and I try to teach my my young me
stat she gets very excited when she can
find something that she teaches her
little brother or teaches me about how
painful it is to have your hair pulled
this is a school this is the latest
school or why wasn't even green on the
map you saw because they hadn't signed
on until about three weeks ago and since
they did they have moved very quickly to
get laptops stick them in schools fine
teachers inspire them and because they
move so quickly I think a week and a
half ago Peru said we want to do it too
and now through the president gave a
press conference and said we're giving
laptops to every child in the country
he's still figuring out how they're
doing it but he's picked a trial school
and they're going to start trialing it
in three weeks so there's a certain
domino effect once you not just see that
other people have thought about it but
there are classes like this
there are some cool videos if you want
to look online I didn't pull them down
but there are great videos from LEC in
Brazil in porto alegre and some of those
are so heartwarming though they'll make
you laugh so that's all i had but i'd
love to take a few questions so there
are a couple ways to answer one is that
we hope very much for emergent behavior
we make sure that in every in every
trial school there are programmers there
are people from the local universities
who care about education but know how to
code who can hack up the system make new
things teach kids the parts of the
system that let you break into it and
change the way it works it's not that we
have plans for storyboarding we're
providing tools for storyboarding they
may not use them that's true and I think
it's important to distinguish between
tools for capture and creation and
sharing and activities that people
regularly do and that become part of a
classroom okay so what are the reasons
that this story project is so great is
that it gives people something very
concrete to do they can see everyone
else doing it every region is going to
be able to do it any child who has
family can take part if they want to and
for teachers who want to explore what it
means to use these tools they can they
can make this part of a class or for
children who want to take part even
though their teachers don't they can
easily do this at home so what we've
seen in classes so far is
that people really like to take pictures
they really like to see themselves and
see their families and share them with
other people they haven't even gotten to
sharing outside the classroom because
there have been some concerns about how
to do that properly in every school is
working their way slowly toward the
national consensus but that they love so
I'm certain that at least this project
we're talking about will be a big hit
now other things they do in the class
they really they like to try playing
with things like II toys I don't know if
anyone's used everyone's downloaded and
tried sugar you should all try sugar we
need to get sugar campaign but it's kind
of cute and one of the nice things is it
has things like scratch and squeak which
are these graphical interfaces that you
program you draw something you make it
do something once kids learn how to do
that that's what they do on their own
they don't always read textbooks on
their own that's not so exciting I'm not
sure they did that before and the other
thing they really like is they like to
show their parents how the computers
work so I don't show that castle is an
activity but they send a lot of time
showing everyone else in the community
what this new thing is i mean this far
is engaging
so that's in trouble in Nigeria because
the kids they're not certain that
they're allowed to actually use the
machines and if no one's around to give
them authority they're kind of anxious
what if I break it and will they take my
family away and and so it takes a while
to convince them that they can go and
show them to new people and that the new
people won't be won't be offended in and
there won't be that those kinds of
trouble but and these are some of the
reasons that it's important to go in in
saturation into each locale so that
there's some cultural shift that this is
this is interesting any other questions
people who have managed to break a
laptop yet and you get bonus points if
you can break them mom my experiences
with breaking them I managed to break
the first hinge I think my personal
experiences with kids I'll tell you one
story and then and then we should move
on I was sitting in a cafe and I
whenever I go somewhere I bring my
laptops and I leave them with the
youngest person I can find and so there
was a four-year-old and her mother was
there and again the four-year-old in
this case wasn't scared but the mother
was she's like you don't really mean
that that she can play with that so look
no no she gets points if she can break
it and after 10 minutes she brought it
back to me very sweet she hadn't said a
word and I didn't tell her how to use it
since the whole idea is is supposed to
be a discoverable in her face and you
know there's some question is that how
discoverable it is so you have to test
it with kids she came back and she she
laid on the table and she said will I be
able to see other kids too I thought
that was really cute I mean she found
the camera and she knew she was seeing
her cell phone and she really wanted to
see other people and I hadn't said that
this was something for kids but it was
clear to her so anyway thanks a lot I'm
extremely excited
thanks to SJ and I think a lot of what
we are thinking about combines sort of
the power of what you see here in the
hands of children in many classrooms
around the world with the kind of
stories that you heard the clips that
Dave I say and his team at StoryCorps
been capturing things that is sort of
the colonel of the idea of what we're
trying to do here and to make all of
that available and accessible on the web
which is of course the part that we can
help out with I want to introduce next
dr. Sharad sopra director of
communications for UNICEF he's been with
UNICEF since 1983 and has had leadership
roles in New Delhi India in the Maldives
New York Bangladesh and Iran in 1999 to
2002 he was chief of operations for the
operation lifeline Sudan program in
Kenya and in 2002 led the Afghanistan
back to school program which resulted in
over three million children newly
enrolling in schools at a very troubled
time for that country prior to UNICEF
dr. Schaffer worked with a trust in
India and led efforts on the effect of
immunization communities for the Indian
Council of medical research he has
degrees in medicine and surgery and
preventive in social medicine in
addition coming with him will be
Christopher Fabian who is the leader for
new media solutions at UNICEF and Erica
Kochi communications partnerships for
UNICEF who are focused on a unit wiki
project which is related to what we're
doing here with the our stories so dr.
Shepherd thank you good afternoon
everybody normally people think that UN
agencies are very bitter bureaucratic
and unimaginative but hearing who I am a
physician being made as a head of
communication for the global
communication effort really needs a lot
of creative creativity and imagination
so UNICEF is a bit different we are
essentially a field-based organized
for 60 years we have been in 180
countries developed and developing we
are in 350 locations worldwide 10,000
people out of which 5,000 work in their
own country so they know the culture and
the region and for 60 years we have had
just one focus and there has been
children we deal with nothing else but
children and nothing inspires us more
than children and working with children
there is a tendency and there's a
reluctance in UNICEF to for people to
work at the headquarters we think it's a
waste of time so out of my 21 22 years
in UNICEF I've been in headquarters only
two and a half years and I don't like it
sir so the working hard every moment i
get to see how can i get back to the
field because that is where the action
is because that is the purpose of the
organization and because that is what we
are as I said we've been there in almost
every country in the world for the last
60 years whether it's an earthquake
whether it's a flood whether it's a
volcanic eruption or there is war going
on we are there before the cameras come
in we are there when the cameras are
there and we are there after the cameras
have left because we are not any belt we
are a part of the whole development
process in that country and that's our
commitment to it over so that actually
puts us in a position where we have our
trust and confidence of the community
and the government so we can work at
every level and we operate at every
level right from the community till the
national level we talked to the
president and in the same day we are
talking to the household and because of
this
shun the Convention on the Rights of the
Child is the most widely ratified
convention anywhere in the world or in
the history only two countries have not
ratified it every other country has
ratified it if you want to know the two
countries one is Somali are the other is
the one in which we are static or he
being here we are all sitting and we are
the only agency identified in the
convention to actually monitor and work
with and report on the status of
children worldwide and one of the key
articles in the convention is the
freedom of expression and that is where
we fit in in this whole place or in this
whole concept in each office that we
have via 400 location each office we
have a communication Officer and in each
country we have at least one person
who's full-time job is nothing but
working on participation of children
when we said children we talking about
birth to 18 years of age from the first
global would ever organized amongst
children to actually tell the world
leaders in the UN General Assembly as to
what are the priorities for children
which actually resulted in what is now
called the Millennium Development Goals
which every country has signed to
achieve by 2015 to even getting the
children as a part of the g8 process
this is the eighth most powerful
economically progressive and powerful
countries in the world when their head
speed in the last three years we have
managed to have a children's session
that goes on simultaneously we are
children from these countries come and
start discussing topics interacting with
a lot of PA children from the developing
countries and then they take the same
agenda that the leaders are
discussing and take it to them and say
while you're discussing at your level
this is what we think about what you
should be doing on these air topics and
what we're hoping is that in Germany
this will reach another level which is
in June and the next year in Tokyo the
children will actually be able to hold
the heads of these eight countries
accountable and say what did you do in
your last year since we met in Germany
so that's that's and I think Erica and
Chris are working on a wiki site so all
the work would take place on the wiki
and all the discussions at all and
hopefully with the one laptop so these
green laptops they have 28 our journeys
on the bus they would actually be
working with each other on these laptops
and would be connected to each other and
they already started building the pages
etc so that's exciting for us the V
really believes that the world can be a
different place if we can actually get
the children to discuss their own issues
and find solutions to the issues that
face them every single day because we
have this utmost faith that children
have the solution and it is best that
the solution is found by those who
actually have to inherit this world
rather than those who are spending the
last few years thinking how can I pass
the next few years of my life peacefully
so that you know I don't have to deal
with all the nonsense of the world kind
of thing so so it's the the kids if you
can get them to actually start working
on solutions and we have seen this
happen when I was in South Sudan I was
responsible for all the NGOs and all the
UN agencies working in the
rebel-controlled areas and we had five
different rebel groups who when they
were not fighting the government in
Khartoum were fighting with each other
and we managed to get about 50 kids from
10 from each of these tribes
to come together and set together and
say create a future for yourself and
they created a future this was in
nineteen ninety nine 70 years of war 17
years of history of conflict amongst
each other with a few years of gap and
then if you add the previous one it was
40 years of conflict in 1999 in nineteen
ninety eight hundred thousand people
died because food was not allowed to
move from one part of Sudan to the other
part of sedan in that environment these
kids stood up and said peace 2005 in
1999 everyone laughed at them and they
brought in the V brought in the rebel
Chiefs and had them listen to what the
children had to say we brought in the
dice poor and I had them listen to what
children's plans were guess what in
spite of all the skepticism that was
there the children don't know anything
children can't do anything 2003 the
peace agreement was signed 2005 there
was a unified government and there is no
fighting in South Sudan their food is a
part which is still not there now this
happened even when we couldn't bring the
kids from cartoon there imagine what
would have been possible if the kids
from Khartoum could also have said in
that same discussion and would have
created a future that was a joint future
which we are now working on on how to do
it in to 2002 january and i was asked to
get do something to get 1.5 million kids
into school and i said how much time do
you have and they said 60 days which
meant creating 7,000 classrooms
identifying 50,000 teachers getting 200
million text books printed getting 60
tons of supplies moved in when the
Taliban was still bombing the airports
were closed and bombed out and it was
snow everywhere and biggest challenge we
had was how to actually communicate the
message to kids how do you get the
teachers trained and oriented so that on
day one everyone at books and textbooks
because that was not just about
education it was about the future of
Afghanistan and we made we managed to do
it I spent a long time traveling on
donkeys
we have 6,000 donkeys as consultants
because that was the only mode of
transport in many parts of the country
but imagine if we had a tool that would
actually link us with all these kids and
school teachers what we would have been
able to do plus having worked with
children for 19 20 years every child I
was in South Sudan and we managed to get
the single largest demobilization of
child soldiers ever undertaken in the
history we've got 4,000 kids out of the
army and we didn't know they all spoke
different language they all had never
seen anything but death and other things
we couldn't connect them to the rest of
the world the only thing we could do was
bring in a V sad which in those days was
150 thousand dollars and we connected
them with the spare capacity so that
they can do some VoIP and they could but
imagine the power of connecting them and
each of these kids had stories to tell
every single day of their life was a
story and the way we could get out of
that trauma over six months was letting
them take it out talk about it talk to
each other such they wouldn't even talk
to each other so our challenge is from
your SS perspective and that's why I'm
so interested in this we're not
technology people you are and what we're
looking for is how do we connect kids a
lot of our audience is or the target
audience of kids's who whose only way of
learning is from stories and songs or
writing on sand slates this is a box
that is created and some mud is put in
there or sand so that they can learn the
alphabet and then you shake the sand box
and then you write again that's the only
mode of writing or something to the kids
who have access to a piece of paper and
pencil to a kid who has access to a cell
phone to a kid who has access to a PDA
or this wonderful one laptop which is
now going into many countries or access
to an Internet how do you
connect these people because I firmly
believe having worked with these kids
for so many years that if they talk to
each other they have a solution for what
we consider is a problem which is
unsolvable so I hope that you folks
would would help us achieve that dream
because I can tell you there is nothing
more rewarding than seeing in the eyes
of these kids who when we demobilized
them they had stone eyes the child was
not there in their childhood and six
months later they had hopes they had
aspirations they have dreams of being a
most of them wanted to be a pastor
because the pastor in South Sudan had a
bicycle they had never they never owned
a bicycle or shoes or clothes nothing
some wanted to be teachers and then
others wanted to be pilots because they
saw our planes going and dropping food
and everything in so that was exciting
for them but but from kids who would
only know how to kill or run away from
danger who had seen their friends kill
suddenly in six months by just talking
to each other we didn't have any trained
psychologist no one they just talk to
each other they played with each other
and it took them two months to even
start talking to each other but in six
months they wanted to be teachers they
wanted to be doctors they wanted they
they were looking for you and I think
that what this communication can do is
bring what is missing and a lot of these
kids a sense of hope a sense of a future
in a sense that they they they matter
and so I hope that we would be able to
make that dream come true change the
world with children and I'll leave now
to Erica and others to talk sense
because and and say something that is of
you know technologically useful for you
interesting for you
this is what our team in New York
headquarters uses to sort of visualize
some of the things that Sharad talked
about and how we can approach them we're
working on a project called yoona wiki
that's a working name and it's not
really a true name because it's not a
wiki and it's not a website it's not a
classroom it's not a storytelling
environment but its parts of all of
those so what we do is sort of sit
around and drill holes in these various
cubes and figure out how we can put
different pegs in them and make
different circles stand out in front of
it if we can pull can you get that up on
the on the screen basically what what
we're trying to do difficulties and
Google headquarters we've got we've got
sort of three three axes that we're
working on here one is the axis that
we've been talking about today the axis
of community kids from a school in New
York we're very very connected sit
somewhere right near the origin here in
the darkest cube a kid who's a child
soldier street child somewhere in Uganda
sits much further along the axis and
really has no ability to communicate
right now horizontally with anybody else
as sharad said one of the big problems
is that lack of connectivity another one
of the axes that we're working with is
the yellow one it's an axis of media or
type of methodology of communication
goes from the most dense this laptop or
a desktop that's connected all the time
up to a hybrid computer like OLPC which
maybe is connected or maybe is
asynchronous on in terms of its
connectivity the pda's mobiles and and
paper that I brought this because it's
better than the PowerPoint you can kind
of sindh these around and switch them
around but so paper sitting as the least
dense point on that axis and the third
the one that we really want to talk to
everybody here about and get some help
with the our stories project is an
access of communicative type we've made
it from again most dense to least dense
and something like gaming sits here at
near the at near the origin gaming the
idea that everybody's communicating at
the same time on many different levels
about something is a much more dense
type of communication than smsing where
you have occasional back in forth
relationships and somewhere in the
center sits something like a wiki a
collective work space somewhere
something like transmedia the idea of
collecting stories and radio or audio
your video format photo format and
linking the stories together one of the
things that most struck me I was just in
Uganda about three weeks ago and I was
talking to a group there that's
unfortunately called well unfortunately
acronym the girls education movement and
they were talking about their back to
school campaign one of the most
important things for them is to ensure
that the girls who are out of school
because either they got pregnant and
left or their parents are worried about
their safety somehow get back to school
so these kids who are like 16 17 18
years old go and negotiate contracts
with the parents of girls who are out of
school and will write a contract that
says you send your daughter back to
school for X number of months and we
will pay for the clothing the supplies
etc and they said one of the things
that's most important to them is to be
able to use radio to convince the
parents that if their girl goes back to
school she isn't going to be in danger
there won't be stigma etc I said well
how do you get the radio in these are a
lot of the places that they work are
displaced person camps or a village
that's really remote and there's not a
lot of electricity and I said well we
still have community radio okay so how
do you get the radio signal how do you
get the broadcast into that community
radio they said well we go around at the
tape recorder and we record it and you
know take it back to the station and few
days later we'll playback will interview
some parent will say hello you know mr.
parent what happened when your girl went
back to school and you say so it's great
you know not only did she not be she was
not stigmatized and nothing bad happened
to her but because of her I learned how
to count and so when I go to the market
I can i can do addition and math and i
don't get ripped off they play that over
the radio and suddenly people have
access to a type of community that they
didn't before but the problem is in the
problem with a lot of these things and I
think what David is talking about with
with our stories the reason that they
have mobile buses now is that it's
sometimes hard to get the person and the
signal and the broadcast all together in
one place and this unit wiki model is
very much about how to do that in a
whole variety of ways as far as the our
stories project goes the the way that we
would like to bring the signal and the
person and the story together in one
place and the help that we would like
from you is is a connection of some of
these boxes we'd like to know that you
can go into a displaced
Camp with a mobile phone go up to a kid
and say here record your story have them
record that on the phone call hang up
send a bunch of tags by SMS have that
all land on a wiki page somewhere that
somebody else can instantly access start
working with edit and rebroadcast back
into that same camp from a mobile
broadcasting station within 10 minutes
of seeing the the file appear on the on
the wiki we'd like to know that you can
mms photos in series and have those
become a photo essay that shows
something about your town or your
village or the places that you live and
we'd like to I think as SJ said be able
to teach people how to teach others
through these shared experiences know my
things flashing on all that must be it
must be really brutal for everybody over
there alright we'd like to make as many
links as possible here it's very easy
for us to conceptualize the links here
in the states we've got connectivity
we've got good computers we've got
people who have education on the access
to to free time what we don't have in
these places as these bars get longer
they get more wobbly right so it's kind
of a little unstable here and we would
very much like with this our stories
project to start to figure out how to
make the longest possible bars so we get
the stories from the farthest away with
the thinking that as much space as you
have here between people you can
actually get that amount of learning
back and that amount of appreciation of
other people's cultures what's going on
and how the world can become sort of a
more connected and safe place erica's
you want to talk for a few seconds about
the minutes seconds half a second about
the j 8 conference sure um so one of the
things are working at which actually
combines would've got a lot of things
along those axes and into that red ball
of our science project is what Sharad
was referring to before as the j8 where
these 90 kids from all over the world
get together and put together a position
paper which they present to some world
leaders in a very sort of high media
high level forum and one of their
complaints was really that from year to
year they really had a hard time sort of
conceptualizing what they should do
after this really high-profile event
when they went back to their country and
also you know how would they actually
keep
in touch in touch with each other after
the event so sort of the first thing we
decided to do along this you know sort
of our triumvirate of axes here was to
build them a very simple collaborative
workspace we had a few constraints the
first one as sharad said was there there
there on a bus for like 16 hours during
the week that they have to work together
so that's essentially was you know dead
33 there are three different buses even
because there's 90 of them that was a
dead time where they had to where they
wouldn't be able to actually sort of
constructively get something on paper
that they could present two leaders the
second constraint which was um I was
very confusing to me but supposedly
heiligen DOM is a port town is they were
on a steel-hulled boat for most of the
time as well so internet was not really
going to be anything that they could use
so what we decided to do and with one
laptops help was bring them some old old
pcs which actually have a mesh network
so hopefully all these kids can work on
the oil pcs creating their their
position papers even though they're
going to be on the bus and on the boat
for the majority of their time the other
thing we're looking at is how do we do
sort of multiple concurrent asynchronous
edits on this wiki unfortunately we know
another guy who is developing a wiki
which actually will enable them to do
that so our wiki is going to going to
have that functionality as well so just
to give you this is sort of just a
screenshot of the German page so this
this this Jay it's not happening or the
g8 as well as not happening till the the
beginning of June but we're already
trying to get some of the country teams
who are involved on the wiki so they can
you know start meeting each other and
sort of put up their resources and start
are already talking about the issues
that they're going to have to
disqus and come to some you know really
sort of tough decisions at the g8 so
let's see if I can find I have it online
not the New York Times no here I don't
know if you know it's the resolution
it's not very good in this okay the
internment what if any of you want to
see sort of a take a little tour around
the workspace afterwards please just
feel free to come and I'll show you on
my computer the other thing we're doing
or where we have done and this is sort
of going out on a lot of the one laptops
is what we're calling you know wiki and
it has sort of at the moment for content
areas one is hiv/aids the second is
water and sanitation the third is child
rights and child protection and the
fourth is education and basically this
is very much of a collaborative area
where you know kids can write their own
stories take their own photos sort of
put up activities and actually talk back
and feedback too well UNICEF and whoever
else is interested about what they think
of the issues that or that affect their
lives and because this is also done on a
wiki they can maybe they don't want to
talk about hiv/aids they can actually
put up what whatever they want they want
to talk about or whatever they find
important to them we think that the sort
of our stories project would fit really
well in in sort of this area on not only
on the OLPC but on the you know wiki as
well and hopefully with sort of trying
to fill out some of these axes we can
bring sort of not only all the kids who
receive all pcs but also other kids in
the world will have an opportunity to
basically contribute to to this and
that's it you guys have any questions
no okay oh uh yeah a one great thing
about working at UNICEF is that we work
in so many countries is that we have
this great network of people who speak
all these different languages and work
with sort of partners on the ground to
you know translate things yeah we're
possible at the moment it's in Spanish
in English because that's where the sort
of test laptops one out and this is sort
of the thing that went out on the test
laptops but we hope to have many more
languages as well maybe you want to
thank everybody for coming just to
reiterate I've sent around some sheets
here we would ask folks both engineering
and on engineering to sign up and our
goal is to build a very simple website
to start off with from the Google
perspective which has one button to
upload an audio file story one button to
play a story and a white box to search
for stories which we're reasonably good
at here there are many other things that
one could do over time in terms of
enabling downloads translations smaller
privacy security domain so you can only
share a particular story with a
particular family group and so on
extensions into video extensions into
many other areas but the objective by
sep tember is to simply have a site
where you can upload a story play a
story and find a story over time we'd
have a geocoding where you could put it
onto Google Earth and you could find
stories by country etc the olpc laptops
start shipping in quantity starting
probably
I'm sorry thank you all right so October
they are starting to ship in quantity
the the first goal i believe is roughly
5 million as a total set across the
three continents of Africa Asia and
Latin America and we would look to have
this site ready to go by then and to
have this little training module that
would go out to all the children to
understand how to do an interview with a
parent or grandparent so this is an idea
at its inception we thank you for being
here today and we look forward to
hopefully getting with all four partners
here five million stories online by 2010
I think you saw some of the power in
days presentation we hope we can bring
that to bear thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
