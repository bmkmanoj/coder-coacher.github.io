of the three founders along with Zach
hook and in Bray Pettis of makerbot
industries and they're attempting to
take 3d fabrication technology and put
it in the hands of the hobbyist so
without further ado Adam Maher one of
the three founders Thanks we've actually
been at maker for the past two days we
probably talked to a couple thousand
people over the course of the weekend so
I'm going to try to uh to speak
naturally without my voice giving out so
I mad mayor this is zack open right here
and bre pettis unfortunately can't be
here today but the three of us are the
juggernaut of 3d printing industry known
as MakerBot entries and the primary
thing we make right now is this
wonderful device maker bot you'll see
when on the table right there
illuminated with red LEDs and little
quite nice so MakerBot's are machines
for making things right now you'll see
this one here is equipped with a little
what we call a strewed or small device
for extruding a very plastics abs PLA
etc yeah right now it's configured as a
3d printer this is its primary use right
now but ideally the cupcake which is
actually with this particular model make
robots called can be used for any kind
of 3d positioning tasks we used to use
it we have a frost cruder brie actually
created a tool head that extra frosting
so it can decorate cupcakes which is how
God's name they're portable I'm not sure
if you guys have seen 3d printers that
other projects create but a they tend to
be huge they tend be very heavy and we
can fit this in a pelican case and move
it around we actually bought three out
here to san mateo the other day one of
them is currently en route back to New
York another one is somewhere in San
Francisco this one's here so let me kind
of explain what we're trying to do with
MakerBot right now as I pointed out the
current crop of devices except our
extremely heavy they're extremely
expensive if you're looking at the
dimension printers you're talking about
20 to 40 to 60 thousand dollars for a
machine and you're not going to have one
your home you're not going to get one
put in the garage and start printing out
things when you need things what we
would like to see is a future where
everyone can have one of these I mean
the future was supposed to be very
different we're supposed to have foreign
cars we're supposed to have space
colonies orbiting the moon we were
supposed to have jet packs we were
supposed to have replicators I could
give us anything we wanted whenever we
wanted it and so we got the last one is
basically that I'm saying or at least
we're working on it MakerBot is as they
point out before Zach bre pettis is
there a second to right that's me I
think this is either just before just
after an all-nighter and the gentleman
right there you'll see second from left
is Adrian Bauer he's the founder of the
reprap project has anyone here heard of
reprap a few okay reprap was a is a
similar project with the Express goal of
creating a 3d printer that anyone could
build that could actually create its own
part
this is a child project of the reprap
the reprap looks like this it's not
terribly transportable but it does work
this design is actually based on a
reprap zach has been working under the
aegis of the reprap foundation for
several years developing the circuit
boards and extruder design for this
project and the boards you'll see on
this machine you'll see they actually
say you know reprap motherboard reprap
controller these are actually boards
that we share with the reprap project
likewise the extruder can be used on
reprap machines and we can use reprap 20
heads as well the problem of our crap is
it's a little large it's long wieldy and
it's not exactly the sort of thing you
can you can put together yourself too
easily it takes a lot of tweaking so we
decided we'd try to make that a little
bit simpler these are our first two
prototypes from left to right the one on
the left is our actually first prototype
ever we should refer to that one is Eve
and the 12 right on the right is a it's
not exactly the production MakerBot you
see here but it is a slight later
version so as you can see you in sort of
flip the design if you go back to the
original rap rap you'll see it moves the
tool head on XY carriage and then raises
that platform in the bottom that's the
build platform that the object or
printing sits on and it raises and
lowers that object the problem of doing
that is that the tool head is usually
pretty heavy it's a few pounds and it's
also probably the most delicate part of
machine what you're doing that you're
shaking it around a lot moving it around
and you're producing object that usually
weighs a few ounces so one of the things
we did we serve inverted the design if
you look inside the MakerBot there
you'll see there's actually an XY table
that moves on the bottom and the tool
head is mounted on a Z platform that
goes up and down so the prototype on the
left I think we finished was it early
March late februari and Bri took it down
to South by Southwest to demo it and he
took it around he showed its pension
people when everyone loved it and they
were asking questions all time like you
know what's the bill Darian looks at he
says I don't know ten centimeters by 10
centimeters and we come back he comes
back and we measure it and it was a not
quite 10 centimeter square which is why
the makeup on the right is a significant
larger than the maker
left we need to expand the build area
that other changes that happen between
generations it's really difficult to see
in this picture but originally the wise
sage motor was actually mounted sideways
essentially on the ex stage and that
meant that the whole ex stage was
torqued slightly it was a little over
built so we moved the steppers around
and the design on the right is actually
pretty close to what we have now so it's
an open source design all our hardware's
open source all our software is open
source you can just go right now and we
have several resources will show you
towards the end we can actually go and
just download our designs and start
playing you don't necessarily need to
get a kit from us it's we recommend it
because getting all the parts together
is a tremendous pain but you can make
modifications to your heart's content if
you've got laser cutter you can cut a
lot of the parts yourself Mary's quintal
from metal lab has been in New York for
the past week and he did his own version
of the outer the outer casing here where
he put teeth in all the apertures
apparently to warn people away from
reaching and grabbing the object seat
printed or maybe it's a trap hit like
print out of precious figurines you know
precious moments figurine and have it
bite your arm off or something to try to
get it so the great thing about that is
people are going to do things with this
that we can't imagine people ask us why
would I need one of these and we can
think of a few stock answers also
actually show you who the stock answers
admit but the other side of that is that
the best answer we can come up with is
we don't know we're just trying to get
this into people's hands you could go
back in time to 1976 and tried to
explain to Steve Wozniak ax what 4chan
is but it wouldn't work he wouldn't know
what the heck you're talking about or
why what he was working on was going to
in some way me to that
we don't need for chat but it happened
anyway so we don't know what the
consequences of this there's gonna be a
lot of things that we don't need coming
out of this project where in fact we've
seen a lot of them already that's okay
that's probably an end that yes that's a
better analogy I more more recent
analogy although you could probably
explain that to him you know within an
afternoon about completely blowing his
mind so anyway like we say it is hacked
ball the box I this is mostly just a
crazy paint job but you can put whatever
tool head you wants up there and people
were i started doing things like trying
to mount milling heads on their mill
phone we haven't done that yet ourselves
because i don't think the XY can really
provide enough force for any serious
meling like knowing metal which some
people have asked if they can do but let
me show you some of the things that
people have been doing with this way
before there was a MakerBot Zach and
Brie set up a site called thing verse
and thing verse is basically a site
where people can share digital designs
so if you create you know yesterday at
maker faire brie whipped up a little
coin that we could print quickly and
give away at the show and so he uploaded
two things worse so other people could
build them and we actually have a fairly
large community of people know just
making things and making copies of
things and some of them are fantastic
like this is a philip has also been in
town for the past month created a script
for generating Lego bricks now we
primarily print an abs which is the same
thing Lego bricks serve are made of so
that enabled him to actually print out
Lego bricks and these you can actually
see them interoperating with official
legal brand bricks in this shot here and
he actually wrote this syrota
parametrized welding a plug into part of
illusion say one used a oh I at all it's
not terribly popular to be modeling
program
it is it is open source here's another
fun thing he generated with that this is
a actually i think zach has one in his
pocket here these are little screwball
boxes these would be very difficult to
actually mill or create through a
traditional manufacturing technique you
don't know where it is I thought you
were saving it but we can print one out
later it's okay but these are basically
two parts that screw into each other so
though it's a little jewelry box
essentially you can hide things inside
and they're fun for number reasons also
kind of showcases the precision of the
MakerBot itself these things can
actually print out the different halves
and trip machines and they'll fit
together nicely unless of course as we
did one day we had one of the steppers
reversed and so had the wrong try
reality that was kinda embarrassing but
the things I love most are the banal
things bringing zach were actually
giving a talk a few weeks ago where
exactly i think MIT and they forgot the
tweezers we use tweezers normally have
this longest Ruby put out a little test
doodle plastic to make sure it's running
before we actually print an object and
we have tweezers so we can reach in and
think pull out the lil extrusion and not
burn our fingers and well if you leave
the tweezers behind the best thing to do
is to print out new tweezers which is
what we did here zacks are actually made
this design as a derivative another
design that someone else had made
earlier and uploaded so because someone
uploaded their tweezers to thing worse
we couldn't download their tweezers make
the changes we needed print out the
tweezers and use the tweezers here's
another one someone is start making a
set of lens caps for their telescopes
because that's something you tend to
lose easily and you don't necessarily
wanna mail order one or wait to go to
the hardware store okay you print one
out and here's my personal favorite
right now is a bath plug someone
actually created the bath plug they
rendered it nao in blender Sketchup
whatever they printed it out and they
took a bath so we've contributed to
making you know cleaner nerds yeah which
is I think nothing no but I know what
they're open source project has done
that yet so we're moving
new ground here I have a friend of mine
have been asking for Utah teapot for a
very long time actually I keep meaning
to get to it one of the few limitations
we have right now is we don't have a
support material extruder so doing
overhangs is still a little difficult
because we have to use a support
material the same material or a pretty
good all right was that all right but
back to back to the slide show
so let me talk a bit more about own what
exactly this machine can do and what
it's capable of the build area is about
10 centimeters 2 aside on the x and y
axis it's actually slightly large drum
the z-axis so you can see actually one
of the nice things about it is the
extruder can actually rise out of the
top of the box there so you can move
that platform almost all the way up to
the top you can't close to 13
centimeters I think this this particular
model is 13 centimeters have a little
competition going on for the tallest
build that people have done yet with a
the baker-bots it's really easy to move
we have Pelican case for each of our
demo machines right now so we toss it in
here at the end of the day you got the
TSA no exit out so they don't destroy it
and as we discovered on the way here
they destroy one of them anyway and but
you can also see how much it weighs
there it's about 42 pounds in the case
it's about 20 pounds without but they're
fairly sturdy one of the disadvantages
that the reprap had as you saw it was a
mass of threaded rod corner brackets
nuts bolts delicate component sticking
out top when you lower the stage there
that thing's just a compact box and it's
not actually indestructible but it's
pretty easy to get around without a
blowing it up melting it down breaking
in half and yes and it looks great you
can fill it with LEDs and just have it
sitting there at night on your desk and
people walk by and say my god someone
really cool sits there and they'll be
right because because even if you're not
cool you can print out something that
will make you cool thing reverse there's
plenty of designs that will make you
cool this is our sort of warehouse space
in Brooklyn we share it with a couple of
other businesses right now but all these
are lovingly packed by hand and used to
be we pack them with care now we pack
them with care and a lot of shipping
tape because we've discovered that usps
is not in the most reliable service in
the world when it comes to respecting
fragile labels
on the side of your box we actually had
a lot of dusted bits showing up in the
first batch this is actually the what we
call the kid of kits this is what we
ship with a fur this we ship with our
first generation of MakerBot's you can
see here this is a this is an obsolete
picture because these bits here are what
we call it our pulley kit we used to
assemble pulleys out of several layers
of wood and those were to start
tensioning pulleys for keeping the belts
tight if you look at this machine you'll
notice on top to sort of strange things
semi-translucent plastic knobs those are
actually we printed those out of PLA
those are the new pulleys we actually
now print the pulleys that we ship with
the machine on the machine it turns out
it's faster it's easier they're less
parts to lose and the parts of the
police tend to break and the ABS that we
print about it now it doesn't let me
actually go through this real quick and
show you what two loops we're talking
about here this is a these are laser-cut
parts for the outer case these are build
platforms and these are also becoming
obsolete one of the tricks with
extruding abs is that ABS loves to stick
to itself and it hates to stick to
anything else so what we used to do is
ship with a bunch of these foam core
plates that would cut out and there's a
thin plastic layer on top of that from
court that the Habeas would stick to
quite reliably and then it would print
out the object on top of it you didn't
have to worry about the objects shifting
ground during a print or peeling itself
off the problem is that you can only
print out once or twice all of these
build bases before you have to flip it
over put it aside we've lately actually
discovered that if you enter acrylic
well enough it will stick even better to
that and you can reuse that we've reused
the ones we have here probably a good
hundred times easily
this is the electronics kit again it's a
it's a bag full of bags each of those
bags represents one of the boards on the
side of that thing right now as you'll
see we're going to show you how we put
those boards together or rather you put
those boards together in the future
those boards are got come preassembled
so that is going to be simplified as
well we've got our power supply a
standard ATX power supply the one we
shipped out here did not stand up to
well to do the the graces of the usps
but any ATX power supply will do we've
got our small bits bag this is the XY
stage laser-cut parts this bag here is
the plaster the plastic extruder you see
on top there a few cables this is what
we call the hardware burrito there are
hundreds and hundreds of bolts in this
thing and so we make a little kid of all
those and the the rods that support the
XY bearings and also the threaded rod
that lifts and lowers e we use T slots
to hold it all this together it turns
out if you originally we're going to
start making these out of acrylic
acrylic looks great it's pretty easy to
cut it's very reliable but the permit
acrylic is that it tends to as Zack but
it's a binary fatal if you tighten an
acrylic part time in phila Park too much
it's going to crack and you've got a
broken part and you're kind of screwed
would conforms what Ben's would it warps
and because of reason would we could use
these simple t slots to actually make a
really strong connection on the corners
those slots over there on either side of
the bowl keep the part in place to slide
the nuttin get the ball down tighten it
down it locks in pretty easily and those
are really easy to put together well
relatively easy to put together so most
of the bulk of this goes together pretty
quickly the boards are primarily surface
mount boards we ship in most kits and
people freak out when they see a hundred
surface no parts it turns out soldering
surfing up parts is extraordinarily easy
you put down solder paste you put pieces
on top of them and throw them on a hot
plate heat them up carefully don't burn
the board and you're pretty much okay
the trickiest part for us has been
these capacitors here because they tend
to conduct heat away from the board and
you need to keep the heat applied for a
longer period to get the solder nor
those two finally melt and pop we are
actually moving towards replacing these
surface mail caps the big ones withdrew
all caps just because they're easier to
get soldered but a everything else here
is actually pretty simple the biggest
the other big issue of course is shift
caps which people tend to get confused
with another and doesn't run oh the
trick for tongue to chip capacitors
apart if you've gotten mixed up you
throw them away yeah but yeah exactly
you toss them you toss it in you order
new ones from digikey and that's
basically your solution that works
unfortunately all too well for us we've
shipped make robots pretty much all over
Canada much of the u.s. Austria I think
unless you should be in here similar ok
it's an old nap this is before we ship
to Austria Spain France Australia we
have a few orders in Japan and these
things are really getting all over the
place we're starting to develop
community of people who are
corresponding about MakerBot's how to
work out kinks they've run into you know
what sort of designs they've come up
with what they've been using them for
and it's very handy for us because it
means a lot of issues before we even
even get to us they set up we also did
make abouts operators list in someone
else's oh I had that problem here's how
i fixed it so they're a really wonderful
community people so let's talk about the
materials we've been using them flash
shooter our primary material has been a
white ABS plastic like I say that's what
Legos are made out of if you step in our
Lego you know that it's strong it's hard
and it's pretty difficult to destroy
something you've been printing out of
ABS these are I guess these are Stanford
bunnies here again the overhangs mean
the years came edible fuzzier than they
usually do for most bunnies but you can
also see these are early prints
dodecahedron and another
parametrize box we've played with hdb
for a while it's a little woozy it
doesn't cool quite as quickly and so
it's been a little more difficult to
print with we haven't spent too much
time with it PLA is a lovely one Adrian
Bauer that picture you saw earlier if he
on that trip he came by with a big old
roll peeling he said you guys have got
to play with us it's great it you know
it melts easily it's tough it's
biodegradable and it smells like butter
when you heat it up which is true and
amazing it's much better smaller than
abs but yeah ple is great it's got a
slightly lower temperature melting point
than the Navy s and it is people like to
say it's biodegradable you actually need
to put an acidic environment and heat it
up a bit for it to really about a grade
but in theory it's it's little
friendlier to the environment it's also
completely biocompatible which is nice
they use this in for making scaffoldings
for growing cells on and we have black
ABS has all the properties of way vs but
it's a different color and we've just
got a bunch of this and it's super fun
because now when you print out a Darth
Vader had people actually recognized as
Darth Vader head rather than you know
some sort of strange robot thing ABS
they actually do manufacturer in a range
of colors but we get this directly from
a manufacturer and you need to order a
fair amount you know before they'll
start doing custom colors for you but we
hope to have read sometimes fairly soon
because it's important that we have I
think red purple and green other ones
we're looking for we're the ones i'm
looking for pink and we want pink
alright so let me walk into the process
of actually printing so I got on the
MakerBot here and that T actually wanted
like in parallel start start a print
maybe in a minute okay that's why we get
there all right
so you create a model on a 3d program
you choose you guys would probably use
Sketchup because you have a vested
interest um but uh I tend to use blender
because it's an open source program in
since all our hardware and software is
open source it really adds to our
argument we have in the tool chain and
open source 3d modeler you can use
anything that exports stl which is
basically anything nowadays art of
Illusion wilkes-barre stl SolidWorks
obviously blender Sketchup I can't
really think of any 3d programs that
don't it's pretty much the standard for
sehri law the fabric your files are
produced a standard for exporting 3d
objects to printers nowadays so we do
then is pass it through a python script
called subpoena forge what skin quarter
does is it takes that model and it
slices it into thin layers at our layer
height and comes up with the toolpath
essentially it's going to figure out
where exactly it's going to move the
bill base as it starts extruding plastic
and you can see these are when it's done
it actually gives you a nice preview
here and you can see the arrows tracing
out the path that the the tool head is
going to use the colors actually are
related to the speed is going to move
the tool head as it as it does the layer
so this is a full layer of the model you
just saw what this actually outputs is G
code people know g-code familiar with a
heard of it all right G code is a very
old it's hardly even a standard really
in to serve a de facto standard evolved
over years but to use for by almost all
CNC machines and essentially you'll see
an example of in a second it's not
terribly verbose but it does work but
essentially it's full of a set of
commands you can see him here g1 the
commands it essentially say move the
move the three axis controller to this
point now this point those went to this
point to actually do that interactively
from the machine would you know be a
little iffy so we actually have is a big
point puffer inside the firmware on the
motherboard over there and that buffer
gets loaded up and the machine then just
pulls out that buffer we keep the buffer
full and we don't run into any snags it
doesn't jump or stop when your host
computer has some trouble
so we don't actually parse the g-code
nowadays directly on this board what we
do instead as we pass it to a program
called replicator G replicator G
essentially reads in the g-code
interprets it and talks to the driver
that's actually on that ship over a
standard serial connection you'll see a
the cables we use that to to probe to
get the data to the machine those are
standard ftdi chips they're just
standard serial connections over a USB
live as salmon tier used to Arduino
environment tell a couple of people okay
that's the same cable used to program
arduino in fact the chip that's honor
motherboard is a it's actually sanguis
know which is that are doing a
derivative that zach developed primarily
a thing for this and sank we know was
essentially a slightly better chip I
think it's 644 and rememory more pins
but it's also a bit of a pain to
maintain the Arduino people now start
using even word vanship with more pins
and their song is the mega Arduino and
we're probably going to transition to
that at some point the the point is that
when you actually upgrade the firmware
and there you're doing it through the
Arduino environment and all the actual
firmware for the motherboard is written
in the ardewin environment so you can
just use that same cable tie put a new
firmware to your machine so replicator G
as a service smorgasbord of silly
features it's got a control panel that
will allow you to manually control
things test things out before we get
started we usually like to just you know
raise things up down on Z X axes make
sure everything's working especially
when you take it out of the box after
moving it and you can also a control the
temperature of the extruder here we like
to personally we usually do actually is
crank up the temperature abs we like to
extrude it usually about between 210 220
degrees Celsius soak up the temperature
wait for it to heat up and then start
the extruder make sure that noodle of
plastic is working out well
and then we're done you just hit the
build button and you can actually build
our own touch and then you have a watch
which you've always wanted that doesn't
actually tell time but you wanted in any
way for a long time because it makes you
cool so actually want to do built real
quick let's do build you don't want to
do build I do okay we're almost done
with this part though so we do sell the
whole kit basically everything you see
there to assemble that is 750 bucks and
if you have any kind of shop tools or
electronic tools you can usually put it
together by yourself but we saw dog skip
that also includes all the tools you
might need to put it together the hex
wrenches the solder paste yeah we have a
really cool LED lit visor with
magnifying lenses in it so you can
actually see what the heck you're doing
lots of plastic and we also have started
selling them fully assembled for
ridiculous what we see is ridiculous
price whether people currently don't
think is is that ridiculous that sort of
covers the effort involved and putting
one together so you can maybe do some
math and try to figure out how much time
is involved and whether it's worth your
time but we're at makerbot com and
there's another address that's not here
and that's that's the other one which we
were discussing earlier that's
thingiverse com makerbot com is our
store and links to our wiki which has
the full documentation for how to put
the thing together links to all you know
the files to actually bring the firmware
etc thingiverse is the companion site
that has all the objects that you're
going to print out that will make you
cool so and we have flyers up front to
have both those addresses on there and I
think now now I think we'd like to
actually do for it so we have some time
so Zack here is going to is going to
fire up a print for us what are we
printing
we do boss you don't have one okay so
Zach was saving one of those a twisted
screwball boxes taken to his grandma
when he visits her this week and I think
you lost it so we're gonna have to print
out another one so this is a case where
maybe about will be making it be
someone's grandma happy which again I
don't think most open source projects
and really done yet so it's right now
it's raising up the built the extruder
and what's going to do now is it's going
to wait a few seconds then heat up the
nozzle there's a little thermistor on
the tip of the nozzle that monitors the
temperature of the novel once it gets up
to about charm play degrees you'll start
the motor on the extruder which will
start basically turning a gear that
pinches the ABS forces it through that
nasal and once it does they'll do a
little five-second extrusion and a
little noodle of a plastic will appear
and this time remove the tweezers so we
don't have to print them out this is
always the tensest moment with
actually the real tensest moment is
gonna come in after we do the test
extrusion I'll talk about that in a
second oh yeah sure hub start asking
that's a really good question I'm sorry
the question was is there a difference
in the speed at which we can extrude
different materials and the answer i
have for you is that we haven't really
experimented too much primarily we've
been working with pla at very similar
parameters to what we've been extruding
abs with my initial metro be possibly
yes but yeah it is the flow rate of the
polymer that's been it okay so this is
actually the real tense moment here like
I say ABS really likes to stick to
itself rather than anything else and so
the first thing we do is we laid on a
raft of abs which is just a rectangle of
abs that we put directly down under bill
base as close to the actual base as we
can and so sometimes we have to adjust
the height a little bit to make sure we
got it at the correct thickness so that
it looks like this one's going really
well and after prints out this which is
these horizontal lines which will adhere
to the baseball so it print out some
very thin vertical line since we do that
by moving the the head very quickly
which will stretch out the extrusion and
give you a thinner line and the reason
we do that is because we want to be able
to remove the build base once you've
actually created your object and so by
creating those little thin stripes you
can from easily peel that build base off
so yeah like Zach says it's it's
dependent on the flow rate of the
material and we have not done that much
experimentation with it yet we've this
is also our loudest machine I have to
warn you
the the new ones we're starting to use a
new new stepper chips stepper driver
chips that do microstepping and those
are actually much quieter the primary
noise you're hearing right now is most
likely the rods rattling around because
these are also not the smoother rods but
the machines are actually getting
quieter as time goes on
if you want to just come up here in
lodge okay sorry question 3dcg platform
there I found something other than a
juror leave only their true done so far
as the frosting extruder which we've
used to decorate cupcakes which will get
you free drinks at bars at least but
yeah again we don't know what people are
going to do with this some people have
already theirs on thingiverse in fact I
can probably find it within the first
page or so but somebody just recently
started designing amount for a dremel
tool to sit on that platform and I don't
know if they've tested out yet but what
you're hearing right now that it's doing
straight-line motion because what's just
done is it's drawn the outline of the
bottom of that box and now it's doing
the infill layer it's actually filling
in the bottom of that box to form a
solid base it's well it's not really in
fill in holes what we do between solid
layers but it's doing its building the
base and after you work with these
things for enough you can actually sort
of recognize what they're printing by by
the sound so this is a this is one of
our more prolific in it contributors and
he's actually designed to base that you
can use they can bolt on to this base
there that will hold a dremel tool so
presumably he's going to try to start
mooing with that this and he gets went
up and running
we have about a tenth of Milner on the x
and y axes and the z-axis is probably
around better than that but the real
limitation on the z axis is the layer
height we usually use about 12
millimeters plastic per layer you could
try to get a thinner layer height you
can move the head faster and that
stretch out the extrusion you have a
thinner layer but your prints would also
start taking longer and longer so do
people want to watch this because it's
kind of cool to actually wash sorry good
so there is tweaking when you're
initially playing with this you need to
essentially set up click the parameters
until you get a good thing
this is we are looking at patterns some
people who were elevated train out of
calibration pattern density where
Atlanta all right but it breaks
experience we have to give you know
stuff right hand to take this week that
it's more parts first attack
ok this guy the toolchain they work in a
replicator do mostly lately I'm going to
start to get great support to the jerk
