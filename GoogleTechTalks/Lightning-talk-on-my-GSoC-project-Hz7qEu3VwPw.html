name is Leslie Hawthorne and I work for
Google's open source program office on
the Summer of Code program among many
other fabulous geeky activities and I am
pleased to present this afternoon mr.
Rock slender who was a google Summer of
Code student for 2006 working with the
Drupal project on a unit test automation
so without further ado here's rock to
give us a lightning talk on his a
particular project if you have any
confidential Google related questions
please hold them till the end until
after the camera is shut off and i
believe that rock will also be taking
questions at the end of his presentation
yeah excellent all right let's get
started cool thanks yeah my name is rock
clinger my project was unit test
automation for drupal so let's first see
what is Drupal Drupal is an open source
content management system built around
PHP and sort of it one of the databases
in core we have support for mysql and
postgresql but there are some
contributed other databases that we can
work with so Drupal is gaining employed
in last year's NASA and some of the MTV
sites use Drupal so it's coming along
nicely drupal consists of chord rupal
which is the basic functionality like
user access content publishing menu
system stuff like that and then the
biggest part of Drupal is contributed
modules which can do basically
everything if there is a question what
can you do with Drupal there's probably
six answers so six modules can do the
stuff you want to do so this means that
the code rupar you install chord rupal
and then around it you install
additional models and it does what you
want to do so how is the Drupal evolving
everything is built around issue queue
so if you want a new feature if you find
a bug you post an issue and
some of the more how do you say that
more geeky people from Drupal we come in
and write a patch and then the future
will be implemented in Drupal so why do
we need my project as I said there is
cord rupal and the patches everything
that is done in quadruple goes through
this patch system so if somebody posts a
patch do you know what patches just
checking cool it means that some of the
core people that started rupal project
must first look at a patch and prove it
so that means they have to check if it
even applies check if there is some
syntax errors in it and check if the
code is written is good enough to
implement it in core so that's why my
project come in with automatic testing
of patch it tests if patch applies and
if patch passes simple test tests so
this basically means that the people
that look at these patches don't need to
manually go through this process which
is quite tedious and long lasting and
they probably have better things to do
than this so this basically means that
they save a lot of time and work on
other features that are more important
for Drupal how does my module works
developers to meet the patch on any
feature or bug my module then installs
the new Drupal site automatically
applies a patch and run tests so and
then of course the results are processed
and the developer finds out if his patch
is good enough or if it is if it is even
ok syntax wise
of course if it even applies so right
now i'll show you a quick demo of this
okay so this is a this is a first page
if you look at on the right side there
is a test your page block so here you
can choose for which project of Drupal
your page is for like Drupal core or
some contributed models let's say core
which version of Drupal a 2.5 and then
you smitten we are URL to your patch and
click test and then everything is done
in background like like I said before
new Drupal site is stole the patch is
applied and tests are run and then you
get your results like something like
this status failed and then the failure
message is some are not finished yet but
you get a picture
okay so this basically means that if the
page doesn't even apply you will see it
instantaneously it will say page did not
apply right another patch and core
contributors don't need to look at your
patch and waste their time right
so as I said benefits every badge that
goes into Drupal core and that is
accepted must is partly tested with this
simple test unit tests and all tests are
run every time on each patch it's also
important because usually you don't have
time to run all the tests on the patch
so this way automatically it gets
everything is tested and you sort of
have some assurance that your patch is
good this is also important they're
usually there is some waiting time
before you submit a patch and some of
the core guys have time to take a look
at it and say your patch is missing
something or you have a syntax error
somewhere this way you can get a
response very quickly and you can can
fix your patch and reapply it and as I
said core maintainer don't lose their
time with simple checks okay so what
does the future holds for this unit test
automation we of course we need to
expand the number of tests because right
now there is just small number of test
that tests only the core part of Drupal
made only the most important features
this is unfortunately not done yet to
use the automatic testing in Drupal
development in everyday use we had some
problems with well a lot of problems
with integrating with issue queue of
Drupal and stuff like that and
this is this is one of the most
important features that we have in the
future to use virtualization for testing
that would mean that you could test your
patch on let's say MySQL five and four
and three and it all together be
processed and returned to you
instantaneously so you wouldn't have to
build your own environments for testing
it will be already built somewhere on
some server and it will be tested then
okay so thank you for your time this is
if you have any questions I'll be very
glad to answer any of them yes please
slice it
okay so let me ask you how do I know if
pets even applies well this is done in
with console commands like patch and if
that returns an error that means the
page doesn't apply cool I'm about
through two months of data
yes and a very small matter because I
didn't have time because of school yeah
I do I have to work on this
virtualization partner
that's right we don't ask questions
shameless Google+ war yes very good so
shameless Google plug is that as I said
at the beginning rock is one of our
google Summer of Code students and we
are going to be taking student
applications for the program for 2007
starting tomorrow March 14th and that
should be running through March 24th so
you two can do something as ultra cool
as saving developers of the Drupal
project which is a really cool open
source project that's used by a lot of
nonprofit organizations and folks who
probably can't afford to get large-scale
software systems installed to make their
websites do the things that they need to
do and you could be contributing to
making that happen so please please do
sign up for summer of code it's
code.google.com / SOC like summer of
code we would love to see your
application thanks for coming everybody</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
