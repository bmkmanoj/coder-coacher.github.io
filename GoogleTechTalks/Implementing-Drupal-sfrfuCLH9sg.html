programs office here at Google I am
pleased today to have Angie Byron I
Summer of Code alum and developer with
lullaby and Jeff butter filled with
glyph the George Lucas Educational
Foundation here today to talk about
Drupal development and implementation
please welcome Angie and Jeff hi um so
as cat mentioned my name is Angie Byron
I guess I look at here come on and I'm
with Drupal project um I got my start in
Drupal two years ago actually as a
summer of code student funnily enough I
I I did summer of code in 2005 as a
student and then kind of went on to
become completely obsessed with
everything to do with Drupal so now i'm
on the documentation team the security
team I'm on the board of directors for
the drupal association I I code core
patches and I test people's patches and
I do can modules and themes and so I'm
kind of basically if there's a way to be
involved in Drupal I'm involved in
Drupal in some way so um but i'd like to
thank google very much for that
opportunity because without them I
definitely would not be here today so
and now I work for a company called la
la botte and we make sort of
high-profile Drupal websites for for
large corporations and things like that
so so let's start with the obvious
question what is Drupal has anybody in
here ever heard of Drupal before
everybody awesome okay so some of this
will be old news to you but for the
benefit the people who have not use
Drupal before it's three things one it's
a content management system um and what
that means is basically is like a
website in a box where anybody who needs
a website built can use this tool in
order to edit web pages without any HTML
knowledge and stuff like that the court
of Drupal which is the thing you
download when you download rupal itself
has a whole bunch of features in it
search engine friendly urls are kind of
important to the Google folks and stuff
taxonomy is a big feature that we have
that a lot of other CMS's don't have and
that gets us a lot of people to pay
attention to it multi-site installations
are kind of cool that basically allows
you to run several Drupal sites off the
same code base which is nice for
maintenance and that sort of thing if
those features aren't enough for you
there's also over 1200 contributed
modules that you can use and those will
add functionality from event calendars
to image galleries to Talk Like a Pirate
Day filters and things like that so it's
pretty cool the second thing Drupal is a
content management framework and what
this means is it an it's an API for
managing content users sessions you know
forms and everything and essentially the
content management system part of Drupal
is sort of a proof of concept of what
the framework can do so in a way it's
sort of like something like rails or
Django but it comes with a CMS built on
top of it in a way these are some of the
features of the API part of Drupal
jQuery is is one of the big features
that's a really robust lightweight
JavaScript library then there's things
like installation profiles that allow
you to bundle up a Drupal site that's
configured just the way you want it and
then deploy it on multiple different
sites with all your changes and things
like that and then the third thing
Drupal is is this community we have a
pretty large community this is a picture
taken at our last Jew pecan which was in
Barcelona about two weeks ago and every
release our community seems to double in
size this has been kind of an ongoing
trend since the beginning so six point o
will be out sometime in the next well
it'll be out when it's done but it'll be
sometime probably towards the end of the
year or early next year so you're some
sadistic tsubota community we have over
800 840 code contributors so that's
people contributing patches to Drupal
core also people with CBS accounts that
have contributed modules and themes and
things like that there's over 160 local
user groups spread throughout the the
world we had over 430 attendees at our
last drupalcon which is answer
seeing this number because our first
Rubicon that we held in in September of
2005 had 20 people so we we've kind of
been going up and up as things go on so
we have over 200,000 users on drupal.org
um there's over three million lines of
code between core and the contributions
repository core itself is really
lightweight and small it's around 40k
and we had 52 Summer of Code mentors for
the 20 students that we were allocated
and thank you for that very much oh and
there's about a hundred thousand
downloads per month of Drupal at this
point that number seems to keep going up
as well so who is using Drupal out there
probably some people that you've heard
of open source projects use it like
Ubuntu Linux also the Eclipse project
OSI they use Drupal as well for their
their websites then there's Greenpeace
other activist organizations anisty
international uses it a lot of political
campaigns in the u.s. use it Hillary
Clinton supporters have a kind of a
community based website that they're
using as a grassroots platform to launch
her campaign The Onion uses it hey other
humorous sites i'll use it like
including ask a ninja calm and and
things like that music companies
starting to take note this is Sony Music
Box Warner Brothers also uses Drupal for
their homepage website and a bunch of
individual artist sites are using it
sony has a Drupal multi-site platform
which all of their new artists and and
existing artists that need to websites
are on so like Ozzy Osbourne Tori Amos
uh you know Daughtry the second
runner-up to American Idol or whatever
but all all of their their main artists
are starting to go to this platform
because it it makes it much easier for
them to maintain the codebase twit this
week in tech and other podcasting sites
use use Drupal as their framework 43
folders this is Marilyn man he's a big
personal productivity guy also Tim
berners-lee's another person using
Drupal for blogging
a lifetime television other television
networks include CDC MTV Fox Adobe Sun
and IBM are all big tech companies that
have taken an interest in Drupal this is
the Flex showcase site where Flex is
sort of a it's sort of like a
programmatic flash kind of thing that
you can do over the web I don't know a
lot about it but looks cool but they
chose Drupal to to do their showcase
site because they really like the the
features and the community stuff that it
added oh yeah and these guys use it too
moving right along so why does everybody
use it well the first thing is is free
software it's free both as in freedom
and free as in beer so that's always
good so for you know in practical terms
that means there's no vendor lock-in and
it means that there's no upfront costs
so that makes an attractive options to
like nonprofits and things like that it
has a lot of features we kind of talked
about that already it gives you a lot of
control you can customize the
functionality and Drupal to your precise
needs you can customize the look and
feel of it to whatever your designers
have come up with and basically you
unlike other CMS's you can turn off the
stuff you don't want and only turn on
the stuff you do so you're not stuck
with this big glomp stuff which is nice
um it's extensible Drupal uses what's
called a hook system to allow you to
inject at any point and alter the way
that Drupal works so there's over 50 of
these hooks that you can cut in and you
can either write your own custom modules
that that say for example change the way
the user login process works or you know
you can just add additional information
to contents and things like that
maturity drupal's been around for seven
years over seven years even though the
release number wise it's Drupal five
there's actually been 12 releases of
Drupal we did point releases for a
little while and and things like that so
there's there's been a lot of thought
behind the code base security is another
big reason we have a dedicated security
team that handles not only the Drupal
core itself but also handles contributed
modules which is something I don't think
any other project has
and something that's really big that the
security team focuses on is education of
developers so we do a lot of work like
writing up documentation and writing
scripts that will automatically scan
your code for SQL injections and things
like that and here's what IBM had to say
they compared Drupal with these four
other or five sorry five other CMS's
including Mambo and typo3 and then came
up with Drupal as the the one on top and
using control extensibility scalability
theme ability and our code is very
standards compliant excuse me so how
does Drupal work since everybody in here
is use Drupal I guess is going to be old
news but I'll just go through it quickly
from an architecture standpoint you've
got your Drupal core down here and
basically that gets you your your your
the basic functional that you need in
order to run the site so it gives you
like user management it gives you the
ability to localize stuff and it gives
you the api's that you need in order to
build modules and then modules will
extend the functionality that the base
Drupal gives you so add new features it
will modify the way Drupal works and you
can either download you can turn on
modules that come with core so for
example the user profiles and forums
modules come with core you can download
extra ones so if you want an event
calendar you can download the event
module and you can also put your own
custom modules using the API let's talk
a little bit about the hook system
because this is pretty much where the
power of Drupal is basically a hook is a
place where drupal asks you know hey i'm
about to do something here when anybody
else like to cut in and modify this so
for example if I'm displaying a list of
permissions in the admin panel I might
do something like say module info call
perm which means go any modules that
implement a hook perm I'm going to call
you and then generate a list of
permissions so for example we might have
blog module and contact module that
implement a blog underscore perm and a
contact underscore perm and then they
return an array of the the permissions
that they define and this is all based
on naming conventions which makes it
really easy for new developers to pick
up and basically what happens is that
array gets passed into the permissions
and then it generates his list
that way so it's really easy for modules
to define their own permissions and then
have fine-grained control over over who
can access what the node system so note
is a funny word that's how we call
content we could call it notes just cuz
I don't know because we like confusing
people um so we start with a node
basically somebody at some point was
smart and said you know forum topics
blog entries polls announcements they
all have kind of the same properties
veteran 82 all of them they all have a
title most of them have a body they all
have who created it and when things like
that so let's take that and shove that
into a node and then let's uh allow for
creating individual like sort of
instances of nodes so for example you
can have an article which in addition to
having a title of body and author and so
on defines a a copyright field so you
need to define where where this articles
from and who owns a copyright and a pole
for example will define choices and
results and stuff like that and then in
addition to that through the hook system
upload module for example could add file
attachments to articles and comment
muzzle can can make it so you can
comment on either of articles or poles I
just want to quickly run through some of
the killer modules in Drupal killer
modules these are some of the modules
that we end up using on a lot of sites
that that are really powerful and we're
pretty excited about so the first one is
cck so this basically allows you to add
fields to node types so here's an
example of an album so you see oh I'm
going to use this we've got a we've got
an artist which is a node reference so
in other words you're referring to
another node in the system so we have
artist nodes and we're referring over to
those we have a album cover which is an
image we have a album release date which
is a date number of dis is an integer
and things like that and cck will take
care of doing all the database
manipulation in order to add the fields
where they need to be it's also smart
enough that if you share a field among
different content types it will
automatically normalize the schema for
you and put those fields in a separate
table and do joining and and things like
that it's it's real
cool an addition to that once you add a
field here um that will also show up in
the in the admin interface when you go
to create a piece of content you'll see
that it's a it's added the artist
selection here and here's some taxonomy
stuff and things like that views is
another really powerful module the way I
explain views people is basically like
anytime you need to create lists of
stuff you know um basically what it is
is it's a query builder with a GUI um
and the the GUI kind of looks like an
airplane cockpit sometimes but tongue
but it's really powerful wanted to new
and essentially what you do is is you
you can select what feels out of the
content to show how you want to filter
it and how you want to sort it so for
example here's a view showing a bunch of
music videos so they've just taken the
thumbnail view of a picture along with
the title so that's pretty
straightforward you can also have
something like this which is an
alphabetic pager of artists by you know
they're the name of their artist starts
with and then finally you can get kind
of more complex and you can say okay I
want the top rated things and I want to
dynamically pass in what node type so
what content type those should be so for
example we've got what's the top rated
album was a top rated video and what's
the top rated song for this artist and
Jeff will be going into more detail
about cck views in a little bit panels
is pretty cool panels is is is sort of a
web layout framework so it's it's
basically geared towards end users who
don't know HTML and PHP but want control
over where their side bars are and
things like that panels gives you an
interface like this where you have rows
and columns laid out and you can control
like how many rows across it is and how
many columns and they can be merged and
all that sort of thing and then they can
add any kind of block menu view a piece
of content anything like that so they
can with a click of a couple buttons
change the featured home page story to
something else without having to bother
you to go in and start editing things as
the does the web person
so that's really nice organic groups is
another kind of cool module this
basically allows you to have private or
public sub sites so for example this is
the Summer of Code group on our group's
drupal org and we we have it set up so
that um this group in particular is
public but we also have a mentor group
which is private so anytime that you
post in this group you have the ability
to mark something as public or private
and the way that gets controlled is
whoever's on the subscriber list and the
subscriber list looks like this the
manager of the group can appoint Co
administrators and then those
administrators have full control over
the content within that group without
giving them control over the rest of the
site so they almost get like their own
private area to to brainstorm about
things and stuff like that actions in
workflow uh this is kind of a powerful
combination but it's kind of confusing
but I'll go through it and you know
hopefully it makes a little bit of sense
but basically gives you fine grained
control over the publishing workflow of
nodes so you start by defining a
workflow for example this is the
editorial workflow which has steps like
you know adding media and editorial
review and published to employees only
and things like that then they have an
interface where you can define for each
step who can move it from this step to
another step for example any author of
the of the content or any basically
anybody can move it from I just created
it to editorial review but only an
editor can move something from a later
stage back to editorial review so
example you you messed up your typing
I'm kicking it back to you you have to
you have to figure it out and things
like that and then in addition to that
actions lets you say when I move a node
from creation to editorial review what
happens and you can assign these
discrete pieces of functionality to fire
when a workflow transition happens so
for example this is going to alert the
editors that the fact-checking is
complete so that means that you know
they gone through the effort of going
through all the things they're kicking
it out to them for review so this might
send an email to
the editorial team and you can say
remove a note from all groups because
you don't want it public facing until
the editors gets chance to to look at it
and things like that so it's really
really powerful so that's all the stuff
duple can do right now what does the
future hold well Drupal 6 which we
mention a little bit earlier just went
into beta 1 like two weeks ago or so so
we're working really hard to get that
out some of the killer features in that
our internationalization drupal's head
like the interface translatable since
way before my time so a long time but
content to translate content on the site
you always had to install a separate
module so we built that into the core
now so that you can have both a like an
English and a French version of the same
article if you're in Canada for example
open ID is in core open ID is a
distributed identity sort of thing where
you can basically instead of creating a
logging at 500 different places you can
authenticate to your one trusted server
which will handle managing your
identities and things like that Drupal
was one of three projects to integrate
open ID into its core first so at OSCON
this year we received a five thousand
dollar bounty for that from the open ID
folks and that was pretty cool update
status module is in core what this
module does is it informs you when your
modules or themes or core itself is out
of date and it will tell you whether
it's just a updated version or whether
it's an actual security release so
that's really important for protecting
our users against you know any kind of
problems and actions module got into
core so this means that modules can
define their own set of the street
actions and then those can be fed into
something like say the workflow module
or the trigger module which is new and
six and that essentially allows you to
assign actions to hooks so whenever a
user log or whenever user registers you
can send an email to the admin or if
somebody publishes a content with viagra
in it you can delete the comment and
then ban the user automatically duple 7
so the
our next release and after Barcelona
everybody was like oh you know we gotta
figure this awesome so some of the stuff
were excited about Drupal 7 is PHP 5
we're dropping support all together for
PHP for actually anything before five
point two point three which probably you
guys don't use much PHP because your
google and use python and stuff but um
page before is bad and and PHP 5.2 is
pretty nice it's it's it's starting to
look like an actual real language it's
got object orientation exceptions things
like that which people usually get
shocked when they find out that people
are programming on things without you
know those type is input you know it
works so one of the things that we can
do with PHP 5 is is web services they
got really nice XML handling and php5 so
we basically want to make it eventually
so that any Drupal site can essentially
act as sort of like a facebook type of
application where it exposes an API so
that visitors to the site can program
you know functionality to be included
and things like that which is really
important because that's clearly the way
the web is headings involving your users
in your in the direction of your site
asset handling this is a mock-up that
one of our members has done about how to
handle dynamic image manipulation right
and core so things like resizing
cropping and including things inside the
editor and things like that and one of
the things we're also plan to do in
Drupal 7 is work a little bit on the
usability because we have a few of those
kind of people that we want to try and
turn around so for more information
here's a list of links the Drupal
handbook is basically our documentation
has a bunch of information in it the API
drupal.org site is our developer
documentation so you can read up there
on how the api's are laid out and things
Drupal book com is the website for the
pro Drupal development book which is on
a press it is a book that it's it's
really good for explaining Drupal
concepts to people who know development
but don't know Drupal the IBM
developerworks series basically IBM
wrote a nine-part tutorial on Drupal and
how it works and how they integrate it
and things like that which is really
really cool
and then finally there's a trees I'm not
compress is there and juries be our
project lead um he he has a he is a blog
and he takes all of the high-profile
sites with this tag so if you go there
you can see other sites that were out
there so let's see it in action and with
that I will turn it over to mr. Jeff
Butterfield thank you very much I think
once it give me just a second while I
get my actually don't mind excuse me
just so a guy walks into a bar nah Oh
knock knock control freak okay now you
say control freak who I liked it it is
such a great dog you know it just works
well as long as I'm doing this I'll show
you the share with you the knock knock
okay knock knock interrupting cow Moo I
have a 5 a 3 year old sorry alright so
my mice part of this I think this one's
active thanks Kenji my part of this is
sort of subtitled this old website
because what I'm going to show you is
the edgy topia website which is the
official website of the George Lucas
Educational Foundation quickly just to
share who we are our basic mission
mission is to share innovative
educational resources with anybody who
has an interest in education and to that
end owner my flash isn't working to that
end cherry letting that go flash mmm
normally this would be fantastically
beautiful oh let me try firefox area
so this is part of we have two
publications we have a magazine which
has sort of lighter content and the idea
is that we drive people to our website
which has a more robust deeper
information excuse me just a second
here we go and so it she talked about a
few things i'm going to share with you
let me just login actually i think i
even haven't logged in let me just share
sort of how our site is built um Angie
mentioned a few things modules being one
of them and let me just show you a
little bit of background we serve about
150,000 unique people per month we
primarily are known for our articles in
our video and media online to put this
site together this site was already a
site in motion and about a year ago I
realized that I was going to have to add
functionality that I didn't have the
capacity to added by myself we really
have one sort of core developer me and a
few other people that helped put in the
articles and maintain for the
intermediate HTML a little bit of PHP
but as far as serious development goes
it was me so I needed something that had
the tools I needed I could kind of get
off the ground right away so the site
looked with the exception of the control
panels here the site looks very much
like you see it today with a few
exceptions the first killer module I
want to share with you is Angie referred
to it earlier the cck which is short for
the content creation kit and what this
really did for me let me go back i'm
going to show you the content types that
i have on the website and you can see
it's a great big list of things like the
articles which looking right past other
we are edgy topia articles which is down
here we have a new set of resources
rolling out this week called the most
part of our green package so there's a
green content type just household stuff
job postings we have a job posting site
the ability and of course actually edge
autopia media which is probably one of
our more critical pieces and the keyword
overview
being able to create all these different
content types really gives us a lot of
flexibility when it comes time to make
each page have have the information that
it needs let me go to for example this
is a media page and actually let me stop
this before this ruins any further it's
pretty straightforward it has a little
rate this media and it has a link to a
taxonomy feature which I'll talk about
in a little bit but you know very
straightforward because it's a content
type I was able to just use comments
it's just built right in we do have a
lot of folks that this particular
article doesn't have any right now but
most of our video pieces have at least a
half a dozen comments let me go to back
to an article find one here so here's an
article now because this is a content
type and Angie can do you have the laser
border that's okay because well here
also I'll stand here in this because
this is a specific content type i was
able to create a template that said all
right every time we serve up an article
i wanted to do a couple of things thank
you I want the breadcrumb because our
bread crumb was sort of pre-existing i
went to bread crumb to behave in a
certain way in this case i wanted to put
the keyword or excuse me the the topic
to which it's connected as part of the
breadcrumb i wanted that to be reflected
in the left-hand navigation I wanted it
to be able to pull in this related links
box when appropriate because this is an
article type I was it was very easy for
me to say okay whenever there's an
article type do this without having to
impact on a lot of different other
article types
Angie also mentioned views which i
showed you already the the media node
type by using vuze i can pull these node
types together and present them in these
kind in this list made it very easy to
do this other places i do this i
mentioned that this is a magazine as
well all of our articles are key worded
in such a way that if i click on
magazine the view can go in you're not
seeing it up in the URL but the key word
is being passed to this page and so it
says Oh find me all the articles that
are in issue 2007 and lay them out
accordingly and so that's what you see
here so the combinations of content
types and views makes it very easy to
put these kinds of I was going to say
rapid prototyping but there's nothing
prototypical about this I put this
together step by step took a step back
and my staff went yeah that's what we
wanted great we're done so I mentioned
cck i mentioned views the third sort of
killer module out of this project i'm
trying to figure the best place to do
this was the taxonomy module we had
built up the organization originally was
standard around 12 or excuse me 11 well
it was 12 now we're down to eleven I
think it's even lower now sort of 11 Big
Ideas assessment community partnerships
digital divide these are all topics that
are important in the areas of Education
so we wanted all of our material to fall
somewhere into these categories the
taxonomy module was the first thing I
looked at that said oh this is the only
this is the only software I found at
this point that lets me do this really
easily so as you see I pulled up the
community partnerships sort of overview
right now this is still static in the
future this will probably be a view of
some kind as well I'll just say you know
show me what's new and community and
have it
have it generate this page when you go
to an article then you can see that the
topics are also over here on the side so
this particular article is a member of
project-based learning technology
integration community partnerships
assessment etc let's see it was going to
show you let's see let me just show you
so this is the entry screen for the
article we were just looking at exerted
title at the top very obvious author
this was very simple this was another
node type you may have noticed earlier
in the presentation there was a look one
that i was showing a list of content
types author was a type it was very easy
for me to create that record and then
link to it using the node reference
function and let me just think of
somebody else's name here oh there's
more than one dian so i can reference my
authors quite easily this way um my deck
but down here you start seeing where the
taxonomy comes in this first one is
actually not being used yet this is we
have some teacher materials that these
are just in the process of getting
hooked up but you can see down here
here's my project based learning my
primary topic taxonomy term here's my
magazine taxonomy term which remember
helps me with that view helps me pull
that information in secondary topics
which gets used in that little local nav
area I was talking about table of
contents all these different taxonomy
functions give me a lot of flexibility
to sort of mix and match content as I
need to and then again you'll see the
node reference as we talked about some
extra search terms one of the nice
things about Drupal is because it's so
extensible I was able to add a field
where I wanted terms to get pulled up by
the search engine that weren't
necessarily in the article and that
literally took me I think two lines of
code to just say when your search when
you're building the search index also
look at this other field so those are my
sort of big three let me go back to
administration and go back over some of
those other modules again because
modules is really there's a there's a
joke among one of Angie's group that if
you wait long enough somebody in the
community will build it for you and I'm
happy to say for me that's been true as
you can see cck is there there are
optional things in core path let me just
grow them just kind of looking for the
the big items here's a whole section of
modules that I've written some of these
are modules some of these are really
just collections of code that I wanted
to put this in one place so because it
made sense logically you can quote sort
of see what what they are on the side
here when I'm looking here we go so down
here below other these are community
modules that i downloaded and dropped in
and saved me a ton of work probably our
favorite one of these days is path
redirect and path auto alias which i
actually don't have installed right now
which made a nice search engine friendly
URL for every article that got created
and does it automatically that was much
appreciated by our editorial staff of
course things like paging if I have an
article a lot of our articles tend to be
overly long so if we want to break them
up into multiple pages we can do that
very simply without having to create
more than one node you know each article
should be a node by itself and of course
the views module web forum is also very
nice just makes very simple to create
contact forms we're using it let's see
I'm not sure this is online yet but
let's take a look we're using it to
collect data about our we have a new
resource that's launching this week as
part of our magazine called the go green
database and you can see again this is a
view the go green records
we're simply a content creation kit type
that I created I pull this view up was
able to pull all the pieces together
that I needed views is very nice in that
it makes it very simple to create search
filters theming them is more of a
challenge but excuse me certainly
possible add your resource here at the
top is just a form created at the web
content creation kit and this took me I
you know maybe half an hour to do I mean
once we had what we needed to put it in
there it just made building a forum
really easy the nice thing about it is
it also then protects me from SQL
injection you know all the bad things
that can potentially happen happen with
forms I've got the security team you
know helping me out on the back end
there so I don't have to worry about it
so much actually let me just show that
to you since long as we're here you can
get a sense for what that looks like so
again this is the webform module and you
can see I was just able to create a type
down here there's a whole list of I can
add a CAPTCHA or date email go down the
list type it in tell it what I wanted to
do and I'm done some other it's
some other modules that are worth
looking at let's see at sure well yeah
let me show you views that's another one
that as Angie says can look a little
scary up and on first go but it's really
not just find it here so for example I
think I showed you the media page and
let me just find or actually let me show
you go green since we just built that
i'll go ahead and edit that and this is
the basic overview so at the top I just
give it a name that's unique within the
system a little description I want this
to be a page i'm gonna offer it to the
world so i could just type in my URL
there and voila it works I want it to be
a table view I can show also full
records i can show little teasers i can
show a list or i can generate an RSS
feed something that's nice to know that
if you have the wherewithal to do it you
can take any of these views and really
pull them apart and reput them back
together any way you wish which is what
I've done actually quite a bit with that
Go Green view I wanted to use the pager
so if I have more than five records on a
page and let's say next page and you
know back and forward it handles all the
navigation I can say how many nodes I
want to show on the page that screen I
had at the top with the artwork and the
submit your information here that just
lives in the header here so that was
very easy to just generate just simple
HTML I can also add a footer and if I
needed to and then below that so here
are all the fields that are part of that
view and it was very easy for me just to
come in and say okay I'm going to look
at all the different nodes or fields i
should say that are possible and i can
find one mmm see if i can find something
that's some
appropriate all right well this one's
not that I could say credits and I add
the field and voila it's now part of my
view below that I have arguments if I
needed back on what I did the magazine
index page and I mentioned that you
didn't actually see it in the URL but
there was a key word being passed which
was the issue of the magazine September
07 was the this month's issue so I can
pass the argument in to the view quite
simply and the view is smart enough to
go oh okay he's asking for 07 and I can
then use filters to supplement the
excuse me actually I'm getting sort of
ahead of myself here arguments will then
feed that value into the view code and
then it'll pull up and try remember
where I have that variable somewhere in
here is that variable excuse me I'm
going to erase this field just before I
forget filters so at the top that big
green box where I said sort this these
records by any number of criteria all
those filters are easily generated here
you can see they're pretty
straightforward I only want things that
are published here are my node types
again I have a big list but I only want
things that are in the green database
and for searching i wanted i want to
make sure that it gets everything
although it looks like we've left out
alabama here so apparently there's
nothing green in alabama we'll have to
fix that and you can see that these are
all my various parameters I don't want
to show that to the whole world I only
want certain fields to be searchable so
I have my exposed filters and these were
the ones that were again in that in that
green box at the top and right now i
don't think i have any sort weight on
here but I think on the media page i
think i have them sorted by date so you
know whatever was the newest
make sure we get that up at the top so
again you know this is something that
prior to this views module took me I
don't know you know a couple of days to
get this kind of functionality um into a
particular node type now with views you
know it's half a day and i'm done i
spend more time worrying about the
theming that i do anything else so so
getting out here let's get back to chico
green
and so there we go there's our exposed
filters up the top here the field that
we asked it to deliver if I have left
that Josh what was that field what was
it field i just put in there a cost or
credits or whatever it was it would be
in this list so you know going forward
when the editorial team comes back to me
and they say oh you know we left out hat
size you know it's very easy for me to
just come in add the field add it to the
view and I've done so that's we're about
ten minutes left that's really just kind
of a cursory look at some of the things
that are on you know my particular site
I'm happy to answer any questions if
anybody has questions specific about
this site or about gerbil in general
we're here we're here to spread the
spread the word anybody questions a but
we were that Bueller yes
let me uh I was telling Angie this story
yesterday in that you know I had we
essentially well there's a joke that
goes around that says you know most
content management system builders build
their own system first and then after a
couple years of doing that they realize
you know this there's this is just not
the way to go I did that and so was
about two years ago I realized there was
a whole feature set that I couldn't
support myself so I started going
through the list and i downloaded mambo
which is now joomla i downloaded blown a
downloaded half a dozen others mambo and
plone were really the only two serious
contenders mambo didn't really have any
taxonomy support so you know that kind
of ruled it out right away blown did
have some taxonomy support um but I to
be honest you know whatever it is that
makes programmers look at something and
say this is the environment I want to be
in plone didn't have that for me and
it's just a personal choice drupal was
on my desktop I was literally I
downloaded it I was literally dragging
it to the trash and thought you know I
downloaded I should probably look at it
and installed it and the taxonomy
support for me was the thing that came
just you know right to the forefront
since that time being able to take
advantage of a lot of these other
features has made that decision a good
one um one thing that I can say these
days is the documentation that's
available today is much better than it
was a year and a half two years ago when
i started doing this Angie mentioned a
book by a press pro developer
development and he was a name of title
Matt westgate and I forget who the other
authors but a lot of the stuff that I
struggled with was there in this book
usually you know concisely written in
if I had it two years ago I've been done
much much sooner uh that's sort of my
two cents I don't know yeah I so in
terms of content management systems most
of the time Drupal and Joomla are
compared together there's also WordPress
but that really has more of a focus in
the blogging single-user blogging space
although you can do more with it that
that tends to be their kind of niche and
there's sort of systems like php-nuke
which is what I started on and then I
said I'm never touching one of these
CMS's again fragrance you know where
that their philosophy seemed to be let's
cram every feature that anyone ever asks
for and not give you any way to shut it
off you know and that sort of thing so
the main difference that I've found from
talking to the joomla guys between
drupal and joomla is that our
communities have both kind of started
from the total opposite way and
approached the same problems so it's
very interesting so for example um
drupal has you know like maybe five guys
who can actually commit to core and
everybody else participates through
patched submissions and stuff like that
our our community started out as a bunch
of developers first where we were a
website to talk about web technology and
stuff like that and then that website
became open source and then you know
people started working on it and then
gradually gained a user base so we
struggle with things like usability we
struggle with things like um you know
making things easy for people you know
we're like oh yeah you just click here
and do this and twiddle that and click
here and do that and then shut this
thing down here and then do this SQL
query in your database and you're done
easy you know and so we were sort of
converging more on like okay well let's
step back and let's figure out how we
can you know improve our admin panels
and make them look nicer and and get our
workflow more straightforward and stuff
like that but uh the advantage of a
bunch of developers working out is that
our AP eyes are pretty solid and so and
we're also not afraid to break things
code wise as long as the data is
maintained so if some new technology
comes out we're right on it we want to
jump on the bleeding edge get that into
Drupal
and we've got a lot of you know i i'd
say if we're like a pyramid up until
very recently have way more developers
up here then and then users were down at
the bottom joomla is sort of the
complete opposite of that where they
have a very small group of developers
they have maybe 20 people or so that our
core kind of working on joomla and
making it better and then all the rest
of their users are users of the software
so they have a really strong focus and
usability and and and ease of use and
like making things really
straightforward for people to pick up
natively and things like that and now
they're moving in the direction of
providing api so like one of the things
joomla is working on is they're writing
their entire code base because they
spooned from mambo and you know and they
so they're rewriting their entire code
base basically to be all object-oriented
and things like that in order to kind of
bring in more development interest and
things like that so that's the main
difference between the two functionality
wise there's things drupal does that
joomla doesn't end things joomla does
that drupal doesn't so it's mostly a
matter of comparing the needs and seeing
which one fits for you but in my
experience that's the main difference
between the two communities and and
eventually you're gonna find that
they're going to end up somewhere in the
middle you know at some point where
we've got the functionality and the
usability and they've got the usability
and the functionality and then it's
going to be a matter of which one votes
your boat so we like drupal though that
was a good question any other questions
yes I don't know we were first no she
yeah might be more of an open-source
kind of the thing where you know just
have a name that's there's nothing about
the sound that's just so like you know
cool exactly I think something like that
yeah well tubal is funny so so Drupal
the name Drupal is a weird name it comes
from so Jesus from from Belgium and so
he meant to he meant to register the
domain dorp dot org which is which means
village for this big website thing he
had and he misspelled it and register
drop org instead and he
like oh cool a four-letter English
domain that's still available sweetie
I'll take that you know so Drupal is
sort of an angle as a Anglet ization of
the word Drupal which means drop in
Dutch so it's sort of like a weird thing
so yeah so that's a sort of hind rupal I
don't know what story is behind jun hwa
I think it's some sort of a greeting or
something but thankfully at this point
when I had to go to my senior management
and say yeah I found this content
management system it's great I didn't
lead with the name you know I went
through all the features why it was
great and then at the end I kind of I
know and it's called Drupal because
inevitably they always kind of glazed
over in right lat drew what he also
avoid showing the scary alien head until
they were sold on the people said cool
everybody else great well then I think
thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
