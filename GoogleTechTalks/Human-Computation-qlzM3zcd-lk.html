have Lewis Vaughan on here today from
Carnegie Mellon University his talk is
on human computation Lewis is a very new
assistant professor in computer science
at the school of computer science at
Carnegie Mellon University he received
his PhD in 2005 and I'm told he was the
hottest new graduate on the market with
offers from just about every University
out there including corporate uh offers
- he received his BS from Duke
University
he received the Microsoft research
fellowship award he his research
interests include encouraging people
will do work for free
as well as catching and throwing
cheaters in online environments his work
has appeared in over a hundred news
publications around world New York Times
CNN USA Today BBC and Discovery Channel
Lewis holds four patents applications
and it's licensed technology to major
Internet companies please join me in
welcoming Lewis fun on can you hear me
now yeah okay okay so I want to start by
asking a question to the people in the
audience how many of you have had to
fill out a registration form for
something a yahoo hotmail or Gmail or
some sort of web form where you've been
asked to read a distorted sequence of
characters so I distorted words such as
this one how many of you found it
annoying awesome okay well that was part
of my thesis that thing is called the
CAPTCHA and the reason is there's to
make sure that you the entity filling
out the web form are actually a human
and not some sort of computer program
that was written to submit the form
millions and millions of times the
reason it works is because humans at
least nonvisually impaired humans have
no trouble reading distorted characters
whereas computer programs simply can't
do it as well yet pay more generally a
CAPTCHA is just a program that can tell
with its users a human or a computer
okay let me say that another way I
CAPTCHAs a program that can generate and
great tests that most humans can pass
but current computer programs cannot
they notice the paradox here a CAPTCHA
is a program that can generate and great
tests that it itself cannot pass so in
that way CAPTCHAs are a lot like some
professors
just to make things crystal-clear let me
give you an example when one of these
programs that can generate an great test
that most humans can pass but current
computer programs cannot get here's how
the program works first the program
picks a random string of letters o AMG
in this case then the program renders
the string into a randomly distorted
image and then the program generates a
test which consists of the randomly
distorted image and the question what
are the characters in this image now it
is CAPTCHAs are used all over the place
for all kinds of things and I could
spend the next hour talking about all
the different applications of CAPTCHAs
but since I don't want to do that I want
to illustrate one of the applications
through a little story so a few years
ago slash dot which is a very popular
website put up this poll in their site
asking which is the best computer
science graduate school in the United
States this is a very dangerous question
to ask where the web as with most online
polls IP addresses of voters were
recorded to make sure that each person
could only vote at most once however as
soon as the poll went up students at CMU
wrote a program that voted for CMU
thousands of thousands of times
the next day students at MIT wrote their
own program and a few days later the
poll had to be taken down with CMU an
MIT having like a gazillion votes and
every other school having less than a
thousand I guess the poll worked in this
case I'm just kidding just kidding ok
but in general this is a huge problem
you simply cannot trust the results of
an online poll because anybody could
just write a program to vote for their
favorite thousands of thousands of times
one solution is to use a CAPTCHA to make
sure that only humans can vote ok
capture some many many other
applications another one is in free
email services for instance there are
several companies that offer free email
services Yahoo Microsoft Google and up
until a few years ago on all of them
were suffering from a very specific type
of attack it was people who wrote
programs to obtain millions of email
accounts every day and the people who
wrote these programs were usually
spammers so if you're a spammer and you
want to send spam from say Yahoo you run
into the problem that is yahoo account
only allows you to send like 100
messages a day so if you want to send
millions of messages a day from a Yahoo
from Yahoo accounts you have to own
millions of yahoo accounts and this is
what spammers wrote programs to obtain
millions of yahoo accounts and the
solution or one solution this is what we
originally suggested to yahoo was to use
a CAPTCHA to make sure that only humans
can obtain free email accounts
now since CAPTCHAs are used all over the
place to stop spammers from doing bad
things spammers have started coming up
with all kinds of dirty hacks to get
around the captures that are being used
in practice
so let me explain a couple of them
here's one I'm sure a lot of you have
heard of this capture sweatshops so spam
companies actually are hiring people to
solve CAPTCHAs all day long and they're
usually being hired in other countries
where the minimum wage is a lot lower
and this is currently happening but
there's at least two consolations first
it's at least costing them some so
whereas before they get the accounts for
free
now it cost them a fraction of a cent
per console they can't get that minute
second CAPTCHAs are actually generating
jobs in order to develop countries so
you guys should so this is one dirty
hack there's an even dirtier hack and
I'm sure a lot of you have heard of it
and this is what some porn companies are
allegedly doing I'm going to emphasize
the word allegedly so porn companies
also want to send spam they also want to
break CAPTCHAs and here's how they're
allegedly doing they write a program
that fills out the entire registration
form say at yahoo and whenever the
program gets to the CAPTCHA it can't
solve it so what it does is it copies
the CAPTCHA back to the porn page now
back at the porn page there's a lot of
people looking at porn and suddenly one
of them gets this screen saying if you
want to see the next picture you got to
tell me what word is in the box below
and you know what people do they typed
the word as fast as possible
and by doing so they are effectively
solving the CAPTCHA for the porn company
bot there that is they're effectively
obtaining a free email account for that
okay so pornographers they're really
really smart
okay so CAPTCHAs take advantage of human
processing power in order to
differentiate humans from computers and
it turns out that being able to do so
have some very very nice applications in
practice now that I've told you I'll cap
just now that I now I can tell you what
this talk really is about this talk is
not about CAPTCHAs this talk is about
human computation sort of the flip side
of captures the idea is there's a lot of
things the humans can easily do the
computers cannot yet do I want to show
you how we can solve some of these
problems by just making good use of
human processing power I think the best
way to introduce the rest of the talk is
with a little statistic and the
statistic is that over 9 billion human
hours to solitaire were played in 2003 9
billion now some people talk about
wasted computer cycles what about wasted
human cycles just to give you an idea of
how large this really this number really
is let me give you two other numbers
first is the number of human hours that
it took to build the Empire State
Building turns out it took seven million
human hours to build the entire Empire
State Building that's equivalent to
about six point eight hours of people
playing solitaire around the world now
in case you don't think the Empire State
Building is a monumental enough task let
me give you another number the Panama
Canal
okay turns out it took 20 million human
hours to build the entire Panama Canal
and that's equivalent to a little less
than a day of people playing solitaire
in the world I want to show how we can
make good use of these wasted human
cycles and that is what I mean by human
computation okay so in this talk we're
going to consider the human brain as an
extremely advanced processing unit that
can solve problems that computers cannot
yet solve even more we're going to
consider all humanity as an extremely
advanced and large-scale distributed
processing unit that can solve
large-scale problems the computers
cannot yet solve I claim that the
current relationship between humans and
computers is extremely parasitic were
parasites of computers what I want to
advocate for in this talk is more of a
symbiotic relationship a symbiosis one
in which humans solve some problems
computers of some other problems and
together together we work to create a
better
oh okay I'm getting freaky but more
seriously I want to talk about some
problems that computers cannot yet solve
and I want to show you how we can easily
solve a lot of these problems by just
making good use of human processing
power okay so the first problem I'm
going to talk about is that of labeling
images with words okay so the problem is
as follows on input an arbitrary image
we want to output a set of keywords that
properly and correctly describe this
image as you should all probably know
this is still a completely open problem
in computer vision and artificial
intelligence in the sense that computer
programs simply can't do this however a
method that could accurately label
images with words would have several
applications one of which you've
probably already seen and that is image
search on the web so Google for instance
has Google Images you can go there to
type a word like dog and get back a lot
of images related to the word dog now it
is the case that there's no computer
program out there I can tell you whether
an arbitrary image from the web contains
the dog or not
so the way Google Images works an image
search on the web core works roughly is
by using file names in HTML text so if
you search for dog you get back a lot of
images named dog jpg or dog dog gif or
that have the word dog very near them
okay of course the problem with this
method is that it doesn't always work
very well for instance this it's not
anymore but it used to be the first page
of results for the query dog on Google
Images there is an image for rabbit
there there's a guy in a blue suit what
the hell okay but if there are methods
so for every image on the web could give
us accurate textual descriptions of
those images we could potentially
improve the accuracy of image search on
the web it's such a method where many
other applications another one is in
accessibility so it turns out that the
majority of the web is not fully
accessible to visually impaired
individuals and one of the biggest
reasons is images ok so blind people
actually surf the web the way they do it
is the use screenreaders
programs that read the entire screen to
them out loud but whenever a screen
reader reaches an image it can't do
anything other than read the caption of
that image of course the majority of
images on the web don't have proper
captions associated to them ok so again
if we had a method such that for every
image on the web could give us accurate
textual descriptions of those images we
could improve the accessibility of the
web ok
social method with our many other
applications and so what we want and
what I'm going to tell you right now is
a method I can label all images on the
web not only that it's a method I can
label all images on the web in a way
that's fast and cheap how are we going
to do it
well we're gonna use humans but we're
gonna use them cleverly okay so normally
if you ask people to label images for
you you have to pay them to do so and if
you wanted to label all images on the
web by paying people you have to pay a
lot of money and even if you had a lot
of money if you wanted to label all
images on the web by paying people fast
you'd have to find a lot of people were
willing to label images for a living
okay good luck with that my approach is
much better rather than paying people to
label images for me I get them to want
to label the images for free and in fact
they want to label the images so much
that in some cases they're even willing
to pay me to label the images for me how
do I do that well I have an extremely
extremely enjoyable multiplayer online
game called the ESP game that people
really really like to play and as people
play sort of as a side effect they
actually label images for me now the ESP
game has two very nice properties first
as people play the game the labels that
they generate for images are accurate
even if the players don't want them to
be so ok second as people play the game
they actually label image is very very
fast that in fact using a conservative
estimate I'm going to show you later in
the talk but if the ESP game is put on a
popular gaming site we could actually
label all images on google image search
in just a few weeks so how does the game
work well first and foremost this
becomes a two-player online game so
there's a website you can go there to
try to play the website whenever you go
to the website you get randomly paired
with somebody else wanting to play the
game that's your partner now you're not
allowed to communicate with them and
you're not told who they are it's just a
complete stranger from the web and the
goal of the game is for both you and
your partner to type the exact same word
given that the only thing you two have
in common is an image so you can both
see the same image you know you can both
see the same image and now you're told
type whatever the other guy's typing
turns out that what people do the best
strategy is just to type a lot of words
related to the common image okay so
basically both players are gonna be
typing a lot of words related to the
common image until wanna player ones
words is equal to one a player twos
words they agree they get points and
then they get happy okay
that's the basic idea of the game now
this word that the two players agree on
is usually a very very good label for
the image because it comes from two
independent sources okay let me give you
a better idea of the basic move of the
game
imagine you have two players player one
and player two and they're both paired
so they can both see the same image
another told type whatever the other
guys typing
notice the players are not told labeled
the image or even what labeling an image
might mean they're just I'll type
whatever the other guys typing so say at
first player one types card player to
type boy it's still not this it's not
the same word so the game still goes on
say then play a one pad tap and then kid
still not a player ones words is equal
to one a player two's words so the game
is still going on by the way
player one cannot see any of player
two's guesses and vice versa okay so
they're just typing words completely
independently until say player two types
of word that play one had already
entered they agree and then they get a
lot of points this is the basic move of
the game the actual game looks a little
more like this basically both players
have a certain amount of time to agree
on as many images as they can so in two
and a half minutes they have to agree on
as many images as they can that's
basically the game each time they agree
on an image they get a certain number of
points there's also a thermometer at the
bottom that measures how many images the
two players have agreed on and if you
fill the thermometer you'll get like a
gazillion points there's also a pass
button so players can agree to pass on
difficult images and another really
important component of the game is this
thing we call taboo words you've ever
played the game taboo you should be able
to guess what these are taboo words are
words that are related to the image the
players cannot use when trying to agree
on that image so in this case for
instance you can't use hat or sunglasses
or any plural or singular of these words
now we're the taboo words come from they
come from the game itself the taboo
words are words that two other players
have already agreed on for this
particular image so the nice thing about
taboo words is that they guarantee that
each time an image passes through the
game it gets a brand new different label
the other nice thing about taboo words
is they make the game more difficult and
therefore more fun not talking about fun
is this game fun well amazingly it
really is a lot of fun so far we've
gotten over 15 million agreements as
over 15 million labels with about 75
thousand players let me say that another
way seventy-five thousand players have
given us over 15 million agreements that
means that on average each player is
playing a lot okay we have many people
that play over 20 hours a week that's
like a full-time job we've had playing
streaks that are longer than 15 hours
straight so
I feel a little bad about this so by now
the game has a mechanism that have you
been playing for longer than 15 hours it
will cut you off and as a promise to my
department head it's ten hours if you're
from a thot edu domain okay so so far
over 15 million agreement what if you
wanted to label the entire web well five
thousand people playing the game
simultaneously could label all images on
Google Images in about two months okay
the striking thing here is that five
thousand is not a very large number in
fact individual games in popular gaming
sites such as Yahoo pogo.com or MSN
averaged over five thousand players at a
time so if you put the HBM on a popular
gaming site you could potentially label
a lot of the images on the web in just a
few months okay a few more things about
the game there's also single player
version of the game so it's important to
have a single player version of the game
for several reasons for one of them is
the number of people playing the game is
not always even but also whenever a
player drops it's important to just
basically have them keep on playing the
single version player of the game and
how do you get a single player game well
you simply can pair up a single person
with a pre-recorded set of moves okay
the idea is as follows
whenever you have two people playing you
record everything that they do and when
they do it okay so you record all the
words they entered along with timing
information and whenever we want to have
a single player played we simply pair
them up with a pre-recorded set of moves
okay so that single player is playing
with somebody else just not at the same
time and one one nice thing about this
notice this actually doesn't stop the
labeling process okay that single player
is playing with somebody else just not
at the same time so everything that I've
said about labeling remains true okay in
fact we could even go one step further
we can do the zero player game we can
also pair up pre-recorded games with
each other to get more labels and if you
count all the extra labels that the ESPN
has collected so far you get that so far
the SPM has collected over 39 million
labels for images on the web okay if you
count all these now one thing that some
of you may be wondering about is uh what
about cheating so for instance could you
try to cheat to screw up the labels
something like my office made and I
could try to log into the game at
exactly the same time maybe we'll get
paired with each other and if we get
paired with each other we can agree on
any word we want for any image or even
worse somebody could go to slashdot and
type hey everybody let's all play the
ESP game and let's all agree on the word
pay for every image it could happen
fortunately I've thought about this and
the SPM has several mechanisms that
fully prevent cheating let me tell you a
few of the things that we do to prevent
cheating here's one at random we
actually give players test images these
are just images that are just there to
test whether the player playing honestly
or not and what they are is they're
images for which we know all the most
common things that people enter for them
ok and we we only store a player's
guesses and the words they agree on if
they successfully label the test images
ok so if you think about it in a way
this sort of gives a probabilistic
guarantee that a given label is not
corrupt ok what's the probability that a
given label is corrupt given that the
players successfully label all of their
test images ok and this probability can
boost can be boosted by using the next
strategy which is repetition so we only
store a label after n pairs of players
have agreed on it wearing is a parameter
that can be tweaked ok so every now and
then we actually delete all the tableau
lists for the images we put the image
back into the game of fresh and we only
store a label if they're in pairs of
players have agreed on ok so if we let X
be the probability of a label being
corrupt given the player successfully
label all of the test images then after
n repetitions the probability of
corruption is X to the N this is
assuming that the n repetitions are
independent of each other but if X is
very small X to the N is really really
small and I'm going to say so far we've
collected lots of lots of labels and we
have not seen cheating be able to screw
up our labels in fact the quality of the
labels that the ESP team has collected
so far is very high let me now show you
some search results so let me show you
what happens when we search for the word
dog for instance here's some dogs more
dogs more dogs more dogs and I could go
on forever here's what happens when you
search for Britney Spears you got to
show this whenever you shall break
search results here's what happens when
you search for Google
I prepare this for this talk you get the
founders and one really nice thing about
this is that this slide constitutes a
proof that the word Google and the word
search really are synonyms on it on and
put that people agreed on Google okay so
let me now show you some sample labels
so what I'm going to show you right now
are some images along with the labels
that the ESP game has collected for them
so far so here's an image and here are
the labels that the ESP team has
collected for it so far by the way this
could be ordered in terms of frequency
they're not this is just the list of all
the words that the esteem has collected
for this image so far you should notice
two things about this list of words
first of all is extremely accurate so
meaning all of these words actually make
sense with respect to the image second
it's extremely complete meaning almost
anything that you can imagine to
describe something in this image is in
this list not everything but a lot of
the things and in fact this is true in
general the word lists generated by the
ESP game they are as accurate and as
complete as those generated by
participants who are just paid to label
images okay let me show you more sample
labels here's another image anybody know
who this is
okay Walter Matthau he's an actor and
just to prep you for one of the labels
what their motto was in the movie Dennis
the Menace and he played the character
of mr. Wilson okay so some of the image
some of the labels that they speaking
has collected for this image so far our
so our first one seems a little wrong
but actually if you look carefully you
realize it's really not that bad I like
to tell people they speak you must
uncovered a major conspiracy event okay
okay okay now that we're on this topic
here's another image by the way not I
have no political affiliations
whatsoever I'm not a US citizen and what
I'm about to show you are simply the
scientific results what happens when you
put this image on the spdm okay so some
of the labels that the ESP game has
collected for this image so far are that
last one can you imagine how awesome the
two players must have felt when they
agreed on that list
it must feel great in fact this brings
us to one of the reasons why people
really like the ESP game and it's
because they can feel a special
connection with their partner especially
when they agree on an off-the-wall word
like yoke for an image of President Bush
okay in fact it gets even better a lot
of the emails we get actually suggest
that players feel a very very very
special connection with their partner
yeah
players like playing with partners of
the opposite sex better they want to
know whether their partners of the
opposite sex and a lot of the emails say
things like my partner and I we look at
the world in exactly the same way can
you tell me their email address this is
great because because I'm gonna be rich
soon and this actually so the more
seriously this brings us to the question
of why do people like the ER speaking I
mean it's true that the game was
designed to be enjoyable what are the
reasons that people like the ESPM so
much and to address that question let me
show you some of the most common things
that people have said of why they like
the game okay so here's what one person
said by the way I'm just going to let
you read
okay so this is the sense of connection
with your partner here are some of the
other most common things that people
have said okay that last one if you
think about it it makes perfect sense
although that was not expected it makes
perfect sense the ESP game helps people
learn English because you get an image
you got to say what it is in English and
that brings up the question could you
have the ESP game in multiple languages
the answer is sure but I don't want to
talk about that okay so that's some of
the most common things that people have
told us of why they like the game
in addition let me show you some of the
things that people have said about the
game in blogs so it was in some point in
literally hundreds of blogs here's a
couple of them here's what one guy said
sense of achievement but the best is the
way this guy ends okay here's another
one
so this guy actually likes the concept
of the game but again the best is the
way this guy ends so not everybody likes
their partner and it completely depends
on whether you do well with with them or
not if you do well with them you fall in
love with them if you do badly you think
they're an idiot of course you're not
the idiot they're an idiot even though
the game is symmetric America okay but
in addition to all those things that
people have told us we continually do
measurement to try to figure out what
are the things that make people play
longer so let me explain one of these
measurements to you at some point in the
history of the game I added this very
small message in the corner of the
screen alerting you whether your partner
had already entered a guess or not it's
a very tiny message this is just a
magnification of it just tells you when
your partner has already entered guess
or not when this was added to the game
it wasn't added to all the players he
was recited to a small random subset of
the players and then we measured whether
the players who have this feature played
longer than those who didn't and it
turns out that those who had this
feature played a whopping four percent
longer than those who didn't now you
might not think the four percent is very
large but actually it's a statistically
significant difference and if you think
about it it's just a very tiny message
in the corner of the screen makes people
play four percent longer okay okay now
in a way the ESP game is kind of like an
algorithm okay much like an algorithm it
has an input-output behavior its input
is an image its output as a set of key
words to properly describe the image
much like an algorithm you can analyze
its efficiency you can prove that it's
out but it's not corrupt with high
probability etc so what I want to do now
is I want to refer to all games like the
ESP game that are kind of like
algorithms I want to refer to them as
games with a purpose okay and the idea
that I want you to have in your mind is
that the games of the purpose is like
running a computation in people's brains
instead of silicon processors okay
and what I want to do now is I want to
give you other examples of games with a
purpose so the next problem that I'm
going to talk about is that of locating
objects in images okay so one input an
arbitrary image the ESP game tells us
what objects are in the image but it
does not tell us where in the image each
objects is each object is located so
what we would like to know is we would
like to know yes there's a man in the
image but the man is right there there's
a plant in the image but the plant is
right there and not only that we would
like to know precisely which pixels
belong to the man which pixels belong to
the plant etc and we would like to have
this information for a large
the images on the web we would have this
information we could do a lot of really
cool things for instance we could have
an image search engine where the results
are highlighted tells you this is where
the man is in each one of your images
that'll be pretty cool but even better
if we had this information for a lot of
images we could use this for training
computer vision algorithms ok so
computer vision has advanced
significantly over the last 20 20 or 40
years but so far it hasn't been able to
create a program that can with high
probability figure out where in the
image each object is located ok and one
of the major stumbling blocks is the
lack of training data but we had image
images like this
this data for a lot of images on the web
we could use it to train better computer
vision algorithms okay so this is what
the next game is going to do the next
game is called peekaboom okay and here's
how it works it's a two-player game much
like the ESP game both players don't
know anything about each other and they
can't communicate with each other at the
beginning of every round oh by the way
the two players the player on the left
is we're gonna call them peak the player
on the right we're gonna call them boom
okay so peak and boom at the beginning
of every round boom gets an image along
with a word so in this case is the image
of a butterfly and the word is butterfly
that image word pair comes directly from
the ESP game okay peak at the beginning
of every round gets nothing just a
completely blank screen and the goal of
the game is for boom to get peak to
guess the word butterfly and the only
thing that boom can do to help pig guess
the word butterfly is he can take his
mouse put it somewhere in the image okay
and click and whenever boom clicks a
circular area around that click is
revealed to peak the actual circular
area is a lot smaller than the one I
revealed I just didn't want to go
through a little clicks but basically
when boom clicks a circular area around
the click is revealed to peak and then
peak given only the circular areas has
to guess what word boom is trying to
make them guess whenever peak guesses
the correct word both players get a lot
of points and then they switch roles
peak becomes boom and boom becomes peak
now notice in this case the word was
butterflies - boom clicked on the
butterfly but had the word been flower
boom would have clicked on the flower so
we're just watching where boom clicks we
get information about where each object
is located in every image ok by the way
I'm brushing over a lot of details for
instance there so
so hints so players can so boom can give
hints to peek about whether the word is
a noun is that a verb is it text in the
image it's a okay now just to make
things more clear let's play a couple of
rounds of diggable okay so you guys have
to guess what I'm trying to make you
guess here we go it's a noun push
awesome okay you got it
push okay here's another one
it's a verb
big okay very nice okay
I love this image okay so imagine we
were back here and I give you a
different hint I told it was a noun and
not only that I started pointing there
what would you say it it here exactly
okay so this is another mechanism of
peekaboom and something called pings
okay so not only can boom revealed part
of the image after something has been
revealed he can also point to somewhere
saying it's this it's this yeah this
gives us extra information about where
each object is located in the image okay
so this is the basic idea of peekaboom
this is what the big one screen looks
like for one of the players this is for
the boom player now the first question
is is this game fun well turns out it
really is a lot of fun by the way the
statistics I'm going to show you right
now are a little outdated this is just
for the first four months of gameplay
okay so in the first four months of
gameplay 27,000 players gave us 2.1
million pieces of data buy a piece of
data I mean an image along with a word
correctly analyzed by a pair of players
in the first 10 days after release
actually many people played over 120
hours that's an average of over 12 hours
a day so it's a lot of fun here's the
top scores list of peekaboom just to put
things in perspective this is for the
first four months of gameplay each time
you play peekaboom you get on average
800 points so the top player there has
3.3 million points and even the lowest
player in this list in the first four
months have played at least 270 hours of
gameplay ok so people really love this
game now what about the data that it
produces is it any good or how do we get
good data out of peekaboo so let me
explain how we get good data or peekaboo
this is an image of Ronald the word is
wrong by the way I love this image and
the last few images the last three
images were collected by searching for
the word funny using the ESP game
okay so we get an image of Ronald a word
Ronald here's what we do to get good
data out of this we give the same image
word pair to a bunch of pairs of players
okay and from each pair of players we
get a region of the image that is
related to the word now we take all of
these regions and intelligently combine
them and get a really good idea of where
the object is located in the image okay
and on top of that we can add sort of
where the pings are to get more
information what the most salient parts
are and we can go even one step further
we can take this information and combine
it with image segmentation algorithms to
get pretty much the precise precise
outline of where the object is in the
image now I'll say this doesn't work for
all objects in the images it works like
that perfectly for about 50% of the
objects in the images that we have data
for for the rest it works mostly but it
can miss like a foot or something okay
but even without using segmentation we
could just use the peekaboom data in a
really really boneheaded way to come up
with a search engine in which the
results are sort of highlighted okay and
we've done this we have a search engine
where you can search for man dog and for
each image it tells you here's the man
here's a dog here's the man here's the
dog and more men more dog okay forget
about peekaboom brand new game verbosity
so this next game that I'm going to talk
about by the way has not yet been
released so I'm not gonna be able to
show you any statistics but I'm just
gonna quickly explain what the idea is
okay so what what does Bravo city do the
idea is it's collect common-sense facts
okay so what's a common-sense fad
there's an example for comments in fact
water quenches thirst okay it's a true
fact that everybody knows okay here's
another common-sense fact cars usually
have four wheels now the thing about
common-sense facts is that it is
estimated that each one of us is
literally hundreds of millions of them
in our head and these are what allow us
to act normal and navigate our world
successfully the other thing about
common sense facts is that computers
don't yet have them but if we could
somehow put common-sense facts into
computers we could potentially make them
more intelligent and I'm not even
talking about making computers as
intelligent as humans just a little more
intelligent like for instance
transforming our search query into
something better that works better or
something like that okay so if we could
somehow collect a lot of comments and
facts and put them into a computer we
could potentially use this to make
computers more intelligent in fact
there's been a lot of projects that have
tried to do this
including one at MIT and so far they
have been able to collect enough
common-sense facts in order to really
make a difference because the process of
entering common-sense facts into a
computer is extremely tedious okay so
we're gonna turn this into a game so for
the next game that I'm going to talk
about the input-output behavior of this
game is as follows on input a word this
game is going to output a set of
common-sense facts about that word okay
so by the way I'm oversimplifying here
these common-sense facts are not just
going to be common-sense facts in
English they're gonna have some
structure to them so there's gonna be
logical operators inside them etc itself
okay so this is the input-output
behavior and in for a word it's gonna
give common-sense facts about that work
and the way the game is gonna work oh
game called verbosity and the way it's
gonna work is as follows it's a
two-player word guessing game so there's
two players a narrator and a guesser
same ideas the ESP game basically both
players can't communicate with each
other they don't know anything about
each other at the beginning of every
round the narrator gets a word and has
to get the guesser to guess that word
and what the narrator can do to get the
guesser to guess that word is you can
pick one among many sentence templates
that they have okay
the which sentence templates are
available to them at the time vary
depending on the word so you can pick
one among many sentence templates and
fill it with an appropriate word what's
an appropriate word is a word that's not
milk and it's also a word that fits in
grammatically with the sentence with the
sentence template okay whenever the
sentence template is filled in it's sent
to the guesser then the narrator can
pick another sentence template fill it
with an appropriate key word and send it
to the guesser okay and the guests are
given enough enough hints about it
eventually has to guess what word it is
and whenever the guesser guesses the
correct word both players get points
okay the way we get common-sense facts
out of this game is by just watching
what the narrator says for each word
okay so that's by the way I'm brushing
over a lot of details for this game this
is just a basic idea so high-level ideas
it's a two-player 1-click two-player
game player 1 and player 2 at the
beginning of every round player 1 gets a
word and because of the rules of the
game has to give some common-sense facts
about the word then those common-sense
facts are sent to player 2 and player 2
given only the common-sense facts has to
guess what word player 1 got as input
okay and if player 2 can guess the
correct word
of players get points this is the core
mechanism of verbosity now I want you to
notice two things about the scoring
mechanism first it's fun so it's this is
very similar to the core mechanism of a
lot of popular party games okay
basically just word guessing games
second this core mechanism actually
gives output that is already in a way
verified okay notice the output we're
getting all the common-sense facts from
player one
but what's player two doing in a way
player two is verifying the output
because the player two can guess the
word it given only the comments in fact
then those common sense has fact must
have something to do with the word okay
so in a way it's giving output that it's
already verified and the same core
mechanism is exactly the same core
mechanism that was used in peekaboom so
in the case of peekaboom it's a two
player game player one and player two at
the beginning of every round player one
gets an image along with a word then has
to give a region of the image that is
related to the word then that region is
sent to player two and player two given
only the region has to guess what word
player one got us in the same mechanism
as verbosity and again it's fun and also
gives output that is in a way verified
okay we're going to call all games that
satisfy this mechanism we're gonna call
them asymmetric verification games okay
so this is a general very mechanism for
building games with a purpose so in
general for an arbitrary input output
behavior we could define a game as
follows okay it's a two-player game we
give the input to player 1 and have them
give an output then we send the output
to player 2 and given only the output
player 2 has to guess what input player
1 got if player 2 can guess the correct
input both players get points this
mechanism has to the two very nice
properties that for a lot of
input-output behaviors it's fun okay and
also it gives output that is in a way
verified of course this doesn't work for
all input-output behaviors but it works
for a large class of thing and these are
asymmetric verification games and it's
asymmetric because both players are
doing something slightly different than
each other and it's also asymmetric as
opposed to symmetric verification games
where you've already seen an example of
a symmetric verification game and that's
the ESP game okay so this is another
general mechanism for creating games
with a purpose so for an arbitrary input
and output behavior you can give both
players the same input and ask them to
guess what output the other player is
going to give okay so if they both give
the same
but they get points again this mechanism
is fun for a lot of input-output
behaviors and also has the property that
the output it gives is in a way verified
because it comes from two independent
sources okay and now we can start
looking at the differences between
symmetric and asymmetric verification
games so for instance symmetric
verification games I claim put a
constraint on the number of inputs per
output so for given the number of
outputs per input sorry if a given input
has too many outputs then a symmetric
verification game is never going to work
because both players are never going to
agree on the same output a symmetric
verification games put a constraint on
the number of inputs that yield the same
output if there are too many inputs that
yield the same output then given only
the output you'll never be able to guess
what input it came from okay I'm gonna
finish now hopefully I been able to
convince you that there's a lot of power
in to looking for clever ways of
utilizing human cycles okay and in fact
if you think about it this talk sort of
hints at a paradigm for dealing with
open problems and artificial
intelligence if you have something that
you really can't solve in artificial
intelligence then then maybe you can
turn the problem into a test that
distinguishes humans from computers
turns out that being able to do so has
some very nice applications in practice
or alternatively maybe you can turn the
problem into a game in which case you
don't even need to solve your problem
anymore people will solve it for you
one nice thing about this whole research
agenda is that it provides a much better
motivation for the movie The Matrix if
you think about it the motivation for
the movie was that in the future
computers become a lot more intelligent
than humans but rather than killing us
they actually have to keep us around
because we generate power okay that
makes no sense
how much better motivation would be in
the future computers become a lot more
intelligent than humans but rather than
killing us they actually have to keep us
around because there's a couple of
problems that we can solve that they
cannot yet solve okay my ultimate
research goal is to transform our human
existence to just eating sleeping
drinking playing it never mind
WWWE captain fw ESPN org peekaboom dot
org and that's it thank you
yes using a name will automatically give
you a very quiet population of people
that are giving us answers to problems
we want answers to and this population
people people have very good question
very good it's true that the population
advice there's no question about that so
but for a lot of really simple things I
mean anybody can do it so it is true but
it's true that the population is biased
that's definitely true I don't know if
any I mean I can tell you that the
population is biased but I have not seen
anything that really can tell me oh
because we're using gamers it's like
this is happening instead of the general
population I have not seen that yeah
very similar about for example we said
milk is
we have someone test sure sure sure so I
I didn't mention a lot of the mechanisms
that we used to stop that sort of
cheating but there's a lot of mechanisms
for instance we don't let them type
anything that's not a dictionary word
second that word has to fit in with the
template agrammatic li but still i mean
there's a lot of mechanisms that try to
prevent that but you're right that's a
concern yeah
we might spend 120 hours of this
but you know you spend a few hours you
know five years from now these the game
and the question is
if your if your
that was strategic
cycles
kind of hindered by the fact that
so this is this is the answer to that is
yes and no so there are games that whose
popularity lasts for thousands of years
right and there's a lot of these there's
a lot of these gaming sites that have
games that the popularity only last like
six months or a year and what they do is
very simple they have the same game
concept and just redress it with another
name and something else and it just all
the people come back this is also well
known to nightclub designers just change
the name but it is true that popularity
does die but it but that is completely
game dependent some games the popular
lasts longer than others so the ESP game
has been running for well over two years
now and the popularity has not died I
mean there was definitely an initial
surge but it has not died so the amount
of time that it works varies and
hopefully we can find games that last
for thousands of years yeah yeah that's
a great question
so the way I explained the ESP game only
only gives you keywords that's not quite
enough for accessibility it's better
than nothing um but it's not quite
enough oh yeah but but that that that
you could that's an engineering problem
you could actually do that no no but you
can actually do that just with a server
that they connect to
so some people are better than others in
anything so can you take people from the
opposite end of the spectrum and there
be good people who trade I think debris
and there be bad people effectively
hugging me I don't know six area well
there's a spectrum of ability in
anything we can look at the either end
of the spectrum and find the really good
right well you can't do that yes I agree
yeah so you said you've been running
this game for two years which we were
supposed to have an obscene amount of
data yes or no I do have an obscene
amount they don't but I recycled the
images so because I just don't want to
have that many images so it there are 39
million labels but it's not that many
images well the reason is because of the
templates because we get we have
templates we don't we don't just let
people free-flow write English we have
templates so out of those templates we
know what the you know we know things
like well this is for purpose so things
like that really cool if we could figure
out how to do that for everything I
don't know how to do that for everything
but it I don't even know if it's
possible to do it for a thing but it
would be really cool if we could figure
out how to do it for everything I don't
know if it's possible to do it for
everything yeah
from an ethical point of view is there
any problem that people who be probably
spending their work hours playing the
game rather than there every time hours
and so you're not really gaining any
productivity in the society right I mean
you're right about that but imagine we
could turn everybody's work into
something fun all right that'd be really
cool so depending but one thing I should
say about ethical is for all these games
they don't they don't try to trick you
into doing anything I mean everybody
knows what the purpose is so
yeah a lot of these games are very good
at getting basic facts out have you
thought about how to get stuff that's a
little bit more anyone's like if you
leave milk in the fridge for three weeks
it's going to feel bad yeah yeah that's
a very good question I mean it depends a
lot on the particular domain but it I
don't know how to do it in general but
for instance for images I can tell you
so for images so the skp excuse me for
the ESP game for images most of the
stuff that you get out of the general
ESP game is very general stuff I mean
the first the first word is gonna be
like dog then once dog becomes a taboo
word it's probably gonna be the breed of
the dog or something but very general
usually things that everybody knows if
you want to start getting things that
only a few people know then you can do a
few things so for instance you can have
you can have people tell you what they
want to see images of so for instance I
like cars can I see images of cars then
I'll be an expert on that sort of thing
and then you get that you can do that
better or you can use collaborative
filtering to try to give people sort of
you try to figure out what they're good
good at and you give them more images
like that and so you can start getting
better things like that but yeah that's
a very good question yeah so it seems
like you could also use these games to
solve problems and computers are already
good at solving but if you to have
people add up numbers or things you're
sure but those games likely would not be
very fun they might be so like pseudo
constraint propagation problem that is a
little bit harder to solve in terms of
sure but I computed given this to know
cos the human self computers are a lot
better than those so if you or anyone
thought about the cognitive ass
of games that are fun in this model
versus it aren't and why in the
computational models are associated that
I mean it seems like there's a lot of
human cognition yeah interests there
yeah definitely definitely so there's
part of the problem I mean this is so I
should say two things there's a lot of
research trying to figure out there's a
lot of research on trying to define and
figure out how to make things more fun
not in general computational things but
just how to make games more fun but
nobody really knows the answer to this I
mean this is an open problem
I don't know I mean I don't making out
that see yeah I don't know I don't know
yeah
James
the when the first person makes a
mistake
that was taken out the descent of the
second player and then after more and
more output from the first guy
the way to do that is by using a sink
the single-player game okay we actually
we take all these facts that we get and
treat them all separately and sometimes
you're just playing with a computer and
we're giving you certain facts that we
want you to verify and eventually you
just try to intersect which ones are
good and which ones are not and you can
try to figure out all the way back
before beforehand beforehand yeah yeah
control
waiting well could this happen to people
I can see it looking
implications coming from this such that
you know well we want to provide all
these search of these results but and
we're gonna basically have try and have
enough Papadopoulou on the best images
available which is kind of seems kind of
just seems like it would be more
people trying to get more control over
confident
I don't understand what you mean so I
mean there are problems with copyright I
mean Google knows about that so yeah
there are problems with that but I don't
know what else I mean yeah so this talk
was about generalizing past the ESP game
to general all kinds of things with
human habitation so I mean so you
flipped a bunch of these now from what I
can tell so far it's opportunistic
Arthur certainly be given a new task
where you know people are better the
computers is there some procedure for
coming to figure out what the right game
is to get out that that would be that
would be great but I mean in the same
way that for instance if I give you a
new task and you have to come up with an
efficient algorithm for it I there's no
procedure to coming up with an efficient
algorithm to solve something I don't
think there will be a procedure given a
problem solve you know here's a game for
it I think it's gonna be an art much
like coming up with efficient algorithms
so basically it's similar to what
happens in algorithm design
I mean people try to come up with
general things so there's things there's
things like dynamic programming that
works for a lot of things so that's
that's the best you can hope for and
that's sort of what I'm trying to do but
uh but yeah I don't think there will
ever be a well I don't know but I don't
I'm not I'm not I don't have my I'm not
holding my breath that there will ever
be a method that will just given a
problem I'll put a pro I'll put a game
okay so are you worried about the
interface between these two things like
does the existence of these games and
their popularity reducing the value of
the catch words oh the captured yeah
yeah yeah yeah you can use these games
to break the CAPTCHAs yeah definitely
it's good to do research that breaks
each other</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
