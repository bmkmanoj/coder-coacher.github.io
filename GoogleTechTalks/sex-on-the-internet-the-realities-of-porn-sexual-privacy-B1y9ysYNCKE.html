pleasure to present violet blue thanks
for coming and piling in here this is
really packed and it's really really
awesome before I say anything I just
want to let you know that there won't be
any explicit sexual imagery up here I'm
sorry
everyone's r18 right but there is going
to be some frank sexual talk so if
you're uncomfortable with Frank graphic
explicit sexual talk now's the time to
probably leave I saw some if you brought
luncheon he'll a good idea so if you
looked at the posters that we're so
sweetly put all over the Google campus
you have an idea of sort of my resume
and what that basically describes is
that I've been a sex educator and a
writer for almost 10 years I have over
20 published books in this form the
print form and I have some immediate as
well I have audiobooks and some ebooks
coming out soon the stuff that I've
written is all nonfiction so it's all
how-to information on sex which stems
from being a sex educator working in the
field lecturing doing peer to peer
support peer to peer counseling and
working with sex information hotline San
Francisco sex information that's SF si
org which is basically we take anyone
and everyone who has some kind of crazy
emergency sometimes non-emergency or
just sort of a my normal question about
sex and talk to them and I lecture to
the students so I'm actually at the
point now where I educate the educators
and when I worked at Good Vibrations I
helped develop their educational
department and what I did there was I
also develop their outreach department
which was sending teams to places like
Planned Parenthood and teaching them
about sex toys and sending teams to
places like halfway houses for
developmentally disabled adults and
teaching them you know about good sex
and bad sex and being able to sort of
navigate their life as adults and things
like that so I have a pretty wide
repertoire I have a lot of experience a
lot of online experience with sex and
searching for sex
not just because I've had a blog for a
long time
I've been doing sex podcasting for a
long time but also because I've been
working for a site called flash bought
comm for the past several years and
fleshpot is a Gawker media site however
we're sort of an island unto ourselves
in many ways in that it's been run by
one person it's been run by jonno for a
very long time and I was the second
person that he hired to come on partly
because he was reblogging a lot of stuff
that I was blogging and then we started
talking him we're like hey we should use
do this together but he also wanted to
bring in inclusivity to the site so it's
a site you know that's for it's
primarily targeted toward a
heteronormative audience so like a
straight male audience if you will about
porn run by a gay man administrated by
someone like me so and then since then
we've hired a bunch of other bloggers so
that we can have a really cover a really
diverse spectrum all genders and oral
all orientations and sort of also get in
a little bit of a subversive message
that there isn't just one kind of sex
out there so the title of this talk is
sex on the internet the realities of
porn sexual privacy online and search
which actually wasn't the title that I
picked that was uh that was my editor in
the front row so I came with subtitle
which is cataloging all the world's
information even if it's taboo as you
can see I have someone looking for
stealing cat and if you're unfamiliar
with stealing cat there it's a online
mole cat meme stealin cat is watching
you masturbate so the joke is that
stealing cat is watching you do naughty
things which I think it's a great
analogy for things about sexual privacy
online and I'm going to be doing a bit
of reading here because there I've done
there are a lot of things in here called
facts that I want to make sure that I
get right so believe it or not the
Internet has changed human sexuality
forever as we know it I think that we
have yet to see the effects of how the
Internet has changed the way that we
express ourselves as human beings
basically sexual information has been
locked down commodified it's been held
in certain channels it's been presented
in certain ways sexual information and
pornography has been held to controlling
interests due to government influences
due to personal opinion doing to
religious influences and
also due to distribution influences
distribution influences primarily being
people like booksellers who won't sell
books about certain sect sex topics
which is why a majority of my books are
with independent publishers so I can
talk about sex from an all genders all
orientations perspective which
mainstream sex publishing is still
scared to death of even though they're
trying to negotiate with me for books
they're still like super afraid that I
talked to gays and stuff like that it's
amazing how backwards they are but the
Internet has sort of leveled a playing
field for what I see is the democratic
dissemination of sex information and
being able to sort of talk to everyone
about that basically it's sort of like a
free-market approach to sex people are
being able to sort of look for what they
want and find what they want working on
a site like flush ba I've been able to
see and see stats and look at stats at
what people are actually interested in
I've been able to sort of play with and
test with looking what you know people
have been looking for well and not just
on fleshpot but on my site and other
sites as well what's really afforded
people the opportunity to start to make
choices about developing what I see is
their own sort of sexual operating
systems because I come from the belief
that everyone's sexuality it's as
individual to them as a fingerprint and
we sort of taken information from
different places and we assemble what
what works best for us and I think that
it's a constant assembly I think that
you know if the first version didn't
work so it was beta and do it again so
so basically what supporting people the
ability to do this is being able to go
online and have what they perceive as
sexual privacy you know it used to be
that you would need to go to the porn
store or you would go you know you would
get an Adam and Eve catalog with a very
limited range of things to choose from
the you know we're sex toys that weren't
even necessarily chosen because they're
made of healthy products but because
they're made of cheap products and put
together by people who don't really care
about the sexual health the sexual
pleasure or what's going on with people
that they're selling these products to
well like I said the Internet has
changed that because people now have
privacy of course the problem is that
people aren't as anonymous as they think
what I want to talk about for is I want
to talk about the user first and it's
who looks for sex online and what are
be looking for well I think the first
obvious answer to all of that is that
people are looking at sex on line to get
off and I know that it's horribly taboo
to talk about but basically what we're
talking about is masturbation people
jacking off there are a lot of
perceptions about people who are
interested in sex the idea of anyone
being interested in sex other than for
usual mainstream media reasons is is
quite taboo the idea of looking at sex
or being interested in sex purely for
the sake of pleasure is something that a
lot of people just simply don't want to
talk about and the perceptions of people
who are doing that tend to get shoved in
the corner of the guy with the raincoat
you know it's that sort of stereotype
where it's like oh well if you're really
interested in sex or if you're searching
for it or looking for it you must you
know immediately be doing something
immoral or be thinking bad thoughts who
else is looking for it well people who
are curious anyone who is curious about
sex I'm sure pretty much everyone in the
world at this point has opened up a
browser and typed in sex just to see
what's gonna come up because we're
curious we're monkeys it's true
I think another another group of people
who are looking for sex online are
people who are seeking accurate and
unbiased non-judgmental sex information
sometimes that information that they're
looking for is urgent and I'll go into
that in a second another subset of
people who are looking for sex online
are people who are seeking community
people who feel alone desperate isolated
and even folks who just want to know if
they're normal or not which is pretty
much the most common question how am i
normal a couple of quick points which
I'll develop later as well is the role
of search in all of this first of all I
think the role of such the role of
search in sex the strongest role is
fighting spam it's a big big problem
it's a big problem for people like me
who want to get accurate information out
there and I just can't even imagine what
you all go through dealing with spammers
because they're just they're pretty
insidious unfortunately they're not like
trolls because thrills trolls are stupid
and easily defeated spammers tend to be
a little smarter which is a bummer also
in the role of search I think is
understanding perceived sexual
minorities for people who are perceived
as sexual minorities
their practices and especially their
self labeling staying active with the
current online taxonomy for the terms
that perceived sexual minorities and I'm
talking even about lesbian gay bisexual
and trans people staying current with
that taxonomy that they used to
self-identify with it's really tricky
because it's changing all the time I
recently did a series of pieces where I
was data mining Craigslist and I dated
mined Craigslist because I just wanted
to see like who was looking for what at
any given point any given time in any
given neighborhood in San Francisco and
it was pretty interesting to see who was
into what into different neighborhoods
some things were fairly predictable like
the you know the cliche of the
businessman looking for the quick
blowjob in you know in you know the
hotel district that's pretty obvious but
I came up with some other surprises as
well what I really came up with that
surprised me which I didn't develop into
a piece was what I started figuring out
when I was data mining Craigslist and
I'm talking about you know just the
quick and dirty personals
is when I started doing it on a
nationwide level because I started to
unearth taxonomy that even I was
unfamiliar with that people were using
as terms to search for and to connect
with each other so I think that part of
the role of search is kind of keeping up
with those terms and maybe even having
community liaisons who can help explain
what these terms mean and demystify
these terms one piece I wrote while I
was at South by Southwest I got this
email from an F to M porn site which is
female to male transsexual and they were
having a hard time with their google
adsense words where words that they
consider respectful and that they use to
identify themselves in a way there are a
lot of disrespectful terms that are used
toward these sexual minorities
especially transsexual people and the
terms that they use to self-identify
we're sort of getting put in the wrong
bucket and ending up coming up as you
know ads for things that were really
insulting degrading disgusting and even
illegal
so they appealed to me for help and I
just sort of made some noise about it
and I think it sort of raised the level
of awareness of how people are labeling
themselves so I think the other role of
search that I think is really important
is understanding the importance of
unbiased results
whether for the users titillation ie
porn healthy sexual expression pleasure
and enjoyment and you know as we all
know porn is legal in America the
emergent trend of sex news and important
entertainment resources such as blogs or
for the delivery of accurate sex
information all of which I think can
easily get confused with spam so that's
really tricky so the question is and
I'll go back to who these people are now
is who needs sexual privacy accurate
search results and unbiased sex
information the most and now I'm talking
specifically about perceived sexual
minorities lesbian gays bisexual and
transgender people those identified by
their sexual orientation or gender
identity regardless of their interest in
the act of sex in most places LGBTQ and
questioning people face hostility from
within as from without the outside world
community healing hookups and hot
pouring which is important can be found
online
of course Matthew Shepard found out in
1998 that being gay in Wyoming was a
death sentence
brutal transgender murders like Brandon
Teena which is what the movies boys
don't cry was based on still happen as
evidenced in the 2002 murder of 17
year-old male to female Gwen Araujo from
Newark California but with a quick
google search now trans identity becomes
more of a community and less of a
mystery or a quote gay panic murder
defense when justice should have had
should have been served which it wasn't
anyone with an outsider sexual interest
such as people Apple folks know this is
actually I was in the I was in the Pride
Parade this year and so I thought this
was a great shot that I took from the
car that I was riding in I was I was
riding with my adopted mother who is
transgender captain or president rather
of the police commission of San
Francisco
Theresa Sparks but anyone with an
outsider sexual interest such as a
fetishes oh and by fetishist I actually
mean someone into balloons or coeds with
colds it's a it's a real sight check it
out
it's not it's not explicit it's really
cute anonymity and direct access allows
someone who feels alone possibly
self-hating and misunderstood and often
a fetishist hides their favorite way to
masturbate from their chosen and
life-long sex partners to find community
and fetishes you know just really
quickly I'm not just talking about
Lunars but I'm also talking about when
you think of sexual fetish you know we
tend to think of you know the people who
are sort of interested in like the
fringes with the more extreme or the
more funny or or the more you know or
aegis or easy to make fun of sexual
interests but you know common sexual
fetishes are more socially accepted
fetishes are like big boobs or big dicks
so it's good for thought BDSM and kink
it's interested people as well those
interested in power exchange sex bondage
sensory play pain complicated scenarios
and predicaments that involve fear and
power over scenes are common targets for
media discrimination until Hollywood
gets over it and the dinosaur era
mainstream media outlets shop
stop showing BDSM as abuse using it as a
trope for female degradation and telling
us that kink and BDSM are dark and
dangerous habits that can kill you which
is exactly what happened in the SF
weekly two weeks ago and in a CNN
article yesterday psycho and
psychiatrist stopped categorizing BDSM
interests as an illness these people
still need access they need information
and needing community again anyone
needing non-biased accurate sex
information that's any kid in the Bible
Belt worried that they're pregnant
because their boyfriend came on their
leg this is an actual question that we
got on this visi hotline and this we've
seen actually as a direct result of four
or five years of abstinence education in
schools since absence education has come
in to schools across the nation we at
the hotline have seen an increase in
calls from young people who really are
like oh my god can I get AIDS from
sitting on a toilet seat because no
one's telling them what's going on and
unfortunately as an effect we're seeing
a rise and STD rates as well because
they're not knowing how not to get and
they don't even know what they're doing
actually they think they can they think
that you know not they think that oral
sex isn't sex and they're thinking about
anal sex is something that helps
maintain their virginity
so we're also talking about trans people
so desperate they want to self-medicate
with hormones someone wondering if
they're gay someone trying to asphyxiate
themselves during masturbation without
killing themselves and needing to know
how the guy who wrote me last week about
a broken condom with his girlfriend or
the girl that emailed me last month who
had just had sex for the first time and
couldn't stop the bleeding and didn't
know what to do
I was the person she reached out to a
total stranger about someone that she
felt that she could ask this question to
and you know that's also the guy with a
flashlight stuck in his ass you should
have just visited 50 org so who else
needs this information women in a
January kneel submit ratings poll they
found that one in three women were
accessing porn online and that's just
women who self disclosed that they were
we were accessing porn online of course
we're looking at porn but we're doing so
improve aceo or at least what we
perceive to be privacy we're more
empowered as ever women period to ask
for what we want sexually at least of
ourselves in anonymity and be and fuck
whoever we want in whatever form we want
in places like Second Life where you can
be a different gender if you want to
female bloggers don't need to be sex
bloggers to have serious need for online
privacy but gender does make us sexual
targets I don't need to communicate to
you how many went about how women are
special targets online statistically and
in real life we all know a female rape
victim sober stalking as we all know
gets perfectly ugly when it's focused on
women sex workers sex workers of all
gender this means porn stars as well I
have an interesting example of that in a
moment actually
darrel online privacy I'll quote also
equals their physical safety in
different jurisdictions may or may not
agree sex shoppers porn and sex toy
consumers customers people plunk down
their credit cards and personal info
online all too often without obsessing
the risk of doing so there's often so
much sex sexual shame involved in
whatever they're buying they tend to
just go for him
some companies bait and switch customers
saying they'll ship in a plain brown
wrapper while selling customer input of
third parties pretty much everyone
anyone who could lose a job a lover a
friend a court case child custody or
visitation freedom under the
Constitution or could face physical or
emotional harm from being added for
their interest in
or sexual identity and that sounds like
a sermon but I have a couple of examples
to show you so what we're talking here
about in a lot of ways is the illusion
of sexual privacy online if people knew
how much their privacy was at risk when
they paid for porn or posted or answered
that Craigslist ad or searched for
canine and Google would they still do it
probably it's easy for those of us who
know our way around the Internet's to
laugh at Nigerian bank scammers but the
internet is growing new users every
single day and will continue to until
you all stop breeding but no one's
telling people not to do stupid things
like give out personal info and sexual
situations from experimentation and
masturbation to point-of-purchase
because the whole topic is still taboo
how many of you have heard of the
Craigslist experiment okay
so that's I would say about a quarter of
the room all right sorry to show you
this photo it's horrifying the
Craigslist experiment in September 2006
griefer extraordinaire Jason Fortuny and
his friend took a hardcore women seeking
men ad from another city and reposted it
on Craigslist Seattle to see how many
replies he and his friend could get in
24 hours then he published every single
response photos emails
I am info phone numbers names everything
to public wiki encyclopedia dramatica
then they went public on Jason's live
journal page calling it the Craigslist
experiment inviting readers to identify
the craigslist ads responders and add
more info quote your goal identify
people you know IRL in real life and
point them out we've already had great
successes here the page is still life
this is a screen cap from just last week
it wasn't just any kind of ad but a
hardcore BDSM ad posting where female
submissive was looking for a rough male
dominant to beat her up and fucker the
ads language suggests to me and many
other sex educators that the original
poster actually had no idea with the
language they were using meant clearly
what the person was asking for was well
beyond the safe saying sm community
definitions this and a few other details
suggested to me and other sex educators
that I talked to about it that the
original Met ad may have indeed been
placed by men experimenting with
transgender identity searching for that
female extreme
the extreme of female submission here's
the text the point is Jason and his
cohort cohort took the ad at face value
as an average and got a face value
response to what the ads message sent
out to the world they got a hundred and
seventy eight responses with a hundred
and forty five photos of men cocks faces
and more full email addresses both
personal and business addresses names
and a few I M names and phone numbers
one respondent uses in my one respondent
used a Microsoft employee email address
and another used a USR army military
email address
respondents emailed Fortuny asking him
to take the info down and he simply
published their requests for 20 then had
his private info published a Craigslist
and was threatened physically with
lawsuits and has been basically hated on
by everyone from online vs BDSM
communities to Wired who called himself
units sociopathic now while C
researching my sex books I've placed ads
on Craigslist just to get a random
sampling or to get ideas every time I've
received an overwhelming amount of troll
responses of course with photos I didn't
ask for offers I didn't ask for and
sometimes some pretty evil language I've
definitely entertained the idea of doing
something with this information that
they're sending me but just thinking
about it makes me feel better it'sit's
something that I could never conceive of
someone actually doing in real life but
unfortunately in this case someone did
and it's pretty common I actually have
joked with other female sex bloggers and
female sex educators about receiving
unsolicited in like extremely personal
information from people via email and in
fact have joked over beers oh my god you
got a face pic ur8 so ultimately in the
Craigslist experiment a high percentage
of these guys lives were changed in a
major way now here's the here's the not
eat your lunch photo censored censored
for your viewing pleasure and this is
how we censored it when we put it on
flash bought the top photo is someone's
who's someone whose photo was reposted
and the bottom photo was the photo that
was used in the ad some might argue that
the Craigslist experiment is an
inevitable form of online natural
selection
if you have something to lose don't do
something that could make you lose it
and I think personally that if our
culture was made to feel less ashamed
about sex Jason's results would be quite
different in a follow-up to the the blog
posting that I did on my personal blog I
received an email forwarded from the
King County Prosecuting Attorney's
Office stating based on what I've read
in the media accounts I would like to
say that there is no violation of our
state Criminal Code involved here yet so
what he did was actually illegal right
after the Craigslist experiment granted
this was last year around this time
there was a copycat in Portland
yesterday in Gainesville Florida
there was another copycat post which was
flagged and removed within a few hours
so I have another example for you it's
very hot photo the police officer
recently fired for hovering having an
adult sight last month an Arizona
officer was officially fired for running
a sex website with his wife went off the
clock a three-judge San Francisco 9th
Circuit US Court of Appeals panel ruled
against the former first officers First
Amendment free speech right and right to
privacy focused case which of course
directly affects any individual's sexual
privacy online and shows I think just
how ignorant a lot of us circuit judges
are about the Internet the judges ruled
that because what the former officer did
was quote vulgar indecent sleazy and
disreputable he has no right to keep his
job as a public servant the thing is
what the former officer and his wife did
was simple boring amateur porn okay I'm
sorry
but I'm surprised anyone paid for it
seriously it was just it was like
they're swingers right it was just like
him and his wife and it was a pay site
it would be pictures of him and her
having sex pictures of her masturbating
or pictures of her with another girl so
I mean it's pretty pretty pedestrian
stuff considering what's out there the
only offense here is that there were a
couple being exhibitionist swingers one
judge didn't agree and I thought that
was really interesting and I have a
little bit from his concurrence in the
judgment with all due respect this is
from Judge candy with all due respect I
am unable to join the majority opinion
under the facts of the case in the
existing precedent the police
department could not discharge Dibble
Ronald double that's his name for his
website expression without violating the
First Amendment as the majority opinion
points out Dibble was careful not to
identify himself or his website with the
police department or with police status
at all now I recognize that pornography
although apparently popular it's not a
very respected subject of First
Amendment protection in many quarters
the majority opinion here reflects that
distaste variously characterizing
dibbles expressive activities as vulgar
indecent sleazy and disreputable but
vigorous enforcement's of the first of
the free speech guarantee of the First
Amendment often requires that we protect
speech that many even a majority find
offensive pornography and sexual
expression in general is protected by
the First Amendment when that does not
constitute obscenity and there is no
showing that dibbles expression meets
that extreme standard when sexual when
applied to sexually sorry when applied
to sexually expressive activities this
ruling has disturbing potential for
expansive application and this is a
photo I actually took it pride this year
the all of the I rode with the police
contingent which is really fun and they
were very very proud these are their
pride beads hanging from their sidearms
the judge concluded a measurable segment
of the population for example is
vigorously antagonistic to homosexual
activity and expression it could easily
be encouraged to mobilize where a police
officer discovered to have engaged
off-duty and unidentified by his
activity in a gay pride parade or
expressive cross-dressing or any number
of expressive activities that might fan
the embers of antagonism smoldering in a
part of the population I have another
example and this is uh this is a more
first-person example here the story of
anonymous sex blogger girl with a
one-track mind this is a recent
screencap from her site as I've told you
I've been a blogger and an occasional
Girl Friday editor at fleshpot calm for
the past few years a job when full time
requires me to scour the Internet's for
explicit sexual content of reasonable
quality we endeavor to cover a wide
range of sexual expression and all
genders and orientations and I'll tell
you when Johnno lives in New Orleans and
when Hurricane Katrina hit New Orleans I
ended up running flush bought for two
months by myself with no I basically
know the employees so I was doing 12 to
15 posts a day so that pretty much
required me to be an expert on taxonomy
terminology where to find it how to find
it who was doing circle-jerk linking who
was doing spamming you know who was you
know doing redirects and get myself
really familiar with the variety of
different types of sexual expression
online and also see how they could be
blogged we we have a regular feature
that's called the sex blogger roundup
and what the sex blog roundup is it's
really cool because what it is is it's a
weekly installment where we do a post
that takes excerpts from sort of the
best of individual sex blogs and these
are sex blogs that our text usually no
photos in fact rarely photos if ever so
what we're concentrating on is is text
porn erotica basically erotic lit but
what's exciting about it is that it's
generally people's real-life experiences
as they're writing them down usually as
anonymous bloggers when I did this
weekly I had upwards of 200 text only
sex blogs written by individuals
worldwide in my RSS reader outside the
50 to 75 usual suspects of variety sex
blogs MSM news linked ups link dumps and
other sex news blogs every week I would
have to call for new blogs I had to read
them and add to my feeds more because
invariably a handful of sex bloggers who
are blogging anonymously
had to quit blogging meaning they were
for one reason or not another no longer
anonymous it was such a regular
occurrence I developed a pretty snarky
attitude toward the limited lifespan
anonymous sex blogger even though they
often offered up the juiciest and most
explicit posts about sex there are still
a lot of regular anonymous sex bloggers
who maintain their privacy but they're
extremely careful and very web savvy in
doing so although I know a number of
them outside their web personas from New
York to Alaska and to London London is
where I found the hot post of single
anonymous female sex blogger the loved
and respected girl with a one-track mind
when I visited London a few years back I
met the girl in the flesh and we had a
very good night of good old-fashioned
English drinking we went out to pubs and
we had a fabulous time what was really
interesting though was
the entire time that I was hanging out
with her and talking about trials and
tribulations of sex blogging blogging on
the internet blogging personal blogging
you know versus blogging private stuff
etc etc because on my personal blog I
blog about my own life as well she
refused to tell me her actual name the
entire evening we spent together she in
fact told me a pseudonym I thought that
was kind of interesting
she also picked my brain because she
really really wanted to be appalled the
published offer author she wanted a book
she wanted a book about her website she
wanted a book about her blog and a book
about her exploits which she got she
later to get that book deal named after
her blog and upon publication in August
of last year found herself ambushed
outside her London flat by paparazzi and
au K outed in the UK tabloids three days
after the book was published
she wrote I guess I was welled into a
false sense of security regarding my
anonymity because I knew that Belle de
Jour who is another an anonymous sex
blogger and also British was hounded by
the press and still managed to keep her
identity private well I may have a high
traffic blog and a book detailing my
sexual adventures in the shops I'm not a
prostitute like her so why I figured
would anyone really be interested in Who
I am
on the 2n 2000 anniversary of her outing
she recently blogged in retrospect I
could talk about how I was the
laughingstock at work everyone in the UK
film industry knowing and discussing the
most intimate details of my sex life she
worked on the Harry Potter films by the
way I could talk about how I had to go
into hiding and how for a week the
tabloids poked their long lens cameras
through my parents letterbox and rang
their doorbell and telephone constantly
making both me and my parents live in a
state of anxiety I could talk about how
profoundly I was affected by the
articles on me both in the media and
online I wanted to challenge the lies
misrepresentations and personal attacks
but couldn't I could talk about how I
wasn't made rich by the book and that
losing my film career as a result of it
made me worry that I wouldn't be able to
pay my rent I could talk about how my
friends were offered money to spilled
the dirt on me and people from my past
suddenly reappeared in my life making me
paranoid that I couldn't trust anyone
here's a picture of her she writes for
Guardian UK now I could talk about how
all my ex-lovers contacted me concerns
that I had disguised them fully all of
them now aware of my
previous hidden feelings about them I
could talk about how I then decided to
give online dating another go only to
discover that somehow every man had got
into conversation with ended up on a
date with knew that I was Abby Lee and
was a fan of the blog making me
immediately scamper in the other
direction because I felt so vulnerable I
could talk about how almost all the men
I've met and/or been intimate with have
asked me not to write about them even
when we've had no more than a pint
together I could talk in explicit detail
about all the hot or not sex I've had
but feel too exposed now that everyone
knows who I am and my friends colleagues
and acquaintances all read the blog I
could talk about all these things on the
blog if I were still anonymous but I'm
not my outing last year was a huge
strain on me and yes I have managed to
find a silver lining out of it but the
ability to freely do the one thing that
gave me such pleasure blogging has been
destroyed
take the anonymity away from a blogger
who depends on it and you get a blog
with no heart true sincerity and
authenticity about events people
thoughts and feelings rely on anonymity
I'll challenge anyone who says that
anonymity shouldn't matter when someone
is writing about their own lives it does
so I mean lighten the atmosphere for a
minute
[Laughter]
so active threats to sexual privacy
online well right now that would be the
US government so anyone here familiar
with 2257 laws or the child obscenity
Act a very small amount of people okay
great
in a nutshell 2257 refers to regulations
under the child protection and an
obscenity Enforcement Act of 1988 which
specifies record-keeping requirements
for those wishing to produce sexually
explicit media and imposes criminal
penalties for failure to comply this is
supposedly to ensure that no person
under the legal age is involved in porn
though is of course only pursued within
the realm of the perfectly legal adult
porn industry industry and applicable
only in the United States the
regulations are directed toward the
terms primary producer and secondary
producer oh and if you feel like reading
this is a 2257 statement on a Canadian
website it's kind of ironic don't you
think so the regulations are directed
toward the terms primary producer and
secondary producer this parts important
a premier producer is defined in the set
of rules as any person who actually
films videotapes photographs or
photographs a visual depiction of actual
sexually explicit conduct a secondary
producer is defined as any person who
produces assembles manufactures
publishes duplicates reproduces
reproduces or reissues a book magazine
periodical film videotape or other
matter intended for commercial
distribution that contains a visual
depiction of actual sexually explicit
conduct different record-keeping
requirements exist for primary versus
secondary producers one may be both a
primary and secondary producer not
surprisingly this has come under many
legal challenges as the definitions of
actual sexually explicit conduct and
secondary producer are vague perhaps
intentionally so just as the definition
of obscenity in the courts is left to
so-called community standards for
instance a fisting DVD may not be
considered obscene by San Francisco
community standards but it most
certainly would be in Laramie Wyoming
that's how obscenity that's how
obscenity is prosecuted in America on a
federal level at this point it's sort of
a blanket you know leaving it to
community standards letting the
community to decide what's obscene for
them or not but I believe that these
laws are intentionally
I believe that the wording about
sexually explicit conduct is
intentionally vague and I believe that
the the definition of sexually secondary
producer is intentionally vague as well
and I think that that's sort of mafia
style on the government side of things
to keep anyone who comes near a porn
image ever ensure if they're in
violation of the law and when recent
2257 record-keeping requirements came
down about a year and a half ago which
have been challenged about secondary
producers which is reposting the content
i got in this great conversation with a
friend of mine who runs a an erotic
online magazine which is primarily just
like non explicit pinup galleries and
covering sex events around the United
States and then articles about sex and
sexuality and sort of news briefs and
things like that and his boss made it
his job to go through every single image
that they had on the site and tried to
determine if each image was considered
sexually explicit conduct and I talked
him on the phone while he was going
through it and he was like I'm looking
at this picture of a girl's ass and I'm
like is that red from a sunburn or is it
red from a spanking so you see what
we're going through here now the idea of
having porn producers keep stringent
laws or keep stringent records is of
course a really good idea what's
unfortunate is that this is being
enforced in legitimate adult businesses
it's not being thought of or applied to
anything outside a legitimate adult
businesses and these you know mainstream
porn people who have these giant
companies and corporations like vivid
and wicked and stuff like that they want
to keep their businesses they're making
a lot of money of course they're gonna
follow the rules it's it's it's
ridiculous that they're raiding these
people and they're not really doing
anything else with this but what's
interesting about this to me sexual
privacy wise this poses a serious threat
sex workers and now you wouldn't think
about this but I have personal
experience with this at this point not
because I'm a sex worker but as a
blogger she looks pretty young doesn't
she
it's kind of creepy this is on her teen
website this is what she's using
for her 2257 documentation so if you
click her on her site for 2257
documentation this is what you get this
is why you'll start to see it's a pretty
serious threat people don't know what to
do and they're doing some really scary
things notably to porn performers an
extras in video and imagery the
government might consider sexually
explicit conduct for example more than
once for flesh BOTS and for my personal
blog porn creators you know and people
who make porn they they want you know
they're starting to get the Internet
right they want access to blogs they
want access to traffic and they also
want access to people like me who are
educators that will present their
material in context and to you know
promote their stuff
they'll sense you know do you want
images do you want a short clip and you
want the 2257 materials that go with
this to my alarm
I'm FedEx DVDs with scans of each
performers driver's license social
security cards image of images of them
holding their IDs and their social
security cards next to their faces
copies of their contracts and signatures
complete with current address and all
personal information like their true
names what's important to know is that
these performers have no idea this
information has been sent to me nor do
they know who I am and this business
practice is commonplace unfortunately
some admittedly low-grade sites I've
found allow surfers to click through and
see the photo IDs of the models I
believe we have yet to see the dark
ramifications of the privacy protections
these sex workers no longer have and a
quick google image search 2257 ID it's
right there you can find a lot more so
hey he's asking what types of searches
lead to things like this and all I did
well safe search off hello I know yeah
and there's a lot more like this that a
us-based but it was it was simply a
matter of safe search off going to
Google Image Search typing in 2257 ID
and I also found some when I went to 22
when I typed in 2257 proof this was on
page for the teen I think was on the
previous team was on page 2 so and this
is these findings are from a week ago
last Friday so I get a fresh one for you
next time hopefully not okay so what
else is interesting about sexual privacy
online and what sort of is posing a
threat or bringing up some interesting
questions 2.0 sites and understanding
what isn't isn't porn porn or not good
question these days don't you think
unfotunately some people are perfectly
fine with that
others are totally freaking out that
someone is having sexual thoughts about
their feet
without their express consent
nonetheless is it flickers role to
police these activities well it's a
really good question and brings into
play the changing cultural values and
judgments about what constitutes porn
acceptable use of images individuals
create and how they're seen by others
I'll argue that any foot fetishist
probably sexualizes feet on the bus in
the park or online the only difference
is that the online software is giving
the foot owners the access to see how
the people in the world around them
might see their feet now they know what
they otherwise wouldn't know and can't
control the notions of community
standards for porn or obscenity I
believe simply don't work in application
to worldwide data clusters social
networking sites have no idea where they
fall into 2257 regulations as to their
role to users and have been fumbling
blindly with the notions of community
standards with disastrous and
embarrassing results this was a direct
result of when or what Flickr has been
going through trying to work with the
German government around how they want
to police their internets so I am aware
that you had a talk here September 21st
by someone named Shelley Lubben oh no
that's sad
I really wanted to come it was a day
before my birthday oh I had some
questions for well I'll go for a couple
of her points because I think they're
really interesting and I think that they
were circulated to all of you as as fact
I you know one of my questions was just
if she could provide data or URLs for
any of the things that she was asserting
and
a good with her offered to you know find
help find fact and things like that
right like offered to go over a
presentation and find what things are
supported by even surveys or any sort of
data points and I guess that was a bit
intimidating and so she decided to quit
because she thought that that was too
hostile well it's a good point though so
you've got people like Shelley Lubben
out there running around right saying
how porn is bad and porn is evil and
she's getting a lot of access media like
to listen to people like her because she
says crazy things about porn and people
like O'Reilly Factor just eat this stuff
up you know for instance I'm the
frightening vizag Oh Shelley Lubben aka
porn star Roxie who was a performer ten
years ago and hasn't been involved in
the porn industry since so that's you
know kind of speaks to some of the
accuracy of her recent experience in
data one of the things she told you guys
was that 66% of porn performers are
infected with herpes the truth to that
is that one in five Americans are
infected and porn performers are no
different how do we know they're no
different well I talk with people like
Sharon Mitchell at aim aim is the adult
industry medical health care foundation
which was found as many years ago when
there was an HIV outbreak in the adult
industry and Sharon Mitchell was working
in the industry at the time and realized
that there was a serious need for sex
education in the porn industry there was
a need for accurate information about
STI STD and virus transmission and also
she wanted to set up basically a
standardized testing center where all
performers would go through the
standardized testing center get tested
be tested regularly and has worked very
closely with the mainstream adult
industry people which are the same
people being rated by the FBI to make
sure that their records are you know
that they're employing adults she works
closely with these companies and
everyone is on a 30-day regimen for
testing and they must provide their
30-day testing documentation in order to
perform on the day that they show up
they have to have the documentation with
they don't they can't fax it they can't
say I'll bring it later or anything like
that they have to have it and I'll also
add to that I've done a lot of work and
a lot of research and a lot of writing
about the type of testing the aims does
because I was really curious like 30
days for screening like you know
normally when one goes to get an HIV
test it's a three to six month window in
San Francisco and I was like how are
they doing this turnaround at 30 days
well it turns out they're using one of
the most advanced HIV tests that you can
get in the United States the PCR DNA
test so they're pretty on it one of the
things that are lovely Shelly also told
you guys was that women do not enjoy
making porn this plays into the myth
that women don't like sex wouldn't enjoy
sex out of the context of
heteronormative romantic relationships
or enjoy sport fucking porn performers
are not like the rest of us they're not
they like sex for sport they are
physically sexual athletes it's like
Cirque de Soleil sex
seriously they Bend in these crazy
positions like and they do it because
they like it people who don't like being
in the porn industry
leave the porn industry they don't stay
in it there's a constant amount of
people who are interested in getting
involved in the porn industry because
it's quick and easy money it's starting
to be a semi glamorous profession and
it's pretty regulated so there's a bit
of a safety net oh one of the other
safety nets I want a dimension to that
aim does is that every every new talent
that comes in every new model that's
girl/boy trans whatever comes through
and goes through a pre counseling
session before appearing in a video
where they sit down and they watch a
really kind of boring video that's long
and talks about STDs and getting tested
and what their tests are going to be
like and talked to them all about their
privacy and their confidentiality also
talks to them about the social
ramifications of getting involved in
working in porn and doing sex work also
talks about the counseling programs that
are available to them through aim if
they want to do any counselling or they
need anybody to talk to
and also aim has a transition program
for people who want to transition into
other types of work so they also help
people get other jobs if they decide
they don't want to do porn anymore one
of the things that miss Levin also said
which is a very commonly asserted myth
porn stars are victims of child abuse
and sexual abuse including early
exposure to pornography
as it as you probably have heard there
is no single unbiased study that bears
this assertion out it's another shameful
myth perpetuated about sex workers the
minute I find a study the minute I find
a study that bears anything about this
out I will most certainly publish it on
my website the only thing the only
things that I've come that I've come
across that are close to making this
assertion based on polls or anything
like that come from Christian
organizations so they have an agenda
another thing that she only talked about
was that approximately 10 percent porn
performers are currently infected with
HIV and that goes with her 66 percent of
porn performers being infected you know
the dirty shameful myth about how
they're all gross and dirty and
spreading disease and stuff Shelly
doesn't have access to those statistics
she doesn't have access to aim
statistics because they're confidential
one of the other funny things she said I
love this no other industry has more
suicide related deaths than the porn
industry according to according to the
Association of psychologists and
psychiatrists health care professionals
doctors and dentists have the highest
suicide rate also EMTs and nurses
followed by food assembly and
preparation personnel that would be
people in working in slaughterhouses
actually
[Laughter]
what's important to know is why people
like Shelley want to come and talk to
you and why they want to talk to
everybody about why this is all dirty
and bad and evil and how we need to
close off the Internet's so people can't
you know for the kids which you know
whenever people say that they're doing
things for the children it's always a
foil for some other agenda and you
should always see it as a red flag as
far as I'm concerned Shelley Lubben is
an active proponent of Utah's CPA D
legislation which states at essence
anybody providing open wireless access
that a miner uses to access pornography
will be subject to a fine repeated
violations are subject to criminal
and/or civil prosecution now part of my
talk I was going to go on the Internet's
and show you the man behind CPA D
legislation is a guy named Ralph P ro
and you might want to check him out
check out his Wikipedia page I mean as
as updated and accurate as Wikipedia is
it still has interesting information
about him and about his CPA D
legislation which is you know poor 80
the most recent version of the CPI D
legislation was signed off and publicly
endorsed by the governor of Utah so
that's something y'all want to check out
and keep in mind so the question is
right what do we do how do we talk about
this what are our next steps as a sex
educator I think that it's a case of
informed risk and harm reduction as
anyone aware of what inform risk or harm
reduction is a sex that sends a couple
people don't be don't be embarrassed I
think that for everyone
sexual privacy and sexual access to non
biased non-judgmental information should
be seen as a case to inform risk and an
attempted harm reduction just like was
safer sex
simply put harm reduction is a
progressive approach to Public Health
which takes into account that people are
going to engage in risky behaviors even
if they know better or not unprotected
sex drug use and I'd like to add sex in
the Internet harm reduction attempts to
mitigate risks and dangers by creating
alternatives some things that harm
reduction has done is rather than just
say no or don't drive drive drunk harm
reduction creates designated driver
campaigns and controversial initiative
like the provision of condoms in public
schools and needle exchange programs so
here's another fun picture from Pride
opponents countered that harm reduction
condones unsafe activities I think with
sex online and particularly with poor
and it's more extreme because pervasive
cultural attitudes are still so deeply
anti sex and sex negative sexual
interest is considered immoral in both
media and government so I think it's now
become sort of I don't know a pet
project of mine or at least a civic duty
to try and tell people how to protect
their sexual privacy privacy because I
think it's the most vulnerable kind at
this point of a huge safer porn
stripping page on my website for that
very reason users need to know basics
about protecting their identity and I
think online businesses should educate
their users in a non biased way and it's
getting pretty urgent for them to do so
at the very least there are basic
general privacy guidelines that anyone
should know about basic safety
precautions right up there with always
use Lube for and all sex so people are
going to do uninformed and sometimes
dumb things with their sexual privacy on
the Internet as I said earlier knowing
the risks the horny surfer will still
click a risky link to get off or because
they're curious or get themselves in
shady or dangerous situations because
they lack community or information and
even more so since the barriers to
Internet access and making online
content becomes less and lower every day
those were the cops at pride there's the
user again and thank you
thanks for listening I don't know if we
have time for questions or all right so
I've got a microphone here
the Utah legislation that you brought up
made me wonder about something that I've
only ever heard sort of rumors and myths
about when you have an international
community website like any kind of
blogging or like journal or something
like that then really like do you know
whose jurisdiction things that are
posted there come under is that who's
hosting the site or is it where they're
reading it and here I mean prosecuting
the people who are giving the Wi-Fi
seems a little bizarre to me
definitely prosecuting people providing
Wi-Fi seems extremely bizarre and I
think that it speaks to the ignorance of
the legislators when you start to talk
about sex sexual privacy and sexual
activity online pretty much all doors
shut when it comes to legislation unless
you talk about something that you're
doing to save the children
the important point that you brought up
is where exactly do social sites fall
where do where do things like
livejournal fall you know how do these
how are these companies where do they
fit how are they going to deal with this
right now nobody knows and they're all
sort of trying to figure it out on their
own and I don't think there's an answer
to that yet unfortunately so 2257 may
not bother the big professional
pornographers but it can be a big hassle
for social networks for the site's
anything with user-submitted contents
what they think is going to happen in
that area that's a really interesting
question because social networking sites
some of them have wondered audibly and
not whether they fall under 2257
secondary producer content content
restrictions I don't know if some of you
remember tribe net but tribe met a
couple years ago for whatever their
reasons decided to start voluntarily
applying 2257 regulations to their users
on their social networking site and they
did so in with a lot of blanket so
the tribe bubble-wrap fetish which was
really just about bubble wrap was
suddenly marked as a mature tribe
pissing off the users and it also made
users who had adult site had adult
tribes you know which are basically
places where people could cluster and
sort of talk about their interests
suddenly they were told directly that
they are going to be held responsible
for 2257 documentation for everything
within their tribes basically everybody
fled tribe and it was the downfall of
that site it's now trying to resurrect
itself again but it didn't work out very
well for them so where do they fall
that's a really good question did I
answer all of that ok so um you were
talking about how when you were
maintaining the site it was Harper you
do get up-to-date on all the different
language available that's community
specific and I'm wondering I think will
be also challenging for someone who is
realizing they want to become part of a
community to figure out what the
appropriate language is especially if
there's not any local influence what do
you think I guess what do you think the
development for that will be what you
think the future of that is how do you
think that can be made easier I think
that making the development of that and
making that easier it's definitely going
to be the lowest entry level access that
people can get to information about
things like this so keeping something
like Wikipedia up-to-date would be
really really helpful and I would love
to see more sex educators get involved
in keeping Wikipedia up to date at least
just with the you know with the terms
and everything that everyone is using
and write and speak more about you know
how people are self labeling their
gender what's acceptable and what's not
and and also what I'd like to see added
to that too is it's sort of some some
guidelines to people who do have sexual
fetishes and sort of may need some
guidelines about how they would behave
online as well one of the things that
came up when I was taking a look at the
the whole feet thing and people being
upset about the feet thing on Flickr was
that some people who were some of the
foot fetishists where we're essentially
adding themselves by leaving really
inappropriate comments you know and so
there needs to be some language out
there that's you know as accessible to
everyone as possible about that I think
that having sites network sites that do
indexing in particular having them
network with community liaisons people
who are working working actively you
know with peer-to-peer counseling and
frontline counseling likes visi org and
organizations like that and you know
even community health clinics to just
sort of keep up with you know what
people are calling themselves you know
and also you know even sort of graphing
like what sort of the urgent interests
are at this point as well so keeping it
as low low entry level as possible like
Wikipedia basically I'm trying to keep
it up to date I'm through your
presentation you're using the words
anonymous and private more or less
interchangeably but they're there your
concepts yes right Rome so what do you
think is more important to people
searching for accurate sex information
or for porn what's more important and an
enmity or privacy well I don't think
that I could choose either one because I
can't speak for the majority of users
and I would also say that the majority
of users could confuse the two terms I
think that there is a tacit I I think
that users tacitly think that when
they're online they just are anonymous
they don't know that they need to go
uncheck things they don't need to you
know they don't know that they need to
erase their search history they don't
you know the the new user doesn't know
about cache and cookies and things like
that so I think that I mean we're
talking about people who are just
figuring a lot of the stuff out they
don't need you know they don't know that
shopping at an online sex store you know
well the sex store may you know can like
guarantee their privacy in terms of
shipping and packaging may not
necessarily guarantee their anonymity
when it comes to selling their info to
third parties so I think that there's a
lot of confusion between the two terms
and as far as choosing which one is more
important
I would say that on a cultural value
level anonymity because it allows people
the freedom to figure out and look for
and explore and trying to understand who
they are more and but I think that
privacy is a more would be the more
physical urgent thing because privacy is
the way that people get found out it's
the way that people get outed it's the
way that they can be tracked it's the
way that they can be harassed stopped
humiliated lose their jobs etc etc so
back back to the 2257 searches were the
are the paths to those to that content
primarily through image search or are
they and not so much through other other
search entry points so if I you know if
I search for 2257 on a on google.com
website
that's correct it was just the image
search that led to the direct files
although I've also randomly found
websites that are like here's our 2257
info for each girl and the girl with
their IDs and I'm like oh so this is
back at the very beginning um you're
talking about how you basically you know
did a search through Craigslist I was
just really curious do you have or do
you have like an easily remember well
link to um what the actual breakdown is
oh when I was dating mining yeah like
what do people mostly look for other you
know what um it's a Google spreadsheet
and it's public so although I'll get as
soon as I'm done I'll put it on my on my
site and it's and it's it's local data
and then the beginnings of me starting
to do the national data and then get
to-- I got totally freaked out about
people having sex with dogs in Texas so
I stopped for a while
because it was like a lot of them and I
was like oh this isn't gonna be a good
article for The Chronicle
how can I know but yeah it's a it's a
Google Doc yeah Google Docs in its
public cuz I think that and you know as
I add you know go back and add more
information it's fun to have people sort
of like watch it grow and change and
email me about you know different stuff
so anybody else yeah thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
