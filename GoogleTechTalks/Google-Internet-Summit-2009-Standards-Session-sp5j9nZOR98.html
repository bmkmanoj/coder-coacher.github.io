into another angle and all of our
discussions and that's standards which
implicitly been part of our discussion
but not so explicitly so okay sure so
I've asked i vas tejeda bharat who is
responsible for managing then sort of
overseeing what's happening in the
standards world for us to manage
organize and manage this session so they
hate I'll turn this over to you to get
started okay thanks mint can we have the
slides
so standards are at the core of the
internet and a reason why we as Google
exists we depend on the standards that
make the internet work and standards
provide the platform on which we as
Google innovate and what enables us to
deliver one service everywhere around
the world and so if you were surprised
to see standards on the agenda today and
the condolences from the middle of the
room there um you know you probably
right they do tend to get overlooked as
part of the plumbing and maybe because
we take them for granted standards are
not what makes the headlines and so it's
very often that nobody talks about
standards unless something breaks they
develop through active collaborative
communication between experts in the
field from researchers educators
communications between a network
operators internet vendors and typically
the issues are raised and resolve
without users of the technology being
aware and today we have a panel that
have worked very closely addressing the
challenges going ahead that will make
the internet simply continue to work so
we and others can continue to innovate
and allow an even greater growth than
we've seen in the last decade our
panelists between them we just learned
in the break here actually only just
between two of them have over 80 years
of experience in the standards
development and we'll start with an
overview with of the standards well
followed by a quick look at google's
participation in standards development
and then three of our experts will
highlight key areas dinner idn and ipv6
three issues that have already been
discussed earlier today just very
lightly and and these are areas where
Google is active and they're significant
to healthy and open Internet of the
future so with that let me
introduce John so sorry not John Tony
you go confuse there so I actually got
bios for my speakers and decided to
create cloud tags for them because there
was so much information such great
accomplishments that I just wanted you
two to have a few minutes to look at
these tag tag clouds well oh that's an
artifact of the way colors are displayed
this is a great it's a great app on the
web called word LEDs which I used to
create these slides cool oh um anyhow um
you know a friend events and been around
actually there's three white beard no
four white birds do we have here so
there's just a couple of slides here
what I called why where what of network
ICT the term ICT is increasingly used
today so it's sort of to describe
information communications technology so
you know for lack of a better name of
sort of packaging all this stuff up and
this one is to answer the question why
we subject ourselves to this so the
second slide is really the Big E which
is sort of what this sort of echo system
looks like today right I thought I'd do
this by you know I had to proceeded to
say you know
we subject ourselves to this and it
seemed to me that everything falls into
these categories which is what I call
legal system instrumentalities so one of
them is you know police public
infrastructure requirements especially
relating the cyber security and are all
kinds of mandates that are typically
associated with that to affect services
required by governments and citizens so
there's a lot of this stuff that ends up
being mandated for one reason or another
and then there's promoting competition
something near and dear to to Google's
heart contractual compliance and
liability mitigation which is something
that's sort of in everyday use in terms
of you know relationships between
different commercial players they're
used in conjunction with with the
contracts that are involved and also in
this category as actually many IETF sort
of realized at one point is avoiding
restrictive intellectual-property claims
and so those are a set of things which
is you can I think conveniently put
under the rubric of legal system
instrumentality system why one does
standards the other big category is
enterprise and national regional
strategies and this is the first Big E
is creating large marketplaces and
platforms for innovation which again
would I think be one that would be near
and dear to the Google's heart and then
the second one is what I call
implementing or parenthetically
preventing sustainable competitive
advantages so if you want to create if
you're a company and you want to
basically take your your pride and joy
in the in terms of your specifications
and infuse them into the right standards
for a as as standards for the rest of
the world to use that's that's a that's
a way to do it the or preventing thing
is a little when I worked for sprint
sprint actually joined a bunch of
standards bodies for the sole reason of
watching what AT&amp;amp;T was doing in fact I
think MC I had the same problem with
respect to the our box so that's it
that's why we said yeah so Tony one
thing that's missing from this picture
is the word interoperability and for me
that's probably one of the most
important motivations for creating and
using standards does that fit here is
that the part of the creating large
marketplaces and platforms for
innovation is that where you would
capture that notion or does it belong
somewhere else in this list it's
probably several places one is promoting
competition and the other is a mandate
for public infrastructure I say
especially cybersecurity but
interoperability is the other one that's
classically associated with public
infrastructure if you look at you know
any of these bodies like I tu that's
been around for 150 years they've got it
in their charter that's the reason they
exist is to promote interoperability so
the next one is kind of the fun one this
is a kind of a classic you are what you
eat and obviously we all I have
participated or followed lots of
standards bodies over our careers I
perhaps have been fortunate or
unfortunate to probably participate in
more than than many and in fact this
it was actually done in the early 1980s
when I was at the FCC and in the Office
of Science and Technology we're trying
to understand what was out there in the
terms terms of standards bodies and one
of my jobs on the side was sort of
follow what was going on so this was my
kind of cheat sheet which became
subsequently institutionalized in
various other lives like publishing
telecommunications magazine or being at
the IT or whatever and it sort of grew
and became ever more complicated this is
a somewhat simplified version the last
of the really complex versions was done
in 1994 and I sort of gave up it just
became too complicated and in fact one
of the problems here is each one each
one of those major bubbles has all kinds
of sub bubbles and sublet bubbles it's
basically a tree of different groups and
there's a kind of a backplane in which
they they're all connected together in
various complex ways so depicting that
is very very difficult but what I tried
to do here is organized this in several
ways one is sure you can read this oh
yeah yeah it's true down here by
literally so trend one rise of the
specialized forms followed by some
convergence so I think what's happened
since 1994 is there's been a
proliferation of these and then a
convergence over the last several years
and that's a subject of long discussion
but one is what i would call is
yeah so that's a typical domestic
cluster so it's basically these these
one can call them bottom feeders to the
International to the the major
international organizations and the kind
of one of the classics is at us this was
a confessor when I was at the FCC we
actually created at us which was
probably it which made sense at the time
because its role was actually to open up
the ss7 infrastructure right right so
then they needed something to basically
to open up that process and it was made
very open anyone could go anyone could
participate anyone could follow you know
the standards were freely available and
their mission in life was basically the
FCC told them thou shalt create open
network standards for the ss7
infrastructure yep with your graph
doesn't show is the funny quasi industry
role for example when you were making
the slide in the mid 1990s the answer
was that cablelabs was far less
important than at homes like lab and
that is in fact at home was giving the
Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval for
the industry not CableLabs or anybody
else um that's declined somewhat i think
but i wonder how much that plays a role
in the ecosystem here whether they just
sort of occasionally pop up or do they
come back and go away yeah yeah because
they have become important for the
entire industry and very cleverly the
guy who
yeah the guy who headed CableLabs dick
Green is had an international vision and
he like cut a deal behind the scenes
with etsy to have etsy blessed CableLabs
standards so that whatever they did
effectively became global standards in
fact he also went into the itu-t shared
the group that dealt with cable
standards and said well just blessed
cable lab standards so they have very
cleverly basically you know engaged in
this strategy of achieving global
dominance which has been helped by the
fact that the cable industry basically
funds full-time engineers to help
develop the standards and they didn't
make the mistake of you know not making
them available you can download all
their standards you know on their
website so they didn't say sort of did
all the right things and Etsy and the
3gpp group sort of did the same clever
kinds of things after getting beat up
they saw the hint and the stuff that
vent and I were doing in the early 90s
you know with respect to evangelizing
the availability of open standards they
finally got it started doing it and as a
result 3gpp is one of the really major
playing grounds these days for mobile
standards they have meetings every
couple months hundreds of people
hundreds of documents and they've even
spun off the IMS forum so you know stuff
is split between that venue now and 3gpp
even the doc
since I think it disrupt probably the
latter I think that this the interesting
game and it's sort of like the last
slide you know what are the meta issues
it revolves around cyber security so I
think that's going to be a significant
disruptor the other one interestingly
enough is still believe it or not this
issue of open availability of standards
you know SC is ofc 27 in which is you
know security and cyber security is
meeting in Beijing right now does anyone
have any idea what documents exist at
that meaning they're almost impossible
to get even if you're a part of the
process it's just horrendous and then
they turn out these standards and they
sell them you know for 500 bucks a pop
to take a look at them and you know most
of them you know frankly probably suck
and so you know they're putting
themselves out of business so that's
that still remains kind of a disrupter
there's another disrupter that I sort of
get to at the end to which is
interesting there you know the one is
the availability of standards the other
is availability of the registration and
the information at in the extensions and
stuff that's created by standards and I
think that's going to be an overtime in
the next couple of years a big disrupter
as well it's and I you know I'm sort of
proud to say that actually both I can in
terms of running I Anna these days as
well as the ITU tease tsb have been
playing a leading role there in
implementing systems in which you can
basically get real-time access to the
you know registration information I
think that's going to be important from
a cyber security standpoint as well so
but the in terms of the grouping the
size is a variable I've tried to
approximately locate these things in in
clusters of subject matter and how they
deal with each other the down in the
lower left hand corner is sort of a
gaggle of what I would call the forums
and I've got some of them on there TM
for a multi-service forum CA b form I've
got some domestic ones that are
effectively our international like miss
a lot of nyssa security standards are
pretty much international standards
these days there's a DHS mitre standards
which are important for cybersecurity
Liberty open group is always and then I
you know there's and then these domestic
clusters are its intended to sort of
point out that there is so there's these
clusters in most major countries of kind
of mirror organizations that have
relationships with these with at least
the the bigger international ones so x
and then last but not least you notice
the big circle i have here app
development forums I think that's
another really interesting phenomena
over the last 15 years it was sort of
started I think it you know it's son by
some of the stuff you know Eric did
Microsoft the private companies that
were big enough to really control sort
of major major pieces of the marketplace
effectively made their standards open
and and created a application
development communities even for example
RSA RSA some of the key security
standards are still are open but there's
still RSA standards
gonzalo channel you from the floor NGM
and IMS strike me as being inimical to a
lot of what the internet tries to do but
I could be wrong about that would you
care to opine on the risk factors
associated with ngn and IMS and you know
how effective is this activity home
potentially disruptive can it be if it's
a serious problem is there anything we
can do to counter it I if I were Google
I would yeah yeah I know the inner well
they are a serious factor in the i.t of
EG the itu-t today the biggest group is
study group 13 which is in Jin the
engine forum is actually a kind of a
little sideshow of where some of them
some of the engine folks play most of
the real ngn work and these this would
be like a sub bubble goes on in it
actually started in its eat I spam and
then the itu-t split up study group 13
Addis now at the US domestic level is
mainly a significantly less
significantly oriented around ngn so
there's this whole engine community of
standards bodies and they have a
somewhat different view of the world
that they're trying to sell as the
security solution absolutely
um it's being sold as a combination of
standards and relationships amongst
Indian companies and I thought that one
of the weather really neat things was a
document that's actually forcing its way
from addis to study group 13 as we speak
that defines what a service provider
identifier is there were service
provider identity actually and one of
these it was sort of divided into three
pieces you're in the club or outside of
the club or you're an app developer and
so I sent a note to these guys I said
what's this in the club and who
determines that no answer but I think it
epitomizes if you will the mindset and
the potential problem well I agree about
the mindset a lot of what we've also
been seeing from the quote ngn community
is a tremendous amount of Internet
applications on ng n bass and a
tremendous amount of well let's say the
sounds of dinah the sounds dinosaurs
make when talking about circuits and the
old vocabularies about well that was a
nice network for research purposes but
now we need to grow up and become the
the real data network again and the
things you two going on in that
vocabulary ah are thinly disguised OSI
from when OSI was a thing and I see this
as either a rather rather different
threat or or not wanting to be standing
next dinosaur when he finally realized
or extinct or whatever other vocabulary
want to use and at least from my
standpoint the question would be how can
that extinction process be sped up well
it's if you know i'll say i span
multiple communities and i understand
the anticipate on the other hand these
guys have survived you know this this
major cosmic disaster right so they're
still there and there are a lot fewer
ISPs so these guys now in a way are in
an enhanced position as survivors so
that if you will the threat ought to be
be taken seriously and believe it or not
they got tons of bucks spent in lobbying
in Washington and in in very clever
strategies to dominate a lot of the four
but I would say the example John is not
OSI per se because OSI could be argued
to be sort of new relatives ample is and
I can I was at the FCC when the our box
in AT&amp;amp;T brought in the intelligent
network in the intelligent network was
supposed to be the sort of the original
cloud right and everything was supposed
to be in that cloud and the FCC in 1985
came out with computer in three and said
okay if you're going to head down this
path these are going to be the rules of
the road it's going to be it's going to
have to be in open infrastructure with
no anti-competitive hooks and that's
what computer three mandated I know it
well because I actually floated the memo
in the FCC and wrote that portion of the
notice of proposed rulemaking and then
it sort of oversaw the process I see
history simply repeating itself
and I think there needs to be a an
effective strategy to ensure that a
closed model for this stuff doesn't
become the norm well that that's exactly
my concern and I have much more much
more fear than I do animosity but I was
wondering about your thoughts as to how
to make one switch is suggests that
happen um that's a that's a fairly
lengthy discussion and some of it's
starting to happen instead of the
Washington dialogue with the network
neutrality stuff in fact in many ways
that it's reminiscent of the concerns
that were expressed when the whole
intelligent network thing was floated in
the early 80s and but there is so much
of this going on all over the world in
all these major fora and last but not
least Korea and China participate as
significantly in these four and they
have an enormous amount of economic
power and so that's going to be a
significant driver as well okay Marion
of you then what I'm ahead I go ahead I
was I was floating intelligent network
for northern telecom in the early
eighties and the really i think is an
essential difference namely that was an
attempt by us and the other telephone
companies to grab computing away from
user own data centers and later desktop
computers where is this the computer
companies to the class of like out
computing or sort of peers of the users
they're not part of the network
infrastructure in the sense of AT&amp;amp;T MCI
etc oh I don't disagree but I'm saying
their vision of cloud computing would be
somewhat different it would be the n GN
cloud in which they basically
they perform all the applications inside
of their infrastructure right and let me
suggest that I want to have this
discussion but I want to have it after
with the other people who had a chance
to speak what I'm very interested in
doing is understanding much more fully
the risk and the threat and whether we
can do something about it because I'll
be damned if I want those dinosaurs to
take over control of the internet is not
acceptable okay let me flip to the last
slide two minutes yeah okay this is not
all inclusive it's some of the things
that I've been source either I see as
major developments I'm spending a lot of
time I one is cybersecurity and part of
that is infrastructure based
capabilities in which incidentally i
would put things like EV certs which I
mentioned forensics and vulnerability
acquisition analysis and exchange
capabilities and there's the
infrastructure protection Li routine
data network management whatever you
think about Li or retain data stuff if
you're in Europe that's a major
directive if profoundly affects the
network infrastructure and you got to be
compliant but how that's implemented I
think we'll you know you do variables
and there can be different different
differences and I don't know why i put
responsive measures I that's a I can't
figure that out persistent flexible
global trust anchors I think is a is a
made a challenge that we haven't sort of
figured out entirely but it's going to
become really important as the Internet
scales globally and ubiquitously the CA
B forum people are trying to deal with
this on a day-to-day basis with you know
who can issue an EV cert and what
happens when things go wrong you got the
same problem with cyber forensics you
know who those forensics and
vulnerabilities can be shared with manda
what basis and and
that's all time-dependent you know your
friends today may not be your friends to
10 years from now or what happens 100
years from now I think we need to
increasingly think in those kinds of
time scales my personal pet thing is I
discussed already in his vet knows from
some sort of our joint exploits in the
beginning in the early 90s is this real
time access to standards and related
registrations is important and the last
one I think is important because you
know going forward we need to I think
think increasingly think of this in
terms of a world of a China centric
Internet of the you know if you
extrapolate on all the variables it
doesn't take very long to to get to a
state where you know that you know from
either in economic or physical presence
or users or whatever kind of measurement
you want to use China plays a dominant
dominant role I know certainly for my
son who's based in Nanjing he's uh you
know he lives it in a in a china
internet world and it's its robust but
it has kind of different dynamics and
one of the I think more disconcerting
things I see in the US and the West is
there's very little if any appreciation
of that so that's thanks Tony I can just
a note to my other panelists that that
was not seven minutes
so as Lynn said earlier I work in the
research organization at Google and on
coordinating and leading our standards
efforts and this is my bio up there my
focus area has been on document
standards also represent Google at the
insights executive board and Oasis as
well so here's a list of some of the
standards that we participate in at
Google it's kind of hard to represent
Walter standards on a slide but I don't
think this is by any means complete but
they're very importance is to google
especially open standards as we're
strong proponents of openness on the
internet and that's also what enables
interoperability and the innovation that
drives google so some of the standards
have a direct impact on how we deliver
our service and getting a standard in
place is very important as much as
getting code right and that's something
that certainly event I know has been a
strong proponent in Google and driving
that message here we have a lot of
active Google is participating and we've
been collecting information about where
the work is happening so as we go
through the slides I'll give you
reference points especially for the
Googlers of where you can go but we
would love to know more if there's
anything missing in our information so
much of the work that's carried out is
actually in the various committees and
as I started to learn more about the
various standards committees and
attending something like the idea of
meetings I also learned that it just
takes a lot of time a lot of challenges
and a lot of people some money just the
conversation that is happening
here over the break was travel just as
an amazing amount to travel between
participants in the standards world and
also lots of disagreements as well and
just as in google we have intellectually
stimulating conversations where people
need to defend their position those are
the same conversations that happen in
the standard world and the internet
standards have a really direct impact on
the way the internet involves and we
really want to make sure that Google is
an integral part of that so this next
slide is shows us our participation and
the larger bubbles are actually the
working groups and also people so it's a
good correlation between how many people
and the activities and you can see that
both the ITF and w3c and JCP are the
largest ones there and then some of the
smaller organizations have maybe one or
two people participating so you can see
with w3c their goal is to through pursue
its mission through the creation of web
standards and guidelines and the goal of
the ITF is to make the internet better
and you can see the sort of strong focus
there's also work happening in some of
the relatively newer organizations like
opeth social open web open ID and do it
Clinton as doing a great job leading
that over in Google Earth and Google
Maps so the open geospatial consortium
and Kronus group so KML 2.2 was formally
announced as a ogc standard on April 13
2008 and in the Cronus group we're
actually working with colada which is a
3d xml file standard and of course new
areas such as health where the focus
there is nina medical record standards
and in transport and or
automotive and then some of the
organization's you might be familiar
with like I Triple E I IC and Unicode
consortium so mark davis is a very
strong representative for google in that
area so i mentioned ITF as the largest
one here's a bunch of working groups
that we participate in and actually went
is a chair on the I DNA base
international domain names working group
and works in there with a bunch of
Googlers including harrell alpha strong
who actually is the google lead for IETF
and it's a interesting organization in
that my involvement with ITF just
started about a year and a half ago and
I was very pleased to see how open and
how collaborative the group is the and
all the communication happens they are
through email and not just face-to-face
meetings although the meetings help fund
the organization everything and anything
is publicly available within the ITF and
with IPR anyone come and implement
anyone can see the basis of the
discussion and nothing is really secret
much of what happens there is also
available and under you know fair
equitable r and IPR policy so we'll be
covering the ipv6 that Eric will be
talking about and that happens with an
ATF and the DNS work that John cleansing
is working on is also within the ATF and
here's a bunch of standards that were
active in in w3c HTML Ian Hickson is our
key lead there for Google and he pretty
much says hTML is the web and so that's
his kind of tag
mine and accessibility is another one
that kind of runs although this is
featured here in w3c there are working
groups over at ISO Oasis and a bunch of
other organizations and many of these
are not working in isolation they do
actually work and collaborate across the
different groups so this is for Googlers
to go to go standards this is where all
the information is we've been collecting
this for some time and I don't think
this will ever be complete so please
help us keep that up to date and I also
talked to the various product teams just
to try and map for standards alongside
the products and asking the Google Apps
team what standards are important and so
here's a cloud tag that showed up
OpenSocial HTML Oh auth open ID feature
very highly as well as you know the
expected ones such as CSS and there's
JavaScript an atom publishing so with
that let me pass over to John Clinton
who will talk about his work over at the
ITF
sorry well you did send me very large
bio hi I'm I'm John cleansing and the
paraphrase other people today I've done
some stuff over the years I refer you to
the previous slide I'm going to talk a
little bit today about the process of
internationalizing domain name system
dns was was originally defined in terms
of taking any string of architects as a
name but that tech that that approach
and that capability has rarely been used
in practice and the protocols suggest a
preferred form for names and that
preferred form basically consists of
ASCII letters and digits in the hyphen
with some additional restrictions one of
the things I've discovered over the
years as one looks at these things there
are two types of standards projects uh
there are those that are basically
engineering with technology targets in
this area in which this agreement about
the problem focus on usability by
somebody and focus on consistently
well-defined results those are the easy
ones there may be disagreements but we
have criteria for trying to resolve
those disagreements we also have ones in
which the major issues turn into culture
and language as an environment and
standardization is extremely difficult
the NSS internationalisation falls into
that space which I'll talk a little bit
more about in a few minutes and then
we've got a third group which is
sometimes indistinguishable in the
second where what goes on is mostly
about political posturing and politics
and standards work in that
works very very badly because there are
no agreed criteria for when one is
finished or when one is successful when
would you move on ah the DNS
internationalisation work follows that
second bottle if not and sometimes it
feels like the third as I said earlier
the domain name system itself has always
been eight bits but the applications
from long before there was a domain name
system have imposed ascii restrictions
the DNS has a ski specific matching
rules in spite of the fact that it's
normally arc tets there's a funny rule
and the funny rule says that if the
octet has the leading zero the leading
bit as zero ah then the assumption is
that it's an ascii character and if it's
gets matched to the servers in a case
independent way and if leading bit is
one it isn't there's no definition
specification of what isn't means and it
means that as one starts looking at
characters outside the esky undecorated
latin character set matching rules
become difficult in the dns doesn't know
anything about it as we try to look at
the domain name system and trying to
figure out how to make it more adaptable
to languages and scripts besides ascii
and maybe english we've discovered
there's disagreement about what the
problem is if the domain name system is
actually about network identifier
network facing identifier is identifies
four things on the network then the
names themselves aren't names their
protocol identifiers and
internationalisation doesn't make any
sense and should be done somewhere else
we keep coming back to that one the
second possibility is that this is
really about mnemonics for things and
mnemonics in non-ascii scripts make a
lot of sense because you ought to be
able to write your mnemonics in your own
language more or less and the third
possibility is really about cultural
elements and language becomes very
important and
spellings become very important and all
sorts of other things become very
important and that problem is not
resolvable but that doesn't mean that
people don't want to resolve it DNS is
just hopeless the other conflict about
this all the way along was whether it go
for a very quick solution whatever quick
means versus trying to make a solution
which was compatible with long term
architecture of a decent identifier
system in different language that's the
difference between grafting some
internationalization stuff onto a
basically a ski domain name system
versus internationalising domain name
system we chose the first it's an
architectural disastrous decision but
possibly the right thing to do because
there are cultural issues in this or
perceived cultural issues in this and
the people who see the cultural issues
don't want to believe that there are any
other possible ways of looking at this
when trade-off decisions or engineering
decisions are made those decisions make
people passionately unhappy some of
those decisions are seen as
international conspiracies against
particular languages or groups we've
often said that sometimes the best
solution is one which makes everybody
equally unhappy in this particular
situation that doesn't work everybody
believes if they get to be more unhappy
than anybody else so we end up with
unrealistic expectations people pretend
they like to write the great novel in
their language and DNS labels and they
want to use very precise language and
very precise terminology and they would
have arguments about semantics they want
to do language sensitive matching and
culturally local language sensitive
matching if the spelling rules differ
from my country your country then the
DNS should match those things or not
match those things depending on how I
feel about your country if you don't
know how to make that work from an
engineering standpoint you're beginning
to understand the problems with
facing here so we end up making choices
of a least rotten technology there are
no good solutions the decisions which
were made optimized for minimum
disruption and rapid deployment the
people argued for this technique assumed
that we would have Universal ITN's two
years after the standard was written
well let's see that would have made it
92 2005 it's past that there are new
excuses one of the things which gets
laid on top of this is people who will
stand up and say the reason why we don't
have the internet widely deployed in my
country is because we don't have good
enough ID ends or we don't have
top-level idns or we can't spell
properly in ideas yet what their excuse
will be when they get that I don't know
but I'm sure there will be one and as a
consequence of those decisions all of
this work gets done in the applications
and not in the DNS decisions which were
made 2002 2003 listen a whole work was
going to be done in the applications
that nearly any Unicode character in
Unicode 3.2 is going to be permitted
that we're going to solve problems by
mapping many characters into other
characters at the applications layer the
rules are based upon some Unicode
operations but ultimately the tables are
unique to I DNA a uniquely this
particular standard that means that if
you have a set of rules which deal with
Unicode elsewhere your application those
rules are guaranteed to be different
than the rules used for ideas once one
gets through doing that particular
mapping process which in it in in the
process legitimize characters which
could not be typed on terminals anywhere
in the world because they map did
something else which may be good
legitimized simples line drawing
characters punctuation dingbats
we ended up with things that don't
display consistently across the world
which cannot be tight consistently
across the world valid in domain names
sort of once one gets to those strings
the result is mapped into an ASCII
compatible form which looks like to the
DNS like letters digits and a high phone
or two and the assumption is that that's
a good idea because I upgraded
applications think it's an ordinary
domain name label and then you end up
with a bunch of rules that have to about
how it's going to be displayed and the
other interesting decision about that
display process is the rules ignored
every operating system I know of from
both legs forward in most of our
languages and operating systems if you
want something displayed you call a
routine and you say display this and the
routine does not come back to you and
say I have no way of representing that
particular character because it doesn't
know but the assumption was that we
could take these things in and convert
them back to something which wasn't
necessarily what the user typed and pass
it out to the screen and have it
rendered maybe all of this had cemented
unanticipated effects one of the
unanticipated effects in addition that
bad assumption about operating systems
is that when you move from worrying
about circa 90 characters to circa a
hundred thousands a lot more things look
like a lot of other things and bad guys
figure that out she so the people who
develop the applications decided they
had to protect their users from this
nonsense and naturally enough they
overreacted so now we've got a layer on
top of the protocol which starts
applications web browsers and other
things figuring out what it's safe to
display
and if they decide something is not safe
to display under criteria which are
basically different for every web
browser out there they display the
internal ace form and what that does to
user who says I always want to be able
to write my name in its correct spelling
at a DNS label that user gets the
improvement from a miserable ASCII
transliteration of that name to a
totally unintelligible and
unpronounceable coded string and for
some reason that's not considered an
improvement in addition to that this
raises a whole series of policy issues
what we've had since the beginning of
the DNS is guidance to people who are
managing sones or hour later terminology
operating registries that says probably
you shouldn't register anything the DNS
which doesn't consist of letters digits
and hyphens with those rules unless you
have some specific reason for doing so
because the applications won't handle it
but the enforcement has been strictly a
registry matter plus the application
enforcement of if you don't follow the
rules it won't get through SMTP and
other things as we move to this other
set of characters we end up with policy
issues of a similar nature and those
policy issues get interpreted by every
registry on the Internet potentially
differently all tens of millions of them
so the registrant or user who expects
consistent behavior or the application
which expense consistent behavior is in
very big trouble and especially very big
trouble because of all of these
interesting mapping rules so we're now
trying to drain the swamp and we're
doing it unfortunately with an
eyedropper we are working on a new
version of ID a name
like it would be faster but distasteful
ah we've had an old rule that ten
percent of certain problems takes ninety
percent of the work with this work it's
turned out that two percent of the
problems takes 95 to ninety-eight
percent of the work what we're trying to
do is ultimately a few small
simplifications we're trying to get this
notion that if you have a character in
unicode you should be able to write in
DNS back to the notion that maybe that
1971 letters digits and hyphens rule
really ought to be extended into this
space so it's letters and digits and
very little else in these names the code
word for that is an inclusion based
model versus an exclusive based model if
you hear those terms we're trying to get
rid of the mappings so that the coding
from the internal form to the external
form is reversible so the user type
something in it gets converted the
internal form it gets converted back it
is actually what the user expected to
see some reason users like facts we're
trying to make a few a lot more
languages useful there's some coding
rules and the old thing which completely
eliminated the possibility of using a
couple of slang gwa jizz and scripts now
we're trying to clean up a few other
details in a perfect world that would
take about two weeks we're about two
years into that two weeks and we're
still having the old arguments about
natural language about novel writing
about words about matching rules we
still have the nasty policy problems
that will get solved and inconsistent
ways there's no way to make them go away
in this world and we're discovering a
new problem which is that every bug and
design miss feature in the original
version is now a feature which people
are arguing has to be preserving
somebody used it and that includes not
only the Miss features of the design
but the decisions which various
implementations and implementers made to
exceed the standard and move beyond it
in ways would show up in files and are
supported by at least some browsers
that's an important general problem
because in a world where somebody says
well somebody violated this standard and
somebody else decided to support their
violation and therefore it can never
change is a world in which one can never
make progress and I don't know what one
does in that world thank you yeah yeah
we have two more speakers to go so we
will do questions at the end but you
know where to find me if you get a
chance otherwise uh yes all right um my
name is Tina damn i work for i can and
i'm in charge of ideas that i can I've
been at i can for about six years and
only the last couple of years my sole
focus has been on ITN's so you can
imagine i don't count that much and a
number of the ato experience of the
entire panel but in any event when it
comes to I can and I dians we look to
the ITF for technical standards and
particularly as John has talked about
the I DNA is the most important one
there also is a couple of letter
technical standards that become
important when it has to do with
implementation and functionality of ID
ends at least one of which is currently
missing which you'll see in a little bit
I just have a couple of slides and I'm
going to try to be brief because we need
more time for questions I think since
we're a little bit of a diverse group I
just thought yeah I just thought I would
make sure that we're sort of like on the
same page
the first version of the I itna protocol
came out in 2003 and what that means is
that we actually have had idns existing
since two thousand three hundred
technical standards for web protocol the
email clients argue is something that
we're beginning to see which is under
experiment experimental implementations
but everything on into the main
namespace is has so far been on the
second level and because of that to
focus within i can is now to get ID ends
at the top level that creates some
challenges since the protocol is under
revision at the same time as you'll see
in a little bit though a box there is
just a further illustration of what it
is that we have and what we're going
towards i'll say probably slightly more
positive than John has been saying that
I tiens actually have existed and
functioned really well for lots of
different language communities but
particularly those that are basing their
languages on the Latin script or the
extended Latin script so when you move
into something like Korean Chinese
Arabic or so forth they don't have as
much experience or implementation
experience as you see in the Latin
extended Latin script because of the
fact that you have to change the script
when you type things in I mean it
becomes more difficult right one thing
is that for Arabic speakers that you
have to type things in in a ski or Latin
today another thing is if they had to
switch between the two so they're
waiting for to the top level they're
waiting for the entire string to be in
their script or language if you want to
talk about it that way we have actually
had the i DNT LDS in the route since
2005 September that test 11 strings were
put in the route just to see how it
worked and they work fine I can show you
some more pointers to it where you can
find it if you're interested
but in any event the top level we have
three processes at the middle one here
is something that's under policy
development so I'm not going to talk a
lot about that that's for ccTLDs for
long term internationalized versions of
that but the top one in the bottom one
the top one is what we typically refer
to as fast track and it's for
internationalized country code top-level
domains it's a limited round it's
intended to be faster than this middle
one that's under policy development this
is not expected the policy of this is
not expected to be finished until at
least a couple of years still so the
fast track is to give those countries
and territories that are ready and
really have an express need you know
what they're looking for non-latin
script only matching the iso 3166 lists
and the string that's applied for and
potentially becomes a label as a TLD
much must match the country or territory
name so there is a lot of different
restrictions in there the bottom process
is new gTLDs and that can be
internationalized as well the main thing
to say about that I'm there's a lot of
stuff going on in the implementation of
that process the main thing to say I
think is that from an ID on perspective
an ID and utility an ID and ccTLD is
essentially the same thing from a
technical point of view there is no
difference between the two and because
of that the technical requirements are
also the same in those two processes I'm
not going to talk much more about the
gTLDs per se I mean we've had a couple
of rounds that I can implementing new
gTLDs this next round is intended to be
much larger round that will continue
rolling so it's not a one-off
implementation but it doesn't really
have much to do with the standards as
does panel is talking about so this is
my last life and it's basically just to
give you a quick overview of what I
believe
are the main technical issues we have a
head in getting this finished and it
goes both forces utilities and utilities
the first one and they're not in any
particular order the first one is very
very intelligent of blocking what do we
do with these variant top-level domains
at second level we have different
approaches some are allocating somewhere
blocking some give out all variants for
one price and so forth there's all kinds
of different models but what do we want
to have into root I put up a couple of
examples and i should say right away
that leader China nor Pakistan have said
this is what we want publicly they've
said this is what we're interested in
but you know we I can is not open for
applications yet so none of this is
formal they've said publicly this is
what we're interested in you can see the
difference between the two strings for
China they both mean China want to
simplify Chinese the others traditional
Chinese the one for Pakistan you
probably can't or at least you shouldn't
be able to the difference is I can't
reach that but um I thought I could I
usually can can I use this oh here we go
this character that kind of look that
looks a little bit like an ass I mean if
you're English native speaker anyways is
actually two different characters one is
used primarily if you're in Saudi Arabia
the other is used for most other
speakers in Pakistan so there are two
different ones so there are two
different unicode characters different
unicode code points so obviously the
string becomes different in the dns even
though you can't see the difference so
what do we do those things and here is
the technical standard that doesn't
exist that i mentioned early on we don't
have a technical solution to alias them
because obviously you would want dose if
if those two existed as tlds in the
route you would need them to be aliased
I mean they would need to be the same
thing right I can't have Tina one and
then one of you have Tina dott the other
one did I mean you can it's the same it
looks the same right so so that's an
open topic that's being discussed right
now the other one is number of
characters in a label and I can see my
little square there was supposed to be
an error on a PC it's an error i guess
so for ccTLDs we're used to having two
characters in a label and now that we're
opening up for the fast track you can
have a whole country name so you can
have actually very long strings and in
any event because their ID ends and they
get converted to X and dash dash in the
I DNA protocol they're longer there
longer than two characters right
obviously in gTLDs we've been used to
seeing three plus characters early on I
guess mostly just three characters but
now we're getting more used to three
plus we've all seen the acceptability
and usability problems of that my
personal email address is under dot info
it doesn't always work things like that
becomes problems when you look at
standards ? is what I put after the gTLD
list is in the new process do we see one
character utilities you know at the top
level extension to character three
character and three plus character and
while this is something that's more
related to how do you implement this
process wise and what can people apply
for it still is a technical issue when
you look at the namespace and how things
are working and functioning and and what
we're used to seeing super from an
application space but also from a user
experience base third topic is the I DNA
technical standards for vision that John
talked about and this is difficult right
i can has been asked many times what are
you going to do if you're ready to
launch these two processes to implement
implement new TLDs and the I DNA
protocol revision is not finished are
you just going to take out I dns and say
well fast-track disappears completely
right because it's only I'd IANS utility
should it'd only be a ski and so far our
position and that is that we do have a
technical standard and it is working so
we are going to go ahead but we're going
to proceed cautiously and add some more
technical requirements around what
strings we're going to allow into route
but that relates into timing and that's
quite a difficult topic as well the fast
track is expected to launch around
sometime in q4 2009 the new gtld
applications process is anticipated to
launch in q1 2010 and there is no fixed
deadline free to one of them but that's
coming up really soon right and when we
talk about a protocol revision that's
underway well we're not just talking
about the technical standard being
finished we're talking about getting it
implemented into these processes getting
it implemented into application so it
actually work for the users so you can
talk about different layers of when is
this all going to work and if we were to
wait and I can until technical standards
implemented I don't know what to call it
broadly in applications well we would
wait forever right so for me it's more
of the chicken and the egg and i believe
that the user have a lot of power in
this and I think the user when they see
wrong difficult faulty behavior and some
applications they're going to move to
others that are more secure but unless
we hold back and we don't move forward
you know nothing is never going to
progress and it won't take us anywhere
so yeah I you know it's it's the it's
going to be difficult to do something
without that revision to be completed
but
that's where we stand today so that's
all I had is that what is about seven
minutes maybe Who am or I can talk about
ideas forever so I'm sorry and I like
being part of the or new member of the
standards body even though there was a
condolences early on Tina just very
quickly if you had a rich enough set of
fonts not only would those two
characters display differently because
they have different code points but so
it several of the other characters you
have the same conflict yeah so and just
to like a quick feedback on that I mean
there's a lot of topics on this that I
didn't touch on at all there's the fonts
there's all kinds of other stuff in
application layer there's guidelines
that are not technical standards but sit
on top of the technical standard strees
there's you know multitude and I'm happy
to talk about any of it would anybody
that is interested in more on ideas so
we can look forward to dingbats and Zapf
Chancery domain names is that were you
telling me right yeah cold day in hell
right right um my name is Eric our
client my work cross on ipv6 for Google
thanks to conserve and Steven Stewart
and the rents of co-ed and so I'm going
to try to take my seven minutes here and
keep you to that so um just I don't know
how much of this i really need to go
into why we were sort of doing ipv6 the
costs here are not necessarily cost by
the way that accrue to us there are
costs running ipv4 that will continue to
increase buying carry grade net devices
buying public addresses least cost
willing to increase and most likely this
this affects ISPs more than it will us
but it'll affect our users the
opportunity is here are actually
actually quite a lot of them and i just
there's an operational simplicity to not
having to deal with math it's really
really nice there's several million
devices that are I 56 only right now
that we
can talk to there are several million
devices that are IV physics only that we
can't talk to you because they're in
walled gardens but if the walled garden
if the walls come down thing will have
multiple millions of more devices we can
also do crazy things like there was
talking earlier about SSL and then also
cloud computing we could assign every
single app engine application its own
64-bit host ID and it could have its own
unique address at every single data
center that we run and it could have a
ssl cert for every single app would be
no problem whatsoever with the space
that large and if we ran out of 22 the
64 applications we would just remove you
know one bit from the network and put it
all over again and of course there's a
lot of personal interest in keeping the
internet open and not wanting to have
things lockdown we don't know what the
next great application is but we want to
be ready for it so and of course it
serves our users if he gives us to take
measures we can now so we'd have to
worry about later a very very brief
history not terribly it's an eye chart
but in december at i HAF 70 mark
townsley said well i don't know what to
do about ITV six maybe we'll just
challenge google to have ipv6 by IETF 73
in November of 08 when they're hosting
it and I send email off from the plenary
floor and in January we served our first
Google over ipv6 query and we had ipv6 a
google com by march for the ipv4
blackout error because I be before
blackhead hours were somehow very
popular although very painful and we
followed it up by having our first we
served Google over ipv6 we serve quoi
days for dub dub dub and mail and a few
other things to IETF 73 and actually
while I was there Eric vinc from Cisco
was like oh you're a client I was just
doing some TCP dumping on my Mac and I
was saying Wow somebody's going to gmail
over ipv6 who's that and then I tasted
me dump some more and then I realized it
was me
and and of course I didn't really
remember him so when i ran into eric
vink in january of oh nine at in
barcelona cisco networkers i told him
that same story he says yeah that was me
and we announced the Google of our v6
program in January and we had a
conference recently a couple weeks ago
and we added a map tiles actually which
gave us this nice little 3x increase in
traffic in about a few minutes some ITF
things that we're sort of following
believe it or not natus probably
possibly coming to ipv6 there's a lot of
passionate debate about this I have my
own thoughts obviously VRP is something
we're interested in I can only find a
couple of data to two dead drafts so but
the convergence of I wanted to wait for
neighbour and each ability discovery for
one router goes down to to keep the TCL
TCP flow would be great most important
for us actually probably are the
non-native access in transition with
those methods of people working on NAT
624 coding the DMS 64 component 6 rd we
like we have a million and a half for
more ipv6 users in France two and a half
million and they're all 6rg users we
want to see that one pushed to be a
standard as well and we have a few other
things that we track this is just ipv6
things obviously there's a great deal
more so we we've been running an
experiment to see what connectivity is
like about a third of a percent the
internet is actually capable of doing
ipv6 and about a tenth of a percent will
actually break if we add quad-a to
desert of the google com these numbers
are kind of especially the brokenness
number that's a very difficult number
two to measure I would take that with a
grain of salt suffice it to say it has
an impact that we're not really willing
to risk just yet so here's a growth over
time it amounts to about point one
percent increase every eight months so
we'll be done in about 8,000 months
so it's all it's all good we're on time
yeah well yeah it's quite possible
comcast as a as a large deployment there
in the middle of doing if we can
actually get to the NTT devices every
single home TT has a fiber to the home
has a slash 48 so we can get to a great
number of devices in theory we've been
monitoring how users get to us
unfortunately about two-thirds of them
get to us over 64 and bring yourself as
statistics I won't go into we watched
Google over ipv6 of course and you can
go to website and see these really neat
graphics about how if your DNS resolver
as in our whitelist will serve you qua
days otherwise you look just like the
rest of the internet and we don't
because we don't want to break you and
this is actually probably this is the
last slide and um is a graph courtesy of
David lawyer there's actually four lines
to look at the top one very faint as a
is all of the search over ipv6 and the
next blue one below at the darker blue
one is the same with 64 and teredo
tunneling mechanisms removed the red
line is actually two red lines those are
ipv6 searches of Google over ipv6 users
people who are actually enrolled at a
program and you'll notice that there's
another line that that is with tunnel
and 624 removers sorry with teredo and
64 users removed and we have no to raid
0 and 60 for users by design or
virtually none so you can see that we
currently have about two thirds
three-quarters of the ipv6 internet
enrolled in Google over ipv6 we have
some appearing arrangements and other
things that are coming up and we're
seeking out the ASNs that that connect
to us to figure out how we can serve
those and so we will grow Google over
ipv6 until we serve all of the ipv6
internet but we're not really seeing
their ipv6 internet size the IVC they're
not growing it so
can I say okay can i say more about
Google of ipv6 rules I mean like what
what qualifies who's allowed to do that
or what are the criteria oh sure it's
essentially production quality ipv6
connectivity between us on them
preferably two paths preferably no
tunnels is that correct Stephen I reckon
it's mandatory yeah and you have to
commit to production quality ipv6
support you have to treat an ipv6 adage
with the same degree of severity would
treat an ipv4 outage and you have to be
willing to troubleshoot problems when
your users report though and we're happy
to willing to work with anybody if
problems are reported but they have to
be willing to take those support calls
as well so we've had great success we've
got like 50 organizations we have about
250,000 unique ipv6 addresses per day
that we see so lots of university's
department of defense research
engineering networks places in lots of
places in Europe think we're still
bringing up a few places in Asia
dependence on network build-up but yeah
is that under seven all right probably I
didn't sound like a legal disclaimer at
the end of a radio ad so if we can just
have all the panelists out in front
we've got time to cure
I have mixed feelings about
internationalized domain names because
on one hand they make internet available
to various populations that are not
literate in layton scripts but on the
other hand they result in more
vulcanization of the internet and for
the rest of humanity so to say it
becomes kind of a walled garden so what
is your take is it a net positive or
negative effect in terms of and in terms
of global impact it certainly is my it's
it's going to be immensely useful it it
ends some other internationalisation
efforts which are more or less related
are going to be immensely useful for
getting communities that are not now
connected well enough to communicate
with anybody communicating among
themselves i I refuse to think of that
as balkanization because I think
ultimately opened I think that kind of
thing ultimately opens things up at the
same time the optimism behind all my
pessimism and cynicism about this is
that i think that there are lots of
people who have expectations for
problems that ID ends are going to solve
that as these things deploy people will
figure out that they do not solve and
what i say at other forums it might as
well say here is the problems which this
stuff is going to cause because of
difficulties in matching because of some
of these other things sort of cause
google in the sense that users today
much more so that even we anticipated a
half a dozen years ago are going to the
search engines because it's getting
harder and harder to try to guess domain
names
this internationalization stuff is going
to drive that problem up astronomically
and as a consequence my guess is that
what we will see once this settles down
no prediction is how long that will take
is things returning to where
philosophically they arguably belong
which domain names being used as
mnemonics and network facing identifiers
and much more use of search engines
intentionally populated directories and
whole series of other things at that
closer to the user layer where you can
actually do some linguistic things for
the user level stuff and it's probably
unfortunate that we have to waste the
amount of time and resources that will
go into doing this exercise to get there
but I think this will sort itself out
and I don't see a balkanization problem
for that reason but it doesn't have to
do with the ideas themselves there
sunkist okay I'm just gonna make a quick
addition to Jones Jon Jon and I actually
agree on most things and we almost also
green this one I'm going to say that I
think it already is useful aliens are
already useful and are going to continue
to be useful I also don't see
balkanization so on top of John's
argument for why let me give you an
example of it what if you have a website
that contains let's say solely Arabic
content and in school and one of the
Arabic speaking nations the kids are
told to go and check out this website
and do some home work or study or
research or you know whatever level
school you're an university or smaller
classes they're told to go to this
website well the website address is in
ASCII characters that makes no sense to
me and and enabling that address in
Arabic characters is not vulcanizing
anything it's just making it more
accessible and usable for that
particular community who would go to
that side
you're not losing a sense of global
community to anybody who is now part of
that community for exactly the reason
Tina's talking about we're adding people
who are finding extremely difficult to
access the network now who one might
hope can gradually be brought into the
global community but this is another two
pieces of the example the place where
ideas are the most useful now all right
that if somebody in the u.s. is naming a
set of machines as Tom Tom Dick and
Harry dot some domained out some TLD
there are advantages if you happen to be
in some place which is not in which is
not English speaking at Tom Dick and
Harry or not natural strings to do that
locally we're seeing tremendous use in
third and fourth and fifth level domains
within enterprises in various parts of
the world of this machinery for that
kind of a lot of use and I think that's
extremely useful today and it's
permanent the other side of the equation
Tina just mentioned is it that arabic
school child is going to have to type
HTTP colon slash slash and then do a
left to right to right the left switch
and types of Arabic characters and then
do a left to right and right the left
switch and type a slash and that's a
nightmare and that's one of the places
where as I say my expectations is going
to sort itself out in ways that are
beyond the expectations of the strongest
advocates of I the ends today so you
actually don't have to type that today
but if you want to do ftp for example
Thank a GPS yeah well if you want the S
on it then you do look for the HTTP you
don't but that's it that's the technical
standard problem but I'm going to
challenge you to go and see if you can
type one of the Chinese addresses in for
example if that's a language that you
don't speak see how difficult that is
for you today if you can figure out if
I'm going to supply you with an address
that's Chinese characters at CN for
example if you can figure out how to
type that in then I agree with you
yes but right so I'm going to tweet John
for a moment for just a moment that I've
got to say his question that tweaking is
you use Tom Dick and Harry dot something
is your example there's an internet
standard for example domain names it's
example.com example dot org units
actually written up to is a very good
standards for isn't there just teasing
the more serious question when you went
in which I raised earlier when you went
through your discussion of where we
ended up on out the ID NN process the
interesting thing to me was that almost
every branching point every point you
described as a point of difficulty maps
to the problems that we had fifteen
years ago in going to 8-bit smtp and
internationalizing the content of email
so people could write in their preferred
languages in email and what was
interesting to me was that the
internationalization of email took about
18 months roughly um and and yet you're
described with all the same problems
with many of the same actors in many
respects and yet in this case we went in
the free international domain names we
ended up with a solution that was not
correct the first time I whereas an
email we got it right when we finally
did it and I'm wondering how much is
that an evolution of the standards
process and that we have added ever more
parties and made it ever harder to do
the things that we did for example
during the email one we ended up putting
you in as smtp sr right and and is that
no longer feasible you know can you no
longer dictate to a standards committee
and say you have to decide on this and
that's at a scope or is this just
representing a harder problem space it's
a harder problem space the first thing
which makes it a harder problem space is
that with mine and smtp we had levers on
this we could specify language in tags
we could specify the p maybe in
retrospect in many years art suspect a
mistake but we could specify the
particular character setting you
we could use the smtp model to to start
negotiating extensions between a client
and a server and perhaps most important
of all relative the comments I was
making earlier we were perfectly willing
to say to people if you are
non-conforming beyond this particular
point nobody made any promises to you
and your life has just become miserable
and that's too bad this one is different
for all of those reasons we could have
and that this is you know enough about
the DNS we could have gone the other
path we could have said okay this set of
rules applies to label type 0 and class
I n and uh that's obsolete and we have a
transition strategy and it's they had
now label class late label type 3 and
class something else and now we're
talking about a transition strategy when
we get that we've got an
internationalized ENS the first thing
which made this different was that there
was a great sense of urgency driven by
political external political pressures
ah and the people who designed I DNA and
were pushing for that solution believe
that we'd have this fully deployed
around the world and fully supported in
applications by three years ago and we
are not close partly because of some
other things how long it would have
taken to deploy that DNS solution I
don't know but it's harder to deploying
the in a second you know how long let's
take ah if you don't do something that
radical you don't have any way to
communicate it to the dns and what are
these weird things is going on and it
affects all the applications across the
board not just smtp try and servers
gateways realities so it's harder for
all those reasons in addition with the
smtp stuff partly because the internet
was much smaller
in terms of interested parties we didn't
have quite as many people who thought
that this was a cultural problem rather
than technical problem with a chat with
smtp as long as we solved it in some way
that would work they were happy as i
mentioned somebody earlier i spent a
number of years of my life working on
data about nutrient composition of foods
and one of the things we discovered
about food naming and food nomenclature
and recipes and food composition data is
the number of people in the world who
have opinions on those subjects are
roughly equal number of people in the
world will eat ever as soon as we've
gotten into these my language my culture
my spelling rules arguments with the DNS
we're in a situation very close to that
food problem the number of people who
think that they're entitled to have
opinions what they know anything or not
is roughly equal the number of people
who used to use the internet plus a lot
of people don't use the internet but
have opinions anyway and that makes it
very very much more difficult context
why not just have google front end IP
addresses look so I guess had a question
back here and I just sort of a follow up
which is sort of what what is the latest
state of thinking about that like
long-term capacity of standards bodies
to deal with these Kwazii political
problems I say that would like sort of
two dimensions to this one is you know
on the wonder if you're taking on
problems that arguably have this kind of
policy dimensions how do you make sure
you have the right stakeholders in the
room and then that's what the other
piece of it is how do you make sure that
these you know these are these bodies
that arguably have been doing very well
like I TF over time you know within a
certain approximation you know how do
you survive the arrival of lobbyists I
say that as a lobbyist from google and
and I'm thinking about the XML example
you know for as a good example you know
political football political theater as
a problem for standards bodies I think
the first thing you do is you figure out
how to tell the difference and we're
getting better at that but not yet good
at it
we're telling the difference is the
difference between a technical argument
or technically grounded argument and
somebody trying to use one of these
arguments to advance either particular
agenda particular narrow agenda or
narrow technical agenda or a political
agenda knowing the difference helps the
other answer that question is like you
see coming towards you in the tunnel is
not a trained as an ocean liner i don't
know and i think the ID at least idea
experience certainly doesn't lead me to
be optimistic although i assume that we
will work it out no this is new I mean
you go back to Saoirse I think 1870 when
they were arguing over the original
digital code which was Horace code
versus the other codes available I think
even though Rhonda crane as I recalled
MIT wrote a whole book on this and
broadcast standards some you
compartmentalize it live with we we we
have gotten less good at the version of
rough consensus which of all tv's of the
ipad to bark so you touched on Dennis
sec 1 comment about how the difficulty
of the deployment but i have a question
that was brought up and maybe it's a
naive one but with all these
proliferation of internationalized names
that have these different characters and
displays and all that stuff i have the
you know this concern about whether
there's DNS SEC behind it and am I going
to the right place or not and if there's
disparity in the deployment of this but
you know DNS SEC takes even longer let's
say then we might expect I would imagine
software to have options that say well
just disable all this stuff I don't want
to even take the risk associated with it
do you think that will happen is if the
first answer is that some software has
already done that just don't see it in
their obvious
way the second is that for better or for
worse what are the advantages of I DNA
is that the only thing in the dns is
stuff that to any piece of the dns
itself looks like letters digits and
hyphens and as a consequence all of the
difficulties here the user facing
difficulties here are invisible to DNS
SEC because as far as the NS SEC is
concerned this is just you know strings
about tets with the usual expected stuff
in them just I'm so in addition to that
um just in case that there could be
anything else going wrong and I agree
with John I mean it's just let your
digits and hyphens so there wouldn't be
any problems but we actually signed the
test idea until these that are into root
and everything works smoothly I mean
there's no problems at all but there's a
difference between you signing it and
then people verifying against that's I
yeah I agree and if that test is not
that broad yeah it's not it's not a
technical question about can the DNS
processes do it it's about out at the
end software and at the end you know
stuff how people were react to it at the
ends one of the reasons why several of
us would press and get the mappings out
of this thing is precisely because
there's no way to verify with DNS SEC or
anything else the thing which was looked
up is actually the same as the thing the
user typed if somebody is invisibly
underneath the user doing doing special
things but the strongest push for doing
those mappings anyway despite that
problem is coming out of this company as
a consequence of trying to make certain
that millions of web pages which took
advantage of that mapping stuff will
continue to work in an orderly in
particular way this is a real tension
okay I think in the interest of time
we're going to have to thank you for all
your questions of the panelists
it's what hopefully microphone works I
heard your description you do response
to him saying you know how do you type
HTTP go from right to left left to right
turns out my wife actually serves she
doesn't work here at Google and not
surprisingly she never typed HTTP in her
life so is interesting that you were
challenging these people to do things
that my wife never does isn't old saying
that there's few problems for which one
extra level of indirection won't offer a
resolution and he said it jokingly but
it seems a little bit true he commented
whining let Google front end and and the
truth is when my wife wanted to go look
at a site she actually didn't type dub
dub didn't even do that part she just
typed chase bank and magically she got
something that led her there and and the
truth is this is actually how people
surf and get around so I'm a little bit
long right so what no okay so what's a
fundamentally I think it was a I think
was a false I think there's a straw man
that you set up there and I'm really
wondering maybe I'm being incredibly
arrogant here you know no no actually I
said you don't have to type HTTP if you
want the S on there then you have to
type it but you don't type AC no you
don't actually because it turns out when
i type vanguard it automatically
redirects me just and no one types no
not no one
you
really that your wife is normal that
those of us who actually know how to use
what a URL looks like are becoming an
increasing rarity and and that every
time a new top-level domain is added
it's more confusion about where to look
at your name guessing and what that does
is I said earlier is basically caused
people to go to the search engines
usually Google to the extent to which
people go to the search engines this
discussion about ID ends and the
protocol work on ideas is irrelevant and
that's good news and good news for the
community not just for Google's bottom
line so it means that long term the role
of these things is much much narrower
than the assumption being made by the
people claim that if only they had IDNs
they'd have more people on the internet
this is going to end up being a very
important niche having more to do with
network management network resources
then users typing names I think so I
just want to clarify i actually didn't
say anything that was in disagreement
with what you said I said you don't have
to type that in maybe if you do have to
pee you do but sorry just since we're as
we stopping I just wanted to ask why why
why we still need DNS in the browser I
mean what Jim is talking about what you
mentioned there's no need for DNS in the
browser at all like
yeah can we can we leave that one to
dinner conversation thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
