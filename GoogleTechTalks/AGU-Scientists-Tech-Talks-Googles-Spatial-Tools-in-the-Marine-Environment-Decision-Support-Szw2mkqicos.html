is coach were from the University of New
Hampshire and Kurt saw a proper techie
geek so it's fitting we end of one but
he's involved in using his skills in a
number of areas in our planetary but in
particular ocean data and it's that he's
going to be talking about today how he's
developed uses of geospatial data in
Google's geo tools all right thank you I
want to start off with a figure to
remind you all that New Hampshire indeed
does have a coastline we have 17 miles
of coast we actually do touch the ocean
those people don't seem to realize that
and I'd also like to acknowledge my
collaborators many people at NOAA
Cornell University and the US Coast
Guard have contributed to the products
you'll see up here today and I want to
go back into the not too distant past
and talk a little bit about where we
used to be before we had google earthen
and some more tools when we were at NASA
we used to have to spend huge amounts of
money trying to buy large sgi's keep
them running and then write all of our
software on our own just to make this
crummy looking earth that's up here and
there's no nice texture background it
sort of looks like North America and we
sort of have a red blob on there and if
you click on it it pops up an actually
fairly nice graphic of something but
there's no way to scale them between the
two and handle all the nice things that
Google Earth now handles for us for
pretty much free here with KML and you
used to have to get a van and truck it
all over to where you going to your demo
and today we take our laptop open it up
and you're good to go that's had a
dramatic effect on how we've looked at
data and how much data we can look at
I'd like to take a little bit of tour
where we get went and what kinds of
things we're trying to do to support the
Mariners who are out there on our
waterways trying to get commerce through
and to keep our economy running my
background is a little bit of geology so
i want to show you sort of how I got
into Google Earth and what we started
looking at at first so here's the Santa
Barbara basin it off
California and we started looking at
what we could do with say taking a
journal paper and skimming the figures
in or using something like fledermaus to
generate a 3d model and then slap it in
there or actually just texture you're
both imagery onto the ocean floor when
we have a high-resolution survey this in
this case it's from embarrass a research
ship and as you go through that I
started playing with the idea of taking
each scientist and maybe we could build
a Google Earth resume so it's a concept
of for a particular scientist where
they've been as they go through their
career and you can actually glean a lot
as they go through the the geologic
record trying to figure out what's going
on a lot of insight comes from what
problems are looking at and when in
their career and how that influences
things if you went back aways you might
see the revolution that occurred in
earth sciences where people realize that
plate tectonics is a real thing it was a
huge change of thought to people and a
lot of that is buried in the literature
in terms of where they were looking on
the ocean and how they looked at the
earth they went from a from an old model
to a to a brand new model that was
really radical change and so I think as
we dig back into that those archives
will start pulling out more of that and
really see a historical change now to
jump into some of our modern tools that
we're looking at and give you a sense
with what we can actually do for the
Mariners to change their world and make
it a better place for them to move about
on the waterways and for those who are
managing it I used an open-source tool
just to get going and we took a NOAA
chart which are the little red lines
you'll see up on the screen and on that
chart we've dropped it on top of Google
Earth and if you look at the pier in the
middle next to the orange arrow you'll
see a really long pier next to a really
short red icon a little iconographic
description of the pier now which one is
right if you came through in the middle
of the night do you want to find out so
we've been looking at you know if you
could just drop a chart in and do a
quick look you can catch a lot of errors
that have been very difficult to see
down the road and I'll show a couple
more examples of of kinds of surprising
things that we found and how tools like
Google Earth can just pop this right out
without having to go through and and dig
through databases and try to look at
Excel spreadsheets and figure out what's
going on now as these ships move around
there's actually a new technology that's
been deployed for about the last five
years and is coming into more and more
use and is called the automatic
identification system so planes for a
long time have had devices that tell you
where they are and the FAA can tell you
what ship is where in the United States
well now we have that for the maritime
world so ships are trying to put these
transponders on and they're mainly meant
for collision avoidance so instead of
just having to rely on your radar you
have a device that actually tells you
who's around you and what they're doing
now for us as researchers we'd like to
see what are the ship's doing why are
they out there why are there problems
where are there areas that are working
well and so what you see up here is a
combination of a little bit fancier
nautical chart here I've used the earth
and sea charts and I've taken a couple
layers out of their tools and merged it
with a is ship tracks throughout go
entry to Delaware Bay and you can see
that there's vessels moving all over
some are using the green traffic lanes
and following the the rules of the road
they don't require to and there's other
vessels who are crossing it and then
their vessels that have to wait around
for some reason and so we need to go in
there and look at as they're out there
what's delaying these ships and how can
we optimize what they're doing while
keeping them safe now it's not always
safe out there and things do happen so
we can use techniques like this to look
at events like the cosco busan this ship
in 2007 ran into or as they call it in
the maritime world alighted with a fixed
object called the san francisco bay
bridge and by having the ship track in
and recorded by all the transponders we
can see what was going on with that and
the investigators I'd not involved in
that but they can actually look at these
tracks and start to understand what's
going on and we can provide them with
graphics where they can go in with a
time slider move things around they can
remove all the ships except for the
ships that they care about and start
really digging into why this incident
happened and hopefully with those
investigations they can create new rules
or remove rules that were causing
problems to make the waterways more
effective and safe and you can combine
that kind of information with things
like in the bottom left we have an image
that was captured
by the ship's radar and so investigators
can really get a fuller picture of
maritime incidents as they happen in the
waterways much better than they ever
have in the past now as a part of that
in addition to things like a is we also
need to get more sensors out there Noah
at EPA and other federal agencies have
got a pretty good infrastructure out
there but we need more we need sensors
that really go in and tell us what's
going on in the environment so here I've
showed an example of a company that's
trying to push that innovation curve
sensor wire systems and they're trying
to place all sorts of sensors out in the
environment and give us tools to be able
to go in and look at this stuff 24 7 365
good days or bad days and tell us what's
going on out in the environment that way
at we as scientists and researchers can
really understand what it is that's
causing those trouble spots and why
things are working the way they are in
the waterways if you don't know what's
happening out there how are supposed to
help them out now one of the things that
we try to do is once you have an
incident there's a short time period
where responders have to get in there
and really start to work with the local
enforcement folks and try to get that
environment cleaned up and restored back
to where it was so to give you an
example of some of the things we're
seeing in the waterway I've shown you a
picture of a grounding in Alaska this
could be anywhere in the United States
there's a lot of incidents on the
waterways it's getting busier out there
so things do happen it's like being on
the highway you don't expect to have an
accident but every once in a while
something happens that it may even be
out of your control so when working on
web interfaces to provide a consistent
environment for each of the ports to
have that they can call up and
responders who come from out of town may
have never been in this particular area
they need a consistent view of what's in
the area consistent set of data products
and access to the management plans that
have been in place so that they can
quickly respond to things such as oil
spills where every minute or hour that
you can't get out there and figure out
what to do causes you to not be able to
recover as much of the oil or debris
that's out in your waterways so here for
example we're showing a multi-beam
bathymetry showing super high-resolution
features of the waterways this is
Portsmouth New Hampshire and you can see
such things as sand waves that are just
meet
or two across and you combine that with
your roads and highways and the icons
show you all of your caches for your
response tools this way that the people
who come on on-site they may not have
been in here before but they can get
going right away it's start to figure
out what they need to do in the first
few hours of a response now once you're
way past that and you've gotten past
your investigations such as the costco
goes on the coast guard keeps a database
of incident investigations part of that
database sits inside of tool called
missile and it's the marine information
for safety and law enforcement database
as a part of that we have access to
these incidents and we can color code
them here i've used the osha symbols for
for industrial accidents not quite the
right icons but it gives you a gist of
what's going on in the waterways and you
can see what are the areas that are
having the most trouble and where do we
need to focus our research efforts to
make this much more focus research and
find those problems that need to be
addressed you can see that the Gulf
Coast has the majority of the incidents
with a fairly good number going on our
inland waterways so those folks refer to
themselves as the brown water crowd they
have plenty of incidents that need to
work on too there's a lot of tight
waterways and passing arrangements that
are difficult with these big ships
trying to move our economic resources up
and down the Mississippi River we'd zoom
in here this is Norfolk Virginia and you
can take a look at their database we
started to create tools that help
associate these together without having
to dig into their Oracle database so
anyone can go in and associate a
particular incident with the details of
the accident or you can drill down and
get the entire accident report and that
way we can start looking at what
actually happened to an incident is
there something we can address or is
this say an active nature or weird
current something that we can't control
therefore there's nothing we can do
about it or can we add a sensor to help
ships out as they go into particular
areas an example that might be the
inland waterways some of the locks as
you approach them have really horrible
cross currents that vary with time so
can we put sensors in the water column
they will tell you the currents and
report that back to the ships now as
Mariners go through the waterways
they're relying on
groups such as Noah to provide them with
the resources to understand where
they're going this is the road atlas for
ships and it starts with field data
entry there's validation and then no it
produces what's called the coast pilot
this is a document that's been around
for a very long time over a hundred
years and it hasn't changed in a hundred
years so we have a really excellent tool
mariners count on this but can we do
better with a geospatial tool we took a
look at lidar and lidar is great you can
generate thousands of laser points
ranged into your environment and you can
look into into buildings see trees all
sorts of stuff but it generates a lot of
data and you're going to overwhelm your
your people who are trained mariners who
are not used to dealing with point
clouds with the data that isn't
necessarily going to help them this
might be helpful for a modeler and we've
looked into what we could do with
producing models to supplement those
that that people like Google have
created or I and we can add the waterway
critical the buildings and markers so
here we've done a lighthouse on Cape Cod
this is highland light modeled by
christiana and in this model it gives us
a good sense of what's out there but
unfortunately if we were to do all the
lights and waterway devices that we want
to have out there it's prohibitively
expensive and time-consuming to model
each of these it takes us going out to a
site running around the building
building a model validating it going
through all of our tools and then
dropping into Sketchup and placing it
into Google Earth the last two steps are
easy all that leads up to that is
actually fairly challenging for these
unusually shaped objects it would be
nice if all of our lighthouses were
square but unfortunately they're not so
we've looked at an approach of running
around with a camera and cameras are
getting better every day they're adding
sensors that we need it used to be that
adding a GPS to a camera was difficult
now you can go to the store and you can
buy a camera that has a GPS and it has a
three axis magnetic compass so you know
which way it's pointed another engineer
and I Matt we went through Boston Harbor
in one day and photo surveyed the entire
Harbor we had very sore arms from trying
to hold a camera stable on top of a ship
but you can go in and one day and survey
tire harbor now how can we use that
information to present something to go
along with that text to produce a new
environment that's helpful for our
Mariners so we come up with a process
collect a whole bunch of photos so
here's Matt and I collecting photos in
Boston you need to match those photos to
features you need to crop those photos
register them orient them and get them
into a database and once we have that we
can try to create interfaces to these
this new type of data we've been playing
with the Asmat calls it the multi rama
where basically you have an oriented
image slice and the renderer picks which
one to do based on which way you're
looking at it the nice thing about this
is unlike a cad model you catch all
those features that cue the Mariner into
what to look for so if a building is
buried among the trees you capture all
those trees that you never want to model
in a 3d world it's just too expensive so
in our lab we've gone ahead and
prototyped a little version of this to
see what it might be you're welcome to
download it and give it a try we're
always looking for feedback we've got
some features that we haven't figured
out how to do in google earth yet as you
move around this world you'll see
pictures moving some smaller and larger
based on where they are in your field of
view things are bigger in the center and
they shrink as they go away we've played
with the aspect oriented which picture
to choose and we've had hyperlinks
between the text and the 3d world we
think with the the new JavaScript API
for google earth that might be a great
way to to create at least the basics of
this and then work through how we're
going to implement some of these other
features on top of what exists in the
current KML I think we can do a lot but
we have yet to figure out what that
might look like there's a lot we can do
we're going to try a few things in the
next couple months but we look forward
to feedback on that first prototype to
see what might be a good match for
people without overloading the interface
with too many things now I'd like to
show you something in our our actual in
the field implementation of stuff this
is a project that's just going online
right now the right whale AIS project
aims to notify Mariners without any
effort on their part of where right
whales might be in critical habitats the
right whales in the East Coast that were
down to about 350 right whales so we'd
like to give the Mariners as much tools
as possible
to avoid running into these whales or if
if it's impossible to know the whales
there to at least be going slow enough
that any impact with a whale might not
be fast enough to actually harm the
animal enough to kill it so give you a
sense of what's going on in the Boston
area here's a finger to give you a view
of a couple of different types of ships
and how they use the waterway some ships
such as fishing or tugs or research
vessels they're the worst don't really
work in a very nice easy to work with
manner however that cargo and and
liquefied natural gas carriers tend to
really run a very consistent line they
use the traffic lanes very consistently
and as a part of a new deepwater port
that's being put in here for LNG right
off the coast the Coast Guard Noah and
the local natural gas companies have
agreed to spend money to put in buies
all all along this to let mariners know
when whales have been heard in
particular area so let me show you the
first implementation of this user
interface for the Mariners who we did it
in Google Earth it was the easiest tool
to create an interface that we found and
what we have is a circle for each of our
buoys and when that buoy detects a right
whale call it goes back to Mission
Control at Cornell University they
verify a whale and the little ring on
the screen turns yellow laying the
mariner know that there was a whale
there sometime in the last 24 hours this
way Mariners can use their best judgment
to understand what to do or if you're
the LNG carrier you're actually required
by your contract with the Coast Guard to
go less than 10 knots now that we have
those kinds of things in place we also
need to start working on our background
data and we've been looking at how to
deal with multi-beam data with google
earth so that we can have rapid
turnaround of validation of our tools
without having to deal with the
multi-day process of processing with the
high power tools such as Karis here's an
example of a really unusual system and
how easy it is to drop into Google Earth
I used a combination of mb system and
Google Earth to drop in the track lines
make sure that this wave rider which is
a little jet ski like device with a
solar on it driven by Tom lipman of our
institution to actually go in and quick
make a model of this and see if we can
go
make a nice model of the inshore areas
where we can't get shipped so we're
trying to work on new ways to acquire
data and get it into Google Earth now as
we go through all the stuff we're trying
to deal with a whole bunch of research
papers that are focused on various
waterways and the bottom of the ocean
things like that we have a request of
Google we would love to see instead of
just google scholar google spatial
scholar so we've actually done a quick
prototype of what it might be to lay in
the historic data we had a whole team of
graduate students who came up with this
project and they they took old
multi-beam data their figures in papers
and laid it on google earth where those
figures should go now maybe the end
result you really want these things
glued right on the planet where they're
supposed to be but this shows the idea
of being able to take a database such as
EndNote and export a KML and be able to
just spin around the globe and see where
the papers are so if you're interested
in Hawaii you flying to Hawaii and you
just get the Hawaii papers I'd like to
finish up with an example of a tool
that's it's about to come online it'll
be a little bit longer than the whale
system this is now Coast done by the
NOAA and they've worked with the
University of New Hampshire to create a
tool called flow viz and get it on the
web this is an arc ims interface so if
you go to now Coast this will be there
hopefully in the next month or two and
we've worked on visualization techniques
that actually are based on the human
visual system so this sort of starry
night view is the current velocities
along the US East Coast you can see the
Gulf Stream nice and clear as we're
working on this we thought what if we
did it in Google what if it was right on
the globe and we weren't always in
arcims so we've taken a quick look at
that and it looks really promising here
I used flight or mouse to go and drop a
Geo tiff onto Google Earth and the
results are really quite stunning being
able to fly around and really see this
kind of flow model is fantastic this is
something when I had to take
oceanography as a grad student I would
have killed for this visualization I
still don't totally understand flow
visualization I'm not an oceanographer
I'm a marine geologist and do physicist
but it's really great to be able to see
this stuff and understand the context of
my geology within the currents of the
area thank you all for listening if you
have any more interest in this type
stuff my blog at swear
org has a lot more pictures of all the
stuff and you can download some of the
files thank you for listening any
questions yes
can you repeat the question
we would rather have google do that than
us yes it would be great to have a
street view car that we punk on top of a
ship and drive around a harbor we're in
a way emulating that except for one
aspect in Street View you want to show
everything because people are interested
in all sorts of different features here
we have a community that actually wants
you to go in and decimate the data and
just find those key features so when
they're coming into Harbor they don't
want to know every nook and cranny of
the harbor they want to know the key
lighthouses the building's the features
they need to go to where they're going
so they're going to aim for that
lighthouse take a left at the third pier
and head for home and it may be foggy
and dark so they want to have that that
best knowledge without all of the street
view like stuff in there so we have an
extra decimation problem yes next
question
now Coast
that one before the whales yeah that one
yes this is not Google Earth this is our
in-house OpenGL implementation and we
hope to have a Google Earth
implementation we have a couple
different teams taking their own take on
it we have one in Florida we've looked
at photo overlays and we think that
might be a way to go we have some
questions on how to control the image
views to maybe do something like the
multi Rama we think you might be able to
pull that out with sort of a you know
level details region type feature where
you pick which region and it's not true
level of detail so perhaps those kinds
of things but this is not currently
Google Earth I wish it was but it's not
any more questions thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
