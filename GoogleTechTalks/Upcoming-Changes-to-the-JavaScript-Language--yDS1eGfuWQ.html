skala luis perez and we're going to be
talking to you about the what's going on
with the JavaScript language
standardization Pascal has been involved
with this for just a short time I've
been on the ACMA Committee for longer
than google has been a company who was
involved with standardizing ECMO skip
edition three it was back at Netscape
then currently we're working on ECMO
script addition for and that this taco
presents what we're thinking about okay
just a little disclaimer what we're
presenting is is a process it's things
that they have not been standardized yet
and which the committee is being working
on so the final language might be
different on features might not be
present some semantics are not fully
designed so don't start writing an
implementation somehow you know there is
quite a bit of debate within the group
so some some features are controversial
the existence of whether JavaScript
should evolve at all is also
controversial and there are interesting
corporate politics about that which we
will not get into this talk so we'll
speak about Joseph history just one
slide and then we'll mention the new
object oriented support in the language
and what's coming to support this kind
of programming in a more easier way then
we'll touch about static typing and
dynamic typing and how this is going to
be combined in the new language finally
some syntactic sugar and a note about
some compatibility quirks yeah the
impetus for doing this is to fix some
things with JavaScript and also to
support better to provide better support
for programming in the large which is
constructing scripts out of constructing
libraries for scripts
selecting scripts out of components
which are not necessarily trusted with
each other providing some safety
invariance so for example you can have
something which is private to your class
and the language will guarantee you that
nobody else can get at it it will not
solve all problems acma scripts edition
for is not intended to address that dumb
in incompatibilities this is outside of
the group's charter so but it does
provide a foundation in which we hope to
be able to build the next generation of
web applications in touch so the a
javascript which was originally called
live scripture was invented by brendan
eich at Netscape back in 96 was a
Netscape product for a while other
companies such as Microsoft made a clone
of it called jscript the implementation
was the spec in the early days so bugs
in the implementation were copied into
other implementations eventually a bunch
of companies get together and under the
inside the eggman organization and
standardized JavaScript due to trademark
issues we couldn't use with named
javascript / standards that was called
acma script instead to try to find a
name which was as unattractive as
possible so I've been involved with this
since 1998 you know two parts of the
third edition of ECMO script standards
which is both an egg man and iso
standard and since this about 99 we've
been working on aquascape edition for in
various guises and Google just joined
acma
last month so this is new to Google
that's I've been involved with this in
other contexts since some of the design
goals of the new akma script for is
support for object orientation lots of
web apps out there are very object
oriented and having that built into the
language makes things way easier and
makes interactions between two libraries
easier some stronger static guarantees
static typing and this is built into the
language and there's a type system that
is being developed to mix the old world
the legacy world with the new statically
typed world and there is definitely a
willingness to make both work together
very well having more room for optimal
performance is also a key thing in the
standard lots of time is spent on trying
to make new features of the language
simple enough so that very simple
implementations can still be out there
and finally being compatible with
echamos great except some really weird
corner cases now the overall is a
dynamic world but that is not going away
we're not the deprecating it's akmal
script will remain very much a dynamic
language and we're evolving both sides
of the language forward the first thing
one of the first things we're adding is
support for block scoping over here if
you're familiar with how JavaScript
works right now local variables even
with within deep within a function are
hoisted to the top of a function so this
valuable declaration of be actually
takes effect at the top of function so b
is a local variable one interesting
feature you could call it a bag of ECMO
script is if you don't declare a
variable its global it creates a global
dynamically will address some of this in
a thing called strict mode but of course
it has to remain the same for backwards
compatibility there is a new construct
called let which instead of hoisting it
to the top of a function will host it to
the top of a block so this declaration
of d would take effect here now there's
some there's some controversy debate
within the group about whether let's
should launch the dollar or whether it
should behave like in c++ and java and
just take effect standing from here
we're also adding cost which declares
things which you cannot mutate after
you've defined them and this is also the
source of many debates about yeah that's
quite a bit of debate about what
constitute my doing since he is yes
well Constance final in Java thus
different is very different from what
constant C++ is in C++ cast means one of
two different things one is depending on
where you use it it can mean that you
cannot mutate it but somebody else can
it can also mean that nobody can mutate
it the what I work I hope we achieve
here is that cast will indicate that if
you've anybody who reads who is able to
read the value twice is guaranteed to
see the same value so if you know so
once you set the value of a cost you
will not be able to change it now there
may be situation with in which you can
access value before it's been said and
we're arguing about what should happen
then it's probably going to be an
exception yes the sum of some hearing we
are delaying the some other features of
ECMO skype addition for our already
implemented in Firefox in JavaScript
windows seven so this will not be you
know in terms of release I don't expect
this to be all out you know release
where suddenly you have all of this
stuff it will be released incrementally
and some of it is already there
so that's that you know that's one of
the disadvantages of releasing things
you know as we're in a kind of working
on them and that we may change our mind
I so some of this intermediate behavior
may change so there are so to introduce
blocks gulping the we do this we have a
light statement there are actually three
forms of its in equity position three
it's also slightly controversial as to
why there are three this one here oh
sorry yeah equus crypto yeah this one
here creates a block local variable a
this one it lets you have a binder
variable just for a scope of a sub
expression so you can use this form
inside expressions and within the sub
expression after the lads a is you know
step 2 X plus y and this form lets you
do the same thing for statements so one
feature that's already present in
Firefox to is restructuring patterns
where you can have some patterns on
assignments and the language basically
does the destructuring that is required
for you so you can write nice things
like the swap function which reverses in
a very clean way and reading the
function you see exactly what's going to
happen just the square brackets mean ras
enact my script if you hear not familiar
with what it is in addition three curly
brackets means objects of names
properties
and now we come to the object-oriented
features classes so echamos crib has
dynamic classes which are really the
same thing as ekman script three objects
it just provides a nicer syntax you can
have fields and extend them at some and
you can also have Java kind of classes
where if you remove the dynamic keyword
then this class is in a way sealed
there's nothing that can mutate the
number of fields on this class so the
dynamic warden does not mean final like
it is in Java what it does mean is that
if you gain an instance of this perp of
this class if the class is dynamic you
can add additional properties just like
to you can add them to echo script of
the objects now if you do not say
dynamic then the fields that the class
the curves are it instance a present you
know intercept passes you can add new
ones but once you have an instance of
the class you cannot create more of them
it's fat at runtime there's also
interface which are exactly the same as
in Java basically you can define a set
of functions that need to be there and
when you implement it you need to have
that to pass the implementation yes
there's also this notion of generic
functions which based on the type of the
parameters selects for you at runtime a
function so these these are for global
and static functions only we do not have
plans to support this for instance
methods just because combining this with
semantics of overriding is gets weird
and there's this concepts of yes sorry
these outside the encapsulation boundary
of the objects they operate on they are
just global functions so you can declare
a global function as generic and then
you can incrementally add new sort of
our laws of it's from different places
so it's probably would not make a good
in a secure security boundaries is
there's no way to close it namespaces
are a way to protect names so instead of
having just one name you can have a
tuple name space plus name their names
places are the key provision for
programming in the large where if you're
getting scripts and libraries from
various places if you publish the
library and once it evolved is API you
need to be able to create names without
conflicting with names with somebody
must have used in the clients program
and this is also how akma script for is
going to support private and public
things in classes basically when you
create a class you get for free to new
name spaces which are one name private
and the other public which no one else
but you can refer to and this allows you
to make the distinction between
visibilities of your fields and methods
however unlike in Java you can also
create other name spaces which can which
can function like public and like
private so you can have various degrees
of privacy is simply by not giving out
the references to the namespace and so
we've been debating in
how to make this reasonably secure and
it has implications of things like
iteration through properties but which I
want to get into but we're trying now we
have as a goal the ability to make
various degrees of access available and
worthwhile to use and just like the
Valdemar said about programming the
large namespace is also a giveaway to
evolve api's by protecting each method
by version number and basically people
can use a service based on a version
number and it will select which kind of
method you have so that you're not bound
by old API is to develop new ones now
version 1 and version to our namespaces
here this there's also the notion of a
package which is physically the same
some functionality that's split across
multiple files and has got a name and
just like classes packages create for
free tunay faces an internal and public
one so you can have in one file a field
defined that's internal in the other a
method that's public that uses this
field and when you run your code you can
import this package you can use the
method but not access the field which is
internal so is the execution model still
going to be that logically all the
source files are concatenated
one long string of source and then
evaluated so far I thought we'd get to
the next leg okay so you've got this
notion of program units which are
exactly what you said basically
different programs in different files
and a program unit can provide some
functionality by requiring some
functionality of other program units so
for instance you could have a Google
Maps mashup which allows you to draw on
maps and to provide this drawing
functionality it needs the Google API so
you have a unit draw nerve and it uses
another unit and for the moment there's
a double quote missing there yes yes for
the moment you can also give a URL and
the thinking is browsers will download
Eunice automatically but this is not
finalized yet know the standard ECMO
script standard will not say what the
format of this string is in browsers it
might be a URL in other applications it
might be something else but this will be
set by the embedding so now we come to
the typing part of this talk about how
static typing and dynamic tapping are
going to be merged into one type system
so historically javascript is
dynamically type and there's basically
no notion of types so there's the
language is being expanded to allow type
annotations for instance this var Colin
int specifies that I can only hold an
int throughout its life and the on that
unannotated code has some special star
type which is compatible with everyone
so types are introduced by language
construct just like in Java or C++
classes introduced in the name of the
classes introduce a new type they can
also be constructed from others there's
this notion of union types and notion of
record types union types are not like
C++ unions it's more like ml unions
where you can create a union of
something which can be of type a or type
be your type C they're not tags hmm yeah
I guess if you look in what the values
of this type represent is basically the
intersection the union of all the values
of string and all the values event
combined Linotype is just like what's
you have an xbox script position three
except that we now have a name for
values with you know our property called
name whose values are straying and a
property called age whose values an
unsigned integer you can also alias
names so we say type point equals this
and whenever you refer to pawn your
actually referring to the short name so
and it's it's not attaching any brand to
it so it's really just a nail yes so
practice using the Union types there's
this notion of null ability and
optionality values have can be can
incorporate knows or not and null is
actually a distinct type from all the
other types and this allows to express
things like this value will never
contain the value the value null or this
field is never going to contain the
value undefined and there's some
shorthand some syntactic sugar to
express that easily t and the
? says this version is nullable and the
other one says that it's not knowable
and there are some defaults the numbers
all the numbers types and billions are
none nullable by default and all the
others are noble so the two the two
syntax are useful so value of pack
numbers is not nullable by default but
if you say number ? you can stick now in
there similarly if you define your own
class it is nullable by default but if
you say your class bang you can take the
null out of the type not really it's
yeah no I guess it provides to to kind
of notions it's useful to be able to
express whether or not as a legal value
or not and that depends really much very
much of what you're doing the difference
in the defaults it's kind of similar to
what Java does and and yeah for string
we actually have if you're familiar with
the JavaScript currently has stirring
and stirring wrappers we actually have
three string classes we have the
lowercase string which is just a string
not knowable we have a uppercase string
which is the current string wrapper
which is kind of fairly useless and very
confusing to people and so then we have
a third class which is the union of the
two which is you know like any string
and that one is just for backwards
compatibility we were starting a fresh
we would just have a lot of a string
there is also the way to say weather app
amateur type is optional so you can say
T equals it's kind of in the corner
there and this will mean that this
parasitic is optional and it can only
appear in functional types which we'll
get to on the next
in fact your signatures so here are just
some examples boolean ? you can put in
all into equals null is an error because
it doesn't include know the date object
can be knowable and here's an example of
a functional type with an optional
integer parameter so functional type are
there to give information about
higher-order functions that are being
passed in a function and they're kind of
like standard functional types the only
two editions are a support for variable
length argument which is exactly the
same as what Java has the three dots in
Java and since functions can be used as
constructors there's needs to be away in
the syntax to be able to tell to the
type system what kind of expression you
get when you instantiate this function
so you can say this and this function is
going to create a volume
parameters types are just like generics
in C++ or Java with syntax is ever so
slightly different here at death before
the opening and less than to cut down on
some of the ambiguity remember the
ambiguities you can type def generic
parameter type the map of key and values
should be familiar to all of you from
other languages it's just a hash table
you can define your own classes which
are also generic parameters by types or
in generic you type since you can use
generics in and if they obvious ways
yeah so the question was what is the
type of generic function it's when you
declare a generic function you must the
first thing you must say is you know the
generic function declaration which is
generic function and give it a parameter
list to every instance every overload of
this function must have parameter types
which are subtypes of the initial
definition so I would assume that attack
of a generic function is the initial
definition it might not resolve if you
call it with some arguments combinations
but soon that would be the logical type
for it
yeah you guess you can put a dot yes you
can have our trespasses and parameters
functions you must instantiate it with a
type to get a faction of a specific type
I don't know how far up the type hair
metal hierarchy we want to go then to
combine old features with new features
there's like in rap so this is for our
the valley script variants of ECMO
script so like types provide a
precondition so if you say that a
variable is of like type in then it's
going to be like an int but just at one
point in time it doesn't give any
warranty on the evolution of this
variable so it's useful if you want to
have some API that talks with legacy
code you've got some precondition on
entry to the function but you've got no
guarantees on the evolution the rebbe on
the other hand does a precondition check
and then adds an object around the value
so that it can prove that the evolution
of this variable is going to follow the
wrapped type so like is when you have a
black parameter in let's say usually
like string in a function the function
will allow we have various things which
kind of in current ECMO script behave
like strings and they will pass them
through and molesta to the function if
you say wrap string then it will still
allow the same set of things but it will
coerce them at the point of entry to the
function into an actual into the type
that you said so it's kind of
a coercion operator we go so like is
this precondition and compared to sudo
Java it's basically doing an instant
soft check before and since data is not
Noble also checking for not null ability
so nothing fancy so some more syntactic
yes
I
the types are checked the question is so
you know without the like operator what
happens if you if you don't declare if
you don't you put types any parameters
then we know it's anything goes if you
do put that type in your parameter then
the language is much stricter about what
you can pass in there so like is a way
of relaxing some of this strictness to
allow similar looking things and we're
similar looking things is defined by the
language to you get accepted so I guess
the putting just the type in there is
this the strictest and then like is a
little more flexible and rap is really
flexible well rap is just like like
except that it will coerce so it will
convert a value into the type so now
some more syntactic sugar the foreign
construct now don't enumerate all
properties but objects can be iterative
balls and produce an iterator so that
they can protect some of their
properties or give some consistent view
of how you can iterate over them so
we're providing in addition 34 in ours a
trace of other properties and here we're
introducing an iteration framework so
individual classes can define or you can
define your own it iterator kinds and
the 4-h is really standard just syntax
there's also this so the generator is
how you define the iterator framework
yeah so basically there's a new keyword
yield which produces a temporary turn
creates a new iterator so what this code
would produce is an infinite number of
numbers starting against you sir these
things have been around for a long time
in non mainstream languages yeah yeah
yeah I guess by FERC has them too so
miscellaneous cleanups we did to the
standard will require implementations to
be pale recursive under specific
conditions where it makes sense we'll
have exploration closures so a function
if you define a local lambda like here
it doesn't need to contain a statement
you can just put an expression in there
and what it means is as though you had
said open brace return x times X closed
brace we also have our a comprehension
switch our way of generating an array
from a generic expression so the
probably the most reported bugs in to
the browser vendors at least Mozilla the
earth you know people complaining that
the arithmetic is broken they do things
like call to fixed and a number
complained that it rounds the wrong way
or complain that's 14 points to 8 times
9 it gives you 1 28.5 one and a whole
bunch of nines and
and that this is actually mandated by
the standard the standard says that you
shall follow I to police a 54 arithmetic
which and that is what I dibbley 754
arithmetic does that's a that's not what
people expect and this has been a thorn
in our side for a long time so in
addition for we will also support the F
coming I a typically 754 our standard
which uses base 10 arithmetic instead of
Base to for floating point numbers and
so this will be you'll be able to enable
this locally and a within a scope by
using a pragma so we'll have two types
of numbers two types of floating-point
numbers nom goodall's you know I Triple
E devils and we'll also have the decimal
for the void members yes we yes we
consider this mean we've been arguing
about this for years that's this you
know this was on the table that's it was
not well-liked as an approach as a
solution these are various library
additions some controversial some notes
the map class is essentially a hash
table without exception well I you could
say that current objects are hash tables
that's not quite you know they have some
special name property since which can
cause trouble if you try to set them so
we're introducing a dense typed non
resizable vector class there is a
proposal for an optional stack walking
library it would it would only walk
those frames which you explicitly
annotated it wouldn't let you pick at
all of them this is a let's also
debatable
some of us some of us like a some of us
don't in this trip movie will be this
mode where you can where you get type
checking and static analysis that checks
for various things calling functions
assigning to non-existent variable
redefining your const things like that
so well just to clarify you get pipe
checking always so if you say you you
know if if you have expression has a
type but you always get the pipe check
but this there are things in addition
three which we must retain for
compatibility such as one of these
things include well if you misspell a
local variable in your program you
suddenly create a global out of thin air
and so stick mode is designed to warn
about things like that if a program
passes stick mode then it will behave
exactly the same way as though you
didn't use sick note so it does not
change what the you know statements do
other than giving you static warnings
this one exception to this which that is
if you say valve and stick notice there
are some interactions between a violent
stick mode which I are beyond the scope
of this talk yes
yes
yeah so it was a very fun one in a week
yeah I wish I could get rid of with
statements mean they're on Abaddon up
abomination in addition three now I
cannot for compatibility however we did
one thing which might address some of
this and that is we introduced the
concept of a typed with statements it's
just if you give in the with statement
you will be able to give an expression
and a type and the type the
implementation will then see the type it
will know what the properties of the
objects are statically so it will be
able to detect things like that yes so I
don't understand the design constraints
once you have the use with you straight
pragma presence of you straight fragment
you can turn all things that would work
in Echo scary bit early but that are
considered about oh I can't you just
simply consider wit as a whole to be a
bug in egg biscuit 3 that's turned off
by the you straight rush well we that's
what's one possibility so I so you know
what you know it's I don't think we'll
go there but this is something that to
be considered as you know whether to use
three extra to enough with an eval now
that I'm legitimately uses for these
things I'm not in favor of an untyped
with after a pipe with this much less
harmful because you can actually you can
look at the type and see what's binding
series reducing statically it's
now we can debate whether this good
programming practice or not since
various people of the committee have
different views about it and then I
really personally I see much of an
advantage of it then last point about
compatibility some little things that
change the neck misfit for that were
valued a necklace with three redefining
the native values of the language like
redefining undefined then alert will
spit out for instead of undefined there
was also some key words which are being
reserved so if you're saying that your
program is an ECMO script for program
using some mint I for some global value
then this code will not work whereas it
would work in acma script for yes for
keywords we have this debate a long time
ago you know it is possible to define a
new language without introducing any new
keywords it's not going to be pretty and
so it would be very confusing because
you need to use punctuation for you know
various language features and we decided
that it's it would just be too ugly to
be usable so we are introducing several
new keywords in acma script edition for
so and so what that means is out of the
web if you have an additional four
script you must use a mime type or some
other method data to tag it as addition
for otherwise the browser will think
it's addition three
is this going to say that they yes yes
and in fact I think one of them will be
able to eval skips of the other kind of
vice versa and it was it where there's
quite a bit of fun you can have that the
question was you know can addition to be
in addition for scripts coexist on the
same page web page of the answer is yes
guess the last quark is a removal of a
bug that to reg ex that the same
radiation the same place in the program
is the same object so this code produces
true and false in es3 but true and true
and yes for which is basically what you
would expect so this yeah it's a little
contentious now now this is called a bug
where if you have an regular in acma
script you know it's unfortunate but
regular expression the objects or
literals have mutable properties and
these movable properties include such as
if you're doing a global search and then
we're along the string are you at and so
when you parse an addition three program
whenever you see a slash slash regular
expression literal that creates a
particular object it and it creates that
object once and only once so if you
reach the same place in the source code
again you'll get the same object which
has this mutable a property now this was
actually not a bug this was intentional
in addition three but now they're
thinking of doing it the other way where
each time you evaluated you get a
different separate regular expression
object so this is also slightly
controversial
okay thanks so yes
was it
well it's I was there when it happened
the first time around it was intentional
so you would avoid having to create lots
of objects
yes
click click ok the question is what's
what's a parent s model it's single
inheritance very similar to java not
appalling so you can have multiple
interfaces single graphic artists yes
have a question to see what our
performance implications of addition for
the goal is to have performance which is
as good or better than before we are
introducing things like vector types
some integer types and so on which will
allow an implementation to perform
better than existing echo script on some
classes of programs now you will
probably be able to find something them
some programs which might be slower than
before I don't have any important
classes of applications which fall into
that category where you would actually
care but there is nothing in the
language I'm aware of which would make
it needlessly slow yes the question is
are integers unlimited precision that's
open to slight debate the current
thinking is no we will have 32-bit
integers I was hoping for today at least
get 65 n integers in there to the
difficulties you run into is if you you
know what is if you have a cost of 15
it's currently you know thought of as a
double so if you had an unlimited
precision integer and added 15 to it
you'd see a Dan an integer to a double
you get a double out it just so it
things get very confusing very quickly
so for integers it's as though you were
doing their arithmetic as doubles I
believe and that's yeah where is really
given the addition 3 semantics there is
no good solution to this that i can
think of each you can optimize for one
thing and so then the other thing will
screw you or you can optimize for B and
then a will screw you yes so let's say I
have a piece of ps4 that imports a
module that defines class employee yes
and then somewhere in there i avow a
piece of code that return that
internally imports that same audio good
mighty Pleasant for you creates an
instance
and returns ish and then I get the
return value of that about does that
return value match as an instance of the
employee that I've imported in other
words is there an inter BM notion of
type that's bound to where that came
from identifier yes if you import if you
import a unit then you'll get one copy
of an employee class so and the
instances you know will be instances of
that class and so you will not have
separates employee classes and running
around the system now if you just start
availing things it's as though you hit
multiple definitions of something in
your objects so if you define a class
twice we get an error yeah yeah if
you've ever unit then you I believe
you'll get the same one so yes
ok the question is when little browser
start supporting this and is it
available internally so some parts of
this are already supported by Firefox
today the beer to get ahold of we have
there's a reference implementation which
you can get from acma script at argh and
we have a local copy of it within google
so you can play with the reference
implementation curiously enough is
written in standard ml and it's for is
to help us so very first implementation
is built for it's optimized for being a
good cementing match to the spec so it's
to help us with spec writing your other
than you know to try to be particularly
efficient or guys to have somebody would
implement this in practice there's been
aI don't want to speak for Microsoft fit
I've heard that they won't push it in
ie7 for sure maybe I EA and there's some
debate as to whether akma script for
will make it in IE browser at all yeah
now the company is heavily involved in
this are Adobe opera is there and there
Mozilla is what is there so there will
be I expect you know I can't really
speak for them but I expected there will
be some implementations of this soon
after get adopted yes
is there also
the question is is you know who is
working on solving the real problem
which is a dumb in okay I agree this is
very old problem and we're not working
on it I mean you know you're welcome to
start something if you like the politics
will be quite brutal
you
okay how will the question is you know
how will applications writers take
advantage of this well I mean the if you
know what browser you're running in when
you can serve an application optimized
for the browser well if you don't know
well I mean you can get site ed tech sub
how you can you know go for at least
common denominator if you're in you have
to cut days it if you're in places like
cell phones you might know quite a bit
about what you're running on
so there will be there will be fairly
simple answer blessed ways of detecting
what kind of information you're running
under there's a second question you
might ask which is you know what would
an implementer do with he have an equity
position three engines here and an
addition for engine here I would expect
not you could do it that way I will
expect there to be just a single engine
which understands addition for syntax
and because I'm out and we should
understand the addition three centers
yes
yes we have several
Oh same standards
you are a browser
probably want to accept as much as you
can because
some point furious at the lowest
poor to get even larger
general so it can also be kind
strict as possible
yes so you have a very important point
just to repeat for our audience the
comment you made is that this is a
complex system and various
implementations may interpret this
differently and the standard may allow
some wiggle room so and implementation
implementers have incentive to be as
permissive as possible to allow you know
mistakes and so on and still make sense
out of them so at least he can render
the webpage well that's yes there is a
lot of this pressure and this pressure
has you know in things like HTML and CSS
you know this kind of pressures caused
the mess of the web but were in right
now now so personally I think that the
things us to be spelled out and off to
be you know written down and as strict
as possible where where it makes sense
so you now know what our choices for
evolution of the language well or are
there are several I mean you could not
do things like this joint work and have
each implementation kind of play around
with extensions and hope to get some
place and so I claim that you'd have
more divergence if you did that so this
work is beneficial to the to that extent
and for features for specific features
we have debates about how strict should
the implementation be
like we just had one recently about what
happens if you have a let variable and
access it before it's defined and I
should an implementation be permissive
and sometimes lets you do that or should
its you know be required to give you an
error so these are the kinds of
decisions we're facing in and we're very
much aware that's getting this wrong
will lead to the kind of mess that's you
described
so any other questions okay thank you
thanks
