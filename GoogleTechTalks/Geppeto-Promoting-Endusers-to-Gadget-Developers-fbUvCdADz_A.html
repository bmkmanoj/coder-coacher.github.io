coming today I know that San Francisco
has a much more exciting thing going on
right now but I believe you won't be
disappointed that you spend some time
with us today and we have here yakiv
corolla who is just starting as an
intern in new york city and we have even
jus jack who had his internship with the
gadgets team not so long ago and made
some impressive contributions to the
team at the time when he was here he
they launched the entry gadget
communication API the first the first
version of it so they're going to be
talking today about something they've
been working and which is supported by
the Google University Grants Program
they proposed an extension of some of
the work they've been doing with the
gadgets team and you know like the
background of this is sort of
interesting you know I give you if you
if you became a programmer as a kid like
I did not in university not in high
school but really early then you know I
grasping some computer concepts it's not
actually trivial and the idea of you
know like having a lot of users using
computers goes actually back all the way
to Charles Babbage and actually Ada
Lovelace who envisioned the world were
in like a lot of people will use this
thinking machines and mesh with them you
know like in a lot of different ways
later on during said something to the
contrary he veered into a direction
because he had practical machines to
work with well no not really I mean
there's going to be a Casti of
programmers and then a lot of people
feeding these machines I think the
pendulum may be swinging swinging back
because of the advances that the like
major advances in technology in the last
decades and I think we're in like about
two maybe enter a world were programming
and mashing up things and come
with new applications for computers the
barrier for that may be lowered you know
like to to eat mer mortals as some of us
would say I think I think that's a
pretty interesting idea you know like
what you will see today is perhaps the
first scratch of it there will be a demo
but I think I think it goes in the right
direction and I think these guys and
professors or bleach who is leading the
whole team at a university of zagreb
would really value your feedback off you
know like how do you see this you know I
can what direction this should be taking
so let me stop here and to give the
floor to these guys please welcome them
okay thank you for sabotaging the google
i/o event in San Francisco and coming
here to listen to us so my name is you
Andrew Jack with me are ya crawl
professor search and even govern from
the university of zagreb that's in
croatia a small nano country in europe
and today we're going to talk about I'm
choosers developing gadgets and maybe
it's not interesting to people that
don't develop gadgets but you can see it
as an extension in the near future for
developing web pages so let's get
rolling so our team in Zagreb has eight
full full-time PhD students with led by
Professor sturbridge and we had a lot of
experience with Google and other
companies most of us have been interest
in Google in virus team like gadgets
Rosetta and check out and tricks and
professor Sir douche has a lot of
experience in the Silicon Valley he was
working at AT&amp;amp;T Bell research labs that
UC Irvine University of Toronto we had
cooperation with cisco and ericsson also
we have to rule research grants awards
for two of our projects one of which i'm
going to talk about today the first one
and the second one is the unified
translation memory project which is
about developing a open-source
distributed translation memory system
oops
so we started this research about five
years ago and it started with
experimenting with service-oriented
architectures and we developed two
systems named by and husky which we
presented here in Google a few years ago
and this resistor is based composition
environments and from that we moved on
to gadgets and you end users developing
gadgets and we reserve the reward for
our research and talk about today so
before we give the demo we want to talk
about the motivation behind our research
why is it important to let end-users
develop gadgets what are the problems
and what are the possibilities of this
and after then we're going to leave some
time for Q&amp;amp;A so most of you have
probably used gadgets has those little
web pages you can put on other web pages
you have calendars at our advertising
Maps pregnancy countdown tickers and
stuff and just a few years gadgets have
been around just for years these gadgets
have become extremely popular you can
have them on any web page they have more
than hundreds of thousands of gadgets
and more than thousands millions of
users and billions of pages every week
but it's just looking at the raw numbers
enough because Facebook has a lot of
growth lately they have a lot of
applications but as you can see from
these numbers from O'Reilly they have
really uneven distribution of users over
these gadgets so it's very unbalanced
thing and just looking at this numbers
you probably can't tell if this is good
or bad and for whom is it good or bad
for the users for facebook or something
and we can help ourselves by looking
back and learning from our experience
with companies like Google Amazon eBay
and the thing they learned is something
that Chris Andersen called the long tail
and this theory explains that there is a
huge value in providing access to low
popular products and you can see it is
an example from amazon pretty don't make
money just from selling the top 20% best
sellers they make a lot of money from
selling
lot of unpopular books to a lot of
people so for example Boris could be
interested in air guitars or skydiving
or something with other but there's a
lot of you buying that stuff just
interesting just for you and this
experience tells us that if we extend
the long tail we could create a new
market for these gadgets which would be
more interesting to attract different
kinds of people and make app you use it
because they're finding the gadgets they
want like buying a book that you want
for air guitar or skydiving or something
like that and happier users means you
can find out you can probably find a way
to monetize this attention there from
market segmentation or something so we
just need to figure out who will develop
all these gadgets in the long tail
because we know who will develop the
best gadgets you can't let someone
without programming skills develop
calendar gadgets or male gadget this is
sensitive stuff but the longtail gadgets
have a possibility to be developed by
end users so up until now only
developers have been developing gadgets
using HTML and JavaScript and end users
don't know that but if we could find a
way to collect end users develop gadgets
there could be a huge opportunity in
this so first of all there is a lot of a
lot more of end users than professional
developers and although they don't know
HTML Javascript Java C++ or something
that are they have some specific domain
knowledge vertical knowledge which they
can use to create better gadgets like
financial gadgets or bookstores gadget
or air guitar gadgets or something and
if in the even even if they don't have
this knowledge they can personalize or
customize these gadgets for themselves
and this is just the majority of the
longtail gadgets which tell us that
these gadgets are not used by majority
of users but they are used by a small
number of users and there's a lot of
them because there's a lot of you the
users the the consumer market is huge
for these long tail gadgets and if we
make this process simple and easy you
get disposable gadgets which means you
can create a gadget just for one purpose
and throw it away when you're done is it
should be that simple to make gadgets
and you get instant gratification for
free which means you don't have to wait
for a developer to develop these gadgets
and if we want to develop old all these
long tail gadgets we need to make
building edge this simple as using edges
and this is because and you just only
know how to use gadgets they don't know
how they work they don't know what the
infrastructure behind them is you only
know how to click a button enter a text
in the text box so this is the challenge
and Google does have something like this
they have the iGoogle gadget maker which
is a programming free form based
environment for creating gadgets so you
can create a predefined set of gadget
types like photo albums cut down gadgets
just by entering like a URL tour picasa
web album and you get a gadgets in just
a few seconds but with this you get only
predefined types of gadgets and you're
wondering at least we were wondering in
Zagreb if we can do something better if
you can improve this process and get
something more than just pretty fine
gadgets so we're thinking about how to
end users perceive gadgets or web pages
or general web services and their
perceived is this web service through
this gadget for the interface of the
gadget and developers know that behind
this web service stands an API which
they use to create this user interface
which the end users use but the end user
is not only about the UI and through
this metaphor you can you can understand
that and users perceive this UI as the
product as the gadget so using actions
using interface actions these actions
are actually the language which end
users perceive as the API for for
gadgets or for webpages generally and
this is the idea with which we started
pedal which is our environment for
developing gadgets and this is it was
actually a quest for finding knowledge
and end users which they already have
and making and use this knowledge to
in an easy way so not meeting and learn
something new like programming or
threads or synchronization like
mechanisms and this quest leads us let
us do four basic questions how our
gadgets generally created how do we
define an interface for these gadgets
how do you define the logic behind
gadgets and is there a need to define
time ordering relations in this gadgets
so I'll just lead you through the key
decisions in our methodology so in
Gepetto we use gadget composition as
general methodology for developing
gadgets and this means you start off
with a few elementary gadgets which you
already have on let's see on your
iGoogle page so you have a few existing
gadgets and you compose them into a new
gadget which we call the composite
gadget so you start with a few gadgets
you end up with a composite catch and
first off you need to create an
interface for their schedule and these
are things the easiest thing to do for
the end user is to create the interface
by reusing elements of the interface
from existing gadgets so you just pick
some elements from the existing gadgets
and your drag and drop into a new blank
gadget which is start up so you define
the interface using elements from
existing gadgets and now you need to
define the logic of the creative gadget
and here's where we use this idea that
the language which end users understand
is the language of interface actions
over the user interface of gadgets or
web pages so for example wait for a
click click a button copy paste data
from text box or something like that so
let me just give you an example so let's
say you want to wait for a button click
on a gadget so the end users understand
this just as I said it wait for a click
so we use this language in our
methodology to write something like this
and this means wait for someone to click
the Go button at this gadget so the
syntax maybe not the most appropriate
for work for end users but you can
imagine a better abstraction for the
syntax or maybe images or icons for this
but underneath this is what's what's
going to be going gone also let's say
you want to copy paste some data from a
text box to a larger text box in another
gadget this is what the end user sees or
perceives mentally so we want to
transfer this in in a sentence or a
statement like this stock price from
this gadget transfer it to stock price
at destination gadget it should be a
really close match to the mental idea of
the end user what's going on and let's
say the user wants to click a button you
say click go button add some gadget and
that's it and we can't we came to the
question where we wanted to what you
wanted to answer end this question was
do we doing do we need to order this
events in time so we define some events
like click a button copy paste some data
etc but is there a need to say something
should happen before something else is
this something that end-users need to
define and if you think about it there
is actually need to do this let's say
you have a finance gadget which buys and
sell stocks anyone you want to buy some
stock before selling some other stock
there is no way where it's extremely
hard to to let the computer guess this
is going to happen before something else
because you can't guess it from the data
flow from the data and this is something
that I know as a developer in my mental
process for defining this gadget so
there is a need to the let end-users
define time ordering between these
events and the only challenge is how to
present this visually to end-users to it
is simple enough for them to use and
this is because they don't know threads
or synchronization mechanism or
something and what we came to is that
end-users know only about two types of
ordering in time and this is first is a
sequential events so we know that
something happens before or after
something else
and independence which means that event
a can happen in any order of event B and
this is all you need and this is all the
end users perceive and what we do in
Geppetto is organized dis events in a
grid layout and this grid time flows
from left to right and from top to
bottom and if you want to have
sequential events you put event a above
event B if it should happen before event
B or you put it all left of events which
would happen after if you want to have
independent events you put them
separately with blank cells between them
so event E is independent of an F what
event C is before event d then you
organize your logic in this grid you get
a sequence of you get a set of sequences
and what this means is event a one
happens before event a two and before
event a five but event a 1 and C 1 are
independent so they can go they can
execute parallel so these sequences are
independent and what you can see also
from this grid is it's not cluttered
with connectors most the layouts you use
on the web you'll see a lot of graphical
styles which use connectors which become
a rather complicated for users when it
starts to scale up and this is the whole
process of defining a gadje so we
started with a composite gadget which is
blank you pick a set of elementary
gadgets or existing gadgets which you'll
use in your composite gadget you pick a
set of interface elements you drag and
drop into your composite gadget and then
you define your events through this grid
and that's it you have a new gadget
before we get the demo don't just show
you a bit of internals so how this works
when you put a gadget on a page how does
it execute so you have a program a set
of events you defined and what we did is
we implemented an engine we should put
in the composite gadgety
the new gadget you created which
executes this program so what happens is
this engine reads this program and
interprets this events and execute sit
by calling methods on these gadgets so
it uses the functionality of the
elementary gadgets to achieve its
functionality so let me just show you
what these needs so the purpose of this
composite gadget is to you enter a stock
symbol like Google or Yahoo or Microsoft
and you fetch the stock price from the
google finance gadget and you should end
you'd fetch the mini chart showing the
stock history from the mini chart gadget
and you display it on your new gadget so
we start off by saying okay wait for
someone to click the Go button on this
gadget so the engine blocks until the
user clicks the button so when the user
clicks the button we have a statement
which transfers the entered stock symbol
to the elementary gadgets so we said
okay let's fetch the goog stock we say
to the company's gadget that we want to
click the go and add buttons so can
fetch the data from the back end so the
existing gadgets refreshed and the last
thing we need to do is to fetch this
data to the composite gadget and we
fetch adjust the stock price and the
minute chart and that's how it works and
now yuck will give the devil
hi my name is yaakov and i'll give the
demo but before we show you a live demo
will give you a short preview of the
next version of our tool so this first
part is not yet fully implemented but it
gives an idea how simple it will be to
create gadgets here implemented Geppetto
to work on iGoogle so what you can see
here is google finance gadget step and
we want to create our own gadget out of
these finance gadgets so first we click
add stuff and add new empty composite
gadget okay so this new empty composite
gadget has two buttons designing
show/hide design starts the process of
creating gadget and show hide hides the
allometric elementary gadgets videos and
shows only the composite cached so let's
create a new gadget out of these two
gadgets google finance and mini charts
drop-down menu is shown which will guide
you through this process so first thing
we have to do is define the interface of
the new composite gadget we do that by
drag and dropping the elements on
elementary gadgets so with drag-and-drop
text box go button stock price text
element from google finance gadget and
charge from mini charts okay so we
define the interface and now we have to
define the logic of this new gadget that
is what the gauge does we want that when
user clicks the go button and stock
quote from this text box and composite
gadgets is transferred to text boxes on
elementary gadgets the stock price and
stock chart refreshed and results are
shown on the new composite gauged okay
so let's define the logic first we click
the Go button which creates a sequence
of actions for this element you can see
the sections here to the right and first
action edit is a quick wait for click
action after that we can add some other
actions like read write or click action
first via the read/write action we
reads the stock quote from the text box
on a composite gadget and transfer it to
the text box on the Google Finance
gadget and there you can see action edit
to this actions list after that we had a
click action that clicks the Go button
which refreshes the stock price element
and lastly readwrite which reads the new
refreshed stock price and the transferee
seats to the composite sketch so that's
we can click finish because we define
how the stock price is refreshed and now
can we now we can do the same in stock
chart so we click wait for click action
we had read right which reads the stock
quote transfers it to the mini charts
quick action which clicks add that
refreshes the stock chart and read right
which reads the Refresh stock stock
chart and write it here after the
composite gauged and that's it so as you
can see it will be that simple to create
engaged and now we're going to show you
a live demo so this first part is the is
not yet it's not yet fully implemented
but it gets it gives you an idea how
simple to be so this is the live demo of
what what we have accomplished so far we
can try it so for example let's write
general electric's go and should get
okay something is not going good with
cookies so I'm going to login again
okay I google page we have composite
gadget called demo one it loads
elementary gadgets that we use gets
gooey now should be all ok so let's find
out things about Google stocks ok so
this stock would quote was transferred
to these text boxes on elementary
gadgets and we pick up the refreshed
values for stock price and stock chart
to this compost gadget we can hide this
elementary gadgets with show/hide button
so which is nice if we have more
elementary gadgets and we can test it
with Yahoo stocks hmm something's not
going well but it worked just few
seconds ago ok so let's try it let's go
to the editor we click on the design
button wed when we want to edit or
design a new gadget so this editor
consists of three screens with sheets
and form for loading and saving gadgets
so this first sheet defines a list of
gadgets that we use this is the logical
name for elementary gadgets we used we
use and this is the URL to its
specification this logical name you use
it to reference stopped gf's talking
four wheels to reference the finance
gadget ngf chart the miniature sketched
we will need that when we when we want
to define the logic of the gauged second
sheet is where we defined the elements
on the interface of this new composite
gadget we use the HTML attributes title
which is nice because when when we mouse
over the element get it pops up the
title so we will use text box with title
symbol on
final skagit button go and dry
settlement also from the finest gadgets
and the charge phone mini charts the
third sheet is repetitive program the
logic but the gauger does at this moment
we need to fill this sheet manually but
as you've seen in the next version it
will be the automatic by point and click
on the interfaces elements on the
interface of the gadget so we have a
sequence of actions here each action
execute after the previous one if you
want them to be ordered but if he has
even said some actions don't need to be
in any order so it can be they can
execute in any order so we can write
them anywhere we want so for example we
can split this sequence in two parts the
first part we will be related to a
refreshing the stock price and the other
one too refreshing the stock chart so I
will going to show you how this works we
define another sequence you which also
waits for the click on the Go button
then stock quote is transferred to the
charts we click the button which
refreshes the chart and the result we
take back to take back back the result
to the compressed gadget so now we have
two sequences which will do exactly the
same but okay we need to save it for
example demo to
we close the editor come back to the
ghoul
now this composite gets loads it's
Elementary gadgets we use the same
gadgets that we only wrote a program in
another way we can test it wit for
example general electric's
and now we can also add another gadget
for example if you want this price in
yours and not in dollars so we should
add some currency converter now we can
call it CC we need URL to this gadget
convert
ok this is URL we don't need any
elements on the way we can use the same
as before but now when the price is
refreshed on the finance gadget we don't
transfer it to these composite gadgets
but you transfer it to the input at CC
this new gadget then we click the
convert convert button on this new
currency converter and the new value
from CC to text element on composite
gadget
this is the key this is the key word for
the composite gauged okay yes quick we
can call it demo tree
you close it
we have here some simple currency
converter some gadgets let's not
Google's and we can test it for example
fool so this value stock price 20 it's
not here 2716 is the price in Euro 1755
and that's it that's them of like them
of what we have accomplished so far and
now even will give a conclusion about
Geppetto okay before going on I just
want to mention that all this designing
the new gadget should be done
automatically in the next version so
filling out these three sheets will be
done by clicking on the UI of the
eggroll page and this will be more user
friendly friendly so so this may be a
lot of resembles with mashups you see
that we mash data from a lot of gadgets
but this is not our intention with which
we started this project and the idea is
to create a tool which end users can use
to create gadgets or maybe in the future
web pages and you have a lot of these
tools on the web what we wanted to
create a tool which would be and
user-friendly and end-user developer
friendly and for us this means that the
tool should satisfy a set of criteria
which we define through our research of
both both cognitive and computer
sciences and i'll just go briefly
through through them and most of all
most of these tools are based on blocks
so you have a lot of blocks of existing
functionality we choose to create new
blocks and what we think is important is
that and users already understand or
know are familiar with this blocks like
in the case of gadgets you don't
introduce new abstractions for elements
they use you use existing elements what
is also important is that these blocks
are self-contained which means that they
can use this blocks outside the
environment which they use to develop
the block so for example I can take the
gadget out of the iGoogle page or other
viral
out of our environment it put it on some
other page and use it there also it's
very familiar to end users to reuse
applications which they built in further
building new applications and for using
the same method the same metaphor for
using gadgets and wiring them together
so if you can achieve a metaphor for
wiring gadgets together the same as
using the gadget this will be very good
for end-users and what we did in
Geppetto is using the user interface
actions to wire this gadgets together
it'll be really simple for end-users if
you don't have different kinds of wiring
elements depending on the type of
gadgets or a number of gadgets to use so
for example if you use a map gadget you
have some set of actions you can do and
if you use a finance gadget you have
some other set of actions you can do
it's really complicated you just have to
you need to have fin its fin estate of
basic actions which end users can use
and learn and reuse again you don't have
to learn new ones after that you want to
use some other gadget one thing is
really important Geppetto is to have end
users defined their time ordering of the
process they have defined cognitively in
their mind and just put it on the
spreadsheet we use and last we want to
have full scale viral construct
constructability which means not limit
the users to earth in the state of
things they can do with the wiring
elements we would just want to let them
do whatever they want in the future we
want to work mostly of all on our
interface making more humor center and
work on edge to get you that data
management which means if you want to
transfer some data from different
elements like from a text box to a label
or text box to a table or a span we
don't want to burden the end user right
with conversions you want to do this
automatically and in terms of research
we want to tie our research together
with cloud computing and
specifically research how this could be
executed scalable in the cloud research
what is what are the problems of content
ownership and advertising for example if
you have to gadgets mashed up in a new
gadget and you use this data from the
existing gadgets there's a question of
ownership of this data you don't know
who owns the data and by using Boris's
data does he let me use his data what if
I'm like making money from his data it's
a it's an honor unresolved issue and
that's it thank you for attention and if
you have questions please feel free to
ask yes this is going to be public so
let's keep the confidential kind of
questions for the end of the session go
ahead to the elementary gadget FP
present once the composite guises
they are present but they're not visible
you can hide them but they have to be
presence is the sorry so the question
was if the elementary gadget should be
present on the page with the composite
gadget so the answer is yes because we
use the functionality of the elementary
gadgets to achieve the functionality of
composite gadget so the limit your
gadget provide the computation power for
our composite gadget I'm sir right
behind you i Sedan juices doesn't have
to be burning with all the gadgets and
the interfaces and clutter with all the
gadgets kept go ahead to do some
calculations which results from veteran
gas
it's like an example you know you had
all that if you get it's doing all the
work good let's say
they either want to get results from too
long when you gather them have those
brittle yeah so you want to do
computation inside the grid yeah yeah so
the question was if we can do you fetch
data from different elementary gadgets
for example currencies or some data and
you want to compute this data without
sending it to another gadget yeah well
you can't do that so the premise is that
the grid is used only for the layout of
the events you want to write and you've
use only the gadgets for to provide the
computation for the composite casual
because using this people really like a
spreadsheet we want to integrate some
spreadsheet functionality in the grid
and this is a lot of users notice
because they use spreadsheets but a lot
of users don't and we think that the
same functionality you would want to
provide in the spreadsheet in the layout
could be provided as a separate gadget
which you could use to composite the new
gadget so we want to keep it simple in
the in the layout yeah go ahead time
goes boat down into the right in that
grid but this seems like users going to
make branches what
one wait for quick and that was treated
right away yeah so let me go back i'll
repeat okay so the question was what we
want to do branching and the in the
spreadsheet or if we wanna so so let's
say then a one had another event on its
right right so we actually want to do
this in the next version and this would
be a perfect example of branching like
you said and this is a really super for
end-users to do and what would what
would happen is invent a one would
execute and after it event a 2 and the
event on the right would execute execute
after it so well this is this is really
simple to understand but we want to take
it step by step because it's really
sensitive to know what end users can
perceive as as a branch because and you
just don't notice as a branch and they
don't know variable there in the
functions the wilds or force it is
really sense to work but yeah it's it's
it's going to be happen in the future
you know yeah execution engine actually
has it
oh good so if you actually worked
properties in addition string
concatenation or something for easier
reasons to proceed our separate address
directly as one image features so the
question was if we just yeah we think it
may be because some some users don't
know spreadsheets they don't know
they'll have to learn the functions for
it so they have to learn the syntax and
the statements for writing add multiply
or something else but if they have the
gadget which they know what does like a
calculator gadget they know what does
and it's really simple to reuse this dis
knowledge for them between language
features and gadget features I do have a
quick operator in your language yes why
so the question is how do we define the
boundary between the language features
and the gadget features so we want to
keep the language for defining the logic
as simple as possible which means no
computation in it so we don't want to
add a addition multiplication in the
language we just want to keep the
computation in other gadgets right
few more questions ok I think that's it
