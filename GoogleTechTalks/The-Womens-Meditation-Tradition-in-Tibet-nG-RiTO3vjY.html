announce one drug
visiting Google from Tibet on his first
trip to the west Rinpoche is here to
support the nuns of his nunnery gab chap
gumpa in tibet he's also here to support
relief efforts for the recent tibetan
earthquake that severely damaged regions
in tibet and particularly an orphanage
that his nunnery supports so very happy
to have Rinpoche here speaking at Google
today about these things I'd also like
to advise those of you who will be in
San Francisco tonight that Rinpoche will
be speaking at the urban Dharma Center
from 7:30 to 9:00 p.m. that's the Dharma
Punx if you're familiar with that
organization and so this presentation
will begin with Caterina DeRay giving a
brief presentation about the nuns of gab
Champa and then we'll turn over to
Rinpoche for a brief presentation and
then questions so thank you all very
much for attending and I'll turn it over
to Caterina now thank you it's really
wonderful to be here in our November
shades very very excited and it's like
even an earthquake in Tibet wasn't going
to stop him from coming here so I'll
just give you like a brief outline and
try to get some context of the spiritual
practitioners in the Tibetan Buddhism
lineage so maybe some of you are
familiar with this English woman her
name is Jade summer Tenzin palmo and
this book has become very popular in the
West in the last few years it's um it's
a story of her life written by Vicki
Burke Mackenzie and Tenzin palmo was I
think the second Western woman ever
ordained in the in the Tibetan Buddhist
tradition and she did it very
traditionally with her teachers and
actually did a 12-year retreat in a cave
in Lahore and so this is a shot when she
was actually in that cave Tenzin palmo
had really adept teachers and she also
had assigned for her meditation
instructors these very amazing Yogi's
who came out of Tibet in about 1958 and
when she was asking them about her
you know like where did they get their
incredible training from and how amazing
they were these Yogi's told her well if
you think we're great you should have
met our female counterparts and so I
think that was her clear guide that for
the rest of her life to try and revive
this female lineage in the West and to
start a nunnery who could train in this
incredible spiritual practice and she's
become renowned throughout the world for
raising the status of nuns you know she
often told me that Tibetan nuns in terms
of the social status were like at the
bottom of the barrel it was hard for me
to believe her but apparently this was
very true it's very hard for them to get
funding and to get any kind of status as
the as the men would so nunneries don't
get funded as much as the the male
counterparts and very very hard for them
to get spiritual training and philosophy
and all these things of course the Dalai
Lama adores her and respects her and she
has spoken at the United Nations and and
really really doing so much to raise the
status of of nuns throughout the world
then she went to Tibet two years ago in
search of women who had a really strong
practice in this yogic tradition that
she was looking for and that in her book
talks about this so she came to get yup
nunnery in Tibet she met one rock
rinpoche who is the abbot of this non
arre it has about 350 women currently
and so she was looking for one of the
elder nuns who still kept it throughout
time and here she is with one of the
nuns from the nunnery this nun has been
noted for her visionary adeptness
so let's go to where Rinpoche comes from
okay you have China here ember shape is
in this area here Yushu is where the
earthquake happened so you can see how
close he was so this is where the
earthquake epicenter was his nuns come
from this region so very close so during
the earthquake the nunnery was okay but
the temple was cracked Rinpoche was in
his home village when it struck and he
immediately jumped in a car with a lot
of the other monks and and drove at
breakneck speed to Yu Shu to literally
pull people from the rubble which is
what he did this is the view from the
nunnery it's at 14,000 feet
in 59 when things changed in Tibet the
nan we had about 800 to a thousand nuns
from what I have been told most of them
didn't survive a handful were put in
labor camps and stayed all that time
into the 80s and some escaped to caves
and managed to survive and keep their
practices going for 30 years and in the
80s when things relaxed and they were
able to do religious practices openly
these elder nuns grouped together and
started to rebuild an honour it was
completely flattened to the ground so
literally stone for stones started
putting their nunnery together and then
slowly slowly young women started to
come and also join the nuns there about
30 of those senior nuns now there's only
a handful left so these are some young
Nomad girls joining the nunnery they do
it of their own volition no one makes
them it's like an honor to be part of
this nan re when they join they do a lot
of domestic work for about the first
year so milking the yaks and and tending
to - things like that
and cooking
and as I was saying they're literally
still putting together their nunneries
stone for stone and that's another
project that Rinpoche is doing that he
needs to rebuild their temple because
there's no electricity there's no
windows and it's falling apart what's
unique about these women unlike many
other communities of nuns in Tibet and
outsider Tibet to be to be honest is
that they do keep a very pure lineage
that actually has been adapted for
females and there's no other group of
community of women probably in the world
that has this so they actually run the
rituals they lead the rituals they pass
on the rituals to one another
and they learned philosophy but in a
very very traditional way
the nuns also have a very rigorous form
of practice so most of them would do a
lot of their practices in these boxes
though three feet by three feet for
their entire lives
so they go to sleep there and they do
their practices there of course they're
doing other things during the day and
they also have refined yoga practices
that they do so they're not going to be
harmed in any way Tenzin palmo also did
this sort of practice of in 12 years
staying in a box like that upright
and they're in tiny little houses so you
have to each little house doing a
special practice is probably 21 to 23
nuns practicing like this in very close
proximity to each other sometimes for
like for their entire three-year retreat
their traditional retreat and sometimes
for the rest of their lives they would
practice like this so it's extremely
rigorous but the results are stunning
these are nuns who are about two and a
half years into their traditional
three-year retreat and they let their
hair grow during that time many of these
nuns too are expert in a practice called
two more and that became very well known
in the West in the 80s through
experiments conducted by a dr. Benson
Herbert sorry Herbert Benson who did
tests on these monks in Dharamsala and
could tell that they could raise their
body temperature by about 40 degrees or
something and these nuns get tested in
the winter when it's about minus 22
degrees Fahrenheit and they do this to
more practices inner heat practice which
can actually melt the snow and they put
like wet sheets on them and they can dry
five sheets in an hour so they're very
adept at producing this this heat and
it's interesting like in the West the
dalai lama had to really scramble to try
and find practitioners men who could do
this we're at this nunnery hundreds of
them can do it and do it really well
I call these women the gold metalist
Olympiads of training the mind these are
probably the only remaining elder nuns
from the pre 1959 days and these ones
hold the lineage and there are some
extraordinary stories on the web about
some of these nuns who are one in
particular shared some or who passed
away two years ago who Rimba she claims
she was about 103 years old and through
her whole process of dying remained
completely alert extremely happy knowing
exactly what was happening to her and
teaching her nuns as she was dying and
then when she actually died sitting
upright in meditation she passed away
sitting up and managed to stay in
meditation posture for seven full days
in the middle of winter minus 22 degrees
Fahrenheit her skin remained elastic and
her heart remained piping hot for a full
seven days after her death now for an
adept Tibetan Buddhist practitioner this
just happens this is what they can do
and it is a sign of the ultimate form of
their realization of their meditations I
think this one has also passed away
since and she also had incredible signs
at the passing of heard of her death
this elderly nun now is the head teacher
of the nunnery and this is the woman I
was telling you about who passed away
two years ago with extraordinary science
you can see stories of her on the web
and I think there are might just
finished because I think it's more
important that we actually talk more
about these nuns and how special they
are so I'll leave it over to remember

Tibet as it as it was and as it still is
today the the opportunities and choices
that are available to men and women in
general as well as those that are open
or available to monks and nuns in
particular are rather distinct there is
quite a large gap in terms of the the

so the the gate Champa was founded based
first and foremost on the understanding
that the potential for awakening or
Buddhahood that is the Buddha nature is
is equally present in all beings not to
mention equally present in both men and
women however notwithstanding that fact
the
the the opportunities for women to to
practice meditation for example to live
a lifestyle conducive to the to their
spiritual aspirations without impediment
and so on were practically non-existent
and and so it was in order to make that
possible
in other words to make it possible for
women to have the same opportunity to
realize their full inner potential their
Buddha nature that the gap chicawa was

then it so and traditionally as in today
as well there there have been and still
are memories as well as monasteries and
in principle they are founded on the
same principles and and ordered by the
same ideals but in Tibetan society in
general the interest that is shown
towards monks is much greater there much
people tend to be much more interested
in the business of monks that in the
then and then in the needs of nuns and
consequently the tendency has always
been that monasteries become wealthy and
influential in society whereas the
nunneries tend to be relatively deprived
and much less easily sustained and
supported Penda then a su chi o karna

that that you know the compa is

other words they're all free to join and

and its traditions and now member Shea
says that the one of the specific
hardships that that nuns or unmarried
women for example will experience in
Tibetan society is even if they stay at
home and depend on their parents for
example for support while they pursue
their practice when their parents died
once they find themselves without a
family then they're really they're
really vulnerable and don't really have

one unique tradition of this non re is
that the the practice of three retreat
which is a traditional form of retreat
practice or traditional length of time
of cloistered meditation practice in
Tibetan Buddhism is done within the
nunnery by groups of about 20 women at a
time and what's unique about their form
of three or retreat practice that they
all live in the same compound and they
all practice as well as sleep in the
same room for the for the full length of
of those three years and even though
they are in such a concentrated
situation they are practicing based on
love and compassion and bodhichitta or
the mind that aspires to to to reach
enlightenment or awakening and it's
because of that grounding motivation
that for the entire time that they're
living together in these close quarters
they they're very happy and they get
along extremely well and it is salah

there's a lot that there's a lot that
could be told about you know what makes
their practice in these three retreat so
special but for now given the time
limitations suffice it to say that what
they are most expert in and most justly
famous for is their practice of the
techniques involving the subtle energy

who've been practicing those techniques
of the subtle nerve channels and
energies and specifically the practice
of inner heat or - mo which allows them
to to survive and exist comfortably in
extremely cold conditions with a minimum
of clothing every year
the public is invited for a period of a
few days to come and see the nuns
demonstrate the level of their
accomplishment in this practice so it's
during the winter it's very very cold
it's well below zero Fahrenheit and the
nuns were adept and inner heat
have a special cloth which they dip
repeatedly in a bowl of water and then
wrap around themselves and they spend
several days of uninterrupted meditation
drying out this cloth again and again as
it means a demonstration of their of
their accomplishment and the public is
allowed to come and witness that in fact
they are able to do this so it's it's a
an actual fact that anyone can see dandy

this is something that anyone who's able
to to make it to the nunnery at this at
that time of year when they when they
are the public is invited to view the

that she will pass away within about
three days and as soon as she understood
that this was a doctor's diagnosis she
perked up immediately and she said no I
feel fine
and she just seemed as if suddenly she
seemed to be looking and feeling a whole

predicted that she would pass away
within three days
however she lived about she lived about
another week and when when she chose to
pass away she sat up as you heard before
she sat up in meditation and when after
she sees breathing she remained seated
upright for a period of seven days in
the sub-zero winter temperatures of that
region of the area and and during that
time her the flesh on her her limbs
remained elastic in other words not
frozen which would have been the case
otherwise and also her heart area
remained warm for a period of seven days

harm descending on the daughter Yuri is

she passed away the the last teaching
she gave again and again was basically
this that everything in every possible
thing that exists in the universe
depends only on the mind and and also
every possible experience of that mind
is purified with within the state or by
the state of the minds true nature and
also that all of the possible qualities
of that the mind could ever manifest
arise from and are perfected within that
ultimate nature of mind then D then a I
need to know emoticons or
company my aunt Anita Momoyama Mahina
Tesoro married Kimani so but this is
just one recent individual in a very
long very old history of the nunnery
which has innumerable stories of great
practitioners like this but I'm tempted
to go into it a bit more but we really
don't have time to do that now tapping
on a mega ray diese morning I hate this
opinion they say and and so this is what
I've what I know from my own direct
experience here and and you also can if
you if you want to Ben didn't a panini
concerning a date sake Annie okay but
you know general Davies our diet and
ethnic being a simple song and so I am
really really delighted to have been
able to share a little bit with everyone
here today about the extraordinary
tradition of this nunnery Benito and
Rhonda one another to doji and IB we'd
be happy to field any questions from the
audience
in her heaps going to but how much
guidance
and so the question is the the practice
of inner heat is it is it something or
how much instruction and training and
guidance is required for that and also
what is really the the spiritual
significance of that kind of practice
does it have is it just a pract practice
a practical practice or does it actually
have a spiritual significance then I

talk woman y'all need the same time in

practice that can be the success of
which or the mastery which can be
measured in terms of how much heat is
produced in meditation on the surface of
the body and could be and that can be
tested in terms of the next in terms of
the external manifestation of the
practice but the real purpose and
meaning of the practice relates to the
the training and purification of the
mind then the the sublime get the net

y'all me JD young ninja and
specifically it is a the practice of
inner heat is related to the nervous
system of the body then thinning on a

it's like chapter euro ah sorry did it's
all the the subtle body of the the
subtle body or the subtle energy aspect
of the human body is all pervasive

the sorry the the the presence or lack
of mental clarity and the the level of

Jake on and what what tends to happen is
that some of the nerve channels of the
subtle body become blocked in other
words there's no there's no there's no
energy able to flow through them because
of their because of their blockages and
whereas other other channels will become
are become open and become the main
conduits for energy then the Lu trauma

often said that the the the
straightening or the balancing of the of
the physical body causes the
straightening and opening and balancing
of the physical channels and when the
physical channels are opened and
straightened and balanced the the mind
itself becomes more open and balanced

a medic no marking on the toy I take
that but to get man what do you do
there's a tremendous there's a
tremendous lure of of information
relating to the practice that takes
advantage of this subtle body that
exists in all of us for the sake of
spiritual practice but suffice it to say
for now that in the subtle body that is
the nerve channels of the subtle body
there are two forms of energy there is
there is the pure energy of timeless
awareness or wisdom and there's also the
impure energy of neurosis and emotional
conflict and so these exist in in a one
degree of a proportion or balance and
everyone one a one degree or another
both of these exist in everyone and so
the the final the final purpose of all
of the practices and yoga's that relate
to the cell body and the nerve channels
is to is to bring the energies together
in the center of the body in the so
called central channel this is a this is
the the basic objective of that kind of
practice but this is only just a rough
description there's a tremendous amount
that needs to be understood
really be able to appreciate and
practice and receive the results of that
kind of practice and a derogatory Conan

nominated same gettin an immunity and so
when it comes to when it comes to this
kind of practice and also determining
what kind of achievement that someone
has has that what kind of experience
someone has had with the the easiest way
to examine like there's a you know as
described before there's a kind of an
annual test that the the nuns who were
engaged in the training of this practice
need to need to pass and and which is
also open to the public but that's just
you know in a really superficial kind of
test that they have to pass the main the
main challenge that they face and the
main accomplishment that they have to
realize in order to be tested like that
relates to the mind itself
being here and I apologize maybe this
was covered in beginning sorry I'm
wondering on their relationship
and whether it's a point like various
support from within
for the the nuns and I'm wondering what

actual kind of social relationship
between the the monasteries in the
region and this memory in particular is
it's very little I mean they really they
really don't have any particular social
or institutional connection Donna Donna

every every monastery and nunnery has
its own has its own rules has its own
tradition and has its own means of draw
of sustenance or support from the from
the secular community at large
that is
yeah
more specifically things that

10 a.m. tomorrow irritate Saarinen to
Hail Mary and so in general there are
three different the question has to do
with the methods of meditation and
repitch I stated before that in the
nunnery there are three or more many
more but three most important kind of
archetypal feminine divinities that are
the that provide the theme and the and
the visual content of the practice that
they do and and so the question is well
these days for example and the teachings
of Osho and and other teachers the
emphasis is is is entirely different in
other words instead some popular
teachers these days emphasize above all
else the meditating on the mind itself
or unconsciousness itself and so what
does what does ricochet
have to say - to that and Renee says
well there are three levels in general
there are three different types of
person or practitioner there are people
of exceptional ability people of average
ability and people of lesser ability and
and so the way that the proper method of
practice for any given individual has to
relate to where they actually are I mean
what their present state of mind and and
knowledge and ability is so so in
general for most people that is except
for people of the very highest ability
it is extremely useful even essential to
have some kind of reference point or or
thematic content in spiritual practice
it is it is definitely not the case that
simply to meditate on on the mind itself
or unconsciousness itself with without
any reference point or any content or
intention and so on whatsoever it
definitely will not work for everybody
it may work for a very few special
individuals to to apply that approach
but to say that that the
one-size-fits-all approach of mind only
in mind itself without any any objective
is is probably not going to work
then the Quran salat go and go Mari tank
bamboo saya telah ginseng cutter here
you read the tactical unit macapa don't
think I read and remember she's just
wondering what what is the what is the
rationale behind saying that that is the
only way that one should meditate in
other words I mean I mean let's just say
assuming that that there is only one
method that should work that is without
a particular focus or without a
particular content and without a
meditating on divine archetype and so on
I mean what would be the reason for
saying that that is the only way that
would work
that image of Idol
you try to get into yourself
you
so the so the the rationale if I'm a may
repeat and please correct me if I a
summary is incorrect that that basically
that if one can just connect directly
with one's oneself or one's true nature
you know one's ones real you know one's
a true self or true nature without this
kind of mediation of ideas and concepts
and images that that is more direct and
more sensible has a more kind of
immediate felt significance than going
through all of the stages or store or
other objects right is that is that
think you can
okay that's good thank you
so you can correct you can connect more
directly with God or with with the truth
by freeing the mind of images and ideas
then through some other kind of image
imagery or idea content de name-o de

semi-volatile your account payable and
so as as in the case of the the 100 year
old nun that was photo you saw before
when she was at the end of her life the
the message that she gave basically was
that she gave she's been saying this
pretty much the same thank everybody
again and again which is everything
relates to mind
everything is perfected in terms of the
mind itself and so the meaning of that
statement that she made is basically
this it doesn't really matter whether
you meditate on a deity or not in other
words if whatever you whatever your
style of
kisses and meditation or religious
practice and so on everything ultimately
comes from the mind and everything
dissolves back into the mind when it's
no longer visible or perceptible and so
in that sense it doesn't matter what
kind of practice you do the point is
however that if you do meditate on a
deity for example if that is useful for
someone that it's not the case that the
deity somehow exists externally from
oneself one should in that sort of
practice that has a thematic content or
an archetypal image at its as its
foundation and so on is to understand
that that does not exist separately for
oneself that really is nothing but an
expression of the nature of mine so
since everything is an expression and
occurs within the the the state of the
mind itself then whether such things are
used or not is doesn't matter ultimately
in other words everything anything that
works works okay I think we have to sort
of finish up here but just in summary
just seems like it's very timely that
now Rinpoche is here in a male form
we're talking about these extraordinary
women and there is a documentary alcohol
blessings narrated by Richard Gere about
this particular community of women of
which this non are' is the mother
nunnery so there's probably are 2,000
women in that area practicing like this
and this monastery of about 230 women
are are really just extraordinary and
even many male tibetan lamas would say
this is probably in terms of
percentage-wise
the greatest probably the greatest group
of meditators we have in the face of
this earth doing it in the way that they
are doing it and they have really
perfected two things compassion and
wisdom we always hear His Holiness the
Dalai Lama and all these other lamas
talk about this but they really have
done it I mean and you can see from this
happiness I mean they're happy these
women have been through 30 years of
labour camps or living in a cave and
still come out radiating this incredible
joy and happiness for others not one
microsecond for themselves
it's they've really nailed it they
have nailed it it's like we hear great
llamas talk about it again and again and
again to sort of have this altruistic
motivation of thinking for others and in
fact just the presence of these women
many llamas say have transformed that
whole area less hunting less dispute
less addictions less drunken behavior
this sort of thing just having this sort
of presence has transformed and so I
think this is where it's really amazing
and reasons why we need to have people
like this we really really do and now
that the whole community is eroding the
supporting community of nomads that gave
them food that gave them shelter this is
all going fast so we also hoping that
maybe people in the West like us can be
their substitute parents or brothers and
sisters so I think Tom you wanted to say
something too so to that end I passed
around some fliers earlier showing some
means of support should you be
interested in doing so so thank you all
very much for coming let's think one day
for coming and his translator John petit
and Katerina de ray thank you all and
thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
