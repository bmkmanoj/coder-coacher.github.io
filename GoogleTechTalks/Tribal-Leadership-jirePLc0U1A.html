McNally of the ad spam team and I'll be
introducing our guest speaker today if
you go to google.com and you start
typing Dave L og psychic will
autocomplete - Dave Logan the first
result will be a retired sports player
second result will be a plumber and the
third result will be our guest
Dave Logan of Dave Logan comm he's been
a friend of mine since our early teenage
years and of the people that I've known
from that peer group he's been a great
inspiration to me personally he's been a
great friend to have all these years
Dave Logan is a faculty member at the
University of Southern California in the
Marshall School of Business he's a
best-selling author and he's a
management consultant Dave writing rang
with Steve Zefron has co-authored the
three laws of performance which is
currently a best-selling book within the
organizational behavior section of
Amazon Dave is also writing with his
co-author John King and Haley Fisher
Wright has co-authored tribe leadership
leveraging natural groups to build a
thriving organization that'll be the
subject of his presentation today just
to mention this book has been endorsed
by David Allen David Allen is the author
of the getting things done series which
we've had David Elam is a guest speaker
of number of times and we had a number
of courses here based on his work and
this is what he says about David Logan
tribal leadership should be required
reading for anyone in teams or with an
interest in improving performance and
job satisfaction so glowing endorsement
Dave here has served as senior partner
at culture sync a management consulting
firm which he co-founded in 1997 and
he's been also on the faculty of the UFC
Marshall School of Business the Getty
Leadership Institute and the
International Center for Leadership and
finance so I'm very glad to welcome
my friend and our guest speaker Dave
Logan well thank you thank you Michael
it's a it's an honor to be here and it's
especially an honor to be introduced by
as Michael said one of my I won't say
oldest friends but longest friend anyway
you can grammatically you know what I'm
saying
okay so here's what I thought might be
an interesting use of time very much
appreciate your your showing up knowing
a bit about Google and knowing a lot of
the people that are employed by Google
tend to be let me just kind of rattle
through what I suspect number one like
way smarter than average okay number two
pretty quick disease on to new ideas and
then want to think through the
implications of those and number three
that you tend to stay or comment kind of
based on merit so as opposed to you know
other things so what I thought I would
do given those three assumptions if you
think those are valid is to take a few
minutes and show you what this framework
is and let me just say a little bit
about it at this point and then and then
propose that and see if that works for
all of you so what this is based on is
my my co-authors and I spent better part
of ten years looking at organizations
trying to answer a question that was by
no means unique to us but we think that
our answer was unique because the
methodology was unique and so what we
sought to answer was not why are some
organizations effective and others are
not I mean that's a question that
everybody asks but the question is what
is it about some organizations if you
think of kind of leadership and the
things that go along with leaders if you
imagine a checklist that good leaders
should do these five or six things you
can find organizations where leaders in
fact do none of those things and yet the
place does really well by any objective
measurements and you can also find the
reverse where leaders do all of those
things and yet the organization isn't
working now there are some easy ways to
explain that away you could say that the
non performing organization has a
strategy that's the wrong one or the
going out for a market segment that's
the wrong one let's assume just for the
sake of argument that most of the
obvious things were pretty much the same
between those two organizations so what
you end up having is really a mental
kind of puzzle to solve and really why
is it that some
organization simply do not need to be
led and others don't respond to even a
lot of leadership that was kind of the
premise going into this and so what we
came to as I said the methodology is
unique was instead of looking at the
unit of analysis as being the person so
like you're a member of the you know
Google you know set of companies that
that's not that's we didn't find it to
be a useful unit of analysis nor did we
find the company to be a useful unit of
analysis or the department or the
business unit those are kind of
traditional ones or the team so what we
found to be kind of the the key to
understanding this whole thing was the
fact that organizations exist and occur
in what we call naturally occurring
groups and originally we called those
energies naturally-occurring group or a
nog and that idea is about as unsexy as
you get so in the process of kind of
working in the big publishing system
HarperCollins happens to be the
publisher of the book we settled on the
word try
now the word tribe is Latin in origin so
I'm this is in no way a reference to say
the Native American traditions or you
know just about anywhere in the world
and if you used the word tribe people
think you mean something particular by
it all I mean by it in this context is a
group of people between roughly 20 and
150 now let me comment on each of those
and we'll jump into this okay so why 20
well because a lot of the literature on
teams assumes that a team goes up to
about 17 18 people and there's really
good literature on teams about how they
work but then there's not a lot on this
next gap what we call a naturally
occurring group there's a lot at the
organizational level or the business
unit level or the department level and
one of the things that got us thinking
about this I spent many years as a
consultant in the automotive industry
both with Japanese companies and
American companies and American
companies talking about the auto
manufacturers no matter what the problem
is reorganizing is the solution and the
issue is it doesn't change anything
not only does it not solve anything it
doesn't actually make anything very
different because the naturally
occurring groups are the same people
don't respond to forced reorganization
so what this whole premise that is based
on is
to understand an organization you have
to understand it really from the bottom
up by the bottom up I don't just mean
from the rank-and-file
up in some managerial paradigm but I
mean from the naturally occurring groups
up so if you look at an entrepreneurial
venture then the naturally occurring
groups are the things that you want to
focus on now just one thing more on
nationally occurring groups and again
that will sort of jump into this often a
naturally occurring group will have
people in it that either are not a
formal member of that group or team or
in some cases they're not even employees
so in the case of the little consulting
company that I work for we've got people
that are members of our naturally
occurring groups that are spouses
friends investors supporters early
clients but if you looked at just the
pure organization chart those people
wouldn't show up as being interesting
just a quick little example I was at
Zappos not too long ago many of you
probably know that company one of the
people that I had lunch with I couldn't
figure out what his role in the company
was so I asked him as we were walking
back from lunch what do you do add a
pose I don't work here what do you do he
said I don't work here either I'm the
UPS rep or one of the UPS reps so he is
a member of the executive kind of
naturally occurring group and is very
instrumental in the organization's
success but is not a formal if you will
member of the tribe so with all of that
being said here that is where the
research led us you can assess an
organization's capabilities by doing two
things number one look at the naturally
occurring groups the kind of informal
networks who's connected to whom
including people who may not even be
members of the organization or members
of the of the corporation that's number
one and number two look at the strength
the relative cultural strength of those
naturally occurring groups so the
analogy is if you're really going to
assess the health of the human body the
unit of analysis might be the cell well
the cell in this case is not the person
but the naturally occurring group and so
with all of that said that lets us do a
couple things okay number one by the
time we're done here you'll have the
intellectual framework you'll be able to
really apply this to strengthen your
tribe so that actually starts with an
assessment just a mental assessment what
are the kinds of tribes that I have
are they relatively strong or relatively
weak and then to build those to
accomplish more and less time now just
one thing to say here from the outset is
this is actually not a simple framework
okay so as we get into it at first it's
going to look very simple but the
questions that are going to come up will
be but what is the relationship between
the person and the tribe and that's
actually a very complex I mean there's a
lot of variables at play relationship
but if you can really understand how all
of that works it really lets you
accomplish both of these okay so this is
not if you will for the feint of mind
it's not a do these three steps and
you'll build great tribes is actually
not what we can do at all
this foundation is used in a lot of
business schools because it's something
that actually requires a bit of thought
okay so we're gonna do this in two
levels here comes level one level one is
the kind of macro view it's a bit of a
generalization so what this says is if
you go into any organization and find
the naturally occurring groups that
exist there that you can use this sort
of temperature gauge to figure out if
they're relatively effective or
relatively ineffective at the very
bottom is everything you don't want
including and this is not in any way an
exaggeration or an attempt at bad humor
people going postal so at the time that
I'm here one of the things that's in the
news is of course what happened in
Tucson okay when we see level 1 or stage
1 tribes the very bottom you actually
see the behaviors that lead to those
types of consequences now they also lead
to graft they leave defraud they lead to
all sorts of both white and blue collar
crime ok that's stage 1 accounts for
relatively few of the naturally
occurring groups that are employed
around the world now society it's a
bigger problem but in terms of
employment relatively small and if we go
up to the top Stage five that isn't
exactly where you want to live every
moment of your life because it's highly
unstable these tribal configurations are
very unstable as we'll see but when you
kind of come away with this you see the
overall net effect is you want to take
your tribes actually to number four
stabilize them there and once they're
stable then do the things to make
occasional leaps into five which are the
groups that are the most innovative and
do things that are really history-making
in their consequences so that makes
sense we're going to jump into this
again I'm assuming that you want the
premise here to then be able have a
conversation now I'm going to stop at
least a couple times probably more and
open it up for any comments questions
but of course if you've got any please
stop me as we're going through this you
need to walk up to the microphone up
things that people are watching it
remotely and either speaking of the
microphone if you just shout it out I'll
repeat what you say so the people
hearing remotely or watching
asynchronously can be into the full
conversation okay so when we talk about
stage one again this is people doing
coastal this is fraud of various sorts
this is what we call an undermining
group now you'll notice the tribes a
language okay we're actually not
referring to just the words that people
use we're referring to I'll use a kind
of big concept here recognizing that
Google is a company that likes the kind
of broader view it's something called a
terminus t'k screen now what does that
mean a terminus t'k screen is a term
from actually a rhetorician guy in the
field of rhetoric in the early 20s and
30s named Kenneth Berg and what he said
is when a human being is experiencing
the world they've got they experience it
through a set of terms a screen of terms
screen of words hence a terminus t'k
screen and so if you think of a
physician one of my co-authors in this
project is a doctor
Haley Fisher right medical doctor one
day we were walking down a street in Los
Angeles
where I live she's from Denver and there
was a bad kind of traffic tie-up and one
of the things that had happened was a
car had run into a pole and so I looked
at it to the terminus --tx screen of a
guy who lives in Los Angeles and my
thought was traffic how is this going to
affect my getting home she looked at it
through the terminus --tx screen of a
physician and recognized that this was
likely someone who had a either heart
attack or a blackout of some kind props
of stroke and then ended up drunk so she
was understanding the situation without
thinking about it just her instant
realization of situational analysis was
that of a physician mine was different
what we see with stage one is the way
that people interpret those situations
the terminus tick screens that are going
on in their minds are ones that net out
to life sucks or life is inherently
unfair now I'm certain when the word
comes out about this guy in Tucson when
I'm not particularly looking forward to
seeing the video of what actually
happened in Tucson but if you remember
the guy who shot at Virginia Tech a
number of years ago and then some video
came out that he had recorded prior to
the incident he actually repeated the
words over and over that life sucks life
is unfair this is a terminus t'k screen
that produces among other things
terrorism if you go into parts of the
world where people the way they look at
the world a set of terms that they have
to make sense of the world is it life is
inherently unfair they will do whatever
it takes to cut a break for themselves
so the behavior pattern that is a
natural correlate of this is despairing
hostility people don't have to think
about it it doesn't strike them as a
choice that they're making it's simply
this is the way it is this is their
behavior and that is about as unthinking
as you get as it gets now within
employed situations this is only the
case stage one two percent of the time
the next one is the case twenty five
percent of the time so 25 percent of
naturally occurring groups have this
next thing Stage two as their dominant
theme you notice it says my life sucks
that may seem very in terms of words
very similar to stage one actually it's
not similar at all because in stage one
you have what's sometimes called in
psychology a generalized complaint about
life that life just seems set up by its
very nature to screw you that's the
that's the view of life in stage two
it's not that at all I can see your
life's work and fine I mean if I got to
hang out at Google my life would be cool
but I don't I work at USC where life is
not nearly as cool so my life sucks
compared to your life and you see this
if you fly you go through the TSA that's
often a tribe that's kind of the
terminus --tx screen sort of that life
is it you know going well for some
people just not for me
and so the behavior pattern that you see
the center column will get to the values
column here in a bit wants to climb a
little higher up it'll make more sense
behavior pattern that you see is apathy
so if you think about getting your
driver's license renewed here in the
state of California there's a good
chance if you're if you blew it like I
did and didn't realize your birthday was
coming up and actually had walk in as it
was make an appointment that what you
saw was a group of
people behaving and you wonder come from
the outside is there actually any sort
of IQ going on here at all right because
people seem to behaving to be behaving
in a way that is not innovative that is
not inspiring that is not optimized for
much other than taking long breaks okay
so this is again the case 25% of the
time now the problem there is it's not
fair to say that this is the result of
some of one particular thing that's
going on in the company so it could be
if you've got too much management in a
situation if you've got a project that's
not going well if people feel in some
way threaten their job something like
that then people can sort of fall into
stage two they adopt this terminus
tricked screen they teach it to each
other it's how sort of the group
communicates right but what might also
happen with a lot of the organizations
that you work with probably not the case
here but probably true of many of your
partners is if people feel like the
economy is not working out well for them
that their house is being foreclosed on
things are not going well they may walk
in a door with this terminus t'k screen
that which or that that's the thing that
they're using to make sense of the world
as a result you look at their behavior
and you see a lot of apathy okay so
again 25% of the time now the next one
is the one where we have to spend a bit
of time and make sense of it because
this may seem like it's going in a good
direction and then suddenly it takes a
very serious kind of right turn in a way
that we don't want so the theme of stage
3 this is 48 percent of employed tribes
and most tribes where people tend to be
really smart very educated have a lot of
degrees okay those tend to termina stick
screen at the very center of the screen
the net of words are I me and money so I
make sense of things by comparing it to
me right this is good for me this is not
good for me so working at a university
it's very common to have a faculty
meeting where one person after another
will say well here's what I think and
here's what I think it will from my
point of view and you know my PhD is in
psychology and from a psychological view
here's what I see here's what I see
here's what I see the problem with that
is there's very little of a build upon
effect so rarely do you have one
saying let me take what Michael said and
add to it and try to kind of extend what
Michael see what Michael said or let me
get on the side of Michael you actually
don't see that it's one person waiting
for the next person to shut up and then
they come in and say what they think so
it turns into conversation without
resolution 48 percent and again its
highest where people are the most
equipped being the most intelligent the
most educated the most agreed and so you
start talking about a lot of
organizations let's say in Silicon
Valley this is a real problem and again
you see the limitation let me just pause
here at one point this is probably an
obvious conclusion but it is to make
sure everybody sees it if you do nothing
more then take a naturally occurring
group and move it from one stage to the
next
bottom line performance will improve so
if you go from stage one where people
are disconnected from one another
planning accounting malfeasance
committing fraud and move them to stage
two we're not getting a lot done
actually your bottom line stuff will
improve right between one and two is
that's a step in the right direction
likewise between two and three I mean
would you rather be involved in let's
say that you have a healthcare crisis
would you rather be involved in a
situation where it's sort of like the
DMV that's caring for you or would you
rather be cared for by a group of kind
of super doctors where every doctor said
okay I'm this is my case everyone shut
up here's the answer but you had all of
them doing it together
see that would lead actually to medical
errors because one doctor is going to
look at it from the point of view of
their discipline but individually those
are all really really competent people
so clearly three is better than two and
then obviously if we go on to for this
continuing the argument is now going to
improve performance so when we look at
stage four the way that some people look
at this is the following and this is
actually incorrect this is the simple
conclusion and it's wrong okay simple
conclusion is oh I see this is a NIDA we
argument this is about the power of we
okay we want to say we instead of I
that's actually not the case at all
what happens with a lot of pseudo
leaders people who want to think that
their leaders they adopt the language of
we but when you actually look behind the
word
what they mean by it is I and so they'll
say things like we've we've come to this
conclusion we were setting this new
strategy we really hope that all of you
will be on board with it and what they
mean is I and my buddies from McKinsey
I've come up with this new strategy and
we really hope you like it in fact if
you don't then we're going to argue with
you I realize this is not how life often
happens at Google it is how life happens
in a lot of organizations what I just
described is not Stage four it's in fact
stage three with kind of an asterisk
that people are doing a mental if you
will search and replace in their head
moving from I to Wii but that's not
Stage four so then if Stage four is not
just the articulation of we than what is
it it's coming from the point of view
that what binds our naturally-occurring
group together is a set of shared values
okay now we've got to kind of pause here
because values is one of the most abused
misunderstood topics in leadership and
organizational behavior and again I know
it's not how Google functions but how it
happens a lot of places is a few people
get together around lunch and we kind of
come up with what our values are and
it's really our values kind of four or
five people's values and they get
imposed upon the rest of the
organization in posters and on mugs okay
again that's not how life happens here
but that's how values are quote unquote
set most places number one they have no
measurable impact on behavior other than
it to be a source of ridicule so how to
stage for work Stage four is where the
group gets together and real kind of
asks the question what is it we stand
for so a line that I was reminded of and
doing a lot of this research comes from
Martin Luther not Martin Luther King but
Martin Luther the guy who founded the
Lutheran Church which was at some point
someone said why are you doing these
things you know people are going to make
life very very difficult for you and his
answer to that question was here I stand
I can do no other ok that is a statement
spoken by a person that knows in this
case his or her values imagine a group
says here we stand we can do no whether
that's a group that really understands
its values and so then when you start
talking about places that are in the
news I mentioned Zappos earlier they
really understand
values fun is one of their values being
a little bit weird or being weird is one
of their values so if you ever have it
have the chance to do the Zappos tour
unlike this you kind of struck with wow
this is a really weird place to be okay
I Dave would make a really bad Zappos
employee I'm really not weird enough you
might have kind of guessed with how I'm
dressed the fact that I hang out in
university is not weird enough for
Zappos not you probably aren't either
okay so it's where the group says here's
what we stand for here's who we are now
what are ways we can take the set of
values and translate it not necessarily
into full-blown strategies but into more
short-term activities so in the case of
Zappos a famous thing that was written
about was the number of new customers
that Zappos was plateauing now if you
ever hung out in a business school
there's a right answer to that question
and as advertising and marketing
we need to advertise we need to market
but again if you've read the delivering
happiness book by Tony Shea you know
that among other things a bus was always
having a cash problem they did have the
money to do that it also was out of step
with their values so notice what they
did with the relationship to values here
at stage 4 being important
they asked the question who are we what
do we stand for and in that discussion
which was very ad-hoc very informal not
required by management not mandated by
any sort of quote-unquote leaders then
someone stepped forward and no one quite
remembers who this was as I understood
the store I was not in the room would
happen and a person said I have an idea
let's offer tours okay which makes no
sense the if you kind of think about it
at first notice how stage 3 would make
sense of that well you know I've got my
MBA and that's just the wrong answer was
a really really stupid thing that that
person just said I can't wait for that
person to stop so that I can say what
the right answer is and everyone can be
moved by my genius and they can all plot
because I have the right answer which is
we need to advertise that's not what
happened notice how stage 2 would
respond wow I had no idea that we're
that much in the soup wow my life is
about to suck I'm about to be unemployed
in Las Vegas in which is next debate
Vegas that would be stage 2 no ability
to innovate no ability to engage an
attraction but it's stage 4 there's a
curiosity just one kind of interesting
aside when we go into stage 3
organizations and I would ask as a
researcher or John would ask
John is is more of a coach than I am and
a lot of the ideas that I'm presenting
actually John John had early iterations
of them when we first met and so as we
wanted to kind of validate or test a lot
of his ideas we're going to stage three
environments and say who you trust and
people would have liked this whole map
worked out of who they trust and in what
situations well I trust Bob when is
financial and I trust Amy you know if
it's about a promotion because I know
Amy's got my back and I protect it or
once and you go into stage four
organizations and say who do you trust
and people say what do you mean well I
mean who do you trust
well I trust people I work with well
what would you do if they ever violated
trust why asking such stupid questions I
go sit down and talk to them we could
play volleyball we would hang out at the
snack bar and work it out
okay well what if you couldn't work it
out I don't know we brings up why you
ask them such stupid questions is really
not a big issue okay that's more a
stage-four with handling so back to the
example from Zappos so as the person
said well let's do tours you can kind of
see the light bulb going off in people's
heads we could bring people in we could
show them what we stand for it's an
inspiring place to work and it will more
importantly start this whole viral thing
of than people going back to wherever
they're you know based how was Vegas it
was okay oh but I saw Zappos Zappos is
really cool demo her does a pose well
you got to go online they're really cool
that was actually one of the turning
points in the Zappos story was when they
took these tours that they had
previously offered to suppliers and so
on and it began to offer it to ordinary
customers so now when the person who
brought up the suggestion who happened
to be a customer service operator is on
the phone later that same day and is
talking to let's say you and you say
what's that noise in the background oh
that's a conga line a conga line that's
the most bizarre where do you work
Zappos this is a kind of famous for
being a little weird and you've got
conga lines at work yeah wow I would
love to see that well hey we're in
Henderson just outside Vegas next time
you're here stop by now we don't have a
store it's not like a retail place but
you can just see what we do and probably
give you lunch what why don't you know
money's kind of tight no no no money's
not tight we'll send our shuttles to go
pick you up so for those people that
have really kind of sipped from the
Zappos
laid the fact that the zapo shuttle is
going to show up at their hotel on the
strip and drive them to Henderson where
they get the tour and see the conga
lines and the chili cook-off and you're
all here all that kind of weirdness was
a major kind of going to Mecca event for
people and so you can see how that
played out so we just kind of you know
stop right here notice a couple things
about Stage four number one there's very
little drama okay it makes really bad
reality television people aren't trying
to undermine one another they're not
trying to be smarter than one another
they're not trying to top one another
they don't turn to the camera and say
I'm really not here to make friends
which is a common line from reality TV
it just doesn't happen it's relatively
drama-free
Stage three high drama makes great
reality television and is really soul
sucking in its nature because it taps
people so much every single day I feel
like I'm personally at war so I have
less energy at the end of the day than I
had at the beginning and so on and stage
two is in fact even more in that
direction the number of stage four you
keep on track is about twenty-two
percent twenty to twenty three percent
depending on how you round so we're
going to stage 5 one of the things about
Stage five that contrasts it from four
is it four there has to be of them
okay so if I were at Google one of the
concerns that I would have is the them
and I'm you know speaking to friends and
I've got friends in the other group that
about to mention is Microsoft okay it's
good to have a really really great
competitor and again I'm choosing my
words very carefully here don't give you
an example at a company called CB
Richard Ellis they are a commercial real
estate broker company when I first got
in contact with them their nemesis was a
company called Trammell Crowe what CB
was number one of the markets based
Travelpro was number two and this was a
worthy competitor where CB was a
street-smart company Trammell Crowe was
a company that hired among other things
Harvard MBAs so this was a company to
really war against and the day came when
CB Richard Alice bought Trammell Crow
and one of the questions is who's them
right if we're us who are we in
competition with and so when that goes
away from a stage four you actually have
a problem and what often happens I'm not
saying this will happen here but what
often happens is the culture then
regrets
is to stage three because it's not us
against them them is not really clearly
defined or them is not cool enough right
so I'm not sure who them is and the
culture actually takes a step back Stage
five is the opposite it's where there is
no sense of them other than an
abstraction or something like that in
the early days of Amgen curing cancer or
if you're familiar with the story of Ray
Anderson one of the early environmental
CEOs you know who's your competition
carbon really I thought you made carpet
what we do but it's carbon and this was
when nobody was really talking about
carbon footprints so it's stage five but
we talked to some people at a physics
lab at MIT who are in competition with
oh well you know it's Caltech well not
really we hire their people we do
projects together we're working on the
super collider
I guess it's knowledge so it's where the
sense of a competitor becomes very very
general now within five is a major
pitfall which is why what we encourage
based on the research is not for five to
be the goal but instead five to be a
place that you visit on occasion so some
of you in this room I suspect were
involved in comms 99 mm we collected
some data on those and we asked who is
your competitor and instead of the
competitor being a vibrant company that
was actually making money people would
say our competitor is retailing and they
would get it they would say it with this
eyes glazed over effect retailing really
well don't you need like money and cash
flow and things like that if business
professor speaking no we have clinics
okay but it was before they actually had
a business model where that made any
sense so notice it Stage five there can
be some delusional activity right
because we're not measuring ourselves
against another it's hard to benchmark
and it's hard to know when we're being
effective
so about as good as it gets is for your
naturally occurring group to start out
wherever you are you want to move up to
four what does that mean you have a good
knowledge of your shared values your
shared values actually drive
conversation so it's not enough to
simply intellectually know what people
value or don't value it has to drive the
conversation in the same way that that
service and being weird and
I of culture drove the conversation in
the Zappos example if you don't have
that then as high as you're going to get
on this is going to be three which again
is sub optimized so one of the big kind
of surprising findings for a lot of
companies is you don't want to find the
best and brightest and hire them now you
do but that's not enough because if you
end there you end up with an
organization optimized for stage 3 think
of the Manhattan Project controversial
by its nature but it was much more stage
4 because it had a sense of calm of a
common enemy so again you want to take
your groups to four where values really
drive the conversation and then every
once in a while take a little leap into
five and ask the question if we were in
competition not with this other group
that could be within Google or outside
Google doesn't matter but if we were in
competition with something grander
perhaps in competition with history
what could we really really do at the
time that I'm here one of the big things
in the news is of course the fact that
Steve Jobs is stepping down for health
reasons Apple has on a number of
occasions you saw Michael on a Mac I got
a Mac - okay
these groups at Apple have come together
and said not how do we beat Microsoft
but how do we do something that by its
nature would make history and you look
at the string of innovations have really
come out of that but when you come out
of that and you're a project manager for
something involving the iPhone you're
then going to track the competition and
you're going to try to do better than
them that stage-four by its nature okay
so I mentioned two levels this is level
1 level 1 is now sorry level 2 is going
to get more detailed let me just stop at
this point any comments any questions
any thoughts and yeah buts how about
what ifs
yes sir
to your organization as large trying to
coming home to the price right I do
identify like my tribe from another and
how did they self-identify inquired of
their self-identification that they know
that they're part of a group named
separate results mother group just
yeah so the question is just to
summarize it for even watching your if
you didn't hear it is is since this I'm
going to paraphrase a little bit since
the tribe is a bit of a mushy idea how
do people within the organization make
sense of which tribe they belong to
again paraphrasing how do you know the
boundaries how to identify it there's a
couple ways to do it one is a fairly
scientific view driven by people in
computer science which is you can do a
you can do a study where you look to see
literally who communicates to whom and
then you can tease out it's called a
community identification system and
again and again if you tease it out
you'll see that these groups form
between twenty and a hundred and fifty
the much less scientific and much more
mushy way to look at it is simply who do
you talk to and if you ask someone that
question they are likely to come up with
you know the people sort of the people
in their tribe when I was flushing this
idea out with John before we met Haley
talked to an anthropologist that had
done some work in this field and one of
the points that she made this is back
when PDAs didn't have very much data
that that due to ways to kind of tell
who's in your quote-unquote tribe one is
they were probably in your phone now
this is when phones didn't include a lot
of people they're probably the numbers
you would recognize if someone called or
anywhere in the world except for New
York City if you saw them walking down
the street you'd stop and say hello
because even if you saw someone in New
York City it's that's not how New
Yorkers live does that make sense so
it's a mushy idea bike by concept where
the machinist goes away is if you
actually start thinking about who are in
your work tribes it's actually a very
easy question to answer and we've never
met anyone who didn't have a pretty good
answer now we've done these studies
involving tens of thousands of people of
asking who do you communicate with on a
regular basis and then asking questions
about who who you share values with and
you trade information and you trust them
in are the influential and you can look
at that or you can do a community
identity it actually Nets out to the
same thing follow yeah
our people members of local tribes at
the same time yesterday okay so how does
it make sense that okay so the question
is can people be members of multiple
tribes at the same time I said yes and
then your follow-up to the follow-up was
then how do they make sense of that the
short answer is they do make sense of it
all the time people are members of
multiple tribes but how I think it
relates back to this idea how where I
suspect you're going is notice it is
incorrect sorry what's your name Doug to
me it would be an incorrect use of the
methodology to say
Doug's kind of a stage two guy so let's
tattoo a two on his head on his forehead
that way anywhere he goes people will
know that he's kind of a down in the
dumps guy that's him that's incorrect or
inaccurate because in one tribe he may
behave in a stage two manner because
that's dominant in that tribe he may go
to another meeting that's very
individual focus may communicate in
stage three you might do something
that's more giving back to the community
might have a real sense of values a
charitable activity or philanthropic
activity of some kind that could be
stage four or even five and you're the
same you're the same person but you're
communicating differently in those
tribes a very simple example and again I
drink from the USC kool-aid here so I
mean no disrespect about where I teach
when I have meetings in the full-time
MBA program its stage three this is
among the faculty same group of people
when we have meetings about the
Executive MBA program which is a
different program largely same people
it's more stage for discussion driven by
values sense of we that's not forced and
not artificial same people but different
context so context is really determining
here make sense now this next thing will
will help to flesh this out a bit more
because where this goes then is what is
the relation so this is now little to
their promised okay so what is the
relationship between the person and the
tribe so if we talk about somebody going
postal this is what it looks like from a
socio Grahame perspective sociogram
being how we we chart out the network of
relationships notice the big green blob
over here to the right and here's
everybody else I am certain when we
discover the motivation of this guy that
did this terrible act in Tucson this
will be what will see the person is has
a sense of alienation
the alienation certainly came to you if
you looked at any of the written
materials of government controls the
grammar it's kind of insanity okay now
if that happened to you that you started
talking like that your friends and
family would do an intervention okay but
when you're this green dot and you've
systematically disconnected from all of
your social relationships there's no
sort of safety net and so this is what
stage one that sort of says life sucks
looks like it's a person that's really
alienated from any sense of a future any
sense of optimism get enough of these
green dots together and we have a gang
and we have a group that may spawn
terrorism depending on where it is in
the world right so this is stage one
stage two if you're familiar with the TV
show the office okay one of the reasons
that that show has has the success that
it has is because people all around the
world not just in the US or Britain
where the show started look at that and
say that's where I work okay here's any
character this green dot at the center
any character in the office I mean I'm
not disconnected I'm not sort of off to
the side I'm in the midst of things but
yet I'm not connected so I'm not
alienate 'add I'm just not connected so
any conversation of values yeah I don't
have those so imagine going into the
typical kind of TSA group or Department
of Motor Vehicles and say what's your
core commitment in life
people would sort of laugh or say or
they'd give you a sarcastic answer
outbreaks
I love taking them but really let's
probe it it why do you like brains one
of the techniques of values assessment
is to say what they say in the probe
deeper asking open-ended questions well
it beats the heck out of working it
doesn't actually go anywhere but at
Zappos if you said what do you really
like about your job
either something like service what do
you like about serving well you know
makes me happy to serve well okay and
why is happiness so important I know
just is that road went down values but
if you find a group that's largely
disconnected so this is a Doug's example
if Doug's a member of a stage two tribe
but also members of higher performing
tribes this is probably his experience
in a stage two tribe now stage three
gets fun okay here's the dot at the
center I forum if I'm if I think kind of
I'm great I'm great and you're not so
it's got to be comparative I have to be
great if we not what happens in the
structure of relationships automatically
as we form or called dyads so I for
might die otic die too
relationship with Doug and I say look
Doug you know I'm great and you're not
they don't actually say that to Doug
because I want Doug's compliance so so I
find some way to sort of butter him up
now notice this is going to come across
completely fake and artificial hey Doug
you know thanks for asking the first
question really appreciate it yeah I
know you got my back okay notice how
plastic that seems but in the world of
someone using the termina stick screen
of I'm great
do I think I'm getting through yeah why
because I'm great there's a major blind
spot you might even say a kind of
reality distortion field and I'm talking
about Steve Jobs that comes in with
stage 3 it's a nature of the beast so
what do i do i form all of my dyadic
relationships if you're the people in my
tribe and then I try to make you clones
which is why the color becomes the same
I mean and this is great for me because
now I've talked to all of you and I've
made you like me and sure you're not
quite as good as me you're not quite as
smart as me you know quite a background
that I have but you know for what you
are you're good and more importantly now
we can get stuff done problem is you
come back to work unchanged because you
know you went home and you talked about
it you slept and now you want to know
what are having discussions dad we're
talking about this remember you said you
were going to offer your support so I
try to change you back and we wonder why
stage 3 naturally occurring groups are
so dramatically ineffective ok so we're
almost done of this so if we take a look
then at stage 4 it looks completely
different and you might have noticed
this weird little spinning character up
in the upper left of the screen this
will now make sense so some of you might
be familiar with Reed Hoffman one of the
people who founded LinkedIn one of the
interesting things that we identified in
talking with Reed and other people is it
actually the basic building block of a
stage 4 remember this is a group that's
driven by its values where the values
really drive the conversation is not a
dyadic relationship but a try otic so
how does this work in practice as Reed
said reason I brought them up as first
of all you do have to know the people we
talked about the theory of small gifts
you know gift that I give small isn't it
doesn't have to be valuable but every
six months a year I need to reach out to
people and my network remind you that I
remember you that you're important to me
and then when I do that I can find two
people and I
can connect them I can sort of matchmake
now at stage 4 the matchmaking is very
systematic but yet we discovered people
were doing it without thinking about the
system they were just doing it because
it seemed natural so what was it they
were doing the levels of connection are
number one if I'm introducing Doug and
Michel I got to find some reason why you
should connect some business reason some
project reason Michael is working on
this project Doug can help Oh Doug you
mentioned you're having that one problem
Michael can you there helper he knows
somebody who does so I find a reason to
connect if that's all I did that would
be very stage three because it's based
on commodities and problem solving
skills the other levels I've gotta find
a value that you share a value as an a
core value something that's important to
both of you Doug I just met Michael of
course I've known for many years
so as I'm meeting Doug I mentally kind
of going through my list to see how can
I introduce him to Michael in a way that
will speak not just to your short-term
problem that you want solved but also to
something more enduring so I build the
connection at both of those levels and
then of course being people who deal
networks all the time you know how
quickly this can scale which is why the
the logo and I'm just saying this is an
explanation there's no way a plug if you
notice it's a little swirling logo the
logo of our company is a triad because
what we've found is is one of the best
ways to take a group that is
individually competitive stage 3 and get
them up to stage 4 is to encourage more
triadic values based relationships that
involve three people so notice if I
connect Michael and Doug it's triatic
because I'm the third member of that
triad I've connected them and then this
can of course scale very quickly so on
the basis of that then we can really
answer Doug's question about how do we
know who's in what group so take a look
at what's up here this is an actual
little Scioscia Graham of the network
side the structural side of a tribe and
so you can just you know shout out if
you know the answer what you know move
my cursor here so I won't get away from
microphone what you see right here what
stage four because you notice triadic
relationships how about right here three
because I'm great and you're not and
you're not and you're not so I put you
in your place I give you your assignment
and then I micromanage you and treat you
like a commodity but notice here I'm
going
I know I'm great now I'm great it's like
the movie the Highlander there can be
only one that's like a faculty meeting
at USC conversation without resolution
here we've got another little hub and
spokes at three here we've got four so
who's great we are who's not great this
group okay so notice the intervention
then that you can make if you do what
Doug what in my answer to Doug's
question about just notice who's
connected to whom they're all
necessarily speaking the same language
in this tribe you hear stage 4 spoken
you hear stage 2 spoke and my life
really sucks you hear stage 3 spoken I'm
great and this person's not and I'm in
an epic life-and-death struggle with
them and to kind of reengineering all we
did to get this is the before this is
the after is really two things number
one teach people how to triad and
encourage them to try out themselves and
number two encourage them to encourage
others to try out so if you take that to
levels down now you'll notice you see a
lot more Stage four across the board so
the interventions then become relatively
not just easy but obvious so when you
see hub-and-spoke behavior that's where
you want to introduce triads do you want
to introduce triads when you see stage
two behavior no they're not ready for it
okay so that's kind of then the two
levels level one is linguistic just to
recap and then see comments questions
you have level one is linguistic
terminus t'k screens remember not just
the language that people speak but more
the set of terms they used to make sense
of their world and then level 2 that is
correlate with it that goes along with
it is structural and bottom line you
want to take if you really want to
optimize for effectiveness and energy
level and innovation and things that you
really care about as I know both
individuals and as a company you want to
take your groups to Stage four if
they're not stabilize them using triad
values based communication and then
every once in a while move up to four
ask those sort of Apple questions and
then move down to four and stabilize
when you do that you're actually in the
top 7% of naturally occurring groups
which are those stable at four able to
take an occasional leap up to five do
something history-making come back down
and then get down to business
okay comments questions about any of
this any thoughts at all
Doug you got your back I got your back
sometimes there's like organizational
hierarchies right and the tribes
especially talked about taking like
people at level 2 and level 3 where
they're basically working you know with
one sort of central like and sort of
risk right right they may not line you
know the organizational structure and
the people who leave might actually work
effectively with
so what you do in a case like that where
you have you know something
other people
a manager is for whatever reasons that's
not able to connect with them there's no
natural person
okay so the question again is a very
good one which is what if you have a
person that is disconnected and then and
the manager is incapable of connecting
with them so then what do you do in that
kind of hierarchical situation the
obvious answer is you need to find
someone not necessarily the hierarchy in
fact in fact almost always not in the
management hierarchy that will connect
to them now
having said that let me just go off on a
tangent this is really important and
frankly is the reason I get out of bed
every morning besides the need to use
the restroom of that something I won't
bore you with so the problem with
management is by its nature its
stage-three its nature so if Doug works
for me
okay come and see me it's called a
one-on-one noticed ionic relationship
and then what do I tell Doug Doug I need
you to do these three things okay these
three things don't anything else just
these three things and in the end of a
year or six months I do an appraisal of
Doug where I tell him how we did and
then I offer him some kind of incentive
or reward for having done or not done
those three things if you didn't do
those three things that I show him the
door as a sign to all of you you better
get in line the nature of that is I'm
great you're not dyadic relationship not
triad and there's values present nowhere
in that everything is commoditized so in
the setup you said what about a manager
what I would say is someone in
management is often not set up to do
this unless they step out of their
formal hierarchical role and really
connected more of a tribal or network
fashion you see the point someone in
management may find it really difficult
is it will come across as and I'm great
you're not intervention they already
know that they're not great and not
doing a great job and not connected that
doesn't solve their problem or in any
way out value in fact that only
reinforces it so the cure for stage two
and three behavior is not management
it's in fact less management it's a lot
more leadership yes over here yes you
said
Stage four means event yes we talked
about taking they tried to stage four
does that mean creating a dam or pouring
out of them yeah so the question is in
stage four requires of them does it do
we then need to to come up or
manufacture identify them the answer is
yes you do
now if you don't manufacture them the
group may produce them which may not be
in them that you want okay because often
them will be the next tribe over that in
fact you actually you know sort of need
their help this happens a lot in in
armed services and things where the
group that we're in competition with is
another group within the same that's not
what you want so like in the case of CB
Richard Ellis the problem was they had
to manufacture a competitor worthy of
competition because if they went with
the next player in the in the market I
won't mention the name but it wasn't
someone that was worthy of a company of
that capability in and caliber so what
you want to do as a leader is and I'm
not just saying that you stand up and
say they are the enemy so I declare that
stage three you go into the group in you
ask them you who should we be competing
against so we were really to come up
with the best possible competitor what
would it be and great leaders and
companies will often set two groups in a
friendly competition and set you know a
purely symbolic prize the winner of it
gets this little clicker but it's
symbolic that encourages that so if you
do it in a systematic thoughtful way
instead of simply finding another group
to beat up against because we want to
you can use the natural competition to
your benefit otherwise you can really
work against you thank you that answer
the question
okay any other could we just got a
couple minutes you're look Doug again
so yeah the question is what's the
lower-end on on tribes can you have a
group it yeah I mean kkm2
what happened so the what happens below
20 is exactly the same dynamics but
because the the number of people is
smaller they'll jump around on that
tribal map they won't really be stable
there won't be a way that we communicate
one of the definitions of culture coming
from two researchers named Elam Kennedy
is the way we do things around here
there kind of is no way we do things
around here because it's such a small
group because you got to three people if
you add another one to the group it
completely changes the dynamic but if
you've got twenty people and you add a
twenty first probably that twenty first
person will adapt his or her behavior
instead of the group of twenty modify
the only exception is to be kind of
honest with the you know with the with
the findings here is if that person is
someone of remarkable caliber and
someone let's say that you've got a
group of twenty and Barack Obama joins
your group your group will radically
change because Barack Obama just joined
the group but outside of those
situations adding that n plus one person
doesn't lead to a dramatic change so
after twenty find a point of stability
okay
we've time for one more comment question
if there is one okay well then two
things and I'll wrap it up these are
both very short number one is I really
appreciate you being here very much
appreciate the opportunity to you know
to come to Google I mean I know you hear
this all the time but if someone is in
the field of education I've been
teaching college since nineteen ninety
been full-time on the on the Marshall
School the USC business school faculty
since 95 I mean I just can't get over
what a revolution you have created in
the world I mean I think back to doing
my dissertation I was going to checking
out books I mean it just seems so I'm
telling my my grad students how I did my
PhD that sounds like something out of
the Flintstones
I mean really the what you've
contributed has just been I think when
our children's children look back this
will be one of the really epic moments
in history largely because of what you
do every day individually and together
that's a short way of saying thank you
really appreciate what you do I mean it
is dramatic and it is transformational
and number two and this is really
personal you know to Michael I really
thank you for the opportunity to be here
the opportunity to meet many of you and
and to spend some time so if you're
watching remotely thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
