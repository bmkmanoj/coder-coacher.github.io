what is talk so this talk will be bound
about a technique for our finding this
technique is called only model checking
and we will also present our tool which
implement influence this technique can
opportunities called llvm sieve which
stands for low-level only model checker
okay let's start with a very general
problems the battle against software
bugs so I want to give some examples
about how software bus turned out in
realistic examples and what some people
suggested how to deal with those
software bugs so let me start back at
the end of two thousand eight so this
example is about mobile devices more
particularly about the Microsoft media
player soon and strange thing happened
on 20 on the 31st December of 2008 when
suddenly all of those 32 gigabyte zoom
devices suddenly stopped working so if
it were switched off you could not start
it again and that was a cause a problem
because many people wanted to use their
devices on three years eve to place a
music on their party and the devices
didn't work and the reason for this was
that it was a part in the clock
initialization of these devices which
didn't work on some particular days you
truly please and the 31st of 2008 was
just such a day on which is advice for
this clock visualization
to fortunately on the next day first of
the first january 2009 this pack didn't
show up anymore because leave here and
change and then the device and started
working again but nevertheless it
brought some not so good press for
microsoft okay let's look at another
example which happened around the same
time and it's also about mobile devices
so this time we are talking about a
device from research in motion and this
device is storm which was introduced at
the end of two thousand eight and it
also suffered from some facts which many
users complained about and one perhaps
more even more interesting than those
boxes the reaction of the co-ceo gym
balls in here and how he reacted what he
said about how to do sucks he said in
the interview but are these matter what
software is just a new reality which
maybe means you cannot do anything about
it okay because there is so much time
pressure and have enough money you just
have to accept that there will be a
senior software perhaps over time in the
new releases low as possible yes
mentioned but of course this is not a
position that we want to so we want to
do something else with us not just say
that's something we can do anything
okay so let's leave the area of mobile
devices in switch to some other area and
that's about security and our backs in
operating systems system software and
applications which can be exploited by
hackers for example over before the web
or in other notions in this regard this
context acid cyber war for example where
also such things up exploit it and the
example that they want to show here that
happened at the end of 2009 beginning of
2010 and it was later named Operation or
aura and it was caused by a zero-day
vulnerability Internet Explorer which
was exploited so did this was a security
hole in microsoft internet explorer and
that was exploited by it presumably
chinese hackers to break into computer
systems and also welcome to google
systems into systems from google and
they try to get access illegal or
unauthorized access to intellectual
property from google they also had some
gmail accounts from Chinese your rights
activists and the reaction of Google was
afterwards that they said that in this
up then he was a highly sophisticated
and co-ordinated attack force going on
here but what is the main point here for
me and is that this was this was finally
just horse by a very small error in
internet explorer there was one used
after freire a huge and up this whole
thing so it's very small errand in one
program hood and posture very large easy
and besides who will also other
companies were affected too in total
percentage 35 companies from all
different kinds of industry
factors were affected by this attack
here okay so this is such another
example of such an error has a small
error which is large in these moods and
this is this is not a very special case
so this is something which is which is
quite generous so you can see this here
from this speaker another for example
here so this figure shows the number of
vulnerabilities which were both by
buffer overflows the buffer overflow is
just one particular kind of of software
errors which can be in a program and you
see it does this piece here what shown
here is the number of software errors or
unrealities in Softimage for which an
exploit was known and which were caused
by after over programs and you see the
numbers are quite high so we have and
they advise tables so we see that in two
thousand eight hundred more than 500
such vulnerability is caused by buffer
overflow problems this number is not
really going down very fast so it seems
that the situation and how we can deal
with such facts of it is not getting
much better over time
okay so and one thing which I found
quite interesting wasn't a message which
was posted on an internet forum that's
only l WM he looks porn and it was
hosted by some user in 2005 in reaction
to a after overflow error in the ceiling
Congressional library and here is what
he has he has written this is a joke
back vs aliens that he was using in his
problem that he said we should have been
done with CD box long ago because it's
this is old software it's 10 or 15 years
old and you continue it should be
possible to analyze the code improve
that there are no remaining buffer
overflows that's exactly the direction
that we also want to follow but not like
what you have seen before with ribbon
for example just say this is in your
reality but something about this along
the sides and what also interesting is
that you continue to bear summer's over
we definitely nice to ask them with
response or something like that sir
perhaps you'll have to chance in the
future ok so this close is my list of
examples on just more or less random
selection of some problems in software
the effects editing course ok so we now
have these effects in our software and
the question is how how do you deal with
them how absolutely deal with them so
let's compare reality how facts are
currently handles and what is our vision
how they text could be handled in the
future so think of written is my
software a nice software which consists
of different not you'll fight this one
here but unfortunately how to avoid the
software still a sandbox
is still there you so put some places
and so what to do about them starts now
so typically you will start to write
some test cases and drum those test
cases though it means in some way you
have you or your armory or your
machinery to deal with buck said you
just start looking at some very
particular points and shoot your arrows
it those points and see what happens and
in this example perfect haha you see but
there was nobody at this place so
interesting okay my software is correct
for this particular example so let's
continue with some water test case is
another hair instead of shoes that this
software and in some cases you might be
lucky like here with this arrows you hit
the back but with others you are you are
not so lucky finally of course you do
not know whether they are still parts
left in your software of course you
might reduce the number biking good
tests but they might still be something
left but there was a screw that testing
and only show the presence of gods but
none of the actions yeah from those five
very directly here this is the same
government so of course what we would
like much more if there would be some
kind of device or Oracle or during which
will tell us exactly where the months
our which the places we have to look at
which test cases do we have to write to
find out the bugs or you can also think
of it like some kind of scattered in
scanner will just go over your software
once like premises scanner at the
airport like this here and then upwards
suddenly turns you very well
and then you can just fix these pinpoint
pinpointed as in the program and this is
how we think of our tool that works in
some way like this scanner at me thst ok
so let's now turn to his message that we
propose SS this scatter this method is
called pounding water chicken one
question first serve how how do you
define buck but it's a very good
generally has surely undecidable or you
would need spec for the program inside
yeah yeah of course is he as you said
there are very different notion so we
mainly think of the obvious programming
errors like these are fertile of those
who choose seen before and after opens
closes for itself or something which can
detect without writing email
notification or integer overflow this
would be another such class or division
by zero so i'll show some examples for
certain case where you run into
undefined behavior and simple yes
undefined behavior or behavior which
makes you program crash or just illegal
things that happen with the program but
is this is very much like or if it's
honest on the source code level of
course so it's not a high level ever
finally decide for example or to improve
designs but it's all very low level very
low level two petzl surviving have
chosen a low level armada check
but we will see bit more about this okay
but let's turn now to the technique that
we want to use this technique of
pounding model checking now the start
was few important ideas of this
technique so that's the most important
idea is that with this technique to you
want to analyze all paths of a program
in all the inputs of a program at the
same time so typically with with an SPF
event going through one program path
you're just using one particular set of
input values for each variable button
exactly what exact value and then you
run it here we want to do everything at
once so we're checking for to change all
past and all inputs at once and then
there is a strict restrictions you see
here so not all arbitrary paths that
only has a prefix length is what we can
check with alternate the force my ass
but what does it mean missed its length
and fixed length in our case means that
the number of loop iterations is limited
which can be taking any true and also
the number of basic function poles which
can be taken are limited this approach
so this is something which you give to
the problem if you check now before they
started so you would say analyze all
loops up to 1000 rupees erations for
example or analyze function halls upto a
nesting depth of 100 of some tonight and
then all ask each other which or within
this limit will be analyzed up not the
ones which why are you doing this proper
message taking properties of programs in
general is undecidable but if you have
finite pass then this means that
everything else also gets ionized if you
have only finite program pass this means
that during these final runs I wanted a
finite out of your memory
can be he'll be looked at so all the
data structures will also be fine I've
in that case and checking properties
about finite things is something which
is decided with them okay so this is the
first I here analyze all paths at once
with this restriction of having okay say
something about the practical limits
definitely do yeah so hopeful looks it
is very dependent on program so do those
things which we see during our category
that's hundred or thousand iterations of
loop which which were you are using but
of course if you depends on many things
away if you just have for example one
very large stuff up with hundreds of
thousands of fights and you will have
one loop which goes over to initialize
it to zero they're much larger pound but
typically you can also parameterize this
order just choose this smaller battle
for verification but around 100,000
their Center next thing that this might
even see too often I sufficient will use
very low numbers of nesting depth so too
is offensive vision 3 4 &amp;amp; B do not eat
there because you're talking about C
programs here yeah yeah I have mentioned
this little that will be taxable to the
next slide yes it's maybe see what we
are looking at
little bit we also started recently
forget c++ and mainly system software or
low-level story okay the second main
idea is to encode the whole program the
logic in a suitable logic so because
that's where provers can work on in
Wentworth perhaps important in our
places that we want to transform our
programs in some kind of stateless
program so typically your program has a
state which is also the time let's say
you have some structure or a class which
saw some values that you're just
changing those fellows over time and we
try to reformulate this program into
something which is stateless so this is
a bit like a functional programming with
yourself for example item raising
functional programming but this makes it
much easier to conform it to launch
against the techniques that we losing
areas for example this ss8 form single
static assignment form for variables
which yeah by all technique is also
already given then we are using accessor
functions for memory and also these
techniques like I think it's like loop
unrolling untreated what we're using and
I'm keeping my house to get such as
things okay so the next main idea is
model semantics of his stride
instructions very precisely so this
means we do not want to have any
approximation of what an exciting
instruction does they but we want to
have exactly this man needs of each
instruction in our program we achieve
that by modeling everything on a bit
level so for example if you have enough
it operation you program like a bitwise
or end or some
going on then is all this model of the
bit level so you get exactly which
pinches your very very nice everyone and
this mainly means that x is logical
empowering we're simulating the harbor
which runs on your system also finally
works on people on gate level yet
seemingly so you're going to a very low
level also in verification and which
might've my team a bit strange because
the formulas also a very large by this
but the solar cell account be available
they are able to enemies how do you
define the memorable so like a modern
art where usually a frequent and more
models which one is specified really
mm-hmm sorry what do you do about that
you just assume something chauvinistic
behavior now also we have some o be just
as you can have Indian authorities
behavior for example for it program
inputs you can also have any terminus
the behavior of out of memory for
example you can make so we have one
particular memory won't it be built into
our system but it for example doesn't
say anything where the memory blocks
which you get from a low for example
where they are exactly located but it
just testify some non overlapping
constraints for different methods
constraint defined that can you deal
with caching media thanks so you know if
you have synchronization primitives the
synchronization with it isn't connected
to all no that's that's not something
that we have actual programs maybe not
in parallel programs it because that
we're also not looking at july second
segment so memorable game is more
colocation yeah a location where this
press ok so now if you have this logical
formula which comes out transformation
of the program can then use these salgas
which are already there set for example
for compositional energy formulas or SMG
solver for decidable it's stronger
objects which can also call for child
without a race or how to eat vectors
using these let's just shortly do
historical notes still is technical
pumpkin motor checking is very
established for quite some years now in
how the verification so almost all how
their companies or shipbuilding
companies i use immunity verify that
chip design
and then around 2000 for this technique
to verify our way was been transferred
to the software area to that was done by
Clark pudding and Leah female university
okay so this was the general it means or
some ideas together rapid us
understanding of how this technique
works now we will turn to our to the SEC
of your own chapter so now what you
already guessed before is that LLL pmc
is working to 1c programs also on some
class pro see the stars programs we only
started with that and of course it tries
to find us remaining backs in your
program and let's look at some design
levels so one no what's that we wanted
without whom to handle all programming
language features so this means if you
have written in C program with other
tools you often have to change some
constructs in your program just the
money run if you make it run for your
verification tool that's something which
we didn't want we have so we wanted
whatever you're using AC program which
you should just support or language
features it's okay it was like at speed
fields or things like that or what using
memory days type task right integer to
memory
and then read the same half the memory
re area 5 for example such okay and to
make this easier we are doing our
verification not for the salsa to level
but we are instead using a compiler
intermediate language and nowadays
they're using the immediate language
from the LLVM compiler and the
advantages of using such as the mediate
language is that it is it is much
simpler than the high-level programming
language like C or C++ so give me just
looks like this assembler and you don't
have to deal with complicated things
like the first operator overloading or
some conversion routines which will run
the background without explicitly
mentioned unicode ok so we also wanted
it to be easy to use for non-experts so
this means that you will have to write
large specifications which my parents
also people even be larger than the
program itself but it should be possible
to use it without any specifications
always just very few specifications on
your program another thing is to achieve
high position and high position in this
case means that we do not want to get
false every ports or limit them as far
as possible and we do it one that our to
mrs. any errors but doesn't it by
definition
only finance yes of course yeah I think
the general problem is that program back
checking or verifications undecidable so
you have to make some restrictions right
and I think that perhaps pick out is how
to make these pictures in the best way
so there are of course many different
possibilities how you can restrict you
into together or your check out with my
making decidable in from inside it and I
think these techniques of bounding pass
is something something which makes a lot
of sense in practice sleep ok so we are
using this big precise techniques here
to avoid false reports or missing these
errors and we want to provide a
comprehensive set of building checks i
will show you a bit more about this
chase on the next slide and scalar give
us your forces problem also with these
logic based tools because the promised
are from theoretical complexities then
i'm quite hard and so you have to find
some tricks to make that run laws or
with larger programs one thing is that
we are using these very advanced S&amp;amp;T
soldiers for example and the other thing
is deafening also trying to get rid of
easy soft problems by having some
preprocessors over simplification
procedures
okay so before I come through the
building checks I just want to have this
other side here which tells you a little
bit about that internal scheme schematic
of our tool for checking is of how the
English processed so on the Left we
start with your source code program then
you run the LLVM compiler front end on
that and when we then get is different
hello vm intermediate language is
difficult in school which is either
briskness everyone to a transformation
but still it more extracted the usual
pylons that we have okay so this is Al
will be evident now maybe I'll do a
little disappointed when it does first
is that it unrolls loops and thus
function inlining this is mainly for
Henry despite by dinosaur ridge with
properties that you get a status formula
and we have this transformed
intermediate language which we then
transformed to a bocce so we were
logical encoding and then we have a
formula in this particular logic bit
vectors with a race we then have some
simplifications which running his
formula to make it smaller and you get
rid of the few checks which might injure
then we asked simplified form of us if
he's all right and finally we get the
result we can either be that it has
hasn't found any errors in the program
or if it has found error it we also are
outputting arrow trace to show
the patient here okay let's turn to the
checks that are built in so without you
having to specify anything districts for
the first thing is that it are two
checks for the internal flows for
example if you add to our shooting
touches and the result of this situation
would be not representable in the space
or integer then in overflow here is
another example which is better a little
bit harder to see that also go below
half is here and then it open i have no
happen can happen at this point here we
have the negation of x there's one case
where this negation can lead to an
overflow or signed integers and we will
show this bit up watching our game or
what for which particular balance so
another thing if we check is for
divisions by zero for integer division
by zero so something like this year for
example if you have a statement where x1
divided by another variable and you
wonder whether why it can be zero in any
case then come places it can be really
easy to see what this can happen but in
other cases perks like this one here
might be not so easy to see whether such
a division by zero can happen and how do
we check for this another thing is
invalid bit shifts which is perhaps not
so well known this for a problem and
this is something which the seller to
define so if you have a say a 32-bit
integer and you shifted to the left by
more than 32 bits then the results
undefined so you might expect that I
just filled in by zeros which is what is
shifted out but that doesn't happen so
it's just undefined and implement
are also doing something different it's
just shift with this just take modulo
that's something would be checked for
then we check for all kinds of video
memory accesses so one in mind for exams
of inception the rain makes out of
bouncing something but also all kind of
other memory accesses so what we have
maybe doing is we check all reads and
writes for memories no matter where they
come from and check whether they fall
into a legal area true infra water right
you're checking 14 value fries well as
we would be something where you have a
pointer which doesn't come out of a
previous mammal instruction but it's
just some other point on which you pass
to displease we're checking for double
fries which is when your particular case
of humility slave freed the same memory
price and then we have some further more
recent hearing tests that we have
checked the air it then they've built
into our to like okay and at this point
I want to pass number to draw your
shoulder a little bit about our
thousands likely we ever hear just
it's not started but we start with the
first example that was this small broker
and what we want to show us what happens
when you run this through our tool and
you take the fire apps see and the
magazine apps and we want to take if
Annad of these built-in properties are
violated here and you can see some tiles
to code to lift things are passed code
to this led embed code fight that's
absolute Nazi top bc and then it runs at
our tool on that file and it did indeed
find that and it gives short synopsis of
what that error is it tells us what kind
of errors what it was signed integer
overflow and it helps us on which on the
assembly line it was and it tells us
what the values were in that case that
we're in some way involved in this
particular instruction so in this case
we divided 0 x minus well the large
number ok subjected yes and what you can
see here is the precise location in
which this error occurs in which does
this undefined value was calculated and
you can see that it is the that equals
minus X case then what happens here is
that this particular value X that we
gave to the proper method is in blin the
smallest possible integer and would
happen this cases I will try to be at
the absolute value of that and that is
not representable in 32 bits so that
would be in max plus 1 because
complement this is not symmetric that
has to Casanova both somehow so this is
what happens see what our tune there is
it essentially tragic well virtually
executed this man for all possible
values of x so that's in 2 to the power
of 32 different possible values if you
try to run down manually and testing
every one of them it will take minutes
hours I don't know quite a long time
actually so we're quite a lot faster we
can do that in 0.007 seconds these
aren't white samples there we picked
these small example so they fit onto one
screen but we can do a little bit more
than that the next example couldn't
change the right to equal normal sex
possible code just
like this but you get now assume the
numbers change the same much the same
guys same actually but we're okay smugly
211 because it's a woman's yeah one more
my sex
it's 1 minus yeah but not the assignment
occasionally I work for yes yeah
positive and it did take a different
number it now divides enough that
subtracts one next yeah yeah um can play
around with a different example very do
that offline yeah we have a second
example in it this is a simple division
and reacted in a faction which takes X
of my sex and white can be any value and
you probably guessed that this is also
dougie and yeah
def not see
and you can see that well obviously
contains the back in that division line
and it tells us it was a division by
zero in which one assembly line it is
and which lines see codon isn't what the
value sign you can see that Y is zero so
obviously that's the division by zero so
what we can do to get rid of that this
we can catch this particular back if one
is still in that file for comparison and
if two is the same one and because you
know the division ratio is not defined
in this case we try to approximate it
like that simply because that's the
closest we can get up to any kind of
result obviously it's a very poor
replacement but better than crashing in
that case so we run the tool again and
we get still together back and this one
is not that expected and the back this
time is to have a minus a very large
number and y is minus 1 and what happens
is very close to the case we trust them
we divided by minus 1 which is taking
you know the symmetric de Leon positive
side and us again undefined so what we
do here is you not overfill errinel 30
minutes oh no you have never ensure that
it actually to death let's just drop
edition from zero ok 10 the why we never
be here you can add something which is
called an assertion so we can write our
assumptions
Ella pfcs movement is everything yeah
the way we fixed it here is to fix the
method and just you know that in that
case again and in Maxis the closest one
we can get to MX plus one so we take
that one and we can verify that one and
this time it tells us there is a
that coating the leaders interesting we
try to because we know you're interested
in C++ more than C curve we try to
implement a little bit of C++ support
and we've had about a week for that and
we got this um Ches again can anyone see
what happens in that case and why this
is what up like this will produce a
package descriptors says the young
person you should take one of the
wonders and if we actually
means
you can see that it does indeed detect
this particular missing virtual
instructor what happens is that this
cast up here from the right to base to
this point arithmetic are the pointer 0
points into the middle of this derived
class and at the beginning of it if
you're not call delete all this without
a virtual instructor record the lead
thing essentially free CS replacement
for that on this pointer which was never
a located directly which is in the
middle of an emic eight o'clock and then
se illegal what we do is we don't static
to just check that this is missing a
virtual is chocolate we actually execute
what a simulated execution of that coat
and we catch that particular example
when this does actually happen um yes
you something first Sammy's thank you
very much if we have to wait it what you
think Maria just it again this was just
a small selection of these errors so we
have to show you anything for example
about this memory accesses new memory
press will have later on the chance to
show you something like that somebody
would see me after you talk okay so I
want to switch now to look a little bit
different thing it so the question is
not if you have this tool how can you
use it in your daily work typically you
would have test cases and the question
is what to do with this how can you put
on some ideas how you can adjust your
test cases to make subject okay so what
would be a typical workflow with this
l.m.c of course the first thing is that
you can just check for these low-level
areas which are already building so you
just do or there's nothing around a
stool on your co didn't see what it
outputs okay this might already find
some of those errors that they might be
that same person more interesting things
that you will also want to check so for
example some functional correctness
properties which are not on this little
purchase tests and where she's now how
can you come to such functional
correctness tests with this new level I
will show this year I've call it
migrating from testing for verification
or to this systematic way of but filing
and one possibility is just to protect
the functional correctness of the power
of your code just to provide an
alternative implementation of our show
sample of this then you just have these
two implementations and you just compare
them where there are all possible inputs
they produce the same output and if this
is the case then you can be more sugar
that your program is correct with those
computations are different enough
another thing is something which was
called parametrized two min tests or
also abstract testing so there are
different names for this and so the name
from a parametrized unit test comes from
microsoft research paper from 2005 which
has to do with their hex tool for
testing software and they have used this
name this notion of parameter as unit
tests there and we've done something
similar in the automotive software
checking so what is their idea behind is
parametrized in the tests / typically in
the unit tests you just have one
particular case that you check so one
for each variable you fix one value at
your body and your coat with those
values in c wats gallica included such
parameterised test you will just take
one variable or several barrels and not
fix the w-4 those variables but just
leave it open and then you wanted to
check all those variables at once or all
those values for the variable supports
and these could for example instead of
English liza-lu 20 you might know that
your program expects perhaps linkages
between 0 and 100 and you just then give
such a range in one
and a third possibility is to write
check out program and the idea here is
that if you have a quite complicated
algorithm to compute something might
still be relatively easy to check
whether this result is correct and then
what you can do is to take your right
write a very fire or the check out
program which checks where the guard is
great which can be relatively small you
have your original program development
which computes some solution and then
you put them both together and check in
together this would mean it we have such
a checker function which takes the input
to a racial problem and the output of
what you programmed us and then you
check your original program together
with is with his check a function and
see whether this check function always
says yes this is a correct output
forward yes it's of course it's I think
a general problem if you want to do
functional correctness check so whether
you're using requirements or other kinds
of specifications for your program needs
if an overhead program that you have to
admit you have as I Haitians in the
descending if you like originally I'm it
like makes sense there might be another
alternative but what would I here for
example had in mind if you arrive in
something like such a logical solver I
cassettes all for example then it's very
hard to compute such such a solution is
quite easy to check such a solution in
if you write such a check a program that
might be so trivial that you believe
that nice that was the idea ok so now
it's time for demo again and this time
Jackson we need to get the demo and
print show two of those members know
from testing to this is not fun
verification wait a second
No
so this cockpit sample essentially shows
but Carson just mentioned we have no
time for fermentation of our message
which function correctly much verified
then we come down without that
alternative definition of some function
computes the same radius seojun runs in
this example is potentially it's a
population count example so you want to
figure out how many bits are set in the
Google bit vector and just be quickly
expenses and there are some clever ways
to do that which is optimized population
functions which essentially just does a
few bitches logical device and
operations and some others are taken and
of course you're interested to know
whether this actually computes what it
suppose to compute name is a number of
settled it to the next well one day you
can do it is cost to some unit tests
either that works correctly but again
they have tutors are started to possibly
inputs so unit testing is going to be
quite expensive what you can do in
status you can define an easier version
of so the profit function which also the
first computing operation how that it's
so easy that you probably believes that
it computes the population hand of new
projects which is this reference prop
count function and now the
to make their try that the optimized
function is doing what it's supposed to
do is and compute the outputs of pasta
sauce functions that you want to check
whether their OS compute the same return
their you and this is done in this main
method is a striper message so it
computes the return value of the
optimized implementation which I'm video
co-occurrence of limitations in it the
cells exhaustive eight hours the same
and are towards that is a buck bunny
boots or tries to find a wave as a
succession fails which means an input X
they are the two temptations that return
values and if it cannot find a sock in
the spa community can find an extra day
disagrees and here Sean's a function
breakfast of the optimizer so let's see
what our chili student of this example
ok
it takes a little bit longer now but
it's the much faster than unit testing
because we essentially says to check my
true to the 7 2 to the power 32 many
inputs takes slightly more than five
seconds you're in testing again will
probably take like an hour or so and it
finds no disagreement in the
implementations and the referencing
mutations the Optimus implementation so
we can be purchasing this property
management imitation is actually correct
as well ok the next example i'm gonna
show is the second message of castor
just mentioned that you essentially want
to generalize unit tests so here we have
no function which is supposed to compute
the next large number one in given f of
X which is a power of 2 so for example
if who gives it function value 5800
under each arm a 50 8192 so to those
cancel out the next larger power of 2
and it again does some via pitch
shifting and bitwise operations was not
really clear that if it's working you
could again to do the tests so for
example could just pass it set number of
a thousand eight hundred and see what
the output is the increase such that
it's always confusing the right paper
matte input what we want to be a little
more generic term that's a we are just
one testicle running 51
inputs and this we can do using this
huge statement in the striver message so
essentially the assume statement saying
exes should be bigger than itself i
under the 92 in smaller than certain
16,000 detonator poor and for all values
didn't arrange the message and your
tuition are three chances in cells
rather than a teapot so it's much energy
unit testing in the sense that it covers
the larger range of inputs not just one
input so let's see that as
implementation is correct for this
generate test case
and again it's quite fast it doesn't I'm
there are meetings at all possible
inputs in this range and always confused
the right output which is nice but of
course we could be more generous than
that even and Alexis parametric test
cases that cosmetic Norfolk has a little
harder to specify what the output should
actually be because now we only assume
that X is not negative and not too big
because we don't want an overflow so
choppy lesson in mex haha essentially
and that the assumption that the f of X
so we now set for all X that are
non-negative and not too big and you
want to check out the function of you
serve as an extra power to and to do
that by using three assertions first of
all you started c return value is bigger
than the input then it's not too big so
that most r IC input and it should of
thousands of their power to which we can
also specify using mr. shin so now here
it takes liking to to the sake run
different inputs and people to see
whether the message is correct for all
of them
and again it doesn't really take very
long we don't find the back you mean
that our source inputs the master
franchisee or two of us compute the
correct out and I guess that actually
computes
continue thank you
okay so you see these examples to power
from our true but those have all been
quite small examples just to make you
see what the positive checks of these
tools are now will now show you some
first results that because of these two
is relatively new so I mean you haven't
made extensive testing but the less I
have to result here which are a bit
larger here so the first example working
check was a functional plate or it's a
program which is complete and that's
from a embedded system benchmark suite
this one is called power study for stuff
for power in something testing and
that's just a bit larger as 96 lines of
code but you have to set quite high
limits here where I have to set an
underlayment of thousand because boobs
are capable many times and I've actually
in the unit of cool and then it takes an
illegal bitches in this benchmark which
presumably wasn't level before this is
an area and this means so this kind of
widgets are a bit strange things that we
try to detect but as I mentioned already
if you shift such a value which is a
32-bit value by more than 30 cookies
left then there is always undefined so
this would be undefined because you were
can have on the right hand side is that
this value gets 44 so you would have a
shift of 44 weeks which is just anything
and this took quite some time mainly
because these unrolling so that was
bit more than one and a half minutes to
find this area here on vertical and
their problem and another example where
we found an error was in a routine for
mpeg-2 video decoding that's a decoder
which is quite two years old and it was
reconciling software simulation crew we
took a look at some part of this decoder
and in particular the integer discrete
cosine has all but in heavy arithmetic
to transfer transform these rocks video
and so the whole the color consists of a
bit more than 10,000 times of seek out
and this you will test that we were over
this parametrize unit test for checking
this discrete cosine transform within
the consisted of six hundred 766 lines
of code including letters so what did
this routine do so in to one input eight
by eight bytes or a pyit drop integer
inputs passed it to this universe
discrete cosine transform and look
whether this routine works correctly and
we were just looking for these low-level
bucks this building checks that we had
there it should buy the loop under a
limit of thousand twenty for a
functionary of two and we do jacket
readiness our found error in this
program so this occurred after having
computed eyes heavy arithmetic cover
some particular value that was used as
an index into an array and this index
was just too high for the array but it
was being not really obvious to find
ce from the top directly whether such
rallies could be computed from this
arable farm tell me what's this okay so
this would be to a little bit larger
examples without beauty and so
approaching the end of my talk so I want
to summarize now what we have shown you
infinitely soon because many about this
back fighting technique I mean water
shaking in our tool for this technique
which LOL BNC so if you've seen it Alvin
seeking very saucy programs i would say
up to several thousand lines of code so
because this was relatively arithmetic
how to verify in other case we should be
able to scale up to a bit more so I'm
saying in several thousand I've phone
are possible with this tool and it's
especially suited for low level system
code lettuce method has already shown
that it works fine film in for example
in those case studies which were done
with this general method of pouring
water check more software and not
without you and so this is some work
that we have done in the past and it was
for example device drivers in the linux
kernel that we have found some error
with Miss technique also agreements
checking of cryptographic routines so we
prepare to NES implementations and we
also were using this technique in
embedded systems automotive
domain to functional verify certain
devices on a car okay so this is the
same now and if you would be to the
future what is the reasonable one what
we like to do in the future something
which is missing from this supporting
all of see it all C++ is still floating
point arithmetic which is contextually
not that hard to implement but it takes
some time the other thing is to
portforward more complex or complicated
languages then see like zebras massive
exit jective see what is also something
that has to be done in the future is to
provide some specifications for quite
widely used library functions for
example for deep-sea read functions from
a file write functions to file that's
something which we have not yet covered
without rule which says we have to do in
the future and of course of all those
improvements are always good to have so
that's what we're learning in the future
but I think that this technique is
already quite quite usable for many
programs especially if you're using
these techniques like generalizing a
test case for example in the test case
is simply do not pass the whole program
that not very favorite just a small
fraction that it might be solution okay
so this concludes my talk our talk and
if you want to get further information
you can be the getting from our research
groups website here very very
all directly from the site website from
our tool and we are planning to make
this tool available in April this year
so when you can start working at a bank
pension down to the ocean creature
softly thank you you asked the question
that I always asked in France about
model shaking which is what do you do
about higher water programs as soon as
you get a function pointer so kate
taylor's or objects yeah yeah so we can
handle function pointers without you but
the techniques to handle them are mainly
also food to in line all possible
functions that could occur in certain
place so if you have a function pointer
can try to find out the candidate set of
possible functions it might be holding
at place so you basically functionalize
the program and the first order yeah
yeah yeah it's that's meaning then you
can just try to make it a bit more
scalable from Hollis Hollis there were
together with your parametric unit test
so you can parameterize
now i think in principle it should work
so you do not have to fix it one
function be here in your progress in too
many what you're doing is you just make
a big switch statement in your program
which just switches between different
functions that right but then I we have
to specify which you need to lenticular
function is need to know the whole
program at that yep that's what means
you can really unit worry now I manage
with the same but i would say you need
to hold source code so you cannot assume
for example that your function points to
something start over yet but if I'm
talking about I want to check out i
believe it's not defined what the whole
sauce is so for example the method
requires a export function the pigs
function is a parameter yeah there was
no more reasonable range of these
functions I mean that's not yeah yeah
everyone yes it's an example there which
we shall spare on cable and you do not
know anything about a function educate
deposited three parameters someone can
compute something of that that you can't
just check all trees that are possible
yes yeah that's also the case and but i
would say what is important here is that
you can check all or Union Army in your
program traces and this also means to
agree that you bound your data
structures so this means you for example
check all trees up to a size of 100 mils
or thousand dollars or something like
that and then then you can say something
about this isn't for many errors it's
they also over they already show up for
more limited to smaller example so
that's that's the idea we have this
table white white is expected to work
also shows of small results so in theory
obviously you don't have false positives
but in practice probably though because
there is a lot of code that just doesn't
care about some cases where you ever you
write a unit s and you pull out a helper
function that have to it has to in
parameters and you divide and you just
know that in you in your code you don't
call right have you run it over like
arbitrary examples and like looked at
how high your false positive riders no
as I said so this is relatively new is
too so we haven't been to reach any
testing but we can say about false
positives you stood so if you have
everything together you have that would
convert the whole source code and if
those bounds are sufficient then this
method is completed
show any for positives as long as their
program here is it there but for larger
examples is often not the case so
typically we have library calls for
example and for this library calls do
not want to include the whole source
code of the service calls and then you
will just give a specification or some
approximation of what this function does
and as soon as you're using those of
approximation see also can get some
false every false image I would say that
the method in general is complete and
doesn't provide such sure Eric such
false errors but in practical cases as
soon as the energy music library
functions then such things can happen
but we hope that it's still better than
with other tables like abstract
interpretation for example which I'm
making even closer approximation
stiffness that would be the interesting
thing because most like things I've seen
that five tags actually have the problem
of too many false positives in the end
it's just too much time to drill through
all those examples to actually find the
real bugs yeah yeah but I would say that
this that this is an advantage of this
family model checking method that it
should be better than for example this
straight interpretation tools which are
computing ranges for variables and with
using these big precise techniques you
can really often avoid this kind of to
cause approximation in chicken now I
also know if the static studies which
compare different verification tools and
also this absolute protection
that the rates can be really quite high
we have to make the Fraxel more
sophisticated saliency our consultants
and in that case is that we have then
I'll show you all the last slide for
example Liam's kirova so commodious off
it didn't turn out to be such a big
problem so when what I can also mention
we also make together with with Bosch
one kind of research project where we
try to combine a sec interpretation that
was a commercial tool that they were
already using it apush which is 440
space which is which produces like some
number of such false error reports if we
try to combine it with our method and we
did it in such a way that we first run
this less precise absolutely rotation
method and then out of those possible
errors that is to reporters we just
checking again without it could get rid
of I think one example present of those
by the treatment their pencils thanks
you said you spent about a week getting
the the basic C++ support engine how
much time you think we take to support
all by let's say most of C++ always hard
to get rough projects will take years
and decades I think we are not decades I
have a little bit i think in a year or
so you could really do it right behind
it so what is what is going so fast you
can say more about is what what are the
main points that we were once again
running in general that will be probably
quite quickly because on the llvm level
there's not that much of a difference
between C++ and C curve pluses are just
abstract assembler what was the first
larger change that we have to do is to
support function pointers and what we do
right now is within what in like all
possible function pointers that would
fit for example and we over approximate
and the inline lots more functions that
would actually be necessary so what we
have to do in that case is to go back
and look which motions could it actually
be and that would most of the time be
the ones of the derived classes for
example that would actually be
overloaded purchase of the same base
motion and we don't do that right now we
just take all functions that mesh have
an action signature so to get that
information which is completely lost on
the llvm level we'd have to spend some
more work on it but it's not like this
is a theoretical problems or an
engineering
just have to do implement doesn't yell
isn't there also theoretical problem in
the sense that your social space skills
quickly when you have an object on the
program because of all the functions you
might call it that's especially problem
because you taking all the functions
that are roughly match that's a lot more
that's the approximation that midst
inefficient it's it runs you can use it
but it won't be a sufficient to get it
vision and to reduce that over
approximation to really look exactly
those times that can actually be called
in that particular context to reduce it
to that number would be a little bit
more you can I suppose a game is rated
by looking at the type of a function you
can stripper looking which closet is
defining you can for example just see
what happens if if that particular
function is called you said an assertion
of that location where it is called and
instead of calling the function you say
oh now this is stop it here and tell us
what was the value of the function
pointer at this particular place and
then you can look it up which motion was
that value and you can take note it and
edit to the list of functions that could
be called at this particular point and
you can cash that information for later
on so you can say for example if it's
this function in this line I'm calling
one of these of this set of functions so
you could do things like that to reduce
the number of possible functions that
can be called but your still giving back
to my earlier point you're still bound
to your whole program
it can't get around that would happen
generate all possible
so like checking an object-oriented
library that's why would depress that
some intention of this so he wouldn't
really have to write some program which
uses the library until it has the whole
program that what you're doing is a live
version Jake copy that's what it would
do in a unit test you would actually
create the method of the object and
initialize it's v table and all that
stuff and instead of having one specific
object at that location you could say
okay this could be one of the subject of
this object but this this class of this
class and you get some kind of
non-determinism at that point but you're
still restricted to subsets it's like a
unit test but a little bit more general
and then produces the complexity engine
but if you just say it's some object and
I don't know anything about it then well
yeah most likely it will be two apart
like
the function it's I think that's I
either you have this kind of annotation
to the function itself and say appear
this function is always called with a
correct object of this of this of this
type or you simply create that project
so you have some kind of test driver
function that calls function you want to
check and that builds up let's say for
example you have some kind of tree data
structure with different kinds of
classes in that tree you build up a
small tree that fits the kind of tree
that we want to check and then if you
don't do it explicitly like object
number node number 5 is um of this class
but you say node number five is one of
these classes and you create a
nondeterministic look like that and then
you pass that one deterministic tree
into the function and you know that it
would be later restricted to this kind
of the beasts kind of trees so it would
be some kind of I think that's the best
approach you can do with this take a
unit test and make it more general and
more general until you hit that kind of
performance about until you can't make
it more general without making fish
I think that's the best way to go to
start off with something very specific
and to make it more general as far as
possible and you will come a lots more
different cases with that
so I on you to source people do their
work in compilers I do quite a bit of
from that very attractive we are right
here we could get it running for the
more basic data types that we use quite
quickly actually it will take more than
let's say another one of two weeks just
to get used to how to do part c class
but um couldn't know that it definitely
finds these errors we have checked them
the problem is Lucy does person really
parents it a specific last words what
that means but there is no fun soldiers
known that so Fonzie office yeah can you
easily limited complexity rather to face
it take those odds in your little bit
see if we give not talking about this
compression library or yes okay yeah
yeah we were looking at some parts of
net of this unique that was for example
check some complication the phone was
under there
because library functions between
pockets and bowls of water but this
check some computations for example that
something that you can check we also
have some guess which we can
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
