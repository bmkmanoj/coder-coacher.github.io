it's going to be a lot like when I
started and it's for this for the sake
of time we wanted to give oh we wanted
to start off by saying you know there
was this quiz we did and there's no your
Googler and there was a bunch of people
who asked us you know can you give us
the answers would be nice to have these
answers so we thought we will compile
these so who's who's commonly known as
space vulture it's Jurgen
you can try and get the answer from him
why is he called so though he does not
look like a vulture or a hawk but but
maybe there's a story there who's Steve
Jobs whipping-boy I think we can now to
play Steve with somebody else and Brad
continues to be that whipping boy there
is there is that story and by the way
Brad if you want to be a part of a
conference you should apply there was a
open search for that so we would love to
have you back that other people did so
and they were here who likes writing
books while enjoy a Kentucky Bourbon I
think there's we will add tons and tons
of beer to it and that would be James
Whittaker he he was very active while at
G Tech and probably that's one of the
reasons he loves India now so who knows
kung foo Anthony was the answer that we
had though I think there was somebody
else in the crowd that also had that
who's commonly known as moose and that's
John he is here and from New York not
loving India as much because cumin and
coriander sends to get his allergies
fired up so he's been staying away from
the food a who were it's the Stockholm
office I think there was a slight change
in that question I think originally we
had it who used to work at the Stockholm
office but now there was a person who
works in Stockholm harp and that's
Philippe he's here and who has a son who
could have four different nationalities
that's a great one it's a global world
Marcus has that that honor do we have an
answer for that or which one he is equal
to choose or are you gonna influence
that when he's 18 okay great
who's the non engineer and has an
important role in this G tag
I think many people reached out to a few
people that actually they were pretty
agitated that they were considered
non-engineers and if you did that then I
think you should have at least tried to
read a couple of these gender and
profiles before reaching out to people
it's Rajini she's the planning organizer
and was has been an integral part of
this conference so this one is
interesting who has worked on a list
this compiler team in his entire career
that's Burrell she actually shows up
down a few notches again because of a
person who understands and speaks about
Japanese in English I think when we
started the quiz we were thinking about
Daigo but then we actually went on
realized that Ted and Burrell both were
qualified for this particular criteria
who's been part of the Delhi State
cricket team that was that would be me
though Joel probably does not want to
you know recognize that fact that's the
next one whose country lost or one day
and a Test cricket series from India and
that was Joel and and you know it's part
of the Commonwealth Games so it was kind
of simcha for that I was a proud moment
for India who is French that's Phil and
good thing he didn't drink any wine
while he's in India at least I don't
know if any so he'll give us thing
that's when I stocked about who has
worked in Google Phoenix office and now
I was working in the city popularly
known as a Big Apple
it's Chaitanya I think he was talking
about how he's lost a lot of money in in
real estate based on investments in
these two spots and who's properly known
by the name of an endangered species its
entre entre pondered Fonda and I hope
you get which is the endangered species
is that the kind of I I would leave that
for your imagination so those were the
answers we have some winners and oh I'm
sorry
sorry I forgot about the bout there who
had a birthday yesterday
and that's Rajesh we tried to sing to
him last night he was embarrassed and
ran away very quickly and so we didn't
want to repeat it afterwards this
morning because it was still his
birthday in the US but anyway he didn't
feel about it so we have some swags for
the winners we first wanted to call out
the person who got the entire full
matrix say he does LOM Basha least will
you come up and get your or
I would encourage the rest of the
winners to come up for a sake of time
congratulations thank you for
participating in the exercise you have
anything to say did you find it fun and
entertaining okay that's great it was
good to see the speakers and then their
work and then different technologies
frameworks like the twist some of them
were really interesting topics Thanks
thank you yeah I think one of things we
tried to show here was the diversity
that is present at Google and I in our
engineering staff so that would be a
great way and we actually pay a lot of
attention to that when we hire as part
of the googly element
Himanshu aggarwal this is people who
actually were able to get through the
rows columns or the diagonal aspect so
if you can come up with and koona if you
can come up for the sake of time
congratulations thank you thank you for
being an active participant yeah thank
you yeah and then Raghu not
congratulations
and then Ramana
oh yeah alright so morally sure I think
Peru thank you I just want to say thanks
to the early Googlers who indirectly
helped me to 1 this event I spent to
Bethel I think you know when I pushed
here you know before they'd be asking ok
where the other nine technical person
who actually said no don't ask me a
question then he signed in couple of
metrics that I think Thanks
thanks for coming through on that and
you were one of the persons and there
were some other people who'd approach
another person on the engineering Google
staff that but hopefully you found it
interactive and meaningful so I just
want to talk about what you can expect I
think we have been trying to push as
much data as we can as fast as we can so
that you have access to it this includes
the photographs we have upload the GTX
ID with yesterday's pictures as soon as
we get today's photographs we will
upload that on the g'tok base side we
will keep it fresh as much as we can
with any new information about when the
videos are being published is there any
activity that could be related to GTECH
announcements about the new and upcoming
G tag sessions that we will set up we've
actually also enabled a LinkedIn and a
Facebook group so you can join in and
then we will actively encourage you to
participate in it and also we will keep
the g'tok 2010 email group alive so
please post your thoughts and questions
and we encourage each of you to sort of
stay active in that and network and and
address some of the questions you have
and answer that the Google testing blog
will be another location where we
actively write to and what we want like
to say is again please keep the feedback
if you have not filled it out for today
make sure you you take some time at the
end of this to do so we will also be
sending you out a an online form to fill
out the overall feedback form this might
have some other dimensions like you know
the logistical stuff and overall theme
and the timing and the agenda and so on
so please take the time to fill it out
it helps us make G tach better and cater
to your needs and
successive ones would be more fun I just
wanted to take a few minutes to thank
everyone this includes everybody in this
room especially our keynote speakers you
know Bob binders is right here he came
all the way and we appreciate you flying
down to India dr. Jeff if Jeff I think
he's oh there yes right there thank you
for flying all the way to India again it
was a great session and of course the
animated mr. James Whittaker and keeping
us all really really fun I think there's
an honorary keynote here and that goes
to Alberto and and and I think if if we
could change the theme of this it would
be probably about how not to write books
or papers it would be maybe a topic for
the future G tags I wanted to thank each
one of our speakers for taking the time
to put themselves out to public voting
and agreeing to do so you had you work
to lots of iterations of abstracts and
the voting act and really being helpful
for the committee to provide us that
feedback so vivex ayman Greg Esteban
Christian Russ and Tracy or Tracy Russ
Shin and Robert Shri Shankar and of
course Matt Evans so thank you so much
for taking this on let's give him a
round of applause and of course the
committee they have been working really
really hard to make this event possible
I personally feel they've done a
fabulous job of staying involved
communicating with each one of you and
making that making sure that you felt
comfortable through this entire process
so my thanks to uncle who was actually a
great emcee and by popular demand McKay
stayed the emcee for two days till I
decided to give him some relief at the
end of this so thank you uncle for
I heard lots of shouts about how they
love on Kate and perhaps there's a
future for you in a different role in or
outside of Google that we could pick and
entrepeneurs she's been also an active
part of the group she's been helping
world Nelson
she's been really really involved in
working closely with the keynote
speakers lightning talks and and
receiving some bizarre questions on the
floor so thank you for answering them
thank you well John Thomas who couldn't
be here for some personal reasons but
actually stayed very active from
Mountain View and Uncle Dan and John and
Michael were all in Mountain View so we
had a committee that was split up across
time zones and I I think we did have
were able to get through all these
challenges and still be able to deliver
so my thanks to everybody was staying
late enough early to be able to enable
that Michael Bachman who again couldn't
be here he's the person on the far right
after of the picture and rachet who's
been walking around tirelessly finding
out the mics and thank you so much and
of course being part of the call for
proposals and every other aspect of GTA
so thank you actually
Pankaj are you and he's been an integral
part of the planning committee
logistical about this this particular
venue however every aspect of the audio
and video along with thiru and and
Rajini have done a fabulous job of
making sure that these go seamlessly and
we've always expected kinks and they
were few and minimized so my thanks to
Pankaj Rodney and Thoreau for doing a
great job of all the logistics from
I especially wanted to thank Rajneesh
she has been tirelessly working apart
from him a full-time job of helping the
team through all the all the day-to-day
needs and and really negotiated hard on
the right venues transportation the
hotels and and going out and making sure
that this was a smoothie run conference
from that side so thank you Reggie
you've been an integral part of this
stuff I do so I just wanted us again
just to recognize Theo he's been also an
active part of the committee so and the
best part of this committee was they
change roles you know even they have
specified roles to play they were able
to step in to each other and make
through this entire entire process and
so my thanks to everyone of them and I
didn't want to forget the pre G TAC
speakers that that basically came in and
we and helped us have this session at
Google where we had about a 350 person
turn out both in Hyderabad on VC in
Bangalore and this was because we had to
turn it off at some point we we didn't
really plan for that bigger logistics so
Brad Ian James again Nathan and Ted
thank you so much for being a part of G
Tech and the pre G tak aspect as well we
received some great feedback on that
event so and of course you all thank you
for taking the time to attend G tak in
India which I know for many of you was
very very far away and for all the
people in India who came in on the week
before Diwali and all the holidays that
are lining up to be in Hyderabad so
thank you and thank you so much for
taking the time to provide the feedback
staying engaged being interactive and
making this a very very tight and
meaningful conference so thank you
around from us for every one of you
so yeah go back a few slides yeah that's
that's good so yeah so I forgot one name
from here right and that's himself and
that would be kind of weird thanking
yourself so I and I'm going to try and
summarize this for the rest of us so
it's been interesting I think while this
disappears like a lot of work and and
you know feels like it's a lot of work
logistically
I think it actually was fun for the last
few months doing this we we actually
then feel we were working and and I
think and some people are working the
case because they didn't feel like it
was working but so but I think it was
really because I think whenever you know
whenever you have a set of people
working especially across time zones it
gets tough I mean you know you everyone
has conflicting personalities opinions
and I think that's why it was really
amazed me I feel to have surgery because
soo-ji
I think at times politely pointed us in
the right direction
he was never rude but at times strongly
pointed us in the right direction that
this needs to get done so let's go on so
no this was a sheer fun I I think GT
gets better every year I think this
one's high bar for whoever else is
organizing next year
good luck but thank you very much so
yeah
thank you for everything is that great
committee and thank you thanks
it really was a pleasure to work with
each one of you and be on this committee
it's it's been an honor and I appreciate
you helping out for this and by the way
this was on their 20 percent time or
free time they actually contributed to
this conference as part of their besides
their active day work so I'd really
really appreciate it it's great to have
the conference in India and a pie for
the first time and I'm really happy to
see this great crowd showing
and being active of it both googlers and
non-googlers and especially the inch
broad staff that have taken the time to
be in India at this point so thank you
so I left the slide empty because I
didn't even want the committee to know
what where it would be any guesses I
think James tried to blog about it but
any guesses Sydney is one answer
Mountain News next answer New York is a
third answer Waterloo is the other
answer huh Tokyo we have told you I
think I heard I heard Hawaii earlier I
think there was some discussion about
that but I think if you look at it we've
pretty much gone around the globe and
we've never had a G tach in Mountain
View so we're gonna have one next year
in Mountain View and so we will it's a
spiral so we will evolve around it so
next year we look forward to a G tag
first time in Mountain View and the
dates and and committee and the agendas
and the themes will evolve in the coming
months so please keep a lookout and our
testing blog as well as G tag dot base
because we will start posting that on
that so we pass it on to Mountain View
and I think that closes represent if we
have here is Brad I think that would be
that would be it so carry it on from Oh
uncle and uncle of course Alberto is is
waiting there with anxiety and and
hopefully he get through the anger
management courses by then and I think
we absolutely have to invite him for
that G tag to speak
James would be a flight away to our
flight from Seattle so hopefully you'll
stay a be a part of this and and we
looked forward to seeing some of you
here one thing I didn't get to do a
chance was to look through and say how
many people of you have been at previous
gtex g'tok alums are a very special part
of this gathering so if you are a G
tackle um please can you stand up and
let's have a look and great I am
standing because that'd be great so this
is the healthy crowd this is good we
want to pass and continue this tradition
in the coming G tax so you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
