you I think it was a for me personally
it was a great two days you were very
helpful in being both on time in the
beginning and the end I'm still
completely amazed from last night's
lightning talk session which was so on
time I think you're all be issued
honorary Swiss passports or something so
thanks for all that what we have planned
right now is something I personally
haven't done before mark will explain
exactly how this works basically will be
a question discussion session that about
the conference but maybe about other
topics you find interesting and then
after that when this fades out but not
later than six we'll wrap it up and call
it a day okay okay thanks um so yeah we
want to have something like a panel a
discussion about the conference but it
can't just be a simple panel i'm from
germany so we need some rules this this
can't just be like that so the subject
is really as you said interesting stuff
about the conference things that you
learned questions that you still have
the conference itself i know that a
couple of people are here for the second
or third time like things what you think
the conference does what it should do in
the future and the idea is that we have
people sitting in the front discussing
whatever topic comes up but you will
guide it that's why we gave out the the
the pens and the index cards write down
questions things that you want to ask
things that you want them to discuss
write them down and when you have
something raise your hand and then it
will collect them and sort of guide the
discussion that we have you in the front
but the other thing also is as you see
there is one empty chair so if something
gets discussed where you think like hey
I really have something to contribute I
know something about it I have an
opinion I tried this out I think what
this guy's saying is totally wrong come
to the front take that take the chair
and then the rule is somebody else has
to get off his chair sit down so that
there's always one empty chair so that
it rotates a little bit around at some
we might have nobody from the panel left
here that might mmm it's no music it's
just the questions and so while you guys
can write on your questions and things
that you want to have discuss I just
want to give it to the four people that
we have here introduce yourself very
quickly and just tell us what you think
about the conference the number one
thing that you thought was interesting
challenging a big puzzler that you still
have once is that I'm starting okay
that's true big mistake so 11 piece that
I could I would like some feedback is
the following point we had some
discussion about the mix off of people
are topics for the talks especially the
point whether we would want and how much
we would want commercial contributions
or contributions from company versus
academia right so I in the end we
decided about a mix of two or three only
that were you know from other companies
talking about their things I think you
test was the most prominent one where it
was clear that it was maybe the furthest
away from a deep technical discussion
and more general framework or or offer
of thoughts and concepts and I
personally took away that went pretty
good but I would be interested what
others think should we continue this
should be up it should we have more of
that what are your thoughts so I guess I
start with you guys what you think was
it a good mix
yeah i think it's it's a good mix when
we have different topics testing is
large there's many different aspect of
it different applications the topics
here were quite interesting from the
early days like in the 1960s to what son
is doing with something that's really
nationwide worldwide so this is I think
we I guess this is one of the reason
maybe we're in testing is because we
like to have an overview of multiple
things maybe not going deep down in one
area but we like to see the full product
and we want to be the first one who can
see all the pieces together and test
them that's personally what excites me
in in testing I feel like I'm the test
pilot for something that nobody had
experimented before and if we don't if
we have only one topic then we might
restrict our self to only one aspect so
another thing also that I like maybe
your feedback on is what do we do from
here so we do this this is a public
conference everything here is going to
be posted on YouTube what do we do to
expand more collaboration in the future
not only here once a year but I'm in the
whole community how do we keep in touch
how do we make more contributions and we
keep the dialogue open all the time so
we have the wave we have many tools like
this I like to hear what you think how
we can contribute and also how you can
contribute as well so there are a couple
things that I generally like in
conferences then that we've done here
and that it's it's a focused community
in fact we've kept the dirt officially
small limited to 100 people which also
meant that we imposed a bit more on the
attendees he wasn't a simple
registration process and/or we had to be
say unfriendly to a lot of people and
not not have them here but I had the
impression that we really had had a
great conference and good discussions
going so I think I think at least it was
it was worth it another thing that I
liked about it is that a single track
conference that we don't have several
things in parallel because it tends to
divide the community and
that's also if it becomes too big people
mix and interchange and it feels like a
community and it feels like we have a 1
discussion running that really evolves
yeah so I think I think we didn't do it
to wrong respect ok so why they pass the
mic back if you have questions let me
know and I collect them and if you want
to discuss this with these guys what
they brought up just come up and sit on
the chair you have to sit on the chair
ok so what I liked about the press
conference yes so I was participating
both in a selection of entities as well
as presentations and on the board of
people who selected presentations we had
like different inputs like I'm morph on
a particular side while unveils for
instance is more from the academic side
understands two formulas it at least
you're just doing stuff you don't
understand it yeah exactly exactly yes
and I'm just nothing what do I so it was
very interesting for me to see too soon
see that it gives a hold of overall
picture and the thing that I like most
about the particular presentations was
is that there was actually something to
take away so the UI layout bucks talk
for instance where really had something
to work with as well as the performance
testing talk for instance and the gaming
talk and others which don't come to my
mind now but I learned some new stuff
and I wouldn't have expected that to be
honest was really good ok so the first
question was I mean here at the
conference we had already many many
testing tools frameworks technologies
and there are many more out there how do
we know where they are how do we find
them how do we know which ones to use
and I mean for you guys I mean your main
job is testing like like how do you how
how do you do this
right answer search engines might be an
option is i think my really honest
answer is if it's hard to find then it
doesn't have enough users and it won't
be developed anyway but incredible it's
just rumors one less you just talk to
colleagues we were educated yes feed
talk to colleagues here that's a queasy
yeah basically it's like like internet
our company tools gets wet around by
talking by getting the word from other
people there's usually like a few people
in companies or in communities who
researches kind of things who know these
kind of things and just find one of them
make them your friends and you're good
to go maybe on top of that we did have
just recently a pretty good effort to
organize our tools right so a couple of
folks got together and tried to put in
put enough information together about
tools first of all what these tools are
what they did but also information about
where they were used what success cases
where who contacts are etc to give you a
bit more or us in its as internal
obviously to give us a bit more than
just the name of a tool and word of
mouth so if you're actively going to
look for help in a certain area you
would at least know where to start and
who to talk to question could be is that
something in general that is necessary
is it worthwhile to do something similar
for publicly or is that an area that is
that is well enough that you can read
enough about to to be satisfied right
already don't know we had that problem
so you're internally we have different
repository of information we have wiki
we have sites and there's lots of
information going right and left one
thing that was helpful ways to organize
something that we call the toolbox the
toolbox is
successful it's quite to be no your
instance here and it's it has a lot of
tools and what yogen was saying is
anyone can put feedback there and so do
we need a toolbox for the entire
community make it public I don't know
that's good question i think one very
pragmatic pragmatic thing you can do
that i often do is look at the forum the
user forums of the tool and and that
that usually gives you so impression of
how how good the tool so the way that i
found mouse the tools that I've used
most recently has been by going to use a
group evenings so I've been part of the
agile community in London and those guys
introduce me to a bunch of stuff go to
you know various coach jams in you know
whatever it is but the user group
evenings are really great way of being
introduced to what people are currently
enthused about what they're engaged with
and to get an idea for like what the
community is is actually using and
involved with um similar to like all the
tools and everything so we heard a lot
about like tools that are methods that
check correctness that check usability
the check latency compatibility ap is
how do we know what we should test for
Wow all right well from a pragmatic
point of view does it work and what is
it that I use is care about for example
with the search engine if you can't
input a term and get results back in a
reasonable amount of time it's not worth
going to that site whereas if you're
writing a system for an internal group
like you know sales or marketing you
know maybe they're happy with longer
latency or longer request times but they
need a different set of features so I
think one of the things that you should
do when you're thinking about what to
test is talk to the people who care
about what it is like you know that the
sort of user driven
approach of figuring out what you need
to do
just as a point to this if you measure
also usage then you can see by testing
one area if that increases the user
Jonah so for us when we start a new
product we are really careful about the
traffic we don't we don't do too much
until we can money to the traffic once
we we have data we add features and we'd
see if the new feature is adding or
decreasing traffic so if you're
wondering what you should test you can
do maybe the same thing you can test one
categories if it improves the usage that
Simon was saying all the traffic and if
it doesn't well unit testing the right
thing so to add something over time we
was saying when I was asked to test a
product I got trapped into the mindset
that I just you know I have the function
test hotel security test and so on at my
hands and what do I have to use while
practically what helped me most is just
to take a look at it from an end-user
perspective see what I would care about
and then afterward try to map this to
the skills I have at most but just take
a look at it from an end-user
perspective and you will naturally find
out what you need to take a look at even
in my even if it might be hard so in
particular one thing I'd like to mention
is that I have the feeling that you
don't influence the quality with unit
testing so much as what you influence
with unit testing is more than speed of
development this whole developer testing
is really is really an aid to
development and not assessment of the
quality if you want to sense the quality
what would as everybody else basically
is already said you need the users right
and you can do alpha testing and you can
do better testing and these are still
very effective and cheap forms if you do
it right so we called alpha testing we
call it dogfooding right we do a lot and
I think the most exciting applications
we write the ones that geeks like
because we're geeks and dogfooding works
extremely well with that tonight though
okay so so then we have a couple of
questions about the conference itself
the first one from Jason have a hard
time to pass I try say it
okay i'm gonna david morgan and robert
nielsen thanks a lot for typing yet they
were previously typing all day long so
yeah the comment was it's difficult to
understand why wave is interesting and
what is the use case for wave and this
setting was a way to see how a wave can
be efficient by collaborating I'd like
to hear maybe other people did other
people had the same feeling how did it
work for you I was surprised that it was
useful to be honest so like in terms of
this live blogging stuff I'm not used to
this modern stuff but that action was
really helpful i'm i'm looking forward
to whether it will be used by the people
on the date on tomorrow or afterward as
well for cultivation or not i'm curious
let's see a dating service and so i'm a
huge fan of wave i've been using it
particularly for collaboration on open
source projects like it's really hard to
get everyone in the same place at the
same time but sort of you know that just
being able to have a wave in it and the
sort of ongoing discussion like we were
working on the Ruby bindings for
webdriver bug bug bug driver selenium
too it's going to be awesome
oh yeah thank you I don't think any one
nated Sam ucweb Grover he will kick you
yeah I fair enough so but we were
working on the on the Ruby bindings and
what happened is we threw together a
to-do list and sort of commented on the
bits and pieces and then people were
farming that and it was sort of a live
progress and document of what was going
on and whenever anyone got stuck they
were sort of able to us for help but
because everything was in the same place
it was you know it works out really well
so I think sort of wave is just this
brilliant collaboration tool and I know
I sound like a fanboy but I am
sit down hi i guess i'm alexi from the
Google office in Sydney and what we find
the amazing one with google wave is that
as a project as a product keeps on being
used by the whole community are there
people start to find on their own all
sort of the user case so we've been
doing this conference we had the
opportunity to see ok what it's like to
Karen to follow the transcript of a talk
but there are so many other user cases
which keeps on showing up every day and
I will not be surprised that in one year
two years from now we will be very used
to new form of user case that people are
doing too don't even think about it now
just to give an example when we started
just by introducing a gadget or by the
using of the robot into conversation you
rig quickly go into a new dimension of
application and just have it just have
as an example another one in mind which
is the we use in our team the gadget
that we could the status gadget which is
very convenient way to to use a wave any
time you want to keep track of the state
of the status of any situation in this
case this is when your group of person
and you just want to know okay um have
brief quickly review of who's doing what
this week it's a okay we had to explain
without showing this gadget but it's a
fabulous shoe thing to see more and more
gadgets showing up which make just
amazingly new new you use cases for for
way so keep an eye on that also think
swollen wave at about boomer of hundred
engineers is basically a cheap when
Morris yeah the important thing with
wife is it's a miserable experience on
your rank and maybe that's why Jason
didn't like it but also like it's a
terrible email client and
terrible check line but it's a great
collaboration tool and I would also like
to thank all of you I think this is the
most testing google wave has ever gotten
I mean hey a room full of testers we
couldn't wish for anything better and
we're also quite happy that the first
time this is the first time wave was
used in this way and it was at a testing
conference isn't that great one thing I
don't think he was planned that way
actually it was kind of improvisers in
it I mean thanks to you did you when did
you have the idea okay so yeah I guess
maybe wave was not really release when
we studied the conference we could never
have it before okay so somewhat related
to that I don't know if wave help with
that or maybe it actually hinted did do
you think that people got the chance to
actually me talk and interact with each
other or was a too much program not
enough time to meet not enough time to
just shared and again did wife maybe
help with that or was just a totally
separate thing I just thought so i think
we had plenty of breaks we had some
talks that were actually showed it in
scheduled so we have even more free time
we had only one evening but well yeah
maybe they would have been more
conversations on a second evening with
more beer menu so I yeah we did we need
to be hear from you but I think the size
also was quite small and was a benefit
for interaction do you feel that you
could talk to everyone you wanted to
talk to ya yeah I think so doing a lot
of talking um I had a great time just
chatting to like all the people that
I've not met before and the people who
are questions like chatting with the
Microsoft guys I've not had an
opportunity to do that before at a
conference and you know and it turns out
you're as as normal as the Google guys
are
but but not just those like that you
know um I was talking about the data
database feeder that we heard about the
other day and that was interesting and
like all these sort of little pieces
that sort of come together and those
hallway conversations I think of the
things that sort of provide a lot of the
value of conferences like this to me and
and I have plenty of those and enjoyed a
lot so I think gee tac is probably the
reason I work here today I visited gee
tac in London that was three years four
years ago three years ago and I before
that I basically I did pretty much the
same thing but as in a consulting
company in Zurich and I was out there
and always felt very lonely being the
guy who tells everybody well I don't do
anymore I'm basically thanks to this
conference because i've met i found out
that as many other people with the same
same problems that i have out there and
we can all talk to each other and figure
those things out yes hello my name is
Nicholas I've been a tester for you no
more you feel as normal as everybody
else now Phil yeah and you okay well I
got the mic i think i'll continue
talking about um just the the talking
I've done here and i went to gtech in
New York two years ago and initially I
was a little concerned because this is a
bit of a smaller conference but honestly
I think that's really worked out for me
I've talked to just about as many people
as my brain can handle in you know
shallow things cultural things in-depth
technical things it's been pretty
fantastic i have to say i haven't met
all of you yet but I'm working on it and
I can probably read your your blips on
the wave lips is that it wavelets
something like that I don't know all the
terminology yet yes so yeah I think it's
really worked out think it's a great
size and there's been a good amount of
good amount and a good number of venues
for conversation thank you um well I'm a
huge fan of small events so this is a
good size of two requests what I don't
know who to look at 1d not you one which
is some way of finding out who's in the
room because that you know you know the
thing you get to like the end the middle
of the second afternoon and there are
actually talk to that person so maybe we
could find some way of bringing that
forward and then maybe an event the
night before because most of us in town
anyway because you know to get here for
the following morning so perhaps we
could do something there oh no you have
to stay here till someone replies you
city until someone else comes so perhaps
we could use they were in written
response to his first request i'm
wondering if latitude would be
appropriate for that i haven't actually
used it but it seems like that's more or
less the purpose i don't know if it goes
down to who's in this conference room or
not but I get the impression it does and
given what we do I figure most of us
have some kind of gps pretty close
thank you I just wanted to mention that
a Nikola organizer created a wave where
you are invited to put your details and
that's nice well so to keep in touch and
have the contacts all right ok let's go
through the exploits yes I'm very sorry
so as you just heard this entire thing
the fact that we're using wave here is
is completely random basically when we
start the company sorry there I need a
drink yes that was the master plan all
the time when we started a conference
damn I was found out when we started
this conference yesterday morning I
actually didn't know so i found out that
people had gone there wave accounts
yesterday evening during a dinner where
is the first time i met i met some
people from the conference because I've
obviously wasn't invited I was on it so
I didn't know I had no I know how people
would have it and we found out just then
sorry no it's fine I'm good I'm good I'm
getting therapy don't worry alright but
basically what i want to say is we
really didn't know this was if this was
actually going to work or not and if
people would get their accounts or not
while we were having the keynote i was
trying to find out how groups work ok so
that's about as organized as whole thing
was so and I'm really terribly sorry so
one thing we learned for the next time
we do this is that we need some spare
invites for the people who
reason or other didn't get one and you
guys roll in the list and you're all
going to get your invites and if you
don't you can hassle me personally I
will make sure of that sorry exactly
Larry at google com actually please
don't do that I'll be even worse but and
and unfortunately the way the invites
pipeline works I can't just give you an
account right here and now so sorry for
that I'm really very sorry for that okay
so one more like somebody said first of
all thank you for the perfect
organization that goes to young and
where's Marie re there she is whoo and
so actually back to testing so the
question is about so if we do all our
testing how do we know about the impact
of the testing that we do how do we know
that we don't like spend more money from
the company than we actually safe with
our testing how do you know that in your
activities that you focus on the right
things and that you actually generate
value with testing I'm going to speak
not from experience necessarily but one
thing that stuck with me from gtech New
York was i think patrick said measure
everything and that that's been
something i've tried to implement in
every project i've done that first we
figure out just how wrong everything is
and then we write write the tests to
prove it and then when it's fixed our
tests show that it's not so wrong
anymore and we can say you know we're
we're saving this many hours of
execution where's have this many more
free machines whatever or whatever it is
that matters to you but i think it has
to do with understanding what your
problem is first
now we're going to force you to come up
here so a test from development behavior
BDD driven development I think the
important thing with those isn't so much
that you're doing the testing it's that
you're making the maintenance of the
project easier so over the lifetime of a
project my experience has been the teams
that are doing strong TDD strong testing
are the ones who have the most flexible
code bases and you can make progress
faster over the lifetime of a project
sure you know the initial stages take
longer but you know a project doesn't
last two weeks it tends the last two
years because you know once it's
complete you don't delete that code you
keep it around you maintain it until
it's no longer fulfilling a function so
in that case sort of testing as a
mechanism for lowering the cost of
maintenance is a as a useful tool yeah
pretty much the same opinion what I
would like to add for me one metric has
always been the confidence that
developers have in changing their code
so so many Googlers up here people come
on please no I want to leave I want to
leave them yes so that comfort the
confidence of the developers in changing
code right i mean wait sometimes you you
you see this piece of code or you deal
with somebody and you say hey why don't
we change this code to do this and that
and they're looking about oh yeah the
guy who wrote that has actually left the
company and it works so don't touch it
right and this for me is you can't put
easily put a dollar value on it but
maybe you can I mean the extra hours
that the developer spends making this
change in the codebase just maybe just
because it's not confident enough that
the change will be working is actually
really big and I think that's one of the
biggest values that testing can bring
thank you I just have in mind this this
comment that
one of my team leaders and when they are
about testing which is that when you
think about it a very very good tester
would be someone who in fact manages to
make his job almost useless what I'm
trying to say is that if you are ideally
if you can try to keep on changing the
direction because things change very
quickly you you have to use a lot of
common sense and it was amazing to see
in this conference to see that there's
no one Berber that fitzy told you have
to keep on looking at what's the new
main problem going on where what its own
security on that NC and and but the
connection in all of that is that the
final goal is always to try to be by
achieving the maximum efficiency as
possible making you eventually almost
ideal useless I mean if you're there
it's because there's their beds but if
you if you keep in mind that what you
want to eat to put together a framework
which is as automatic as possible where
you don't need to go policing after the
people where bugs are prevented as LG a
possible in fact ideally we were like
that they don't even happen in the first
place that's really the final goal so we
when you really treat think about it you
realize that when this a very ironic
situation where what we truly aiming for
is making a job useless eventually which
which is beautiful golden if I remember
quick with correctly the question was
how do we measure right and how do we
measure the the benefit the dollar
benefit to the company okay sir for me
this is one this is probably the major
challenge especially where I'm at I'm in
Tel Aviv I'm the only s software
engineering test down there and my brief
is to try and convince extremely smart
extremely capable and very impatient
people 22 I mean impatient because they
want to get the features out because we
really go to getting features out
to convince them to try something that's
going to cost them time and I think this
is we need to realize that when we when
you start talking about this where we've
gone beyond the boundaries of computer
science and we're entering into
psychology okay and and I think that's
something that conferences like these
and especially networking and just
continually talking to people trying to
collect as much anecdotal evidence as
possible and extracting from that some
sort of metric oh yeah I got a second I
think I think that's some almost
impossible but we have to keep trying to
do it it's like you know we're looking
for life on Mars or whatever and it's
pretty nigh impossible that it exists
but we keep doing it because we think
that the search itself is worthwhile and
has benefits and that's what we're
talking about here so if anyone has you
know some sort of recipe of coming up
with metrics that can prove that TDD had
this particular measurable benefit and
we have a sample of 30 or 40 projects
where we can show that there has been
tangible benefit please let me know as
far as I know that as such studies don't
yet exist yes the numbers are something
like reduction in bugs in production of
it ranges between I think 50 and ninety
percent at a cost of about at a
intuitive cost of about ten to fifteen
percent extra development time yeah they
did well well the the the bug reduction
is not anecdotal and he's a big project
and the what I remember the research was
done post-hoc so there's no you know was
that was done after the budgets were
closed so there was no influence on the
only on the development style and and I
think that's missing from this is
suddenly I mean our experiences with
Simon of doing TDD it's not so much
about
you know we test it to make sure it
works but the other part of it is we
test we you know this whole thing about
pulling the test forward so that you
know what you're supposed to be doing
and when you're done and I think that
that part of is actually much more
powerful than the regression part and
there's almost with a lot of this it's
almost worth just doing you know even if
you never automated it which you should
do but even if you never did the process
of thinking thinking at this stage what
what I need to do to get done is really
powerful the subject of cost and how to
convince people to test test first
automated tests because we can split
them in order of importance I think
although i think debate of automating a
test is more important than testing
first is huge so it made me come from
the back here here in front I've got
very decent experience because I was in
a project where we big project a lot of
components in in the system and we had a
portal and we actually had about six
months of work doing selenium tests
which during development where we were
cranking our feature features were
really flaky way we kept putting in
effort to keep them green it was a huge
amount of effort and a huge cost and at
one point actually in several points it
was actually debated do we drop them all
together and I was like we have to use
them we can use them use them use them
and then we put the rid the project in
maintenance mode and the team went from
10 to two and we changed the data grid
six months two people fixing the test I
don't know how much the cost is in
thousands of euros that one change in
that data grid it was all worth it all
worth it overnight the test just went
from green to red all of them but they
were built up in such a way where we
could look at the report and go like oh
that and that needs fixing that in that
needs fixing next build half of the test
green
another two errors fixing and in one day
we had did we did a massive refactoring
whole project and it was just worth it
worth the hassle the hassle to convince
them that it was this and it's
experiences like that that you can share
in an event like this which is people
who come through such experiences and
you get anecdotal data and also each
project we go through that I just gather
arrows in my my pocket so the next time
I go to a client I go right here I did
that in that in that it costs that much
but at the end it saved our asses
actually the thing is I think remember
something that you remark no escape I my
eye since remember from the Europe when
you were VMware about how you manage to
get your release cycle down from you
know from code done to out the door from
from months down two weeks when you
started introducing it's got your name
on it somewhere someone on the web when
when you started doing TDD all started
doing some some kind of you were lying
at the time which witch project was that
I don't remember I've got this citation
somewhere the other thing I'm from again
from my mom yeah it's a bit vague on but
I think remember there are papers the
report again reduction of the massive
reductions of or raising equality is
associated the number of tests and the
only way to get people to actually write
tests is to do at first I mean that the
reports are the first part and then my
experience is the second in terms of
getting people to adopt EDD I think
there is something of a Eureka moment
that's needed and I happen to have that
thanks to one of Steve's work as a was
just reading the mock roles not objects
paper and I was my first time really
doing it from the start writing out my
tests
the test covered everything that the
component was supposed to do and like
Steve said I knew when I was done and
that felt good that was something that
you know you don't really feel in
software development well until you
until you know the project is cancelled
and then because otherwise these things
don't tend to end but when you have have
something you can actually rely on that
you can work towards a goal and you can
accomplish it's a tremendously inspiring
feeling and we have a you know a set of
behaviors that will make that happen so
I think if we can put people in
situations where they experienced that
personally whatever it takes I think
that will really help in adoption of TDD
and a lot of the other things that we're
trying to push on people like to make
myself unpopular and say something
critical thank you yeah let's hear it
for it um so not all amounts of testing
is always good you can also overdo it i
mean a test case comes at a cost and if
it doesn't fit the team and if it's not
done well you know if you just have all
false positives the the maintenance
costs if the project can actually go up
and can slow a team down and I'd like to
bring back the the first opening talk
from for built in everybody's attention
I think we just as well need to focus on
on good tools on clean abstractions and
clean concepts I think they're equally
important to make a team productive and
bring quality to a product and we go run
and run again and because test first
helps you develop clean abstractions I
mean making it code testable fixes your
architecture essentially yeah so yeah
but I do agree that there is a tipping
point you have you have a point where
you should stop some think some testing
away so you can't exhaustively test
everything so you need to sit back and
decide exactly how much you need to
invest in the test I think I mean a
different level of other track not not
on the coatis unnecessarily but also on
the tools we use we keep developing
these new cool cool tools that help us
do this new things which which is great
right but the debug ability and the
testability of these new new tools we
always start from scratch again write
our language is get more and more
complicated the concepts don't don't get
easier so that that's on a different
level this right I'm just going to make
the comment as far as like the cost of
testing I think the observation is
notice in the room who's not here who's
not present and the one thing I've
observed now being in start-up land for
last year is there aren't a lot of
people from startups here mostly we're
all can representative of companies well
could probably afford to send us here
that's one filter to that startups are
kind of cheap but that goes back to the
cost of testing it's really expensive to
do testing let's be honest especially if
you're diversen startup and trying to
sell testing two companies we noticed
startups don't care about testing until
they've gone in production until it's
important until they've been embarrassed
by a production bug but there's I think
Kent Beck made a really good blog post a
couple of months ago again he was
talking about his experiences in testing
and startups and you realized when
you're there's a certain point where the
project is not ready for a full regimen
of testing the first couple months it's
especially in start-up land where you
have to crank out those features so
that's the important thing of like if
you have to convince do those stories to
people to like we need to do more
testing we do more testing that the
thing is they might not be ready and it
might actually be the correct decision
that you know just doing the hallway
testing or the dog food testing that's
enough because the project is not
important yet hasn't made revenue yet so
always be looking for that filter of
like maybe we shouldn't be pushing it
wait until it's important then do it and
sometimes we don't see that like and
that's been my filter lately is seeing
who are the people not in the present in
the room it's also important to build
the right product not just to build the
product right time in terms of kind of
the absolute cost of testing and it does
seem to be very expensive and I think
that has a lot to do with the specific
skill set that's involved I would
imagine more or less everyone here has
spent a lot of time and invested a lot
of their own own effort and passion into
becoming knowledgeable testers and I
think part of that has to do with
something that James Whittaker has been
talking about on the Google testing blog
I don't know which of these seven
plagues it was but I'm going to go with
lore or they're being a lack of lore
where we all test in our own way and we
all tend to make our own mistakes and
learn from them and come better testers
that way which i think is great for us
individually and provides a lot of job
security but people trying to get into
the field don't really have too many
options other than to spend a lot of
time making their own mistakes and a
seems like there are efforts going on to
approve that we were talking about the
testing education topic at the table
yesterday and it was mentioned there
were some certifications that were
available and some training courses and
that seems like a good start but even
just you know what's the hello world for
software testing is it as easy to find
as you know the hello world for Java
hasn't been in my experience and I think
it's kind of that obscurity that makes
it very difficult for for startups to
consider
testing because it's going to be very
expensive for them to bring the right
people in to get the right system set up
okay I should I keep talking I'm Adrian
my job is to convince the management of
the importance of testing and our
messages always and it's about risk
right so if you talk about cost and
value as exempt for a static varies the
risk of you know that the quality is bad
having to rescue the risk is not that
high in first place right so you might
test less so you need more like two
years old projects risk is higher so you
have to test more and that something
with management understands and people
understand even a developer understands
that and then if you think this is risky
function we have to test it more if it's
less risky to be test less I think
that's did this easiest way to approach
it think about how important is it does
it more test it less it's a very easy
advice specific point is that at the
very beginning the project the risk of
just not ever getting anything live in a
production is greater than not having
tested it especially in an automated
fashion so especially on a very new
initiative that first three months
you're going to get a lot of pushback
from unless we're test infected like we
all are otherwise that people say no no
no that the number one risk of the
project is we have to go live on a
somewhat tangential note odo interview
I'll be quick i read a blog post
yesterday just related to testing in the
open source world about someone who has
decided to ensure that they have a
hundred percent coverage for anything
they release open source simply on the
basis that that way if they receive any
patches that don't meet that mark they
have a easy way to reject them without
saying well your code is crap yeah i
mean on the cost of testing like i said
before there's a tipping point as um
it's an uphill battle to get to the test
to a point where you test
enough yo you product your application
whatever oh where you have automated
enough test automation is even more of
an uphill battle actually in the
beginning when you set up that and I one
of my favorite one of my favorite
subjects something a task close to my
heart is actually to be able to reduce
the angle of the uphill Tech essentially
to be able to set up a to set up the
testing infrastructure a project needs
faster at the moment it cost us quite a
bit because we have many disparate tools
they don't really talk with each other
and there's a lot of glue I mean things
like graphing test results getting
useful information out of a timeline of
tests on the same codebase figuring out
what what it did two months ago and
which parts of your code are really
flaky ones that tend to break by every
check in moval with the other check in
things like that they kind of project
specific everybody does it's only so
yeah I don't know that there's a lot of
work in that area we gotta get together
on it I think we have an unsolved
contradiction or a contradiction the
textbook and I think TD by now is the X
textbook in that the way to develop
software is to start with high quality
and to continue having a high quality
and adding features on the way right we
all know that this is the way to get
good and maintainable software but as
other people have rightfully argued in
particular in start-up situations and in
some other situations that's not the way
to go you want to go to market first for
for other reasons right and I haven't
seen a textbook and we haven't addressed
the problem of how do you switch over
from the one phase to the other I I
don't know yeah I think one thing that's
I don't think there's like a linear the
graph of value the amount of money you
spend and the
you get from your tests I don't think
it's linear but i think is another thing
for like startup companies that when we
started we had a suite of tests that we
probably invested quite a lot in but we
had a lot of problems with them and we
weren't really getting a whole lot of
value from them we had there was one
point when i moved them to run a
different infrastructure i ran them or
buy one past when i looked at what was
wrong the server hadn't started up and
all by one of them i passed and we had
quite a lot of investment in them but we
actually had no value from them at all
we spent quite a lot of time making the
test fast reliable and i think yeah we
found that the value to get the value to
go up it was kind of like a hug but once
you get over the top of that hump you
start to get real value and that the
amount you have to do is sort of gone
down yeah and we found in terms of how
you measure it we did a lot we tried to
use a lot of metrics things like time it
takes to run the stability of them
things like that but I think we have
more value from the sort of anecdotal
type things we notice so the our big
goal was getting to run in a submit Q so
we run large selenium tests every time
people submit and yeah we have some like
metrics about it but the other day I did
a code review and I saw in the submit
you these tests had failed and a
developer had got a E&amp;amp;M completely wrong
that wouldn't have been caught until the
release had been cut and someone had
noticed that but we caught that before
and the the value of that I think was
kind of a lot more indicative than any
sort of metrics so with that I want to
come to the last question and it's
actually interesting like so one thing
that we discussed the most was actually
the value of testing and there was no
session at gtech about the value of
testing and the question actually is
should we have more open space type
sessions at gtech to allow actually
sessions like this that are not on the
program where people just have a
spontaneous idea saying hey I want to
talk about this or this with this fit
into this like very small format two
days or would that be too much of a
distraction
let the people up front know that we
have there that year then tell me get
then we all can prepare I guess I mean
for me like yesterday but shorter notice
was like okay hey five minutes yeah
don't I mean there are many things we
all can talk about but maybe just two
days upfront keep us a note and say yeah
be the apt adoption and then I think
open space with work pretty well I
really enjoyed both the lightning talks
yesterday and this open forum at the end
and also having the tables and having
the different discussions on the tables
I think those three things have allowed
us to have a certain amount of sort of
directed and open forums I don't know if
we need any more I don't people think on
that may be a bit more time on the
roundtables because when you combine
them with food is yeah you know do I eat
what do I talk okay so no more food and
then we can talk oops okay is it normal
food then that means mm-hmm um hiya Mack
you wanna leave before right okay i
think the format is perfect if it ain't
broke down don't fix it i think the idea
of doing lightning talks is excellent if
it puts people in a mode where they
immediately focus on what is most
pressing for them I think we need to
trust the attendance that someone who
gets up and talks about sugar in
cappuccino and how exactly he does it I
think we need to to trust that in there
is a message for us as an industry
that's more important than a pregnant
maybe if we opened up you know more time
for for just rambling discussions like
this one
what what I think is important that the
the the idea of making it two days
singletrack very finely controlled in
terms of time and so on i think that
that is good because we're coming we
don't have a lot of time we're extremely
busy were extremely stretched we've got
to focus on multiple different different
things while we're doing our jobs we get
to sit here for two days and just hear
what the leaders in the industry think
is important and to me that's that's
critical ok so i guess was that you guys
are free thank you yeah this was
surprisingly fun I had no idea how this
would work out I enjoyed the most a
moment where for visitors were sitting
here that was cool that's cool so thanks
again this is it at the end of day to
have safe trips home and I hope to see
all of you next year again where we plan
to have a repeat of this not quite clear
where but we do want to have another G
techniques here ok safe travels home
take care
