can see he's already invoking the Blues
Brothers which has me very excited for
this talk so Tim thank you very much
thanks John sad hi I'm a partner in the
little tiny consulting firm there's
actually five minutes away from you our
office on West twelfth Street and there
are seven of us for in the united states
and three in europe and so we have an
office in london as well and that's why
what's called the Atlantic system skill
and I always have to remember to say my
my co-author Tom DeMarco is one of my
partners in the guild and and Tom
usually lives in maine now so a hotbed
of software anyway I just wanted to kind
of pick some topics to talk about and i
would like to run this in New York City
fashion of no hands raised just
interrupt me at will and and we'll go
for their from that and I don't even
know if I'm going to go through all the
slides and all that sort of stuff but a
little bit if you Tom and I wrote the
first edition of people we're back in
1988 i think it was then another edition
came out in 99 and then we wrote a book
in this decade called waltzing with
bears about managing risk on software
projects and we consider ourselves a
team of two we actually work pretty well
that the other writing but i'm a team
zealot and a risk management zealot and
i and the other thing i think that you
should know about me because i think it
kind of twists my brain after a while
for about 20 years I'm very much a part
time basis I'm an arbitrator for the
American Arbitration Association and
then I arbitrate software and system
disputes I'm not a lawyer I didn't go to
law school they I'm technically a
commercial arbitrator because there's no
systems group in arbitration but they
know I won't take cases unless there's
something that I have some knowledge
about in them and it's really kind of
interesting to look at projects that go
through that kind of New Age American
life a life cycle of analysis design
code test litigate and instead of
operate and in to see all
all break loose and crazy projects and
just craziness and emotional upset
anyway um what I was thinking about it
I'm most old I i discovered that
recently and you know with a couple
sections in this room you know you look
like my son's so and that's fine that's
great and I'm all for that I saw I've
seen a lot i guess i guess you know
everybody's talks about experience no
it's just you have a lot of years being
in offices and seeing different kinds of
places i do mostly consulting so i'm in
all sorts of offices we were talking
about that before and it's always
amazing to me to come in two different
offices and feel the different kind of
culture and we're walking around in this
space I've never been here before at all
even though I'm just down the road and
we were laughing about it is who forgot
the whiteboards I mean this place is
it's so weird I mean I mean most places
with a bunch of developers there's
there's writing everywhere and you guys
look oddly tidy I don't know what's
going on but you know hit more
whiteboards you'll feel happier trust me
anyway so tapas I discuss and we might
not even discuss them all I picked a
couple a team magic that the the plus
sides of teams that weird thing that
happens every once in a while but not
very often where teams really do
something magical um Demmings point I
don't know if you know Deming very much
at all but it has 14 points and there's
a this one that is just bizarre and I I
always bring it up to irritate people
because Deming tells you not to do
certain things in your organization but
he doesn't tell you what to do instead
but it's an interesting topic to talk
about just want to show it to you get
your take on it I want to have a little
bit about agile methods and teams
because in the last decade or so that's
really caused a lot of change in kind of
team formation where in many
organizations now the agile teams would
for instance have people selecting their
own work rather than having real task
assignment coming to developers or
testers or whatever and then I also want
to talk a little bit about good old team
aside organizations still you
thousand six practice it very well the
general inhibition of team for real team
formation and in certain kinds of ways
that are probably subconscious not
conscious but those my topics to discuss
let's pick a couple um the notion of
team gel when time I wrote the book
years ago everybody who's in a group is
on the team and in most of time they
show no team behavior for instance
you'll have teams of hundreds of people
where you don't even know their own
names and you can't be on a team if you
don't know that person's name in the in
the sense of you know a work group
together and one of the things that when
we first wrote the book we didn't
consciously think of is is that we
didn't mean sports teams and in America
at least not Europe so much in America
you say team and everybody has the
basketball team the football team model
and that's if you think about how we
work in groups that is not the model
it's I like the glee club model or the
the swing band model or something like
that where yeah you know yes you have to
try out to get into the glee club but
there's not an internal competition
going on you there you know the
baritones aren't saying gee I hope the
Altos are off so we sound better
compared to them that kind of stuff and
they've got different voices as they're
trying to put together the thing about
sports teams that I put this slide
together is you know sports may have the
wrong analogy because it is internally
competitive you have the bench and you
have the starters and you know if you're
on the bench oh I can sum it up with
this bubble I invented I you know if
Matt turned his act that I'd be in kind
of thing you know I'm the backup point
guard and I'm sitting on the bench and
yeah I moved for my team but and that's
not what happens on gel teams the
magical teams were where everybody has
plenty of work to do and no one's I'm
sitting on the bench I've never seen a
bench in software in and kind of
interesting I mean you know if you think
about the bench notion I always I've
always been remarkable about us talking
to a guy at HP years ago about anything
you know people come in and lobbies late
come inbound requirements on to a team
and just say oh
we need this in there we're not going to
change the delivery date or anything
that's okay oh isn't it and you know and
the guy was saying you know you know
where the were the programmers are
sleeping that we can wake up and take on
these new requirements in a the bullpen
model of software and I've never seen
that everybody's got a full plate
everywhere you go I know you guys get
some time carved out for your own use
which is was very sweet and very rare
but usually everybody's got more than
enough to work to do on any given day
the thing about the about about the the
gelled teams are there are kind of
mysterious to me is the gel team is it's
even hard to describe it perfectly I
hope you've been on one you made that
you may not have been on one yet this is
where something happens it is not
directly formulaic that Google or
anybody could crank it out but something
happens where a group of people get
together and they start to be able to
finish each other's sentences in terms
of the work that's being done it's the
easiest way to think about it they start
to have a common view of it a common
architecture might be it or cog a great
design theme might capture people and
they start to work on it together and
you see watch where the team will have
all sorts of interesting behaviors one
is is when we focus they really focus I
I took this picture a while back couple
years ago and I show it to managers I
don't know who have managers and this is
my manager test because if you look at
that picture in your manager and you
don't smile you're in the wrong business
now go to go into agriculture or
something because it never gets better
than that those two those two guys have
no idea where they are who's around them
they're looking at a piece of code
together they're a pair of pair
programming it in this one they're
working a piece of code together and
they are loaded they are locked they are
they're working as hard as I can
possibly work together and you get these
bursts on these good teams where pairs
or small groups of people put enormous
amount of focus together and then there
will be rest areas to write on a gel
team you'll see weird behavior like
stupid behavior and silliness
turns out to be really important and
there will be in jokes on teams gel
teams and in some organizations who are
very Presbyterian or whatever get really
uptight about you know it really
sophomoric humor usually is what arises
jokes in you know cartoons or whatever
and it seems to be a big vent something
I guess it's because of the focus when
you break your focus and you you rest up
you need to have silliness in your life
and you'll see an jell teams lots of odd
be especially with your you're not in
the team what looks like very odd
fourteen-year-old behavior at times and
many organizations have a hard time of
that which I worry about so it's more
fun now people work very hard but they
also what they will they will they will
talk about these teams there with with
with great warmth in their heart I have
a just I have a friend who works in
Phoenix outside of Phoenix and he's a
very serious guy and he I'm with him in
his office and he works now at honeywell
bull so the old American Honeywell got
bought by the french bull and I'm
walking down the hall because we're
gonna go get a cup of coffee and we're
talking about the project that he asked
me to come take a look at walking down
and he's my age basically maybe a little
younger and there's a woman who's
clearly no I around about our eggs
walking toward us and we're talking and
as we crossed guys names ed ed went
where in the woman went and I think and
I said it did you quack at her he said
yeah and he said I'll tell you later and
because he was talking about something
grace ears so I get to the cafeteria
said what was the quacking and he said
oh back in 1993-94 we were on a project
together and we got called lakin odds
Sauvage the wild ducks the savage ducks
you know of course in French in honor of
Honeywell above bull and ever since then
when you meet anybody on that team you
quack and they have an annual reunion
one of their guys now lives in Malaysia
and he's been to every single room in
every year it says he makes a point of
coming back the United States he visits
his family obviously as well Bettina's
wife come back and they make sure
they're in Phoenix for the Cunard
Salvage reunion you know that kind of
odd behavior you see all the time though
and on teams people talk about that
amazing project 15 years ago where five
years ago whatever people have you know
spread out them they'll reunite of the
things like that so it's a lot more fun
interestingly from management point of
view is when a team gels its its
turnover rate almost goes to zero unless
there's some sort of catastrophe and it
has nothing to do with management as
then do the company it has to do with
the peer group I've seen that happen a
lot where people say I'm not leaving now
it wouldn't be fair I know when we get
this release done I got to leave I had a
project in Maryland where a guy stayed
his wife got this incredible job in
Chicago and he basically they moved to
Chicago and he stayed in like a motel 6
on his dime and tell the next release
you said I'll get another job in Chicago
you go you should take this job the jobs
offerings there I can't leave now and
have nothing to do with the company
offering any sweetness or whatever he
had to stay for that release and it was
like you know I would let my teammates
down it was kind of the unsaid line and
the team was very grateful to him and I
had nothing to do with vertical it had
everything to do with with horizontal
going back and forth uh and then I
pulled this off somewhere I forget
that's a juggernaut you know and and
projects require self-healing property
one of the most interesting things I see
in these in these teams is they become
excellent problem solvers something
comes up and it's almost like a
challenge rather than a problem or an
issue it's like oh this comes up what
are we going to do and everybody powwows
together yes together they yell and
scream and argue figure out what their
strategy how to deal with this and
they'll go over it under it around it
that blow it up they'll do something but
it's like you know you can't stop us and
if you're an older confident manager
this is where you go okay you know I
just have to do base
Karen feeding here and leave these guys
alone because they are smarter together
than I am and you know and in I don't
need to quote unquote manage this team
they are if they can manage the big
issues they can manage themselves
basically and you just make sure that
the organization doesn't screw up you
end up I will use the apocryphal word
that a old manager friend of mine said
you become the shield and I'll just
keep everything away from these guys so
they can work all day there's a kind of
interesting notion but that juggernaut
for success it can't be stopped if
you've ever been on one of these teams
you know what I mean you know it's going
to be bloody you know you're going to
work hard and long hours but you know
you're going to deliver a really good
product and it's from your perspective
not from the company's perspective it's
not google says oh that was a real solid
job you don't care you know it together
you look each other and go this is the
rocket Gibraltar and we don't care what
the rest of the world thinks because we
know what it really is and we know how
we put together and that's the kind of
magic of the teams the only thing about
teams is kind of interesting to point
out is they are collegial right in the
old sense of collegial we're a little
town would have a church and they
couldn't actually have a minister full
time and so ministers from the areas we
take turns going into little town you
know that's how the College of the
collegiate churches and things like that
and you see it's very much a peer
relationship and one of the things that
you lata organizations don't talk about
and I don't know if jonathan is going to
be thrilled with this but you know you
are if you're a developer or test or
whatever you're in the Federated States
of the project but the managers are
Canadians wait managers are different
than the players on the project on a
good team I mean they're just like
canadians I couldn't leave a better
analogy more or less speak the same
language they're not going to invade
their allies their friends we have an
open border but they're not us right and
if you're on a team it did you know it's
really too especially if a manager is
doing you know salary reviews and
performance things or whatever they're
your ally in that kind of sense but
they're not on the team when you listen
two teams and they talk about we
they usually don't have the manager in
mind and I mean and that's not bad if
you're again if you're a manager that's
way it is and that's what it's going to
always be they when they say well we did
this and then we know and then you know
Mike came in and looked like he had just
seen a ghost he said I think we got a
major problem we all got together and we
went in and Mike took the front end
design and boomed apart in front of us
we scrapped a month and a half of work
we came back we did this and then you
never hear about Larry the boss right
it's like the boss wasn't even there
that day and its first person plural is
is the College of the developers of the
partners always in a in a gel teeth so
that's kind of the the magic I'm
actually me go let go back of it
counterpoint each bathroom where dad
watches missile at the tea what it's
antithetical to Jones you eating
managers can do horrible damages two
teams right I mean there's a melon tits
you know there's a million variations of
team aside I mean the team has to own
all the critical technical decisions and
one of the things that we for instance
one of things I see all the time is that
the more junior managers come out of the
technical ranks often and they're
feeling more comfortable with the
technical decisions and those are the
ones they should first release back to
the team right you know it isn't it is a
team of specialists it's not a hierarchy
I mean in the old media of the sense of
like guild like right where the master
craftsman in the apprentice and you
apprenticed to a master craftsman
because you want to become a goldsmith
to and that Goldsmith that your boss
could do things in gold you couldn't do
and you had to learn from him to rise up
to master I mean maybe that was once
true when I had a different hair color
but it clear hasn't been true for 20
years on software projects it's a maid
that's a team of specialists if one if
you pick any random person on the team a
developer and you say and you had them
disappear the manager can't come down
and do that job they can't say oh ger my
network guy is sick for
the next month I'll be the network guy
they don't they can't spell network
right they're clueless usually and so
it's not a matter of a hierarchy based
on on skill at all it's a different kind
of job and I think the skill set of a
making product right is a different one
than the the project manager who never
writes a line of code or does a test or
the rights any documentation or any of
that kind of stuff it's a different kind
of skills and um let me show you this is
I don't know is it old guy I think
Deming died two years ago I think now
but he wrote a book called out of the
crisis he's were in a whole bunch of
books but he has 14 points about
critical things and I just want to show
you this because honestly I don't know
what to make of it all and and so it's
it's it's got something about teams and
people in it that's really interesting
the first part is really simple right
remove barriers that robbed the hourly
worker you know the workmen on the
factory floor of his right to pride of
workmanship the responsibility of
supervisors must be change from sheer
numbers to quality ok great everybody
you know can say fine but now here comes
the singer remove barriers that rob
people in management and in engineering
and I assume that's basically you folks
of the right to pride and wearing ship
this means inter alia abolishment of the
annual or merit rating and of management
by objective management by the numbers
and he doesn't say what to replace of it
but he's basically it's a really weird
one here of yeah and he's not saying you
might think of this he's saying abolish
the annual or merit rating you know it's
don't wait on americana Oh most organs I
don't know what Google has eyes that
I've never been here but most
organizations you have some sort of
time-based review some reviews or pure
performance reviews and others may have
salary implement implications and
entered some extremes there's from some
sort of ranking I i just found this year
the ultimate one Lawrence Livermore labs
out in and in livermore california force
ranks all employees
there's an employee number one an
employee number last no matter what they
do they're all in one list so there's a
manager and a janitor and a gardener and
you know your employee 37 the gardener
is one hell of a gardener I mean it's
you look at it's a totally absurd but
the interest of the thing about it is is
this whole notion of pride of
workmanship right and what I think
Deming is saying is other rewards are
crass and pride of workmanship can be
driven out by dangling other rewards and
you drive pride of workmanship out and
then the quality of the product goes
right into the dumpster and that pride
of workmanship is fragile and anything
you do where you try to dangle
incentives away from the pride of
workmanship is very dangerous and one of
the things I see in angèle teams is
basically with it well that sounding
dramatic this kind of a cult of quality
I mean on a good team there's almost not
even talk about quality and the direct
in the sense of this theoretical notion
I mean it's all concrete stuff but let's
look at this code is it good enough to
be part of the product it's not a matter
of what is the theory of quality they're
kind of becomes a body of work that
you're putting together how about the
other way is I look at good developers
well I don't know meet him all the time
people tell you all the ski got to be
this guy this young kiddies terrific
developer they are internal standard
quality is so above the standard of
quality for the company that's
irrelevant to talk about company
standards it's just demeaning it's like
get away from me I mean you know a good
engineer will will not do some things I
mean I had a couple of beers one time
with a good friend of mine hit that was
his death definition of a good software
developers somebody who wouldn't do
certain things you know I just not gonna
write my code that way I'm just not
gonna do it this way I won't I don't
care what you do I'm not going to do it
it's my standard the hell of the rest of
world this is the way I work I cannot
work below this line just I just feel
too uncomfortable I mean it's just kind
of like you know working faster or
slower
I mean I don't know I don't know what
with this place is like but people have
this and you hear this kind of odd
notion of you know you know we've got to
get this done so let's get going and
people people can't sustain working
faster proud I mean it's like no try
walking faster than you normally walk
you can't sustain that you'll fall back
to your natural walking space I've been
married for a long long time my wife and
I walk at different speeds in a and we
paid finally you know I tried everything
you know and and you know I I'll take
shorter steps and or I do the dog thing
where I'd walk ahead and come back to
her and we'd go for a walk in the woods
and I go out back and but if I walked
her pace it was just driving me nuts so
slow and finally we decided to stay
married and take separate walks no I
come in short walks are okay but you
know it's just impossible and in whether
you in this in the same goes for working
slower as though people want to work
slower if you look at practically you
can't work slower than you want to for
any amount of time it is impossible you
just drive yourself crazy now this is
very generational there's a maybe ever
listen to Bob &amp;amp; ray Bob and Ray were on
the radio they're just they're they're
wonderful and Bob and Ray I'm sure you
can find him somewhere out there Bob and
Ray at this great routine where Ray was
interviewing bob and bob was the
president of the slow speakers of
America and you listen to it and it's
funny for about 15 seconds and then its
sheer agony you know as Bob would have
them question like at the speed ray what
answer and the thing about individuals
and teams is you have a comfort zone the
only thing you can do is try to work
longer you can't work faster you can't
work slower and you can work longer a
pill certain point and if I don't count
myself as a developer anymore but I
played one on TV when I was a young guy
and you know and there comes a time when
you know you get dangerous you
just too tired you're too stupid and you
just don't do it because you're just
gonna damage stuff right and so you know
things like over time are great for
short Sprint's but sustaining it is
crazy I mean you're when you're yelling
can sing a lot longer I noticed for
instance under I'm going to predict this
for you I used to be able to write code
for four hours where I didn't know where
I was I could concentrate for about four
hours I i actually had I infections I
used to wear contact lens ism my doctor
discovered that I wasn't blinking and
and I could just lock in and now that
I'm an old guy I can go maybe 45 minutes
to an hour even when I'm left alone and
I fall out of it i just i got to get up
and walk around I just come I just can't
hold that concentration anymore but you
know if you look at great software
software isn't built nine to five or
noon to 10 it's built in those enormous
focused bursts where you hunker down and
you work you know and then when we went
ah my writing people where you start to
see that where one of the things you see
is I don't know again about this
workspace is workspace ism is important
because it if it permits you to
concentrate for those lengths of time if
the space constantly pulls you out of
that what we flow kind of concentration
you get really frustrated and eventually
neurotic you know right where you cannot
buckle down it's a weird sensation than
we I think as developers we need to
always talk about that but for instance
if you don't have a window of time you
won't even start to really work right
you come in at nine thirty and you're
going to have to meet at ten what do you
do between 9 30 and 10 email whatever
because you can't say I'm going to start
to write a piece of code for 30 minutes
because as you as you get immersed all
of a sudden boom it's ten o'clock and
you got a great so so if you don't see a
couple hours you wouldn't start or if
you start and then people start to grab
you're like hey come over here take a
look at this again if you're really good
it's like the cosmic eraser comes out of
here in your brain and just everything
that was in there just goes flying out
you deal something else you come back
and now you've got that cycle back up
and I don't know you but most folks
guesstimate and you know it's somewhere
around 10 to 20 minutes for a software
developer to resume building a
non-trivial piece of code to get
everything lined up into the gray matter
to have code come flowing out fingertips
in it's a non-serious restart time so I
know I this pride of workmanship is
fascinating to me I and I don't know
what to do about that it turns out that
the interesting thing about money it all
is it turns out it looks like for most
folks it's hygiene and I i I'd heard
that term and I guess it's the right way
to hug it's either sufficient or it's
insufficient either you say I'm being
rewarded for my contribution here at
Google and I feel it's fair and now and
you're working or you say hey I'm
contributing way more than I'm getting
you know reimbursed for and I'm grouchy
I think I'm being used in some way but
unless you get to extremes of money
money doesn't motivate very well I mean
one of the things I I was talking to a
bunch of managers just last month was
they were talking about you know and
it's a big company you know rewarding
their best developers and and I was
trying to say I think it's a no op most
of time the villa comes in they say here
you know we uh you know we're having a
hard time at blatts go we're giving you
a four percent raise that's the highest
raise anybody's gonna get we had to
battle for it you know you know we love
you we love you here's your new money
and that program or developer says thank
you very much and goes back to work I
mean they might go back to their
guessing callable call home ago hey you
gotta raise let's go out to dinner but
then they go back to work and it's not
like they go oh I'm now making four
percent more I must be at least four
percent more productive to be fair they
don't think that way they had an
interesting problem they were working on
they got a raise they went back and
they're working on an don't they that
they don't go oh my goodness it's kind
of a no sew in it it does differ if you
dangle huge amounts of dough out there
you know if somebody said to the team of
you know you three guys you deliver this
there's a three million dollar bonus at
the end that changes behavior but most
organizations that's not what's
happening it's not about to be happening
right as you go through it so okay um I
mean talk of yeah this is another one I
just you know Jonathan asked me to come
talk for free says this is what you get
and it's a bunch of half-baked ideas you
know you know you get what you pay for
again this is this is not thing that
that I've seen awards and rewards are
when the organization does them they're
usually horribly lame the only awards or
rewards that seem to be meaningful or
inside that again inside the team where
you know somebody you know it usually
it's a meaningless award or reward
somebody recognizes somebody else for
busting their ass the last couple of
days to get something done and the team
you know gusta buys them a pizza or
something like that but in most
organizations managers have this thing
about they want to reward their best
producers or extraordinary work it
always comes out kind of like a forced
smile I mean I was at a company that
builds CAD CAM software in in southern
Ohio and I've been in now they're a
bunch of times and I was there one time
when they had software day which tells
you something right right you know it's
the day when they act this software
people are allowed to look at the CEO
yeah there he is and the CEO is there
and they have and and so at one point
they of the CEO announced you know a
special award you know to the I forget
the name of the team you know the the
the the the x27 project team and for our
great year and all this stuff and in
this it must been four or five hundred
developers and testers and you know and
there's this yeah clap clap and the most
interesting thing was there they're
saying come on up x 2017 these people
look like they were going to the gallows
they got up it had been look they look
so uncomfortable and you could see
everybody other team other teams are
looking at and going like what am I
chopped liver I busted my hump this last
and we did a great job why they you know
and then in the X 27 guys have to go up
and have their picture taken with a CEO
and you know no one is smiling no it's
just horrible you know I went back to
the manager I said what was that about
and I said oh every year we do this and
I said didn't you you must have missed
it but no one was pleased including the
prize winners and you know again awards
and rewards are very odd difficult
things to make to pull the spirit that
you intend off and and I as a met my
truck to manage I was talk about be very
careful I had a manager who's who
managed me who had this really great
thing she would she would and she later
we talked about it she would she would
pull you in private her big thing was
always been private never around anybody
it was an individual who done something
tell them in private what you saw them
do why why you thought that was
extraordinary or whatever associate no
award or reward to it at all and just
tell him you saw it and that you know
that was that was terrific and she said
I remember what she said to me she said
you'll blush they'll blush and it's the
best thing you can do you don't do it in
front of other people and don't make a
big deal one-on-one you know just a
blatant compliment is about as good as
it gets and all the rest of the stuff is
BS I just to give you favorite I don't
know if you get this here there's a
project i'm working with now and a group
of three people came and worked
literally saturday i think they slept in
the office on Saturday night Sunday they
were there monday morning long enough to
tell everybody what they done and then
they crashed tuesday they came back in
and the manager got knows american
expressed dinner on us things you know
dinner for two you know and and gave him
to the three people in front of
everybody and i could see this one guy
he didn't do anything he waited for the
little ceremony be over and he gave it
back to the manager and he said I can't
take this home I think I was like what
he means no no my wife will kill me if
she thinks I spent all the weekend so
she had a spinner with our kids alone
before dinner she'll shoot me it'd have
been much more important than dinner no
incense don't give me any reward I told
her this was really really important to
the project so don't don't dangle
macaroni and cheese in front of her nose
and think she's going to be a happy
trooper having lost a whole weekend and
they got two little kids or something
until always backfires I don't know why
okay um who decides the clown hiring
again you guys that probably I should
even bother to talk about this because
you're growing so so in many ways but
the Yankees versus growing your own is
what my analogy was there now you you
buy the talent versus you grow it and
one of the things that I I see
organizations do and that I that amazes
me is they will hire they will be the
Yankees they will say you know in they
hire the most absurd way you know must
have at least eight experience eight
years experience and they name you know
operating systems and you know must have
deep knowledge of you know auto
insurance or whatever it is like you got
to be kidding me you know the kind of
stuff and in the end up in this kind of
homogenized white bread boring
organization where everybody has you
know four years of Java or whatever they
were looking for is though that was the
key to a great developer right and the
the grow your own folks it just to give
you a feel for it I don't know what you
guys do is the best organizations I've
seen are usually the real hirers are the
developers hiring the developers but the
managers will talk to them for a while
kind of give them a sniff test and then
leave them with the developers and the
developers feedback will come back like
let's let's offer this guy a job or lets
you know whatever it comes up but if
you're especially trying to build
cohesive units gel teams it's not a
matter of you know yeah what do you have
the skills that you need or are you
likely to grow the skills I mean all of
you at one point came out of school
we'll never really work for a living
probably and so somebody gave you a
break and it seems to me that you know
they're sometimes when you really do
need a skilled experienced person right
away how to plug a gap but in the long
haul the great developers I've watched
are more happy because they they don't
know stuff than they what they know that
they're going to learn something on this
project they learn something new
something new there much more eager
about that than having the skill set and
if you want to keep people who are
really really good you've got to keep
challenging them with interesting from
their perspective interesting projects
and that is not do it again do it again
is a big bore in our business for for
the people who can really pull it off
and you know and there's a big pole in
management you know the nothing's better
than having a quote unquote experience
season team where this is gone the oh
this is not novel this is not anything
scary they can they can pump this baby
out you know in the short term that
looks great in a long-term you know into
the great blender of mediocrity you go
and this gets really kind of grim let's
see agility in teams scrum get it okay a
couple things that I find really
interesting about people wearin agility
one is the agile methods basically there
are family of methods let me put this
way you know there's crystal and scrum
and XP and all those things but one of
them is basically colocation
face-to-face and if you're but if you
want to build and maybe that's my
generation and not yours but if you want
to build a high-velocity team nothing
beats face to face if you're trying to
be quick as a bunny it's really hard to
do it with you know the Toronto office
coordinating with the Tel Aviv office
coordinating with the Albuquerque office
in it's a nightmare nothing is better
than oral communication grab somebody
when you need them and say hey let's
look at this together you have a minute
does it just doesn't work and it seems
to me there's something very satisfying
about that yeah but I don't know if some
of you do this but you know remote with
California or whatever that is you can
have a California
in one second you know at the California
team you can have the New York team
they'll never be one team in the sense
of what I've been talking about there'll
be there'll be allies again they'll be
its kind of Canadians again none of
those Californians they're nice guys but
they're not us and the closest you can
come is if you've cross-pollinated like
you've actually worked together at one
point and now those people are in
California so you know them you've
worked with them before then you can
have that video conference love affair
that you're having but if you if you've
never had the physical contact the video
conference love affair is usually a
bunch of people staring at the desk you
might as well turn off the video
conference and just pick up the phone
you know it's just not going to happen I
went by yeah but you can walk again i'm
an old fart i know it but maybe it's my
generation but you can watch the i think
i can tell the difference between groups
that have actually worked together in
groups that haven't when you just watch
the video conference behavior right
right and you can see that happening
I've got a client in Massachusetts has
an office in waterford ireland and one
of the good things i've done is they
they get a couple of months of time they
bring those whole gang irish folks over
then they take bunch of Yanks and send
them over to Ireland and so they've
actually stabilized everybody knows each
other you know the Yanks have learned
about a you know irish football and so
they find out what the scores are and
talked to him back and forth and the
usual kinds of stuff you know the
Americans learn to drink Guinness and
all that good stuff and I'm not saying
it's perfect but it certainly is a whole
lot better than this kind of them us
kind of thing that usually is they're
not us when when you listen to people
talk about we did this it's not it's not
mountain view and New York did this it's
we did this yeah so I think in general a
little bit this is having more words
that it is perfectly fine to fly to
California with the justification of
yeah but one of the one of the difficult
things is one you can only spend so much
time traveling to some other place
before you but and to its
hard to get especially actions on
filtration of expertise it should do it
all with one TV you're right word tell
me right yeah without a penalty on some
portion yeah yeah in the team's I'm
talking about they're usually our
working groups are small we're talking
about teams at the top end being maybe
20 at the top end and the greatest teams
I've ever seen our teams you know you
are like family size these eight five
six seven that kind of game sighs where
those people can wail right and well
we're talking a little bit about this
the other thing though is it's one of
the things I think in your in your world
of growth is really hard but you can
fight the fight is teams need to own
something they can't have a piece of the
action they have to have or you can call
it responsibility or ownership whatever
you wanna call with your up there's a
product or something that is theirs they
make decisions about it they build it
they tested they own it if they are if
they're working for a part of something
else the magic just doesn't happen again
it's gotta be like we are responsible
for getting this out if you have only a
slice you know it's it's there's no
closure it doesn't feel right and it
gets hard as you get big and dispersed
and you have big projects it's really
hard to do that I can't say you're going
to win at it but I think managers really
need to think about how they organize to
try to carve so people feel as though
they they have a meaningful hole that
they're building it's not necessary the
whole system but is it's clearly bounded
they know what what product piece or
whatever way you want to call it they're
building and it they're responsible for
it together that you know you know it
doesn't take you long in this industry
it's always the damn interfaces right
the human interfaces the software
interfaces you want to know where the
problems are it's always the interfaces
you know Mountain View thought you had
it you thought they had it and now
nobody's got those kinds of things so
you try to try to clear up the interface
as best you can so it's established
where I have this piece you have that
piece kind of kind of kind of work um
nothing boots working on only one
project and again one of the things as
you grow and I don't know you can't do
to everybody but I if you're a manager I
really want you to fight the fight is
once you start to to have people
multitasking across different groups
they are basically on no teams is what
happens your I I've come to believe
you're either on one or zero teams at
any given time I people say oh I was on
three teams and now you are yeah you
were a Canadian again you were not on
those teams and sometimes you if are you
are very distinct specialist you don't
you can't spend full time on one project
you don't have enough work and and
that's the cluster you pay I'm saying
against you can't prevent it but one
project where you hit you know it's the
Blues Brothers though we're on a mission
from God right we've got one thing to do
as a group today and tomorrow and the
next bunch of months this is what we do
all day here and we don't have to worry
about the other stuff this is our
responsibility and that makes a huge
difference I mean if you just think
about it just all the reboot time you
know if you're you to start you know
you're just thrashing back and forth
between projects and where was I and
jumping around nothing works by now
nothing beats working hard and going
home Kent Beck in the of the XP fame has
this great thing about sustainable pace
okay let's find a work rate that we can
work at and hold for weeks and months
ago that we can build product at and the
you know its idiom everybody's got their
own different kind of work habits I'd
been one of the hardest things I have is
I got a lot of work in California and my
clients in California like started like
seven in the morning you know it's just
like give me a bagel on a cup of coffee
at eight please you know like I'm thing
and and i was i was talking to Jonathan
and saying that no this is more like the
classic New York everybody kind of rolls
in and work starts sometime late am
usually or whatever and you know and you
work tell you you have to go home or
want to go home that kind of thing and
the the idea of that sustainable pace is
is a really important one again I don't
remember who said this I I don't know
where even heard it but there's this
great line of don't forget for every
hour of overtime you get you're going to
get an hour of under time later that on
the long haul it just washes now you
work an 80-hour week this week and if
you're smart you don't even show up next
Monday and if you're young you go in
monday and you're smart you know your
your lethal so you clean up all the
things you pushed off while you were
working that week before the eight
thousand emails and all the rest of it
that you didn't answer because you just
you just can't keep that going and so
I'm a big fan of the notion of actually
working in the work day I know that
sounds strange one of the good things
that interesting thing about teams and
the agile stuff is they tend to have
fewer meetings because it's more
conversations I talked to specifically
someone rather than you know the if you
think about it there darn few meetings
in our world that need 20 people I don't
know if if if you guys have gotten into
this but as watch organizations grow
they have these really odd meetings that
are just mind numbing and a couple hours
of you know oh like this size group
anything what's going on why do these
people need this and it's always like
people get sent to the meeting because
they might something might be get
decided so somebody sitting there kind
of in neutral state and discovers that
that didn't get decide and they go back
to their team and report and you just
realize you're basically pissed away
half a day and you know that kind of
bureaucracy is a disaster um tema side
let me just I'll shoot them up mmm here
are my seven surefire ways to dis
inhibit team formation like if defensive
management is a number one managers who
are trying not to let people make
mistakes prevent teams from ever getting
going right you know don't you know
don't do that now they the manager who
thinks they are the senior technical
expert when they're not you know we're
trying to that kind of fun phenomenon
I'm not going to go through all them
bureaucracy bureaucracy is any work the
team doesn't believe they should be
doing if I mean if you think about it
again I'm talking about a small team
that the easiest way the thing about is
what's the most important work I could
be doing now and that's the stuff you
work on 8 and the rest of it comes out
in the wash i mean you might have all
sorts of interesting discussions along
the way as what are we building and what
is the complete product not just the
working code what are the other things
we have to build to call this a product
but that's a separate conversation once
we know what our definition of product
is then we can drive by saying what's
the most important thing I can work on
today and I'll go attack that in
anything else is bureaucracy it just
will drive them crazy physical
separation now I I don't know if it's
going to happen here we talked about you
know Ireland and New York and in
mountain view the kiss of death will be
when you're on a project and there's
five of you on this floor and two of you
on what six and another person on eat
right you've got all this open space and
all this stuff and they can't move you
together and they're telling you this is
really important physical proximity
seems to be a really big deal I mean you
know incidental contact if you you watch
the way teams work I did a lot of work
at Bell modern research in nortel and I
and in the winter in ottawa in in the
winter I remember one team that was a
really great team people come in some
people get the earlier than others i
watch this great 12 people were talking
a guy comes in still in his parka he's
walking down the hall and somebody said
you know Mark and Mark unzips his parka
and they're talking about some part of
the design and insult the guy takes his
park off and then another person the
team kind of met in the hall as they
appeared and it was an amazing design
meeting you know there they got a
whiteboard they pulled out and they're
talking and half the people at parkers
on the floor and other people and I'd
even gone to their desk yet that's how
teams learn how to work and in you know
in and they literally could park in one
spot and have a whole team parading in
to have this spontaneous meeting and it
just doesn't happen right I mean you go
to lunch for the people whose you sit
around
you'd like to have lunch some days with
your teammates kind of phenomena um
fragmentation of jobs we talked about
that click control this is a weird one
Tom tomorrow and I Retta out an and in
the bay area we were giving a talk about
people we're a bunch of years ago and
talk was over in this this woman from a
mullet companies of Bayer came up to us
and said the only time we officially
talk about teams in our company is we
have a rule that the end the project we
must break them up and and and I went
why and and she said I think it's
because they're afraid of clicks and I
know if you've ever met my partner Tom
and if you ever get a chance you should
meet him he's a wonderful guy and and
Tom said without any segue it all he
goes what's the difference between a
breeze and a draft I I mean I maybe we
put this in the second issue and the
woman kind of looked at him and you know
and I like the time I was like wow
Alzheimer's hits fast you know but I
knew Tom so I said gee Tom I don't know
what's the difference between a breeze
in a draft and he says a breeze is a
cool puff of air that you enjoy and a
draft is a cool puff of air that you
find annoying and he ended and obviously
DeMarco and his own little cryptic way
is saying what's the difference between
a team and a click it's whether you find
them annoying or enjoying right because
they are tightly bound there's loyalty
to the Federated States of the team and
they're not bound I mean they're uppity
their elitist in many ways and this
whole kind of click control kind of
thing is is usually fearful managers as
far as I'm concerned you know that just
you know they have the odd notion that
there the center of the team instead of
being Canadians they think they're the
you know the little piece of dirt that
the beautiful pearl will grow around in
the oyster and they are not in the
oyster forget it and flask phony
deadlines I mean I don't know again be
an old guy I I think back of projects
with real deadlines and I can't remember
one that took more than 15 seconds for
somebody to explain why that was the
deadline you'd hear the deadline to go
got it right we have a real deadline
here we got to do this
you know somebody says we're writing the
software for analyzing exit polls for
the 2006 election we got a deadline it's
you know november seventh you know right
now if we deliver a day late katie
couric is pissed no or whatever you know
you know yeah so yeah we got a deadline
we understand that but there'll be all
sorts of deadlines and then sometimes
the deadlines are our business deadlines
we have a contractual obligation to
deliver this by this date and it buddy
goes God otherwise we have penalties
that are severe got it like it and don't
talk to me anymore I understand we got
to figure out how we can deliver within
this constraint but the phony deadlines
are the ones that knee I WAYNE know this
must be done by octobre 13 2007 and yeah
now that I'm all I go what time on
october Thirteen's yeah you know can you
beat him you know give me greenwich mean
time here is ok if I delivered by 5pm
that kind of stuff and you look at the
date me and in you just say where did
this day come from and you know the
world won't stop rotating it in what you
know why did you say October 13th why
not sep tember 13th or August 13 and now
being a hardened guy I think octobre 13
is the earliest they could stay so they
could say and keep a straight face yeah
what they're trying to say is work fast
please or whatever they're doing but you
look there in teams are fragile they
need to perceive the possibility of
success right that's all they don't have
they don't need guarantees guarantees
are for children anyway right no nothing
worth doing in life is guaranteed but
they don't need guarantees but they got
out to be able look to get and go hey
guys we could pull this off let's go and
then they you know but if they don't
proceed that you know no one ever gets
together and says come on everybody
let's get together and lose hmm let's
get together work our butts off and then
next fall will come and they're going to
look at us and go you're behind schedule
you know and you get in you know and in
implying you slugs you let us down and
people just you know you look at and say
I mean I have a friend was a manager he
down on Wall Street here in and he's a
project mandrews my enginee they keep
trying to elevate him and he just loves
two runs projects he's just that
masochist and he and he has this thing
of where we're now he's he's fearless
cuz you know he's been around long
enough he doesn't need the money he just
likes to run interesting projects his
kids are all grown and and he talks
about groundhog day you know the movie
Groundhog Day with Bill Murray you know
he says I've been on this project before
I know how it ends you know we're gonna
work and work and work and and we're not
going to deliver and and then you know
we're going to all of a sudden magically
the functionality that had to be there
by the fall will slip into the winter
you know like that it will have the
no-shave the delivery date meeting at
the end you know in your key goes to the
whole things I've been on this project
I've seen it and the phony deadlines are
real killers especially when you look at
it and go I mean I don't know if you've
ever been on one really bad I i call
them dead fish projects the project that
starts as a dead fish it was never alive
you look at it and you're on the project
like a week or two and you go to lunch
and you with a couple of your colleagues
and somebody says no way we're getting
this done by next April you know or
whatever and somebody usually says hey
wait a second they didn't say which
April you know something like that you
know and everybody's like hunt they
hunkered down right i mean they just get
totally hunkered down everybody says oh
boy this is gonna be brutal and you know
put it this way if you're a manager
that's management hell is trying to
manage a project you don't believe in a
project you think is slated for one
thing severe criticism if not no death
you know that kind of thing and it's
just misery all around and it's a
disaster and in now from a management
point of view you've got to be able to
fight jawbone anything to get the
envelope so it's at least possible to
pull it off if it's if you people look
at and go this is just ridiculous
charade everything falls apart after
that right morale goes in the dumper
everything happens
yep yep Rick um well let me last slide
it's growing teams I used a gagra
cultural analogy because you can do
everything right and not get a good crop
right so you have to pray for rain but
you know never push the quality you
don't think people say oh we oh we got
three dimensions you know time and
resources and quality ball there's no
quality to mention I'm sorry software
software has to work right I mean you
can talk about what levels you're going
to do validation and verification all
that up front you know like insurance
but they'll talk about negotiating
quality with a team shoot yourself first
don't don't don't don't play that card
right lots of closure one of the things
i do like about the the agile stuff is
regular builds people you know you're
sophisticated i'm sophisticated you you
can look so fired out in time where you
can say i have to do these things and
get this done by this point and then
there's manana beyond there you know
what you know right now for me
Christmases manana it's I know it's
november i can't even start to think
about christmas presents for my kids or
my wife yet you know it's not important
enough to me i guess but you know it's
mañana but you know you're on a project
in and google says to you you need to
deliver this by october two thousand
seven and you really sophisticated but
it's only a voice in your head going I
could be dead you know and it's yeah so
Google's point of view that's closure
deliver a really good product by default
2007 and we will be very thankful and
happy right but from humans that's
that's a huge hole and it's hard to fire
up there to go in the office in the
morning so Greg gotta get in there
because october two thousand seven it's
coming soon and we need you to break
things down so somebody says hey I built
you know it's a piece I can't deliver it
second be operational but I can test it
i can demonstrate it i can i can
integrate it with other pieces other
people are building we can put it
together we can have a little fetal
system going that's closure and i'm in
developers all of us
on that kind of stuff to watch it at you
I made it and it works that's not be no
better feeling in life right um I think
last one perfect provides strategic but
not technical directions up the team
does the design the team does most
things the manager has to lay back on
that kind of stuff they do the strategic
things like how many people do we need
on a team now how are we going to do
this let's define what the product is
what we have to deliver that kind of
stuff work together with a team but get
get out of them and let them make the
calls whichever way they want to it is
one o'clock I will shut up thank you
very much yeah the question was what
sudden will turn the farm from the time
marketing or sales recognized as a
something a customer needs and the
turnaround of that feature I I would say
that the the prudent right answer right
now is in is marketing has no idea how
much work they put on your plate or not
somebody needs to size it I you know and
I in and i truly say if it's such an
important thing can't we work on a
little while and then sighs it right I
mean is it really something the customer
won't take unless we build it in 30 days
if it's done in 35 they're not going to
use it I mean most you know is the
deadline real or not is the question and
in most of time that in most the context
the deadline is not real it might it
might just be priority this is really
hot this is a great idea and we want to
scoot the priority on it and refocus our
you know our folks on it but the
deadline to me you know to have a number
there is asking for trouble did do a
number that's there without regard to
the size of the work and I in and I
