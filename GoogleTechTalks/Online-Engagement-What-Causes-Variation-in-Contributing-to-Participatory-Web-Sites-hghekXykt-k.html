hargett I who's from Northwestern I
first got to know Esther when she was
here visiting scholar at Stanford she
came over and was helping us with a
bunch of field study work and her
insights into how people surge how they
think about working on the web and
getting information to improve him
really interesting and useful so I also
want to point out that she's also a
master geocacher so she's capable of
finding anything under the most rigorous
of conditions so please welcome me in
welcoming Esther Haggadah great thanks
very much and thanks for coming so I
thought I would start by situating
myself since this is an
interdisciplinary group so I don't know
if you've seen this slide from XKCD but
there I am identifying myself as to
where I belong on the skill so I'm a
sociologist by training I thought that
would be helpful for you to know because
I know there are people from very
different backgrounds here and generally
speaking my background in terms of what
has motivated to me to do the research i
do is an interest in questions of social
inequality and how internet use in
particular relates to that so that's the
very general motivating framework that i
that i use so i'll start by a few
framing words for my talk so there's to
this day after quite a while of having
cut the internet around there's still a
lot of enthusiasm about its potential to
improve our lives in various ways but
what's interesting is that there's also
another side of this is that there's
actually also quite a bit of anxiety
when it comes to kind of the opposite of
all these potential positives so
depending on who you are how you think
about these things people get either
extremely excited about the internet and
its potential in positive ways or
freaked out about its negative potential
consequences so if you think this is
kind of an ugly slide that's on purpose
because I just wanted to show the
cacophony of just these
opinions that are out there and how
jumbled they are and not not very clear
view I would say because how can you
really have all these different
perspectives so a simpler way to show it
is just to say that so one perspective
suggests that there's the internet and
everything that comes from it is great
and then there's the other side which
suggests that there's the internet and
we have all these negative consequences
conveniently these smileys actually can
transform into the Venn diagram and what
I argue is that in reality what the way
we should be thinking about the
Internet's potential social implications
is something in between that there's a
balance and that there's nothing
inherent about what will emanate from
the internet socially speaking rather
there's a balance and in fact it matters
on the social context of a person's uses
of the internet what might come of it
whether there will be potential benefits
or negative consequences and what the
balances of those types of outcomes so
that's just to frame the talk for you so
I'm very interested in people's social
background what they're bringing to
their internet uses and in particular
we'll be focusing quite a bit on the
concept of skill and how skill in
particular matters and why that matters
and why we need to pay more attention to
it another issue that I wanted to
mention concerns would seem like pretty
widely held assumptions about how savvy
today's youth are with technology and
this is what I will call a myth and will
show you data to suggest that this
assumption is actually incorrect these
are some of the what some people quite a
few people seem to consider the capital
T truth about young people but in fact
there's little empirical evidence to
suggest that this is all true so what we
we do have empirical work on is more
that yes young people have been online a
lot throughout their lives and actually
do spend a lot of time online many of
them however there's not really
empirical evidence to suggest that they
do lots of different things online per
se and there's definitely no empirical
evidence to suggest
they're all University savvy so i'll be
showing you some data on this just one
more word on overall framework so again
i am interested in internet users I'm
not that interested for the purposes of
this talk and much of my work and people
who don't use the internet at all to be
sure there are still lots of Americans
who don't and lots of people in the
world who don't and that's an issue as
well it's just not my focus so I start
out with the user and recognize very
consciously that that user has a certain
position in society and brings all sorts
of characteristics to their uses and
then there's also technical context and
a social context of use that also
matters to how people use the internet
which is often ignored in a lot of work
and then I argue that these influence
someone's skill all of which then
influences what they end up doing with
digital media and then the really big
question which I'll leave more of it is
a question but as something that really
guides all of this work at a much larger
level is how all these things that might
feed into people's life chances what
what kind of feedback mechanism do we
see of this that how do people skills
and what they do online my how might
those things impact their offline life
chances as well so whether that's health
well-being financial well-being or
whatnot so that's why ultimately we
should care about these things from my
perspective and again as I said skill is
a factor that I will be focusing on
quite a bit ok so what data should one
turn to if interested in skill so that's
that's an issue because people don't
tend to collect data on skill large
datasets don't really have information
on that so I've been left to collect a
lot of my own data before explaining to
specifically the data sources that I am
drawing on for today's talk I did want
to spend a few minutes just a couple of
minutes talking about why I don't rely
on log data and why I think there are
challenges to relying a log data and why
I'm excited to see that Google over the
years is supplementing its work a lot
data with other types of data work about
users so for example an important issues
that becoming the user of a service
is not a random event now that's an
empirical question i will show you data
to show that this is the case but
basically what i mean by that is whether
you use a site is not random across the
population and so often we'll see data
analyses by having people analyze the
users of a certain site well by
analyzing users of a certain site that
project that study has already
automatically sampled against those
people who are not or biased against
those people are not users of that site
in the first place so that's one issue
another issue is that people understand
and use sites and services differently
so for example if you wanna look at
people's friendship networks in general
and then you use data just about
people's networks on facebook you can't
just say that you are looking at
people's friendship networks per se
because some people may use facebook to
connect with colleagues others might use
facebook to connect with family yet
others might use it to connect the
distant france others with their closest
friends so you can't compare the data
about networks of people on that one
site assuming that they're all the same
types of ties so that's just an example
of why again relying on to this log data
may be problematic and then finally or
one more point is that what people do
online is just one aspect of what people
do for different things so for example
how am I in touch with my best friends
well maybe I'm in touch with them again
say on facebook but in fact if I'm in
touch with my best friends mostly
through texting or picking up the phone
then if you just look at my facebook
network you're getting a skewed
perception of what I do with my best
friend or even who my best friend maybe
because you don't have the other data of
how we interact for example so those are
some reason the reasons why log data
have tons of potential obviously they
can't address all issues and there are
all sorts of other factors as well
things that we can't really assume by
looking at log data and I'll get to some
of that as I talk to you about my data
so as Dan mentioned in the introduction
I've done quite a bit of work are
looking at specifically looking at how
people search for information actually
meeting with people one-on-one sitting
with them it's what's called usability
testing in some areas I just call it
observation in my in my area but at one
study I did what we found across or what
I found across a hundred cases was that
people differed considerably and how
long they took to complete a group of
tasks and so that was interesting in and
of itself and it showed that there are
definitely skill differences among users
I'm not going to get into details of
that particular study because it's not
really what I'm focusing on today the
reason I bring this up is to mention how
I developed a skill measure an awareness
measure that i use on surveys so one of
the big challenges of these in person
studies is that of course it's
incredibly labor-intensive it's very
expensive it takes a lot of time to do
and you really can't do it on large
samples and it would be very difficult
to do a representative samples so
findings so there is limited general as
I generalizability from the findings
given that it would be very hard to get
to a nationally representative sample
that's large enough so what I did in
that study was I look to see what we're
good survey measures what were good
proxies on the survey to measure
people's actual skills as I observed
them while looking at how they found
information and so this is how I came up
with the survey instrument that I use
that I call a measure of skill which
itself is it's a it's a complicated
methodological question and I'm happy to
talk about it more but just so you know
it's not that one day I woke up and came
up with this I've been working on this
for about a decade now and have three
publications that detail how it was
developed and how it relates to other
types of data but basically this is the
question that people see on the survey
and this is a list of items that they're
asked to rank and the idea is that this
the measure that comes from this survey
item list which is this is just the half
there's a whole other
of another dozen terms this is a better
predictor of actual skill based on our
previous study than how many years
you've been a user how much time you
spend online or even simply asking
people what they think their internet
skill is so this this just performed
better statistically so that's why I use
it ok so then today I'll mainly be
drawing on survey data about internet
uses and skills in an ideal world I'd
have nationally representative data I
don't although I will mention a data set
that has been since conducted collected
that had some fuller data so I'll be
able to compare to a nationally
representative data set some of my
findings but basically so yeah in an
ideal world we'd have an actually
represents ample soon real expensive I
haven't had the funding to do that so
what I've done is I've done a lot of my
data collection on a specific college
campus at the University of
illinois-chicago I want to say a few
words about why they're so first of all
note for my signature line in case you
forgot that's not my institution that
I've never been affiliated with it so
this is not simply me studying my
students just to clarify and for those
of you not familiar with Chicago
geography that's northwestern and that's
where UIC is and it's about 20 miles
apart and we do in person data
collection in the winter so oh I used to
have I used to have the average
temperatures for Chicago winters but you
can imagine I mean last weekend was zero
but the average is about 20 so though
all of which is to say this is not a
convenience sample because as my
research assistants we're tell you
there's nothing convenient about going
down to UIC from Northwestern 30 times
in the dead of winter so the reason I
work with you I see is twofold one is
that it turns out that it's one of the
most ethnically diverse universities in
the country and so as someone who's
interested in social inequality it's
helpful to work with a population that
has quite a bit of diversity in terms of
students backgrounds and another reason
that I work with this group is that
there's one course they UIC actually is
a course that every first-year has to
take so that's very helpful because I
don't have to buy us towards a course
people happen to sign up for there's a
course I can go into a course where
people have been very kind and generous
to work with me where I can go into we
can go into the classrooms and survey
people in there now just to clarify it's
not one big class it's actually more
than 80 sections so we survey them 20 at
a time so it's still a lot of work and
we did a study back in two thousand
seven with over a thousand of their
first years at that time and then
followed up with over a thousand new
first years in 2009 and then what's also
very exciting is that this past year we
actually followed up with that same
sample so we have longitudinal data for
for about 500 students for what they do
online and their skills okay so as I
said it's a diverse campus and indeed
you can see that from the demographics
of the students who participated in the
study so we have half almost half were
first-generation college students this
is important because so obviously by
going with the first year college cohort
we're controlling on age and education
well you could see that age is pretty
much constant and education obviously
we're controlling for because they're
all first-years at the same school
however and parent education is proxy
for socioeconomic status as is often
used in the literature I just want to
remind you again this is while a diverse
sample it is nonetheless controls on
education controls on H both are related
to internet uses so that's important to
acknowledge but if anything it means
that findings would be conservative when
it comes to a more representative
national sample so that's just something
to keep in mind so is it the wire
generation is it the case that those
assumptions that this generation has
grown up with technology yes we can
confirm that so from the data we see
that they have lots of experiences with
the internet I don't think I have to
dwell on this slide I will add though
that most of them still do use email a
lot there's some losing the academic
community there's some discussion that
today's young adults no longer use email
but I think that's more if they don't
want to you know they don't want you to
reach the middle
but they actually do um okay so when it
comes to understanding some of these
internet related items that i showed you
were part of this measure this is what
the figures look like so again this was
that a survey item that i described that
has all these responses so there's
certain time it turns that lots of
people understand but then others that
people understand much less now what i
try to do is it's an ongoing process for
me to figure out additional ways to
measure skill so i try to come up with
new measures as I field new surveys and
one of the things I did and the 2010
survey was actually used a multiple
choice question for whether people
understand bcc and just to be clear I
didn't care if they knew that it stands
for blind carbon copy that's not the
point the point is do they care do they
understand the function like what does
that actually mean it turns out that a
third of them don't they don't know what
PCC is so all those disastrous situation
sometimes when I'm sure we've all
experienced it CC list that shouldn't
have been CC lists this would be one
source of that so just because an
organization hires a young person
doesn't mean that they know how to use
every aspect of Technology so it's kind
of I often think of some of my data as a
reality check about how to think about
employees and colleagues so then there's
there was a list of what I call more
advanced Internet related terms what
this was really just me deciding what to
call them it's not about they don't have
to be classified in a particular way per
se and again we see that there's a
pretty quick drop in average level of
understanding of some of these terms i
will add that the 2007 measures were
actually quite consistent so there's
very that was obviously a different
cohort but the measures in general for
the averages tend to be very close over
time so it's only in the hundredth
decimal point that it changed over two
years actually and 2 2010 which is the
same group again the measures were quite
consistent so because sometimes people
react and say oh it's my next year they
all know this and no they don't
yes go ahead know that there's not
really that's that's why I'm saying that
it it pretty much stays consistent earth
decimal point level there are a few
things that they're really from 2007 to
2009 there there were just a couple of
things that went up tagging went up
quite a bit and I think that's because
of say Facebook and photo tagging in
particular and social bookmarking has
definitely gone up as browser says not
social bookmarking sorry tabbed browsing
that went up since 2007 are gone I think
because browsers with tabs have really
started to spread but unless there's
that kind of a change that there's this
one technology that's really taking off
you don't see much change in how people
rate their understanding so then as i
said i'm really interested in how
people's backgrounds relate to their
skill and uses so let's look at just
some bivariate relationships so what we
see is that women tend to rate their
skills lower than men and i'm going to
come back to the gender variable more in
the talk because it's actually very
complicated variable that i want to talk
about it a little bit more but this is
this is a statistically significant
difference we see differences by race
ethnicity as to where people are in
terms of their average level of
understanding and we also see it by
parent education again the proxy for
socioeconomic status so taking it all
together what we have is that if you
take the average Hispanic female student
in the group whose parents have less
than a high school education that's her
score and if you take the average male
asian student in the group whose parents
have a graduate degree that's his score
that's a pretty large difference I also
have this later after the talk people
want to see the regression results i
have out to um okay so what's exciting
is that i I've been talking to people
about the importance of measuring skill
that we need to get it on nationally
represented samples and I'm happy to say
that in the in
the fall of two thousand nine when the
Federal Communication Commission fielded
a survey nationally they did include
some of these items on their surveys so
I'm able to end those data are made
public so I'm able to look at okay so we
know what you I see there are these
differences but how does it look
nationally so basically just quickly
looking at their figures so the the
findings i showed you are consistent so
in terms of gender and race that those
data show the same relationships with
the skill measures data I didn't have in
my data set income perhaps not
surprisingly as another measure of
socioeconomic status is positively
related to skill education which as you
will recall in my data set is constant
naturally it's not is also positive
related to skill but what's interesting
is age if you look at just people 50 and
under in that data set is actually not
related to skill so that's one of those
assumptions people have that the younger
the more highly skilled the older the
less skilled over 50 it's true that
there we have decline but 50 and under
there's no clear correlation between
agents go okay so I said that I would
come back to the question of gender and
I want to talk about this just a little
bit more I'll keep coming back to it so
in a paper that i published a few years
ago we showed and this was based on that
study where you saw the where I observed
100 people and doing actual tasks and
one of our findings was that if you
predict people's self-perceived skill
while controlling for actual skill
gender is still significant so that
shows that regardless of their skill
women are raiding their skills lower
than men so that's an issue but one of
the things we concluded is whether it's
actually perceived this might still
influence what people actually end up
doing so we can't completely dismiss it
as oh it's just in their head or it's
just a perception because it might still
influence what women versus men do
online
so it's just something to keep in mind
but again not to assume that there's
something inherent per se about women or
that it's a simple question is actually
quite complicated so I like to show this
slide or this XKCD comic because it
shows again the social factors that
influence how women might be thinking
about their skills versus men that if we
have situations where just women in
general are assumed to be worse that
could influence people how they perceive
their skills like if we draw on the
stereotype threat literature from social
psychology for example ok so now moving
on to what what is it that people
actually do online so just a few slides
on some of the sites that I asked about
on the survey because again there are so
many assumptions that young people do
all these things so these are the three
sites that many of the people in the
sample actually used but what's
interesting is that there are a lot of
sites that are often associated with
younger people that they actually don't
really use at all so I think yet again
it's a bit of a reality check so a
particular comparing Facebook and
MySpace it's been important I think to
highlight that they're quite a bit of
racial ethnic differences and who
selects into using these sites so this
brings us back to a point I made earlier
that you can't rely on one site to draw
conclusions about all people out there
because people select to use these sites
at different rates another reason to be
concerned about something like this if
you're trying to reach the general
population whether it's an ad campaign
or whatnot you should be very careful
not to target just one site because if
you say one to reach Hispanic people as
well then Facebook might not be the best
place to do it and I had already shown
this relationship back in two thousand
seven from the two thousand eight seven
dataset and again it was one of those
things where back then people said oh
this is just timing it'll change very
quickly but 2009 there are still
differences that held up so we can't
just dismiss these these differences as
just a very temporary blip they tend to
persist quite a bit I was also
interesting was when when I publish that
two thousand
peace I tried to get some places to
cover it and The Chronicle of Higher
Education covered it because it was
about students but other places said oh
well you're just talking about this
group of students what's interesting is
that that Nielsen two years later had
more representative data so that got
covered vary widely but in fact they
just confirm my findings from two years
prior so I think it's helpful to know
that this data set is actually quite
generalizable more so than it might seem
at first partly because it's such a nice
leap diverse sample so I thought I'd say
a few words about Twitter in particular
I have some interesting findings there
so you might have noticed that for 2009
the level of useless four percent and
maybe you thought well they're surely a
year makes a difference because 2010 was
really the year it took off so what is
the rate in 2010 well it did go up quite
a bit for sure but let's recognize that
it's still less than a fifth of the
students who are using it to be fair all
I have data on is whether people use it
I don't know if they're using it to
tweet or is it just following people but
it's still interesting now I have a
couple of quotes here from a different
study this was focus groups with
Northwestern seniors actually then again
show that just because you're young you
don't necessarily get it so I think
these are just interesting illustrative
quotes but quantitative back to the
quantitative data so I'm able to draw on
well okay so one of the things that
others have shown as well is that
there's quite a bit of variation in
Twitter use by race and ethnicity where
we have african-americans much more
likely to use it than anybody else so
what might be going on and this is where
longitudinal data actually come in
really handy and so in a paper that I've
written with my student inlet we looked
at the following we looked at outcome
Twitter use in 2010 as predicted by
various factors about you in 2009 so not
surprisingly african-americans are more
likely to tweet yes we've showed that
previously
if we look at skill into that your skill
in 2009 that's positively related to
adopting twitter by 2010 but here's
here's the really interesting thing so
we have data for 2009 about different
topics that you're interested in and it
turns out that this is actually what's
driving adoption so far as getting rid
of the relationship with
african-american so if we put in
information about being interested in
entertainment and celebrity news in 2009
then being black is no longer associated
with being a Twitter adopter so it's
really that it looks like a fan of
americans on average seem to be more
interested in entertainment news than
lights and that's what's driving it this
is the first study I know that has
actually managed to explain some of this
racial ethnic difference in sight
adoption so I'm pretty excited about it
what's also interesting not sure what to
make it is is that if you were
interested in science and research in
2009 you're actually less likely to use
Twitter and 20 ton and I think also
interesting is that interest in
technology and politics are in no way
related to Twitter adoption either I
think especially the one politician
interesting because there's so much
rhetoric about the potential of Twitter
to get people excited about news and
politics and get people participating
but it doesn't look like that's actually
driving why people would adopt it
obviously there's room for more research
here where for example if we had data
more specifics of what are actually
people doing on Twitter right are they
tweeting or do they just following how
are they choosing that would be nice to
have so now what I call participation
gap which is the idea that you're
actually contributing content to the web
yourself so you're making your voices
heard yourself you're potentially
influencing public opinion yourself so
this is one another one of those areas
that's supposed to be really exciting
about the web so here are some questions
that I asked on both the two thousand
nine and ten date surveys but i'll just
be focusing on the nine data but i
checked the numbers and they're they're
very similar 410 so here's some
activities i asked about whether people
engage in them
and here are the numbers so I think it's
helpful to note that none of them are
things that at least half the people do
so again some people engage in them but
not everybody now you might be wondering
how I listed these activities because
they're not obviously they are not in
order of popularity so I'd like you to
take a look at the list and think a
little bit about how I might have picked
this listing because it's not random
there's a reason for this ordering I
wonder if anybody has any thoughts on
that I'm sorry from difficult too easy
or from easy to difficult something like
that so like a difficulty level issue
potentially yes Jen okay that's another
possibility so that you might be
thinking I'm saying yes maybe because
those aren't the right answers but
actually they may be the right answers
it's not how I chose to list them but as
soon as I tell you the reason for this
listing you'll see that it might
actually relate to those factors so I
chose this listing based on the level of
difference by gender in engaging in
these activities so just to clarify the
top activity is probably about Facebook
quizzes right so let's not think about
really complicated quizzes that you're
putting out there for students to take I
mean it's more of those playful things
but what's interesting so creating
quizzes is it seems to be very similar
by gender but then uploading video
there's also quite a bit of difference
and if you go down to a changing or
adding a Wikipedia entry the gender
difference is enormous there so while I
listed this by gender difference it may
be that the those things you mentioned
whether it's difficult to level a reach
or are still related right but it's
interesting to note that ah this is what
we get report
by gender the only thing in the 2009
data said that women reported doing more
than men was changing the privacy on
their Facebook accounts which is
probably not too surprising by 2010 it
turns out that it's so universal that
there's no variation because pretty much
everyone's done it so then I was
interested in seeing whether we see
difference by other factors as well so i
created a summary variable have you
engaged in these how many of these
activities have you engaged in and again
it's a very simple measure right it's
just ever it's like how many times do we
clear anything like that just have you
ever done it and so I think not
surprisingly from the figures i already
showed you there is a significant gender
difference but there's also significant
variation by race and ethnicity in how
many of these things people tend to do
and also variation by parental education
so the proxy for socioeconomic status
and again bringing all those variables
together what you have if you take the
average female hispanic students whose
parents have less than a high school
education she will have done one of
those activities if you take the average
white male whose parents have who have
was parents with a graduate degree he
will have engaged in three of those
activities that's a huge difference on a
on a five scale and again i have the
regressions if anyone's interested so
another paper that i'm not talking about
but is somewhat similar we looked at who
shares content online so there it was
about videos and photos and fiction and
what we found was that men shared more
than women however in a regression model
when we controlled for skill the skill
measure I've been showing you that
gender effect went away so in fact if
you have a man or woman of similar skill
level whether that's actual or perceived
they will share similarly so again I'm
pointing out the importance of that
skill measure I thought I'd show you a
little bit from the 2010 data because
it's more detail about YouTube in
particular and so we see that pretty
much everybody has watched a video on
youtube I think that's helpful partly
just to verify
that the data are all right but again no
the the difference in what it is exactly
that people are doing on YouTube and the
variation especially by gender and again
even in terms of posting a video the
difference among blacks and other
students in the sample so just pointing
out that background seems to matter in
different ways and so to assume sort of
a universal internet for all is is an
incorrect assumption I wanted to say
just a few words about Wikipedia as well
now I'm going to shift a little bit to
talk about some more recent
observational work that we've done
partly on the UIC students but also on
100 northwestern students a couple of
years ago I'll just take another few
minutes I'll wrap up in terms of
understanding Wikipedia there's quite a
bit of variation so this is another
thing where it's we know that students
use Wikipedia but we don't necessarily
know if they really understand it or not
and so it's interesting to note these
quotes that I think signal that people
have different levels of understanding
and again this is one of those things
I'm trying to form into survey questions
so in fact in the 2010 data we have a
question where we try to get at whether
people understand Wikipedia or not and
it was interesting to note that almost a
third believe that there were official
editors responsible for what content is
on there which has implications for how
people understand the content that's on
there and how they approach it on a
survey question again on the 2010 survey
we also asked about more specifically
what people are doing on Wikipedia and
again pretty much everyone goes on there
to read content but huge huge variation
in who's actually editing the material
which again goes back to this issue of
whose voices are really being heard out
there
just finally I had to put this in in
here since I'm giving a talk at Google I
I mean I've I talked about this in other
talks but I focus more on the
information search information seeking
search process but I think this is
another area where their skill issues at
hand so in a paper that we published
last year we looked at how people decide
how to trust the content that they
encounter and traditionally a lot of
work on credibility looks at the site
features and what the layouts like and
who's the source but what we found which
this quote illustrates very succinctly
is that basically Google ranked at
number one of course it's it's
trustworthy so that was interesting to
note because as we know Google doesn't
rate sites per se based on credibility
there all sorts of factors that go into
how Google waste sites and while one
would hope that in that process
credibility comes into play we know of
examples where that's absolutely not the
case that the number one hits are very
problematic so this is our cost for some
concern just finally a few words about
mobile because you might be thinking you
know she hasn't talked about mobile at
all and this is the mobile generation so
it is I mean everyone's very wired when
it comes to owning a cell phone for sure
however again not in every way it turns
out that in 2009 the majority of the
students in this sample had not accessed
the web on their mobile phones and using
regression we were able to show that in
fact it's peep it's the students who
already access the web more anyway who
who have more autonomy who have better
skills who are more likely to have
access to the web on their mobile phones
in the first place so again it's a
concern about whether we're recreating
traditional divides if we just assume
that oh well they're accessing it on
their phones anyway and everyone's doing
it when it's not in fact the case that
everyone's doing that so why is it
helpful to focus on skill I've shown you
that it matters or hopefully you're
convinced by the day
that I've showed you that it matters
well other things matter to have showed
you that user background matters those
are not things that we can really fix or
change not that some of those things
need fixing but we can't you know it's
very hard to change people's level of
education at some level or certainly
their financial status economic status
it's hard to change however school is
something that is much much more likely
for intervention right so that's
something where we could really
intervene to how people get better
skilled obviously there's the other side
of it which is that information should
be supplies to a friend leeway and
whatnot but and there are obviously lots
of lots of progress and innovation being
done there but at the same time people
are using these sites and services we
see how they different understanding
them so I think it's reasonable to
suggest that we try to intervene and
improve people's skills so that's the
component of the story that skill
matters I think we need to be working on
that so one way to do that is to partly
we need more data understanding how
people do these searches and I know
there's obviously work being done here
and I know Dan thinks about that a lot
to another is intervention I think to
see how do what are the way so even if
we agree sure let's try to improve
people's skills we don't really know yet
how what's the optimal way to do that
how do we do that and it is it the same
across population given what I've shown
in terms of how different types of
people use the internet in the first
place maybe we need different
interventions based on type of person
who knows so that's a question that
remains and then another issue which I
haven't really addressed because we
simply lack the data to really get at it
is this final loop back to what are the
real what are the life outcome
implications of these online uses and
here what's important is to look at well
how does your skill and what you do
online relate to all these different
types of outcomes so to wrap up you
might recall that in 2006 time came out
with person of the year as you
because the idea was that everybody was
contributing but hopefully what you'll
take away from this talk is that in fact
it's really just some of you are more
precisely some of us in this room so
let's not think of it as this Universal
happy story that everyone is benefitting
and taking advantage of all this or is
able to and partly that's because they
lack the skill so thank you and I
welcome questions great sure yes mhm so
a question is if I from if I've repeated
this surveys at Northwestern or other
schools to see if these differences
exist and yes so to the extent not at
the same scale we did observations of
over 100 northwestern students at a
similar time when we did observations of
about of over 100 UIC students and we
surveyed those 109 northwestern students
there is slight difference but not huge
difference some of the factors are hard
to track at Northwestern oh for the
reasons I'm well actually I didn't point
out that northwestern is not quite as
diverse at UIC but you could probably
imagine that it is so people don't
students don't differ as much in terms
of their parent education for example so
i can't really look at the predictors
there but in terms of just the core
numbers they're a little bit higher on
average but they still differ quite a
bit so there's still variation did you
have your handle
so the question is when I was showing
the numbers that twenty percent of
students had edited if I thought that
was lower of that was high right so um
right so it is definitely important to
recognize that compared to so first of
all I'd like to point out that it's it's
those numbers are true for the men and
not for the women so channeled white
guys ten young white guys uh that's
simplified but so the story is actually
not that different now obviously more
people are contributing to the content
today than they were 20 years ago for
sure but part of the point of showing
these data is that there's still
difference and who those types of people
are who are contributing and I think and
part of part of the issue here in
pointing out these differences is also
that why things may look better it's
important to remember that there are
these differences because if we just
walk away assuming that it's all great
then we might really be leaving those
people behind like before we knew that
it was just those few people and now if
we assume oh it's everybody and it's not
then that's a really wrong perception of
what's actually going on I don't deny
though that it is more democratic for
sure I just want to make sure that we
remain conscious of the trends that we
see and who is actually contributing and
who isn't
mm-hmm so the question is whether I've
looked at what to what extent anonymity
of anonymous anonymous contributions
might influence well you didn't say that
but that's what I'm assuming you're
asking might influence how to what
extent people are contributing and I
think it's a really great question and
it's something I've thought about
because I do think that some of the
reactions that people get to content is
what may have them contribute more or
less so to speak so I don't know to what
extent people have looked at this for
online content i'll give you an example
from academic research where as far as i
know there's some evidence that shows
for example that when you know the
journal review process peer review you
got lots of critical comments I think
there's research that has shown that
female faculty academics are more likely
when they get a rejection like that to
internalize the critiques and say oh wow
I did poorly I'm not even going to send
this out where is male on average the
male scholar would say oh these
reviewers have no idea what they're
talking about send it out turn around
and so I think this is a relevant
parallel here because it's the it's the
question of how do people perceive
critical comments they get and so the
way I'm linking it back here is let's
say you make a comment on youtube and
people jump on you and say oh you're so
stupid what are you doing or you post a
video and it's all against all negative
comments this would suggest that gender
might predict how you react to it and
then that might influence whether you
come back to do more of this activity so
I mean I don't want to say that that's
what you were suggesting but it seems
like that's one thing that could be
going on here
also do I have data on it sorry right so
the question is do I have data on
whether people are contributing on MC or
not I'm afraid I do not have data on
that I did ask a question I tried so
I've been trying to get at this because
it is something I've been curious about
for the reasons I just mentioned and I
had a question about the extent to which
you've had bad experiences with just
aggressive behavior that kind of stuff
it didn't it didn't really show a lot I
mean they're definitely gender there's
some gender variation there but not a
lot so I haven't quite been able to get
at that I do have however I do have some
data that I haven't looked at closely in
that way yet where I have data on
sharing photos videos writing images
that you created either just privately
or publicly so it's not about whether
you're posting anonymously but it's
about whether you're just saying it with
people presumably you know because
you're doing privately versus publicly
and that could get at that a little bit
as well just haven't looked at it yet
yes what's the best example of the most
diverse input for hmm I think it would
be neat if it oh sorry so the what is
the best example of contributions to a
type of site or service what am i
shooting foreign tour well I guess what
would I like to see I think it would be
great if we didn't see that your
background matters right that that it
didn't matter whether you were female or
male or whether you were hispanic or
white or whether your parents have a
graduate degree or just a high school
degree that regardless of that people
are contributing and it seems that skill
is mediating this so one way to achieve
it is to make sure that people are
better skilled and understand sites
better so one of the thing one of the
ways people sometimes approach is to say
well some people just don't want to
contribute well maybe but my point is
that some people might not know how to
contribute and that's why they're not
doing it yes so the question is whether
I've looked at content creation in terms
of how easy it is to comment or respond
to the comment on or respond to the
content that was created and the example
given was that apparently there there's
some data to show that women create more
complete complete profiles on facebook
I'm not familiar with that research I
don't know if it's about more of a safe
space because on facebook it's again the
people you know so it's what we would
consider a more private space and recall
that the creating quizzes was actually
quite equal between men and women and
again I think that's pretty much
Facebook quizzes so i don't know if it's
about that I but it's an interesting
question although I feel like the the
things we had here I mean on a Wikipedia
sure people someone could erase your
change so that's a way of commenting on
it for sure yeah I'll think about it
more but I think it may partly be
related to the whole private public
nature of it i will say also in a
completely different paper while drawing
on the same data set the 2007 data set
we showed that looking at how people use
social now
or excites differently one of the things
we showed was that men were more likely
to make new connections whereas women
were more likely to engage in activities
that solidified their existing
connections so there are some
differences and again you might say
they're too that your women are
solidifying connections they already
have so there isn't that fear of who
might this be or don't know what this is
where as men perhaps I I don't know if
some of it is fear that we talk about
what may be lurking outside in the
unknown and that then ends up scaring
people away and certainly the way the
rhetoric is framed around those issues
makes it more of a concern I think often
for women just the way we hear about it
so that's something to consider to where
I would again argue that if we have more
skilled people then hopefully they'd be
able to know how they can be safe and
not alter the behavior per se or altered
in a way that still leaves them engaged
no pressure one last question yes
okay so the question is whether I look
at things like experiences with the
internet and interest to explain a
gender variation partly because
historically their stereotypes
associated with who goes into what areas
I saw in the regressions I could always
control for things like number of years
you've been online how much time you
spend online things like that I do and
the gender effect is pretty much robust
to all that I do think that there is
some stereotype issue going on when it
comes to people's women's
self-perceptions right so this issue of
well it's not the technology it's not
woman's domain so they might it's
dessert time for literature that i
mentioned that would also be related to
it i think so this then concerns how we
think about these things i think it's
interesting because often we talk about
the internet there was a very social
space so and not so much as a technology
per se so it's curious that it
translates to this domain i will say as
the last note on that point that a
literature review we did as we rode up
that piece showed that pretty much a
domain that has been surveyed and this
is not necessarily technology-related
women always rate their skills lower
than so that's completely consistent so
there's just an issue going on there
