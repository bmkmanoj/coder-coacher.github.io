engineering director here at Google not
here at Google but in Kirkland in
Seattle and engineering directors at
Google our responsibility is to take
credit for the work of people who are
smarter than than we are and I excel at
this and generally I don't even talk
about those people who I take credit for
their work because they're never in the
audience but today one is and so I just
want to you know kudos to my friend Joel
Han Oski Joel wave everybody besides
being my bodyguard Joel is also works
very hard to see that I get credit for
all of client testing at Google that's
the chrome chrome operating system you
know small things like that and the
other thing I do with my time is I take
credit for people who write cool tools
we call it engineering tools and I have
a couple of teams to do IDE work dev
work that developers consume and I have
another team that does ite work
integrated test environments which are
going to see a little bit today so since
this is a closing I would like to say
this has been a really good experience
the keynotes Bob and Jeff you guys were
awesome I thought it was really really
cool that we had an academic and a
consultant who's I think has made your
customers Microsoft right now come to
this conference it's it was a good
change of pace I think that g'tok is
special if for a lot of reasons but one
reason this is the only conference I
have ever been to in 25 years of going
to conferences okay am I really that old
okay let's say 15 let's call it 15 where
people stay till the end I mean have you
ever been to a conference where you're
at the end of day two and there's
actually more people here than we're
here yesterday I think that I think
that's pretty amazing so CJ the
committee you guys have done a great job
and here's to you
and I have to admit I have to thank the
host country of India because I didn't
actually jump with joy when I found out
T tak was gonna be in India I'm just
gonna be honest I did not know what to
expect my first visit to this country
and I can say now truthfully that I was
not disappointed and and some cool
things have happened these two days you
know we had a demand from our Turkish
embassy for building good tools and it
was the right time to say that bossless
because you've got Microsoft here tool
builders you've got Mozilla tool
builders and you've got Google tool
builders so if we don't listen to you
then try again next year
so I'm here to turn quality on its head
because I've sat here through all of
this politely mind you listen to all
this kind of testability love and and
before I turn that on its head I'd like
to just talk about some common ground
I've got my brother I was a professor
for 10 years I got my chalkboard with me
today a little bit of common ground that
we can all agree on just the fact that
we're all here at a test conference we
are all implicitly agreeing explicitly
agreeing that software just isn't that
good there's bugs in software all
software coding is complicated coding is
error-prone no one gets it right except
Tracy and Russ and and I'm gonna call
you Tracy and Russ because everybody
else calls you Russ and Tracy and I just
want to be different
and so instead really we should just be
trying to you know duplicate Tracy and
Russ as opposed to testing software
because I submit this is an endless
endeavor especially the way you guys
want to do it you guys want to take
something that we all admit is
fundamentally flawed the process of
writing software really complicated
incredibly error-prone because humans
are doing it and stick with me here you
want to solve it by writing more code
interesting so then we're gonna have
another G tack G tack the Google test
automation conference for test
automation because
the test automation rewrites gonna be
buggy this is an infinite regress there
is a fundamental problem with what we're
doing here with the theme of this
conference but let's look at the facts
first let's figure this out let's have a
contest between dev and tests writing
code and testing code and see what we
see what we end up with now at Google
testers are sorely outnumbered some
teams you know four or five to one some
teams ten twelve to one some teams who
knows fifteen twenty it all depends now
how do we get by with this because this
sounds atrocious I know there's a lot of
Microsoft E's in the audience and
somebody had a quote I think it was Jeff
from Bill Gates it said you know we have
a developer for every tester and a
tester for every developer how do we get
by with this at Google we get by with
this by having our developers do lots
and lots of testing in fact the general
rule is that an SE t a software engineer
in test will write a framework but the
test cases for that framework will be
written by the dev team so we have these
huge dev teams and we have these little
bitty test teams but we got the devs
doing a lot of the upfront work right
they're writing unit tests they're doing
TDD they're writing test cases for the
automated frameworks this is a lot of
code that's going into test I call this
early cycle testing on the other hand we
have test engineers and some contractors
who do late cycle testing some scripting
some manual testing but this is when the
product is more mature later in the
cycle so I want to just kind of let's
have a little contest right now it's dev
test nil-nil and let's see where we're
going to invest now I'm not going to say
the winner gets all the money and we got
to stop doing the other that's not what
I'm doing here this is Google we've got
some change in our couch cushions if I'm
gonna make a additional investment in
testing where is it going to be early
cycle or late cycle that's what I want
to talk about
so we all know that you can't test
quality in all right you put lipstick on
the pig it's still a pig the only thing
you can do is turn it into bacon so the
whole idea of you know testing test and
test and test and test and test to pick
your worst product ever pick the product
that you hate the most pick the product
that you cuss the most more testing
ain't gonna help it right refactoring
redevelopment throwing it throwing it
away and starting over you know its
development that fixes problems test
doesn't fix problems so if you want
better software you got to write better
code and this is a development task
one-nil def there's nothing we can do
about this nothing we can do in late
cycle that will really fundamentally
improve a broken product we can find
some bugs but the devs are gonna have to
fix them we can totally prove that it's
crap and it'll just be crap one-nil dev
sorry test now someone else produced a
slide earlier today that showed how much
bug's cost they don't cost hardly
anything if you realize you're right
well as you're riding the bug you
realize it's a bug and you just fix it
right there no cost right there's no bug
report there's no time lost in debugging
there's no rebuilding involved it's free
and as you go I think the number R that
just shocked me was like 500 X right 500
times the cost and late cycle testing
we've done some things to make that
cheaper right we were all looking for
it's funny we were when we were doing
the exercise but we were looking for the
bug on our little badge things I was
sitting next to Ted and Ted's looking at
it online he's right there's no bug
there's no bug this is perfect right the
bug had been fixed but not on the
printed versions right we don't do much
printing of software distributed it that
way anymore we do it in the cloud so the
cost has come down but certainly there's
more cost late cycle nothing you can do
about it two-nil dev because even in the
late
cycle the even if there's no additional
cost you can just fix it really quickly
in the data center and pump it out to
all users for free there's still loss of
reputation there's you know that bug has
to DB be debugged and it could be that
the developer who wrote that bug wrote
it weeks ago and weeks in developer
years is like you know a century they've
forgotten about it right they got to get
it back inside their head lots of time
lots of money to nail dev sorry tests
can't help you this is the thing that
really really makes me mad at testers
they create throwaway stuff they do all
the time you write a test plan how many
of you are right now working on a test
plan that is exact reputation execution
of what you're doing
a representation of what you're doing
and an exact representation of the
product that's being built that's what I
thought I walk around the halls of
Google and I see dead test plans
remember this little boy from The Sixth
Sense all right I see dead people I see
dead test plans they're all dead
it's like a graveyard at Google you
write a test plan why do you write a
test plan because you're told to write a
test plan you're not doing it to solve
any real fundamental issue are you
really planning test strategy in that
test plan
are you really designing all your
automation and figuring out all your
manual test cases really it looks to me
like a Kix document or Word document for
you Sam it looks to me like a document
that describes kind of some touchy-feely
stuff about our products got some stuff
in it and we're gonna do some stuff to
it and here's a big long list of it and
you write these things hoping that
they'll fool people hoping that you can
write it and give it and show it around
to people and people say yeah all right
you wrote the test plan now go off and
start testing and then you go off and
start testing and what happens do you
use the test plan do I walk around and
see testers with two screens we all have
two screens at Google some of
have four right two screens where the
test plans on one and the app your
testings on the other and it's guiding
your every step only in my wildest
dreams I have these dreams and I wake up
in a cold sweat I think it was great if
I could only go back to sleep and
retrieve it people you're writing usable
test plans and using them sorry
three-nil dev test you're down three nil
it's halftime and you're getting your
ass kicked
oh my god I'm starting to agree with you
people now yes let's write a bunch of
test code upfront that's the way to do
it is there any hope for tests they're
creating dead documents they're finding
test it Bub's long after the code is
left the devs had too expensive what are
we gonna do with these people fire them
all now why do I even have hope for late
cycle testing what is it that makes me
think that this is something that we
should do at all that we should invest
in at all because I have directors who I
partner with right I'm the I'm the test
director for Chrome operating system
there's a dev director for Chrome
operating system if I walked up to Linus
Upson and said Linus you got two choices
we can delete all of our automation and
stop doing writing Auto test test cases
or I can fire all my manual testers you
Pig I know in my heart of hearts that he
would fire the automation I know it
because he's told me he would because I
asked him I asked them all they cherish
manual testing the devs you know they're
not proud about this right and Linus is
gonna throw me under the bus with the
ever watches this on YouTube they're not
proud about it when they asked for more
manual testers they whisper don't they
Joel right hey Joel
can he get his ten more manual testers
right and Joel's like hey James guess
what lightest ones and then of course we
like we like to broadcast this out Joel
sending out emails to you know dev all
hey man we're looking for ten more
testers for a lioness they don't like to
admit it but they know in their heart of
hearts there are some very valuable
stuff going on there right
there's recall class bugs being found by
people sitting down using the stuff
people with minds people with fingers
and people with eyes so there's
something there
what is it so this is the way I think
about it I think about software as a
forest I like to hike I go out in the
woods and I think about ideas to write
all my books have started in the woods
now in these woods
the developers grow trees right they
have a slice of the product and there's
nobody on the team that understands that
slice of the product better than the
Deaf right all the way from the UI all
the way down to the bowels of the system
nobody who understands it better than
the Deaf and there's no question that
the person most qualified to test that
code is to death they understand it
better than anybody why would you hire a
tester to test the code that the dev
just wrote stupid devs grow trees now if
I want to make an investment in early
cycle testing maybe I could get the
tester to help water those trees but
this doesn't make any sense
testers don't want to water trees
testers want to chop them down right
this is why I mean we don't hire testers
because they can't write code our
testers can write code we hire testers
because they want to break stuff they
want to write code that breaks stuff
they want to use their fingers to break
stuff this is their passion we don't
want them to help water the trees what I
need them to do is scenarios like this
and I'm gonna score a goal for my tester
here because this is where a developer's
ability to test completely falls down
they're great at watering their own tree
and caring for it but when you start to
put other trees up next to them that
they have to interface
with all the sudden there's a lot of
integration scenarios of the developer
doesn't see that's code they don't
understand over there written by that
other death and you don't want the other
dev tests in it either in fact I don't
even think you want the two devs
together testing it they're just gonna
confuse each other because they don't
want to do that we don't hire devs
because they have a passion for tests we
hire devs because they want to sit at
their desk and write code bless their
hearts I'm glad somebody does this is
what we need testers for the testers are
gonna see these scenarios they're gonna
bring an independent mind independent
thought and they are going to find the
bugs that either of those two devs and
then you add three and four and five and
six and twenty and 115 and it gets more
and more complicated and you need
someone who can see the forest for the
trees three one test three one death
sorry now the devs often build these big
beautiful trees they love their trees
they stand back and they admire their
trees this is a beautiful tree I just
built you built it right in the middle
of a user path right you built it upside
down you built something that a user
can't use you built something that's too
hard to use you built something that's
full of bugs and you can't see them
because you're just admiring the foliage
devs often build the wrong code they
often put it in the wrong place they
often build code that ends up getting
integrated and you find out that there's
really not a great user path through it
devs don't think like users they think
like devs that's why we call them deaths
we need somebody to think like the user
we need somebody that has to look at
this for us and say there's no path that
I like there's a path here that goes
around in a circle there's a path here
that's supposed to go through this bold
or really and then there's a path here
where I just fall off the end of the
earth the world is flat in your forest
so three two tests I'm going to score a
goal four tests for the ability to
think like a user so now I'm beginning
to understand its demand from my dev
directors for manual testers did we have
an equaliser course we're gonna have an
equaliser what is this this is a forest
this is a product that's complete is it
bug free
no it's bug free because it's not bug
free for a number of reasons it's not
bug free because we've got fallible
human beings building it that are
guaranteed to make errors so there will
be latent bugs and there gonna be bugs
in the test code that was trying to find
those bugs so there's gonna be bugs for
that reason too and there's also gonna
be bugs because it's now a complete
forest and complete forests get used in
different ways just ask Steve Jobs
iPhone 4 worked great in the lab and
then you get it in its case and in the
hands of a left-handed fat thumbed user
and it breaks right there are some bugs
that simply don't appear until software
is built and let me show you some just
in case you don't believe me I heard
Alberto wanted to go to England so I was
planning a route for him this is by the
way a walking route was the user was the
user Jesus I don't know but you're gonna
need his help to navigate it this is a
walking route from Cambridge to Hall now
find this with an automated test find
this with the unit test
you can't not until you get the data on
the map and the software installed and
the user selecting a very specific route
can you find this bug you got to have
the forest three three tests that's
right
we have spot a and spot B start/finish
one hundred and fifty yards apart which
Google Maps tells you this is the shore
his path find this with a unit test
testiclees was it testiclees testiclees
testiclees I'm only gonna pronounce
testiclees that way because if I change
it it might not be good test what was it
test about testifiers test a virus okay
find it all right see there are some
bugs he wants me to find code bugs when
the software with it what does his
software is soft and malleable problem
is there are certain bugs that aren't
there until it's hard and brittle and
we've got to be able to find these bugs
because these are the bugs that the user
will see this is why my dev directors
want manual testing this is why my dev
directors want smart human beings doing
doing scripting and manual testing and
other late cycle test engineering go on
automation find the bug see some of them
are even hard for manual testers to find
do you see it do you see it do you see
where it says Arlington National
Cemetery look just above Arlington
National Cemetery it's a restaurant it's
what are they serving catch of the day
cadaver I don't know but it's not nice
to do this you can't find this will
Automation this is a late cycle test
engineering problem and so is this do
you see it let me blow this one up
Copenhagen International Airport is a
bridle way that's a little horse what
are they what are they doing i'm and i'm
assuming denmark is fairly developed
decent infrastructure but they got
horses pulling they're 747s down there
then that down the runway find this
early cycle you can't sometimes it's the
test code itself that really makes a
show this one says an error has occurred
while displaying the error that has
occurred while creating an error
port this is a bug in test code at
Microsoft this is a Microsoft bug was
found while I was an employee of
Microsoft what did we do when we found
this bug
we got t-shirts printed with it on there
so I've got to give test a tie here it's
a draw so what are we gonna do about
this it's three three and I really can't
give another goal to to either dev or
test I've run out we're in extra time
we're in penalty kicks and everybody's
making their penalties somebody's got to
miss what's gonna give so let's think
about it a little bit differently then
if it's a draw let's really put some
thought into where we spend our money
what could we do to just fundamentally
make early cycle test engineering better
I don't know this is a really hard one
we've been talking about it for two days
haven't we and there are some ideas
they're hard ideas every everything
we've talked about is hard you know we
talked about it the very first talk was
about writing test code and there was a
concern from the audience that you've
increased the attack surface of the
application right so you know for every
solution there seems to be another
problem every time we look really hard
at early cycle test engineering and
there's another problem here how many
people are really good at this Tracy and
Russ I can name actually I can name off
the top of my head I can name at least
50 Googlers who really good at this many
of them work for me and Joel you and I
are thinking to the same names aren't we
now the problem with these really ultra
talented people like we've got one on
Chrome OS man he is a absolute Jedi
early cycle test engineer if I asked him
to go work on maps he no no no no no no
dude this is this is me right I live in
the kernel these early cycle tests
engineering skills aren't particularly
transferable they can't really be moved
easily from one project to another so
really hesitant to place that investment
there and then this skills are very dead
like very dev like in the last six
months two of my ICTs software engineers
and tests have converted to SWE's
software engineers right from test
developers to feature developers I six
more in my in my tree of whatever how
many ever 8090 people in my mic tree who
are going through the process now so
it's the very skills that we need for
early cycle test engineering lead people
into feature development and that's not
a bad thing in fact I think it's a good
thing I encourage it but right now that
man this is being recorded this is so
hard I'm gonna say it in here open
kimono right now the best dev in my org
is a Swee that was a tester before he
was a tester for 12 years he's been a
suite for three best dev New York all
all this we say the same thing right
he writes code a little slower than
everybody else but people just breezes
through the code review process
hardly any regressions never breaks the
build his stuff just works so this is
something we want to encourage
I love test skills moving to dev far
more than I love devs gills moving to
tests
I'm always hesitant when a suite wants
to become an S et you got really want to
do it you really got to tell me you're
you have a passion for breaking things
so I'm worried about this not only are
these people that can do this very rare
they tend to move into dev I'm not so
sure about an investment there so let's
think about the other half what's the
other half
well hire more manual testers get 20,000
people from from Mozilla's and you tests
crowd to help us do this I mean I do
like that I like the fact that we've got
a solution for this numbers game now
with price
outsourcing this makes me quite happy
and I'm gonna talk about about it in a
few minutes but this isn't enough
something technological has to happen
manual testers are expensive and they're
really not useful through the entire
process until that code gets sort of
hard and brittle there's there's just a
lot of prep work for them to do there's
not a lot of value to be added we really
need to be flexible with how we use
these move these resources these late
cycle test engineering resources around
our various products so this is a
problem how do we solve this problem if
I had a solution for that if I could
take a tester and make them sort of
hyper productive somehow right that that
little helmet that that Anakin Skywalker
wears in the Phantom Menace you know
driving little pods around I had one of
those helmets and I could just put on
and a head you know like heads-up
displays inside and just turning them
into a Jedi that would be cool but if I
don't have that tool I'm not sure I can
place an investment in late cycle
testing either so what do we do we
either give up stop having G tack and
all these other silly nonsense
conferences and just realize we're going
to be producing crappy software for
decades users are already used to it
anyhow right I mean really are you
surprised when something breaks no I
expect it to I'm thinking why I've been
using the software for five whole
minutes this is great well I am gonna
make an investment I am gonna put that
helmet on that tester and I'm gonna see
if this works
data is still coming in but I want to
show you how I'm making my investment
how I'm spending Google's hard-earned
dollars on this problem I'm gonna put
the helmet on my tester and I'm gonna
turn my tester into a bunch of testers
I'm gonna turn a single good tester into
a really hyper productive good tester
that's what I want to do notice I'm not
promising to turn a mediocre tester into
a good tester I'm gonna take a good
tester which I believe is a plentiful
resource and turn them into a high
productive tester and here's how I'm
gonna do it first of all I'm not going
to ask him to do stuff throw away work
no more dead test plans no more debts in
fact I'm not even a write test plans
test plans pissed me off
instead I'm gonna do test planning but
I'm not gonna write a test plan I'm not
gonna write test cases I'm gonna do
testing in fact I'm gonna try my best to
write the minimal amount of artifacts I
can in fact what I'd really like to do
is just start in the middle start
testing and have the artifacts be
documented while I go I'd love to do
that but that's version 2 version 1
requires some upfront work and I'm gonna
show you what that upfront work is now
for this to really be effective I need
to solve the problem for all late cycle
test engineering not just manual testing
of a person sitting at their desk so
I've got my tester and what I'd like to
be able to do is I'd like to sign a
number to that tester right we completed
X number of of testing you know we took
it from a hundred percent undone down to
90 percent undone and then I'd like to
give it to the crowd and have them not
just start testing but continue testing
to be able to pick up where the internal
testers left off so that when you say
alright how much of this problem is we
solve you know the number goes down now
we're down to 60% left to do and then
give it to the dog food errs to continue
testing not to just start it all over
again I mean come on you guys have all
run dog food programs what happens every
single bug you've got in your bug
database that's what you spend the first
two weeks re-finding just a bunch of bug
duplicates a lot of noise and a bunch of
developers taken offline to have to do
this stuff and then finally to beta
and the beta's should again be edited
continuation wouldn't be nice of all
this test infrastructure is attached to
the beta and we can still continue to
monitor coverage and we can still
continue to monitor new paths that have
been that have been hit new test cases
that have been quote-unquote written all
right so this is where I want to place
my investment and if it pays off I got
something if it doesn't then I'm gonna
go back to my 3-3 draw and think it
through again are you with me all right
so let's see what we're gonna do about
this we need a way to think about
software if we're not going to do a
write a test plan we need a way to do
test planning and so here's our process
we have a three-step process
adjectives and adverbs are first
followed by nouns followed by verbs
we're going to describe our system in
those three terms we're going to
discover all the ways that you can talk
about our system with an adjective or an
adverb and we're gonna call those things
attributes just like a human body has
attributes a human body is responsive
alive intelligent now let me just give
you a little peek ahead at what I'm
trying to do I want to be able to attach
tests that test for these attributes
just like you have with a human being we
have test for a responsive human being
is the patient responsive well let's see
right we do the little reflex test here
we've got the little light test on the
pupils to see if they're dilating
properly we can take a pulse we have
tests to see if those attributes are
there so attributes are first second are
the nouns the parts of the body if you
will to hand the brain the arm the
things that make the attributes come
alive what are the attributes of
software well they're the components I'm
sorry what are the downs of software the
nouns of software the components so now
we've got attributes that describe our
system components that define our system
and we're left with the verbs the
actions what is our software do we call
these capabilities so we end up with a
CC attribute component capabilities
we should be able to test that
capabilities are correct and that the
collection of capabilities that make up
a component are correct and that they
describe the attribute would it be
horrible if you had something like
chrome with an attribute of fast right
when you think of chrome you think of
speed wouldn't it be horrible if you
went into Joel Heine skis test team and
asked the testers all right Chrome's
supposed to be fast right
show me the test cases that indicate
that that's either true or false that
should happen we should be able to do it
so let's show you how we do this it's a
product that we have that where the code
name is testify I'm still I don't do
live demos anymore because I've been
burned by a 2-month so these are screen
snaps I scrape before we change the same
turned out testifies is trademarked by
some legal organization I mean this is
definitely not a trademark you want to
break it's gonna be called Google test
analytics step number one tell your work
tell the world about your product I want
this is Google every product needs to be
if I can look at the source code of any
of my other teams I should be able to
look at the test cases of any of my
other teams so the first thing to do is
define your project and it's world
readable by default everybody can look
at your test cases so let's say we have
two related products you know apps have
lots of related web applications one web
app could actually copy the test cases
of another web app wouldn't that be nice
second step are the attributes this is a
a small sample of the attributes for
chrome operating system it has about 14
total and they're listed on it on
another screen and we come up with these
on our own we figure these out right how
do we figure out the attributes the best
way to figure out the attributes is to
watch a dev manager or a test manager or
a sales person demo the product and
write down all the adverbs that they say
this takes minutes now for each
attribute we attach components which
components
make it fast which components make it
secure and we write all these down now
some of these are actually automatically
available so we have my bug databases
and other places within the databases
existing within Google that we can just
pull these from and Auto populate this
we're not doing that auto population yet
what we want to do this manually to see
how painful it is but it is possible and
for Chrome OS there's I don't know 20 or
so of these and the third is to add
capabilities right
what does software do write them all
down now when I first started telling
people I want to do this I want to write
down all the capabilities of your
application every single one right
there's too many we can't we can't do
this it's gonna take too long and so I'm
in charge and so they did it anyhow
it's what a wonderful thing that is and
we ended up with 304 for Chrome
operating system because you know a
capability like play Flash content is
pretty broad so I'm not asking you to
boil the ocean here I'm asking you to
come up with statements about what this
software does and then we're gonna test
them all or as many of them as we can
and in many different ways as we can and
we're gonna know how many test cases
played Flash content and which component
that's in and which attribute it
describes and we've created all those
when we went to the dev team and said
they're 304 they were aghast
so they reviewed it with us and turns
out we were wrong or like what 314 I
think and then they believed us now we
end up with the numbers here and this is
just a small section of it while it was
still I scraped all these out while it
was still in development next thing we
do is we prioritize these so we've got
314 capabilities which ones are more
important now coming up with risk
numbers is really not scientific how do
you do it what are the most risky parts
well certainly any capability that
kept it from performing one of its key
attributes they would be really
high-risk so if you have a capability
that has to be fast that's got to have a
high risk number if you have a
capability that has to be secured right
like you know Chrome operating system
the capability would be that we timeout
after after inactivity all right if
that's broken that's really high risk so
we just guessed what is this aziz rule
from from goosenecks
if you don't know the answer take a
guess - a bunch of experts and they'll
tell you you're wrong but if you go to
them and ask them for the answer they'll
say I don't know so we guess we come up
with a bunch of risk numbers and then we
take them to the devs and say hey this
is the order in which we're going to
test your stuff and they get real
interested all of a sudden because devs
have a different view of risk than we do
if you ask a single dev they're gonna
tell you the stuff I worked on is the
riskiest part please test it the most if
you ask a sales guy what's the riskiest
part they're gonna tell you the part
that I have to demo to customers is the
riskiest part please test that the most
so we don't know how to do this so we
gasses testers and that guess forces the
hands of all of our partners and we put
in numbers and we average them and we
get something something hopefully is
better than nothing and we won't know if
we're wrong for many many months we've
got to do this project after project
after project after project we need to
do this so eventually will understand
okay we were wrong and we were wrong
this way and we can fix this so maybe in
March if I give another talk I will have
some data about that so those are the
risks and I just color-coded them red
yellow green so here's how it all stacks
up this is a visualization that the tool
provides this is basically for all of
the and this is I think this is all the
attributes that we have or all the no no
no this is a subset of the components
this will show you the basically the
test volume of each of those components
this is how meant how much testing
to be done the number of capabilities
that need to be tested per component so
now you can do a little resource
planning and figure out okay this is
gonna need more testers than this and
you can you can do some preparation this
is the part of the application that
requires testing and so the mountains
require more testing than the valleys if
you don't like to look at it that way
you can flip it upside down and you can
think of pouring test cases into these
holes until they're full or you can look
at it this way as a spiral where the
highest grist is the center of the graph
lowest risk is the outside of the graph
and you can see which of these circles
you have how many test cases does it
take to push one of these circle from
the inside to the outside if you want to
know what one of the circles is you can
click on it and it'll tell you which
capabilities how many test cases are
associated with it
etc you can also pivot on smaller number
of points if you're only interested in a
few of the attributes or a few of the
components and those arrows indicate the
direction that you want to go so these
are time-lapse arrows this is where we
started we did some testing and this is
where we are now our risk is going down
you with me okay so this is a setup this
is what we want to do this is what I'm
investing in I think this is a good idea
I end up with an application called test
Google test analytics that contains all
of my test planning information there's
no test plans in there but everything I
need to test is described in this tool
and I can maintain it see what we need
to do the devs have a huge advantage
they have no choice they cannot have
dead code the code is always alive the
code is always up-to-date in tests we
have this ability to just let our stuff
die because really the codes the only
thing we ship I'd like us to maintain
this I'd like to make it as easy as
possible I'd like to automate as much of
it as possible
I'd like to drag a lot of this stuff in
from the environment if I can we're
working on it but this is compelling to
me
is working for me now how do I go about
testing the thing that once I figured
this out and we started doing it and it
started working and on client and
YouTube and some of the other places
within Google that are using it it
became clear that we still weren't
really helping testers be better we were
just helping them be more organized so
that's the second part of this how do we
help testers be better and do a better
job of testing how do we take that good
tester and amplify their effort and
amplify their productivity so I take an
inspiration from gaming here because I
think the gaming world has it right if
you think about what does a tester have
to do a tester there's a lot of
information a tester has to consume
while they're testing there's a bug
database there's a source database
there's a source code review database
that testers check all the time to see
if these things are actually worth
testing there's there's there's test
automation there's test case databases
right test case management systems
there's all of this information that a
tester has to run around and figure out
you know how much time that I started
just actually started asking every
single tester in my org how much time do
you actually spend fingers on the
keyboard testing or fingers on the
keyboard writing a script that will test
writing test cases whether they're
automated scripted or manual how much
time do you actually spend doing that I
asked after I got to the fifth person I
was so depressed I decided I was going
to cut my survey short my boss likes
data like that data like that depresses
me it was clear to me that testers
aren't spending enough time actually
testing software they're spending a lot
of time doing all this other stuff just
stopping testing turning around going
through and finding your bug report
writing the bug report making sure the
bug reports really good really accurate
what version of am i running what
operating system do I have what version
browser this takes time chances are
you've just produced a bug report that
someone else has another bug report for
because we've got 18 duplicates in our
bug
bass for this not only has it's taken a
lot of time it's all been a waste of
time so what can we do for that
gamers got it all figured out for me I
didn't even have to invent this one what
what what if the gamers do do gamers
spend a lot of time trying to figure
stuff out do they do they have to read
the game user manual to figure it out
no all that stuff's displayed for them
it's called a heads-up display there's a
game or you know you're in Halo and
you're going through do you have to
figure out what weapons you have in
storage if you're you're in World of
Warcraft and you're a wizard do you have
to figure out oh let's see do I have
fireball or was that magic missile I
don't remember pause the game and go
check no it's all there on your heads-up
display every spell every weapon every
capability there's a mini-map in the
upper right hand corner to tell you
where you are there's all of this help
you can hover over an enemy to see what
their health and power is so you know
whether to attack them or not that's
what I want I want you to spend the
gamers spend all their time gaming and
the testers are running around looking
at all this other stuff so now I want to
take the bug database and I want to
surface it on the screen and a heads-up
display I want to take the source code
and I want to be able to surface at any
time you see it I want to take every
single piece of information that takes
you away from testing your application
and I want to overlay it just like this
heads-up display that's what I want if I
could do that I think it would be very
impactful now there's one thing that
gamers do there's one thing that they
have to look at there's one thing that
stops the gamer in their tracks and I
know this because I have a 13 year old
son Xbox is upstairs
he'll come whipping down the stairs
flick on the Mac and start looking for
game cheese so I gotta figure out how to
play this level right and there's two
things he's looking for he goes to
YouTube to look for videos of other
people who've beat the level and he
could just watch him he's like oh that's
how you beat that Hobgoblin right they
don't turn off the Mac yes son and then
he's up there and I don't you know I
could tell him
it's actually all internet-enabled up
there you could but I just kind of like
you to get the exercise so now you don't
even have to do that you got the cheats
I hope you can see this well I've got
another one but the upper left-hand
corner is a look ahead radar it's a
cheat right and it's in the same vein as
everything else it's pulling information
except this time from the game illegally
because all that information is cached
on your xbox so it pulls it out right
see the little red squares those are bad
guys waiting to be spawned as soon as
you go in those rooms because it's all
cached right on your on your in your
memory waiting right and so you can do
some really cool things the blue the
blue or shields around people on my team
so I don't accidentally shoot them the
red are bad guys this is a hack we did
was a Microsoft employee was live on an
Xbox for a while we were trying to
figure it out so what we did instead of
instead of trying to figure out how
people were cheating us we just wrote
better cheats than them and then figured
out how to stop those right so wipe
debug their cheats will wheat when it
was really fun to write our own and my
son was a tester on this the day I came
home and said I'm I've left Microsoft
and going to Google the poor little lad
cried what about my xbox cheats it's a
simple world when you're that young
right so this is so can I get this too
right can I can I can I cheat can I make
myself more powerful than just a regular
user by surfacing information from the
application itself
there's cheats all over the place right
this is such a useful common thing that
it's implemented in almost every game
you get right heads up displays and
cheats so maybe we can learn something
from these video game guys maybe there's
something here there's something to this
alright are you with me I mean is this
worth investing in is it worth pursuing
or should we just stop right now and
call it a draw proceed okay thank you so
so let's proceed whoa
so here it is not quite as sexy as the
videogame but I'm testing Chrome
extensions gallery and that's my app the
heads-up display is in the upper right
hand corner and you'll see it's got
journal bugs flux which I'll talk about
in a minute and a map the map will will
crawls the code and builds a map of your
application for you it knows about the
components Maps those components to the
components in the ACC all as well the
journal is your log right it's your
mission log you're gonna do some testing
and we're gonna record it
this is another thing that really maybe
maybe I should have taken take a goal
away from the testers because this
pisses me off too we just got through
review cycle right Allen and I were
sitting around having a beer last night
and complaining about this very scenario
right how do you judge a tester this is
what we were trying to figure out over
beers and and he's like you know what do
I have I don't know I don't know a lot
of these people I don't know their work
all I can do is sort of look at what
code they wrote and look at what bugs
they found and it's very unsatisfying to
judge somebody on that this person may
have written you know a thousand really
good test cases that validated really
complex scenarios and showed that
there's no bugs in them really valuable
work but all we've got credit for is the
bug I hate this so I want to be able to
take credit for those thousand really
good scenario so I'm gonna record
everything you know I'll show you a
little bit of what we record later so
that not only can we reuse these test
cases we can take credit for them as
well so what I'm gonna do here you see
in the heads-up display hopefully it's
big enough
I'll just interpret for you it says
you're gonna perform a bad neighborhood
tour so this is part of the cheating
just like my son goes down to YouTube
and watches someone else better than him
try to finish a level and then learn
from that and go upstairs to the Xbox
and do it himself we've done the same
thing we've taken test wisdom we call
these things tours it's in the fourth
book exploratory software testing damn I
just approved approved Albert all right
I'm here to sell
egad its wisdom that we've learned over
the ages right so the bad neighborhood
tour is two piece of wisdom that says
run the bugs tend to hang out together
if you found one bug in a component
there's probably another one right we've
known this for decades we don't know why
but it's very wise to test there and so
we do so bad neighborhood tour goes
through and says oK we've got all these
components extensions most recent search
results most popular etc and there's
three of them that are marked red
meaning they have had the most bugs and
they have outstanding bugs right now and
so all you do is click on extensions and
you're taken to the extension so you
don't have to navigate there the tool
will take you there it already has
figured out the structure of this
application and now you click that and
it takes you there and you see that
there are three bugs here two red bugs
and one yellow bug you also see those
bugs are overlaid they have a little
little cellophane and overlay to them
the red bugs are bugs that have been
filed but the dev hasn't fixed them yet
how do we know that because I told you
we just drew all this information out of
the bug database we are totally aware
completely aware of every bug against
this app in the bug database and we show
you where they are so now if you look at
all those red ones you think well
there's already been a bug filed there
certainly you're not gonna file that bug
again because you can hover over that
and you can get information about that
bug so if you have found another bug
there you can you can make sure it's
it's been distinguished the yellow one
you might want to go ahead and validate
that that means it's been filed it's
been fixed a fix has been checked in
it's in the build ready to test there's
no test cases that have run through that
area yet and so you could do that or you
could file another bug some stuff we
stole from feedback say you find it
found a bug there you've got these
little crosshairs and you identify it
you click on it and say okay I want to
file a bug now the tool pulls up the
information about that control to help
you identify it this is the control is
that the bug you want to you want to
file a bug against this control yes I do
okay now you can do two things here you
can type in information about
bug or you can let the tool do it and
the tool will knows where it's been and
knows how it's got there it's recorded
everything you do it'll it'll be happy
to put that in there in either English
or JavaScript
now you can may have some choices you've
got a video recording that we've been
doing in the background you want to
attach that yes or no screenshots of
everywhere you've been from the time you
started the application to the time you
found this bug help for it to help for
debugging a flux log that's a JavaScript
recording of everything you've done so
you can actually replay it the developer
can just click the link in the in the
bug bug report and have it replayed for
them automatically and then a Dom dump
it turns out the the series of changes
to the Dom we're quite interested in
this the series of changes it to the Dom
is a lot is the way that a lot of
developers debug web apps they look at
the Dom they look at what happened to
the Dom as they run this test case they
you so we're trying to figure out maybe
there's some patterns there that we can
just file bugs automatically when we see
those those patterns occur so that's a
little 20% project that me and one of
our guys are working on so now we've
done that it automatically detects what
versions of all the relevant software
that you're doing so you don't have to
guess yes users do enter this wrong and
the bug has been filed immediately it's
already in the bug database and we've
turned that control red to let other
testers know all testers are gonna see
this same same heads-up display when
they're when they're testing the app and
then the journal will tell you what
you've done where you've been how long
you've done it and all that stuff is
stored so it can you to be replayed or
you can take credit for it and then you
can go back to your map and you can
click on some something else and
continue on your merry way you with me
there are a few other capabilities of
this tour of this tool there's a bunch
of tours that we've implemented you the
tours are basically collections of test
cases of similar form and they'll
they'll guide you through it
the journal there and then you've seen
some of those there's
if you hover over those squares you get
information about the bugs you can click
and get more information if you'd like
and then you there's there's there's a
historical record of the testing that
you've done on this application this is
what the scripts look like this is a
we've done a bunch of JavaScript
recordings of common YouTube scenarios
and we play them against every build
some of them break because UI changes we
throw them away rerecord them somebody's
building a tool now where it will it
will it will play the script until it
breaks and then it'll give you a little
editor and you can try to fix it or you
can just go over and start the script
from there so you don't have to repair
at all or we record it and as good of
English as we can figure out we're
associating these these Java scripts
with more English oriented versions of
it that's what we're going to do that's
what we're doing this tool has been the
current form of this tool is that we
have it we're dogfooding it with I think
we're up to about eight projects now and
you test has it and you test has done
one project what we did with you test is
we gave it to ten testers we hired 20
testers from the crowd to test the same
thing ten with the HUD ten without the
HUD and we're still collecting the data
to see to see how we've how we've done
so now if this works if this is a worthy
investment
then we've got four three tests and
we're gonna have to have people do this
so how do we get people to do this
well we're committing to open sourcing
this open source and as much of it as we
can you realize that as an internal
Googler I've got access to
infrastructure that is very hard to
export so to the extent that we can open
source this we will write the for Soph
right now it runs as a Chrome extension
and the chromium project is completely
open-source
so as long as you're testing within
chrome and using those bug databases etc
you're totally fine
my new friend Matt from Mozilla and I
spent two spent a day together at the
fort and we have a gentleman's agreement
to share a source and figure out how we
can get this in Firefox and my old
friend Sam from Microsoft is we have a
gentleman's agreement to get Internet
Explorer to look hard at this too so
that the three browsers can share source
code and try to get this implementation
in all three so we're very near to the
point where we're going to announce this
and give it out to two others so stay
tuned the Google testing blog Google
testing blog spot.com is when is when
and where where where we will announce
it when we will announce it hopefully
before the end of this year okay so if
we succeed here what we've done is we've
got a tool that stores the record of our
testing now what I want to do with this
tool is I want it to maintain itself
through manual testing inside of Google
or in your company and then when we hire
the mozilla x' and you test crowds or
Satyam crowds or whoever else is doing
crowdsourcing it would continue on right
the tool would understand okay there's
more testing going on this is a
cumulative effort same thing with the
dog food errs I would like my dog food
or to see those little overlays to know
where the bugs work so they don't bug me
with new ones finally into beta and then
the HUD can be can be stripped by simply
taking away the Chrome extension it's
that simple not introducing any new code
into the app at all if I can do all that
I think we really do have a situation
where we've got four three tests and
this will be a worthwhile investment so
if you're interested in this follow our
progress we're going to start blogging
about our experiences using this tool on
Google testing blog spot.com we're gonna
be really open and honest about the
parts that don't work and that we throw
away we're gonna be really open and
honest about the researching and cool
stuff we want to do maybe you can help
and
we're going to release it as soon as we
think it will do more good than harm and
that's it I hope I have succeeded in
turning quality on its head and now I
know everybody's expecting some
statement about Alberto this is my wish
my wish is that next year at G tach
he gets invited to do a keynote and I
get invited to do a video that is my
wish
I'm James Whittaker I'm from Google and
I'm done thank you
questions please that I can answer
preferably yep thank you James that was
a fantastic talk and that's why I'm
standing up I like it already okay whoo
anybody else have a question
so is it Fame yeah it's you so three
things that I noticed in your
presentation first thing was ripping
test plan agreed that you said
empowering the testers to be hyper
productive and providing them some sort
of helmet I think testify was that
helmet testified as far as I understood
is again planning around risk and that
will take same amount of time as
creating a test plan document or our
document isn't it the same thing is
running around there is will that time
tester will not spend time on testing he
will be planning around risk will be
providing some numbers to test scenarios
at whatever level we find comfortable
with so is testify
early life cycle tool or late lifecycle
tool or is it throughout the product
life cycle tool first thing second thing
isn't it a new short of s planning with
the testify okay so so testifies our
internal code name we're gonna be
calling this Google test analytics now
so the first question is is good is this
a late cycle or early cycle testing so
here's how we do it now so on Chrome OS
we've actually been using this in the
early stages when
according to Alberto this the software
is still soft and malleable and it's
hard right because it's difficult to
keep it up-to-date it's the same exact
problem as people have with test plans
I'll be perfectly honest with you
however it really gives you a running
start to the point where the software
does begin to dry out and become crispy
and you know so for example a lot of my
products and client will get to a part
where complete code freeze so if I wait
until a code freeze to start doing this
I've waited too long so I need to be
test planning and executing while the
software is still soft and malleable but
at the point at code freeze I want my
ACC to be complete and I want to just go
all out Sprint's on on doing testing so
so we use it through the whole process
you know it's most useful late cycle I
used to call this talk late cycle
engineering until I turn it changed it
to attorney quality on its head so so I
see it I see it as both hey my Turkish
friend what's up dude
well you go a bug I got a bug yeah I
come from the only country that works
like an American event investment bank
and that's not tanki you work in Turkey
there was a turkey in there somewhere
was it in here but it's not me okay you
like Greek friends you owe me a t-shirt
and never piss off a Greek I will send
you a t-shirt you want this one
thanks for that correction so uh with
this tool have you observed like the
Heisenberg the fact that just because
you're monitoring so many things that in
itself creates more issue especially
performance related wow I don't even
think I can spell that your performance
isn't an issue with the tool it's it's
lightning fast it runs as a Chrome
extension and it does a lot of stuff in
the background in advance so that you
know while you're running test cases we
haven't noticed a lot of a lot of
latency and in general you'll be in one
area right like when you're in the bugs
tab we're really only interested in in
the chromium.org bug database at that
point so it has not been a problem in
our trials as of yet you know YouTube's
probably been the well I mean all the
client stuff is way further but but
YouTube has been there's a lot of test
cases there and you know we throw the
ones away that break we record new ones
easily the recording process is really
fast so we haven't noticed a big problem
but we are watching for it hey James hey
I'm over there oh hello Markus hey so I
have a question about this whole forest
route tracing in the beginning I
actually think the examples you brought
with the Google Maps are for me a
classical example that should have been
found by a small test in the development
cycle but but that's a different point
the the point is I see that we need to
test and I know that we need to have
make a huge effort but I think the real
effort should go into getting our
products to a lever but actually don't
need testing anymore at all so I'm
thinking of I'm building a house which
is an engineering feat just like writing
Google Maps but nobody afterwards comes
with some complicated equipment to test
the house there are no house testing
conferences how do you think we can
actually get rid of the need of testing
in first place
so I would first of all argue that
building a house and writing software
are two completely different things
building a house is way easier
Boris Weiser wrote a famous and I think
brilliant paper many years ago about
arguing that software engineering is
harder than anything right even putting
the space shuttle in the air and he
makes very convincing argument for it so
but houses break all the time man I
built four of them and and it's in a
constant state of broke so so I don't
think argue your analogy but you know
people have been trying I mean really
smart people have been trying
Harlan Mills cleanroom software
engineering back in 1984 right that was
probably the the heart the best attempt
the reason he called a cleanroom right
clean room you design hardware in a
clean room where bugs never exist you
know the only bug free software will be
software that never has a bug to begin
with this is a really hard problem we've
been working on it for a really long
time I don't see us making a lot of
progress so maybe this is a stopgap
maybe there's some future in which we
don't have testing conferences anymore
but I don't think I'll live to see it
okay let me let me put it different so
we've seen basically two kinds of talks
to today and yesterday we've seen half
of the talks telling us how to make
software better and half of the talks
telling us how to test software better
now you're in a position where you
actually allocating resources to one of
the two things how do you think is the
right trade-off I think the right
trade-off is the status quo on building
software better because I tried to make
the argument that progress there is
going to be limited because of the
number of people they're capable of
doing it Tracy and Russ and that there
is a lot of benefit to be gained in late
cycle testing because I I disagree with
you those Maps bugs require data to be
found right and that data changes on a
monthly basis they're sucked into the
maps constantly so there there are a
certain number of number of bugs that
will be introduced
after the software is built by
definition so so I and we're gonna be
talking to be having tests conferences
for probably decades certainly decades
probably centuries in fact I'm not sure
it'll ever be solved humans are fallible
man the equation James this is your new
test buddy right hey my hand good old
madman you take some good pictures Oh
glad you like them
how does this tool handle like a session
or is there a pause and resume on this
tool so that it you know you can just go
home and and and resume later when you
come back to the next day so so a
session meaning a contiguous part where
you're just testing I mean it's like
there is no pause you know it just you
can just pick up completely just like a
video game you stop playing you pick up
you can either run a new mission you
know save your old mission run a new one
or you can continue where you left off
now hopefully you know you're doing this
as teams that we liked it the funnest
part about the HUD particularly the
heads-up display is doing this in teams
and watching you know four or five
testers working on machines and having
this stuff updated updated in real time
it's actually it's actually pretty cool
so so in that in that sense once
somebody leaves the missions over just
like an Xbox game somebody's got some
kids got to go to go to bed you know the
game is over because you guys lost a
player great thanks James the state I'm
glad you all raise your hands because it
seems like someone from above is talking
to me okay so my question is around the
known adjective and adverb technique so
beyond that they've also some research
done called extensions to known work
techniques which which gives us
questions and then to organize those
questions in the form of shareable test
ideas across teams and organizations
there was something called questioning
patterns cue patterns which is a which
is patented by people Koecher yeah cue
parents there is go question matrix I
mean there's lots of stuff out there
yeah so are they similar measures taken
at Google to share test ideas by
stripping of the domain part of that
making them generate and then sharing
across teams what kind of initiative so
you take this well for us within my
teams so you know this is all pretty new
stuff and sharing this you know every
single test director of peer of mine is
is ready to use this but they want to
see it work right so we're all we're all
kind of starting starting small tours
are really our mechanism for sharing
test wisdom we don't call them patterns
we call them tours because that's what I
call them in the book it seemed to make
sense right you're visiting a city and
you want to make good progress and and
that's how you organize your thoughts we
could have called them missions Iying
missions it's kind of cool it's more
military but we you know we try to group
it in something that makes sense so so
here's how I knew you know back when I
worked at Microsoft I was walking down
the hall and there are two people around
a corner and they were talking about the
landmark tour and I thought hey that's
cool I invented the landmark tour here
are two people I'm gonna walk right in
between them you know just kind of
sashay in between them and they're gonna
go oh wow there's the creator and I walk
I sashayed in between them and they just
kind of stepped aside and looked at me
like I was rude and then continued to
talk about the landmark tour apply to
Visual Studio they didn't even know who
I was that was really to me I walked
away with a big smile on my face because
I thought I've succeeded right we taken
this out and it's and it's sort of
virally gone gone through the through
the company Microsoft has tours now in
their in their in their course where
that Alan page runs for for the on
behalf of the debts and the company so
so that that's kind of the the idea
right is to because the tours do make
sense the landmark tour once you learn
it you can tell a tester run the
landmark to her and they will know the
exact set of test cases to run no matter
what the application is so it's a way to
talk about testing and it's in my fourth
book
the root cause you cited was at the
beginning was code code is complexity
and we hired devs to write code and
testers to write more code if the
problem is code perhaps an alternative
solution is to hire people who's
explicit job it is to delete code and to
into clean code up and reduce company
you sound like Simon Stewart have you uh
Simon's on the way over in the airplane
he comes over to me and he sits down and
he says I want to talk to you about
deleting code right I want to figure out
a system where we can pay people to just
rip code out of Google three the stuff
right and and you know so it's this big
grand idea and it's a great idea I'd
love to do it I think we ought to use
our milk our pure bonus system for this
right you don't get you don't get paid
for writing code you get paid for
deleting code I love it Simon let's do
it
okay thanks but really the problem gets
back to complexity I mean Marcus's idea
that we can we can build this is
wonderful
but software is hard and human beings
fallible human beings are doing it and
we continue to do the same stupid things
you know I've worked for a lot of
companies as a consultant as a full-time
employee I see the same stupid things in
the halls of all these companies until
we get to the point where we stop doing
those stupid things we're gonna continue
to be talking about about this and even
then it's still hard and we're still
fallible human beings so I mean we
either we either start you know
collecting DNA from Tracy and Russ or we
continue to struggle but I'll tell you
what Marcus you figure it out turn it
into homebuilding I'm buying you I'm not
only buying you a beer I'm buying you a
keg James here James this neck oh I see
I see a bright light in him yes sir so
you mentioned that you know you are
making this helmet for a smart smart
tester right what if it becomes overhead
right you know so how much can i over
the head
yeah so you know it is this somebody
who's advising the guy you know there's
somebody somebody who's keeping an audit
trail of all the activities that he is
doing and somebody who is expecting that
smart engineer to follow that advice you
know based on certain scores or metrics
which he may like to question or like
you know he may like to take a different
path so don't you think that this is
kind of a information overload or that's
kind of a expectation that you know that
kind of a kind of you know compliments
his his his style of work okay so the
two parts to this answer first part is
we're not controlling the tester the
tester is going where they want to go
right they can they can ask the HUD take
me to this component so I can start
testing or they can go there themselves
right so there's there there's no
there's no fences that they have to
climb in order to go where they want to
go testers are completely and totally
unleashed the second part of it is is
you just turn it off right if there's a
part of the hood you don't like just
like in a video game if you if you walk
into to you know one of these internet
cafes and and everybody's playing the
same game all their HUDs are gonna be
different they're gonna customize it for
themselves based on what kind of what
kind of help that they need so so no
shackles no fences and and it's fully
fully customizable okay so I just wanted
to put a point out that there we are 15
minutes over and we're eating into our
break so if there are more questions we
can continue on and get a chance to have
James address them or we can take a
break now and you can find him later on
let's take a break but before we take a
break did you all like the chalkboard
that was that was so so that that's in
presently that's the Google Google
presently believe it or not and some of
the people that work on this product
we're going that's presently so a guy on
my team
Joe Allen mehar ski and his wife Terry
Mahara ski are the artists behind this
so I just want to shout out to them
alright
I just wanted you I wanted to thanks
James for all the excitement that he
brought on dude I love her know that
tagged along and if you invite me back
to India I'm gonna have a smile on my
face when I say yes I'll come
that is a great change of heart so we
already expect that to continue on thank
you James</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
