to this big affair memorizing Alan
Turing I'm going to talk about touring
church girdle the topics which appear
here and the idea is going to be to give
the intellectual history of the
technology which is so prominent
nowadays in all of our lives all over
the world billions of people are now
involved and are using computers when
we're in one way or another and it all
essentially originated with a
mathematical idea it's an example a
prime example where a pure idea which is
due to doing revolutionized the world so
let me start with the origins and the
origins of this revolution are
essentially in mathematics and
mathematical logic namely in the year
1900 around 1900 Hilbert posed the
following question after the phone
formalization of mathematics by means of
logic in axioms and the like he asked
can one find an automatic decision
procedure an algorithm in today's
language to determine for every
formalized sentence s whether that
there's a theorem in the salton
Mathematica let's say in set theory or a
number theory in some math algebra and
some
ethical domain so it's really the
situation that mathematical logic is the
mother of computability now doing in
1935 asked what what is really meant by
being automatically computable this was
left leg in Hilbert's question and then
there were three
answers to that question truing came up
with towing machines which I'll discuss
in a moment and a church independently
invented the lambda calculus and girdle
in a different context defined first of
all primitive and then essentially
general recursive functions and it was
very important that those three
definitions actually in content led to
the same concept to the same class of
functions and this is to this day
considered a demonstration that these
answers really are the appropriate
answers to the question now we have
these computers and they perform let us
say a billion in Hebrew a million
operations per second how is it possible
to build a machine performing 10 to the
9th different operations per second the
idea the solution lies in an idea which
also goes back to touring of actually
having an instruction cycle so if you
consider a wheel in principle is
possible to be turned ten to the ninth
times per second except that since
centrifugal forces would
at the part but how computers do
paradoxically the following 10 to the
nine times they are doing the same thing
they are repeating an instruction cycle
but each time an instruction cycle is
being repeated a possibly different
instructions X actual instruction is
being performed
now Turing machines the most readily
understandable definition of
computability is via the construct which
we now call a Turing machine and the
Turing machine has the following the
following components the memory is a
tape which is a potentially infinite
sequence of memory cells and that tape
and this goes back to doing is divided
into a section where the program is
being stalled this is what you have on
the left there the program memory and
then a part which is the data and
computation memory now if you look at
modern computers essentially the memory
there especially you know with virtual
memory is essentially still logically an
extendable sequence of memory cells
which are being addressed by by the
address register now the way he
conducted the computation is to have the
instruction cycle namely it starts by
reading a memory cell so here we read
the memory cell then
you change state you read an instruction
you go to the to the program you read an
instruction you change state you go back
your item memories sell and then you
repeat that's the instruction cycle so
the tooling Church thesis was that being
computable is its equivalent to have to
having a Turing machine computing that
function now tooling for his
construction had that tape and had the
control move a sort of one step at the
time in 1960 look at the bottom of that
slide here L got an Robinson at IBM a
Cal L got a neighbor arm or Benson had a
version of the Turing machine which has
address registers so very much now very
close to what we have nowadays so moving
now to the next one what are the basic
features of the Turing machine there is
a memory tape that's this extensible
sequence of memory cells then and this
is the point which is very often
overlooked there is a small finite
control process so you see we could sit
together I and any three of us here and
devise a universal Turing machine a
universal computer using normal as
Turing did no more than maybe 50 or 60
different instructions what's the
significance of this fact if it would
turn out that to have a universal
machine and that seal the fifth point to
have a
machine which can be programmed to
calculate any computable function if
that would have required let us say
20,000 instructions then in the early in
the late 40s and early 50s with the
technology then available maybe even
with the technology now available it
would have been impossible to build a
universal computer so this is an
extremely important point sort of
uncovered by tooling in his original
work then the next thing is that the
device is a stored-program device the
program the control and I'll get back to
that point in a moment is in the same
memory
well the computation in the same fast
memory nowadays well the computation is
being conducted and finally unlike the
computing machines suggested say by
Pascal and lightnings which did
additions multiplications and so on this
is a universal machine one machine which
by different programs can calculate any
computable function one machine can do
it and these are the essential features
of the processor that we have in our in
all of our devices
so essentially tooling gave the
intellectual blueprint for what we could
call in sort of children's language the
little engine that could alright now
let's go back to history to essentially
the first large computer that was
constructed Moakley an acre of
constructed the ENIAC
and then held in a moment come to John
phone of to John for knowing man
Goldstein and Burks now this was an
enormous machine here you have it
it was electronic it could perform maybe
a thousands of so computations per
second and now how was it programmed it
was programmed by going to the control
board
plugging with wires and moving and
switching sort of switches you see these
two women standing there and they are
doing the work to sort of reprogram the
computer now how does phenomen come into
it this machine was built for the
purpose of doing computations for the
for the army to calculate to calculate
trajectories of of gun bullets and
phenomen and Goldstein were working at
the Aberdeen Proving Grounds doing
computations for the same purpose so and
this I have personally from Herman
goldstine he took phenomen to see the
ENIAC machine and phenomen looked at
that monster now this machine this
machine so the ENIAC was programmed by
plugging miles and setting switches now
for Norman when he was visiting there
looked at that machine and the machine
had a primitive electronic memory
storing a table
which contained air friction values
which you needed in order to calculate
those trajectories and he as he was
standing there the man was a clear
genius phenomen as he was standing there
he said why don't you store the program
in that table and have the whole thing
you know completely electronic and then
it can be changed by sort of
reprogramming the table now
in 1945 phenom and all the edvac report
featuring thought program a binary
memory believe it or not the ENIAC was
doing calculations in in decimal form so
a binary memory and of course you know
the edvac was a scheduled to be a
universal computer now I was in
Princeton in the 50s and let me share
with you my relationship I've never met
doing but I did meet Goldstein for
Norman and not for Norman sorry
Church of course a girdle and a few
other of the main figures now in the
early 50s I was a student at the Hebrew
University of Jerusalem and I was
working mainly in algebra and in logic
and I ran across two links paper about
computable numbers and this was as
computing technology was emerging the
first machines were being built by IBM
using in palette also punched cards and
so on and I realized looking at that
paper that here you have a technology
that needs a science to support it that
wants the creation of his science and
the center at the time was
the center at the time was Princeton
that's well girdle church and the people
around for Norman well sitting at the
Institute for Advanced Study now I have
a distant relative who is a biologist
and he met me at some wedding and he
said Michael I was 21 years old he said
Michael I understand you're going to
Princeton what are you going to do there
and I said I want to to study to follow
the scientific foundations of computing
and computers and he said computers what
our computers good for except for doing
payrolls and inventories and some
large-scale computations and I said to
him you know you're a biologist that was
before by the way the double helix so I
said to him one day computers are going
to be used to analyze and calculate the
properties of very large molecules like
proteins and he looked at me almost
contemptuously and he said this will
never happen ok so he wasn't quite right
now in at Princeton so you had the
sequence of events for Norman writes the
edvac report containing all the features
in 1949 Wilson England reads attract
reports in built at Zak and from 1945 to
51 a phenomen and people around them
build the Institute for Advanced Study
computers now I did not meet from now a
man even though I had an opportunity to
do so I had a letter of introduction to
him I didn't want to bother him
but I spoke a lot to the people around
him
at Princeton and also somebody who
cooperated with him Berks and there is
absolutely no doubt that phenomen was
deeply aware of tubing's world touring
was at Princeton and he himself said
that those ideas over having a stalled
program and the instruction cycle and so
on all of that was revealed to him to
Philemon via torrents basic people they
spent together some time in Princeton
for a couple of years as was mentioned
here by the introductory story election
on the other hand for Norman was not
only a wizard architect the electrical
engineers who worked with him said that
when they had some circuit they had to
design some electronic circuit they had
to design and they couldn't really solve
it they would bring the problem to
phenom and the mathematician and he
would settle it within about 10 minutes
okay let that be an example to all of us
here so fine now we want to go back to
mathematical logic I said that the
origins of this revolution was
essentially in logic in Hill Wells
question in the definition by logicians
who wanted to answer the question what
computability means so now we want to
see what these ideas did in lot to logic
itself so n here n is the set of all
natural numbers and if you consider
natural numbers as being expressed in
binary so you essentially have the set
of all wells
yes everything is translatable into the
zero one language the Bible love poems
everything is translatable into
sequences of zeros and ones and a subset
like that we call a language we say it
has the language has a solvable decision
problem if the characteristic function
the function f from n into 0 1 which is
run if if n is in L and 0 if n is not an
L is doing church girdle computable also
later on the language instead because of
recursive functions such a function is
also called a recursive function now 2
Inc has shown in the original paper that
the language halt namely the language
meaning the set of binary sequences
describing all computer programs that
halt that stop let's say on the input 0
that that language meaning the halting
problem is unsolvable this was the first
indication and we are going to hear I
think a lecture about that that
programming languages are completely and
their correctness is a completely
non-trivial topic namely there is no in
general computable solution to say
whether the program is correct
not even whether that program on a given
input is going to stop and produce an
output from that he derived and this is
technical but very cute and I read all
of that stuff and it made an enormous
impression on me that the world problem
falls
oops that problem is unsolvable if you
don't know what that means it doesn't
matter now tooling in church have shown
that the decision problem for first
order logic given a formula of first
order logic the question whether that
formula is a theorem this is unsolvable
in a sense meaning that mathematics is
not trivial and it turned out that
towing church girdle have shown that the
decision problem for almost any
axiomatic theory is unsolvable to say
for any axiomatic non and going to give
a counter example in a moment in
particular if we take the natural
numbers with addition and multiplication
and we talk about the question which
sentences there are two or not or which
sentences of theorems of what is called
piano a thematic that set is not
recursive you cannot build any machine
that is going to automatically answer
those questions so that was a sort of a
complete death sentence to the Hilbert
program of finding an algorithmic
solution to to the question what is the
theorem and what isn't now we want to go
to unsolvable ax t2 complexity so I'll
arrive at complexity for a moment and
I'm going to do because my boss here is
going to tell me very soon that I don't
have too much time I'm going to sort of
miss I am going to skip that but
essentially and you'll have to follow
very quickly this
suppose we have Rica recon stably
innumerable but unsolvable non recursive
sets it turns out that touring already
suggests that the hierarchy of of
unsolvable ax t and he raised the
question whether they're really
unsolvable problems unsolvable of
different complexity of non
computability and that question was
answered by Friedberg by Friedberg who
showed that in fact the degree in the
touring sense the degrees form a certain
hierarchy and that there is a whole
hierarchy of unsolvable ax t now the
next step from those degrees of answer
mobility we go to what I call the 1958
degrees of difficulty of computing
functions and now of course this is
called complexity I was visiting IBM in
1958 at before they had the reserve
center they well located in a place
called the Lambeth state very
appropriately before they moved in and
before I came to visit there it was an
insane asylum but then we guys well city
guys there were almost no women we were
sitting there and working essentially on
on the early steps of what is now
computer science so there was a question
by John McAfee posed to me about
passwords I don't I don't have time it's
a lovely question so it raised in me the
question what does it mean that for
computable function
for solvable problems what does it mean
to say that man solvable in the touring
sense problem there is another solvable
problem which is absolutely half of them
in other words they're both solvable
enhance from toolings point of view
trivial problems still there is a
concept of what I call degree of
difficulty and now it's called
complexity well one problem is
absolutely more difficult than another
problem and I prove the theorem that in
a very strong sense for every recursive
meaning solvable problem there is a
another solvable problem such that the
decision problem for the second one is
absolutely more difficult than the
solvable decision problem for the first
so it is absolutely more complex I can't
go into the formal definitions anyway if
I would have done it you would have
forgotten it the minute you walk out of
this hole now the concepts complexity of
computations it is what enables modern
cryptography modern cryptography is
based on the on the proposition as yet
open that there are functions namely the
encryption which are easy to compute
whereas the inverse namely the
decryption is hard if that assumption
turns out to be false and we don't as
yet know there is no proof that that
actually exists if that turns out to be
false
then modern cryptography is going to
collapse now let us go back to fear
improving there is a segment of the
theory of addition and multiplication of
natural numbers
let's theory being absolutely
undecidable in the tuning sense namely
principle girl in 1929 considered the
natural numbers so to get the formal
language you have this alphabet the
domain of the natural integers the
operation is addition and examples of
two sentences are for all X and for all
Y X plus y is equal to y plus X which
means addition is commutative addition
of natural numbers for all X and for y
there exists a Z remember that the
numbers I'll 0 1 2 though the
non-negative integers so that X plus Z
is y all my plus Z's X in other words
that there is an ordering there that
they are actually linearly although by
this relationship and professor Berger
in 1929 has proved that the set of all
true felt all the sentences about
addition of natural numbers is decidable
there is a decision procedural for bet
in fact people in in program
verification we're very interested there
are various applications for that ok is
decidable now hey michael fisher and our
in 1973 have shown that there exists an
alpha not a small one it's about 3/4
such
that for every decision algorithm for
every algorithm which tells you about
each sequence whether it is a theorem or
not there is an NC or dependent on the
algorithm so that for every N greater
than and 0 there exists a sentence about
addition of length n so that the
algorithm applied to that s that's
shocking takes more than 2 to the 2 to
the alpha times n steps to give you the
answer it's doubly exponential
absolutely devastating the N 0 is not
very large
the N 0 is essentially the size of the
algorithm so that means that if you have
an algorithm which takes a thousand
symbols to describe they are going to be
sentences of length for every N greater
than 1,000 so let's say of length 1,000
so that applying that algorithm to get
the correct answer will take two to the
two to the 750 steps to give you the
answer absolutely devastating good or
bad depending depending well you look at
it now beyond Turing computability so
our and Scott in 57 introduced the
notion of non-deterministic computations
these are sort of extensions of the
ideas of towing non-deterministic led I
mean that concept was used by cook in
1971 to pose the classical question
whether P equals to NP if you don't know
what that is going google it
you'll really learn something and that
question by the way is is essential to
the question whether cryptographic
algorithms are really really secure then
in 1963 I had an extension of
non-deterministic namely probabilistic
automata where you use coin tossing and
that turns out that this simplifies
automata in certain cases greatly and
then in 1976 and solovay strassen 1977
had sort of the general idea of
randomized algorithms where you use coin
tossing in order to speed up
computations and then of course parallel
and distributed computing came in and
then of course communications and
computation networks and quantum
computing came I don't think doing
thought of that I put a question mark
there because we don't yet have the
verdict whether that is feasible or not
and now I want to come to the future and
I'm going to give two examples of what I
think and I had discussions here where I
respect oh you know the next sound - at
least of the next very big things that
will come about by use of LED technology
I'm skipping Facebook things like that
they are very important and created
revolutions and so on but university
education
now I taught the course at Columbia
which was recorded and then distributed
to felty or 40 people all over the world
but that was done in a very primitive
way I envision that you're going to have
a classroom say at Stanford Stanford is
entering into this but in that classroom
and I am only going to give you you know
the bare outline in that classroom while
it is being taught here like this they
are going to be six or seven cameras
controlled in some way and those cameras
are going to run is going to focus on
the speaker another one on the speaker
and the board the blackboard whiteboard
another one is going to focus on various
people in the audience and so on all of
that will be recorded and then somebody
who is not fortunate enough to be at
Stanford within that lecture is going to
look at it and he is going to control
also the output of the cameras he is
going not in real time while the lecture
is going on not in real time he's going
to see the board he's going to see the
speaker he's going to see the board
expression on some of the people in the
audience somebody asks a question that
he can choose a camera focusing on the
person who asked the question and so on
and this is going to give a hundred
thousand people all over the world
a feeling of again using a cliche from a
movie a feeling of being there then
there is also a way and I'm not going to
enter into it of controlling the
business of if I have a question I am
sitting in Hawaii and I'm I have a
question about the lecture with Stanford
lecture there is a methodology of being
able to answer these questions in
very satisfactory way I'm not going into
the details so this is going to make
this remote University education a real
possibility and giving the the users a
feeling that they are really there and
deriving the full benefit and the next
thing there are many applications the
next thing is remote medicine so the
reasons for remote medicine are clear
there are even in the United States
small communities small cities well
there isn't really an adequate medical
center so here for example you can have
a field hospital in Haiti Pesci in Haiti
SOI there is an x-ray of some patient
who was maybe in in the earthquake and
the x-ray is being sent to some medical
team at Mass General Hospital on the one
hand maybe also another I think that
some people are going to have Watson
maybe also to Watson to answer all the
questions and in this way computer
technology will enable an access to to
real medicine all over the world in a
sense now who is going to do it maybe
some of the existing companies
corporations usually existing
corporations are a little bit slow in in
moving into other directions and if not
there are going to be some exciting
startups who are going to give various
realizations of this technology those
technologies and many others all of them
all of them would have been impossible
without
toolings little engine that could thank
you
