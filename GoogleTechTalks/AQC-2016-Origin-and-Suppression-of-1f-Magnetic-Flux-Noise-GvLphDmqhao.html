University of Wisconsin medicine and he
will tell us about origin and
suppression of 1 over F magnetic flux
noise ok so this talk is a little bit of
a departure from what we've heard about
earlier in the meeting I'm going to tell
you about some recent developments in a
long-standing problem in materials and
device physics that impacts the
performance of quantum annealer 'he's so
you know we know that in an annealer the
idea is to encode some difficult problem
in the hamiltonian of an interacting
spin system and we've heard that it's
useful to think of these annealer 'he's
in terms of the language of spin glasses
we talk about spin glass freezing and
replicas and that sort of thing but of
course the annealing elements aren't
physical spins instead they're
superconducting circuits which I draw
here schematically is little current
loops and we've got control over local
fields and we've got control over
interactions and that allows us to build
something useful out of a system of many
of these annealing elements but of
course these little superconducting
circuits aren't perfect and we've heard
in a couple of the talks up to now that
these annealer zar also coupled to some
environment to a bath and kind of the
the funny message that I want to convey
to you is that really important part of
this bath is a disordered interacting
spin system that creates fluctuations
and the bias of these individual
annealing elements and makes things work
not quite so well so what I want to tell
you about it so I'm tell you about the
history of this problem and give kind of
an optimistic message that after 30
years or so we're really starting to get
a handle on this disordered spin glass
physical spin glass that lives on the
surface of our annealing elements and I
mopped
mystic that in the coming years we can
really make some progress towards
suppressing the the noise that that
comes from these physical spins okay so
this work is his work that I've been
doing at Wisconsin for quite a few years
and over over that time it's been
supported by various agencies but i
really want to acknowledge a gift from
google that's sustained this effort over
the last couple of years and allowed us
really to push this work through to i
think a pretty satisfying point and i'm
optimistic about the future so in my
group in wisconsin these are the the big
players pradeep kumar is the major
contributor over the last several years
but i also want to really highlight the
contributions of claire you a theorist
at UC irvine not far from here she's
really one of the world's experts and
thinking about this problem and I
encourage and any of you who are
interested in learning more to contact
her okay so here's an outline of the
talk I'll give you a little bit of a
history of this problem of flux noise
and superconducting devices and then
I'll tell you about the the evidence
that we've accumulated over the last 10
or so years that points to the existence
of this interacting spin system on the
surfaces are powered devices and then
all I show some data that we've gotten
quite recently that indicates that
there's a real path towards suppressing
the noise and making better devices for
annealing and also for a database
quantum computing and then I'll wrap up
with some discussion of some recent
theoretical progress okay so the problem
that I'm telling you about has a very
long history and it goes back to the
1980s when researchers were interested
in taking squids sensitive detectors of
magnetic flux and pushing them to their
absolute limits of sensitivity for
exotic applications like detecting
gravity waves so in John Clark's group
in Berkeley what they were doing is for
the first time they took these squids
and they cool them down in millikelvin
temperatures and as expected the white
noise level
decreased as you reduce the Johnson
noise and the normal metal components of
the devices and got things cold but
there was an excess low frequency part
to the flux noise spectrum that scaled
with frequency more or less is 1 over F
and the magnitude of this noise was
remarkably robust and very weakly
dependent on a wide range of parameters
including geometry materials that were
used to fabricate the devices only
weakly dependent on temperature and this
was a real puzzle at the time and there
was a lot of work by the Berkeley group
and others that it was aimed at try to
elucidate where this noise is coming
from and at the time was it was not
clear at all where the noise is coming
from although a lot of possible noise
mechanisms were ruled out so this was a
mystery and it remained a mystery for a
couple of decades and I think that it's
probably safe to say that interest in
the problem kind of waned in the 90s but
in the late 90s early 2000s of course
there was a lot of interest in taking
superconducting circuits like squids
very much like squids and using those as
elements in a quantum computer and what
was found at that time is that the the
dephasing time soy were rather short and
some experiments were done that really
showed quite clearly that the dephasing
was due to low frequency magnetic flux
noise with a 1 over F spectrum it's the
same noise that was seen in the in this
early work by the the Berkeley group and
so if you take a cubed and create some
superposition state 0 plus 1 what you
find is that the phase coherence is lost
on a rather short time scale and it's
it's possible to show that that's due to
this presence of a low frequency flux
noise and another striking thing about
these early qubit experiments is that
the same levels of flux noise we're
seeing in devices that were very
different in geometry very different in
scale so for example here I'm showing a
photograph of phase qubit that we
studied when I was working with john and
santa barbara we did some experiments
when we backed out a 1-over a flux noise
magnitude of a few microphone odd perut
her to one Hertz and similar levels of
flux noise are seen in other types of
qubits that were very different much
smaller for example this flux cubed from
the Delft group so again we see that
there's this weak dependence with the
noise on the geometry of the device
really connects to these earlier
experiments from the Berkeley group and
more recently there have been some very
nice experiments by siddiqui by the
Lincoln group by the group at Google
that show that this noise extends out to
very very high frequencies it spans 13
orders of magnitude and spectrum is very
close to 1 over F with with magnitude in
the noise that's really quite weakly
dependent on a wide range of parameters
ok so where is this noise coming from
what do we know about this well in the
late 2000s about eight or so years ago
my group of Wisconsin did an experiment
where we took some squid devices and
applied a strong local field by
intentionally trapping magnetic flux in
the thin film of the device I won't go
into the details of how exactly we do
this experiment but the bottom line is
we were able to measure a susceptibility
of the surface of the device it showed a
1 over T Curie like divergence as we
cooled the low temperature and of course
when you see this you immediately think
about magnetism paramagnetism and i'd be
happy to talk in detail about how how we
do the experiments and the analysis but
the bottom line is this data was the
first experiment that really pointed to
the existence of a high density of
magnetic states that live on the
surfaces of our devices and we could do
a little bit of analysis and we can back
out a surface density of spins and what
it corresponds to is about one more
Magneton
nanometer extremely high density of
magnetic defects that live on the
surfaces and since this experiment a
number of other groups have probed this
surface magnetism in different ways so
you know this time we thought okay this
is great we know that these spins are
there on the surface and there were a
lot of interesting theoretical ideas for
how you could get 1 over F noise from
the system of interacting spins that
live on on surfaces and Levy off a and
Laura 40 put forth some nice ideas that
invoked spins that interacted via our
kky mechanism there's some other ideas
from John Clark but still at this time
this is 2008-2010 and a little bit
beyond we really didn't know you know
anything about the microscopic nature of
these spins and in the absence of any
information about where this magnetism
is coming from it was really difficult
to devise ways to try to suppress this
noise and so there's a period of a few
years where you know we learned a little
bit more about the noise we saw that
there's noise not just in magnetization
but in susceptibility but we didn't have
an idea about how to reduce the noise
and that that's a problem because at the
end of the day we all want to make
better devices so we want to understand
where the noise is coming from so you
can get rid of these moments okay so the
the next step forward came a couple of
years ago when Dave Pappas said miss
boulder introduced me to a very cool
technique called x-ray magnetic circular
dichroism or XM CD and here the basic
idea is you irradiate some sample with
x-rays by varying the x-ray energy by
irradiating at different x-ray
absorption edges you can get elemental
specificity you can see whether the
x-rays are being absorbed by oxygen or
aluminum or niobium or whatever but the
other twist here is that you don't use
linearly polarized x-rays or unpolarized
actually use circularly polarized x-rays
which coupled to magnetism in the sample
so what we do is we do a difference
measurement where we irradiate with
right and left circularly polarized
x-rays and we immerse the sample in a
field and that allows us to probe
magnetism and identify the atom that's
associated with the magnetism and you
can do some DFT modeling to learn more
about the chemical composition of the
moments and what we found I won't go
through this in much detail bottom line
is we took films aluminum and niobium
films that had various dielectric
encapsulations the same sort of material
stack that we would use to make cubed
circuits and we saw zero evidence of
magnetism in any of the samples that we
studied until we intentionally degraded
the vacuum of the sample cryostat at the
end station of the synchrotron so when
you introduce a tiny tiny bit of air or
molecular 02 dry 02 into the sample
priced at suddenly you see a very strong
X mcd signature that happens at the
oxygen k-edge and subsequent DFT
modeling density theory funk density
functional theory modeling by our
collaborators at Irvine shows that this
this signature is coming from molecular
02 that is adsorbed on the surface okay
so this is really interesting it's
telling us that the films that were
using to fabricate our devices
intrinsically aren't magnetic the
magnetism is extra extrinsic to the
sample and it's suggesting that if we
can somehow improve the vacuum
environment are the devices that we're
making and using for Cupid experiments
maybe we can eliminate this noise okay
now it turns out that a fair amount is
known about solid molecular o2 at low
temperature turns out it's a total mess
there are a lot of different competing
magnetic orders some long-range magnetic
order in in certain phases and it's you
know I think very reasonable to think
that you've got this disordered
two-dimensional magnet sort of a spin
glass it lives on the surface of your
devices and the goal now is to figure
out a way to get rid of this these
oxygen moments and so that's that's
really a lot easier said than done so
for really a couple years my group has
been working to try to beat down this
noise beatdown this magnetism we tried a
number of things that I won't go into
but in the end I think we came up with a
solution that is not not really very
cumbersome it seems to work quite well
and I think it offers a good path
forward so what we do is you know
instead of putting our devices in some
sort of aluminum sample box does
everybody in the community normally does
instead we make our sample enclosure at
a titanium grade 5 titanium which is a
grade material it's really hard it's
super conducts it's hard enough so that
you can make all metal vacuum seals con
flat seals you can bake these enclosures
out achieve really ultra-high vacuum
conditions and and it's a you know it's
a pretty pretty slick solution and easy
to work with and it's not bad at all so
we've done a couple of different things
with these sample cells that have
allowed us to suppress surface magnetism
on the one hand we can take our devices
we can put them in this special titanium
box we can bake them for a couple of
days to clean them up and out gassing
and then we can backfill in the sample
enclosure ammonia gas now ammonia nh3
has a higher free energy of adsorption
than oxygen but it's non-magnetic and so
when we do that when we backfill with a
hundred tour of ammonia and then seal
off this enclosure what we find is that
when we take devices and trap flux and
cool them down to low temperature so we
can measure the zero frequency
susceptibility we see a much weaker
magnetic signature in these ammonia
passivated devices and the
so here we're looking at the kiri
response for devices cooled basically
the positive field and a negative field
and the difference here between the red
points at lowest temperature that's
directly proportional to the surface
density of spins and with the blue data
here that's our passivated devices we
see that we've suppressed the
susceptibility by about an order
magnitude now in any magnetic system the
susceptibility is proportional to the
noise power spectral density integrated
over all frequencies so this is an
indirect measurement of a suppression of
flux noise but it's it's you know all
the same it's a it's a clear indication
that we've reduced this noise the
integrated noise by an order of
magnitude ok but this isn't totally
satisfying a course we want to measure
noise directly so to do that what we can
do is we can take a squid device we can
buy sit with a voltage and use a second
squid to read out the fluctuating
current through the device which is
going to be proportional to the
fluctuating flux in this first device
under test that's this kind of a
standard way to measure squid noise and
so we can take a device and do that cool
it down to a millikelvin temperatures
and here's some kind of typical baseline
data and what we're doing here is we're
measuring the power spectral density of
flux in the squid loop is a function of
frequency and we fit this to this
functional form here and what we care
about here is this pre factor a the
noise power and also we care about this
noise exponent alpha and so that's what
we we do we did a series of measurements
where we characterize devices before
doing any sort of special treatment and
then we took those same devices and then
characterize them again after
passivating in in ammonia or the other
thing that we tried that also worked as
we've taken the devices we've irradiated
with UV light to promote desorption of
strongly bound magnetic species and and
and done that in uhv environment and
then encapsulated and uh
line is that both of those approaches
work and so we've got before after
spectra of devices that were cooled down
without any special treatment and then
cooled down in this improved vacuum
environment or with ammonia passivation
and we've seen suppressions of noise
power spectral density by up to about a
factor of five and so you know I can
talk to people offline about the details
of these measurements and the data you
know there's some you know some some
subtleties or details they don't have
time to get into here but the bottom
line is we found a way and after 30
years this is the first experiment that
anybody has done to show any sort of
reduction in this flux noise power so
this is really exciting the reductions
maybe aren't as large as we would like
and there's still some work that we can
do to optimize the protocol but you know
I think clearly we're on to something
there's a clear path forward and I'm
really excited about the possibility to
to make better superconducting devices
for annealer xand gate base qubits now
okay so here's the data that we've got
again showing the before and after noise
power spectral density and we're seeing
clearly for a large range of devices and
treatments that there's a way to reduce
the noise and that's exciting so in the
the remaining time am i doing on time
four minutes okay great I just want to
say a few words about some recent
developments on the the theory side so
this is not my work this is work of
collaborators so on the one hand you
know Claire use group has been a real
leader in thinking about noise from
service adsorbates she's been working
over the last couple years with ruching
woo a DFT expert at Irvine and now that
we've got a picture of where the the
dominant contributors to flux noise are
coming from you know what these things
are microscopically we can do some
calculations and we can you know
calculate for a given density of
adsorbates what sort of interaction
energies to expect to have what sort of
satrapies do we have and we can take
that data and use that as inputs into a
detailed theoretical model that you know
will allow us to get a better handle on
what we need to do to to make better
devices so in Claire Claire's group
they've they've looked at exchange
energies of o2 adsorbed on an aluminum
oxide surface they see that the exchange
is dominantly predominantly
ferromagnetic with a very large energy
border Kelvin or more so that
corresponds to frequency of 20 gigahertz
and so this this large energy scale this
is setting the the high frequency roll
off from this 1 over F noise so this
large energy scale this is why we see
this one RF noise going out to almost 10
gigahertz so the the highest fluctuate
errs these are the guys that are coupled
most tightly together with this very
strong ferromagnetic exchange and claire
has done a lot of simulations where
she's taken distributions of exchange
energies and show that this is very
compatible with a 1 over F magnetization
noise spectrum now another development
as it looks like PowerPoint having some
problems here but in in the group of lab
yafei working with laura 40 they have
quite recently started to think very
seriously about noise from adsorbed
oxygen and one of the key and subtle
things about the o2 molecule is it's a
spin one object it's not a spin one half
object when you've got to spin one that
means that there's a possibility for a
random and I saw trippy and in the work
from lab and Laura they've modeled this
interacting spin system as having some
are kky interaction although exchange
works just as well here and this random
anisotropy is a key ingredient because
when when you have that it means that
magnetization is no longer conserved
locally ok so previously lab Laura
others
thought about some spin diffusion model
and you can calculate 1 over F spectrum
from spins that diffuse with local
conservation magnetization and that kind
of works but it doesn't really match up
with a lot of the features of the
experimental data namely with spin
diffusion you wouldn't expect the noise
spectrum to extend out to gigahertz
frequencies if you've got this random
and I saw trippy than that that means
magnetization is no longer conserved
locally and the relevant energy scale is
actually going to be the bear exchange
energy another key thing is this random
anisotropy means that you can have spin
clusters that get stuck in these very
high energy configurations where they
can't emit energy to their surroundings
and so locally you're going to have a
broken time reversal symmetry and that's
enough to give you correlations and
magnetization and susceptibility noise
which we've observed experimentally and
it's really hard to cook up a
theoretical model that'll give you those
correlations with oxygen and random
anisotropy this is explained in a very
natural way so I'm really excited about
the possibility to develop a really
detailed theoretical model for this
noise and with that I think I'll wrap up
so Hardman started this conv or this
meeting by saying that he's an optimist
i'm also an optimist this is a really
hard problem it's been around for three
decades but I feel really confident that
we've got a great handle on this we're
going to make significant progress in
the coming years the message here is
that we now know where one over efflux
noise is coming from there's a path
forward to reducing this noise and
developing a really detailed theoretical
model for noise from these adsorbed
moments and at the moment my group is
sort of pivoted and we're working now to
characterize this noise in qubit
circuits and it's a pleasure to work
with the the google group on this and i
think we're going to make a lot of
progress in the coming years ok with
that I'll end thanks
question please please thanks very much
that this is just a curiosity but how do
you produce circularly polarized x-rays
this is actually really interesting so
they have magnet arrays that force the
electrons in the synchrotron to travel
in these helical paths it's kind of nuts
but that's how they do it but yep ah
didn't diss look correctly that when you
made this treatment the suppression of
the magnetic susceptibility was much
stronger than suppression of the noise
that's true and so one of the subtle
points they're happy to talk about this
in detail is the devices that we use to
characterize the surface susceptibility
were naive iam based because we need to
be able to trap flux vortices in the
film's in a controlled way we've not
been able to do that with aluminum but
those niobium devices for various
technical reasons really weren't
amenable to the type of noise
measurements that we could do so we
measured susceptibility on one set of
devices in noise on another set of
devices so that's correct and the
susceptibility suppression we saw is
larger than the noise suppression that
we've seen up to now and you cannot tell
that there is a violation of fluctuation
dissipation theorem or something so I
mean we haven't done any experiments so
far that would allow us to you know tell
whether we're dealing with an
equilibrium system it's going to obey
fluctuation dissipation or whether we're
at equilibrium I mean this is this is
one of the things that we're interested
in looking at moving forward more
questions please hey Robert oh I got a
mic over here really great work I'm kind
of interested I saw that your post
treatment results had a reduced exponent
and I know that dephasing depends on the
integral a right noise uprightly the
megahertz
and I don't know if you have any results
of kind of taking that integral and
seeing if you see a reduction in that
area underneath the noisy spec you know
so you're absolutely correct and I you
know I don't want to read too much into
this data but you do see in devices
where the the noise magnitude at one
Hertz is suppressed we do I think you
can sort of squid and maybe you don't
have to squint too hard but it does look
like there's a suppression in the noise
exponent a little bit so if you're
totally pessimistic you would say that
okay maybe you've just taken spectral
weight and shifted it from low frequency
at the high frequency which would be bad
right but you think about what's
happening physically and if you if you
have the system of interacting 02
moments and you start to remove some so
you're reducing the density then you're
going to do two things you expect the
high frequency cutoff of the 1 over F
spectrum to move the lower frequencies
because you're reducing the maximum
exchange energy at the same time you're
preventing the formation of really large
clusters which are going to dominate the
fluctuations at lowest frequency so what
I would expect and we haven't done the
experiments to prove or disprove this is
what's going on but namely what I would
expect is that as we reduce the spin
density then the noise exponent the low
frequencies had come down and sort of
flattened out the spectrum and then also
that high frequency cutoff would move
the lower frequency and this is exactly
the type of thing that we need to look
at in detail by doing cubed based
measurements that will allow us to
access the frequency spectrum over a
really broad range so I mean this is
this is these are things that we're
going to be looking at in the coming
months in years I very nice data and
nice and I said a theory to back it up
I'm just wondering you saw a drop in the
1 over F amplitude but the drop was sort
of factors of 25 can you comment on on
what do you see do you think that
there's a maybe a second spin bath or
that you might not be removing all of
them that there are so it could be that
the remaining noise is due to some
residual 02 moments that aren't getting
removed and so we're we're trying to in
prove this encapsulation protocol and
create better vacuum in these sample
cells another possibility is it could be
that there's a second population of
spins that don't live on the surface
that are contributing to low frequency
flux annoyance at some lower level we
just don't know at this point but you
know the fact that we do in certain
devices see up to order magnitude
suppression a susceptibility suggests
that you know this is really by far the
dominant contributor and that's about
all we can say at this point about
magnetic susceptibility temperature my
question of like theoretical data and I
noticed that it's about 4.3 Kelvin Oh
curie temperature yeah so yeah this is
from clear you correct that's so if this
is correct curie temperature so those
pins will be frozen at at at millikelvin
completely will go out of the picture
yeah but mean we're dealing here with a
disordered systems we've got some
distribution of exchange energies and
more recently labs group has done some
more detailed calculations where they
take a in a modest distribution of
exchange and they've calculated
a system of a hundred by hundred or so
interacting 02 moments and you very
naturally get these arrangements where
you have little paramagnetic puddles in
ferromagnetic regions and so you know I
think you're going to have some noise
from maybe domain wall motions the type
of thing it's a disordered system so
you've got a broad distribution to these
interaction energies I see so but you
are not ruling out that you might have
the second bath spins no I we can't we
can't rule it out but I think that this
is certainly the dominant contributor
this is late yeah to us christian right
all right thank you very much I think we
can conclude the session and</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
