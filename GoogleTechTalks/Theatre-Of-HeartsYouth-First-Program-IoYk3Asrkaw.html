are very important part of their
children's education
Oh
I'm
I
oh okay this is mark Armstrong he's our
board here so he's come along to support
they gave me a mic so you're going to
have to chime in yeah well first of all
you know it's a pleasure thank you so
much for receiving us and for allowing
us to tell you a little bit about what
we've been doing for the last 15 years
theatre of hearts use first we have
provided over 65,000 at risk and
underserved youngsters with quality long
term fine arts education in music dance
theatre visual arts it's across the
board it's multidisciplinary as you know
when we started Theatre of hearts
actually is an older organization but
the youth first program as I said
started in 1992 and that happened after
the civil unrest and when that happened
there the kids were everybody was like
talking and we noticed that the kids had
no voice I mean they were being
traumatized they absolutely nobody was
speaking to them so what our
organization decided to do is to start a
summer program so we went into the
communities that were affected by the
civil unrest and we found that not only
did the children were they didn't they
didn't have any arts but they had no
arts in their public schools either so
they had taken the arts away from mostly
the public and underserved areas in this
county so we said well this can't just
be a summer program we have to look at
how we can help facilitate our most
at-risk youngsters so after two years we
started our year-round program so today
we have a roster of over 300
professional artists who we contract to
go into
to the various areas of Los Angeles
County and they are all underserved
areas and as you know a lot of Los
Angeles is a huge huge County so a lot
of our youngsters cannot get to museums
they've never been to the theater they
can't get to any of the venues that we
go to and you think well you know it's
really easy for a parent to take their
kids to a museum or to a theater or so
forth first of all the funds aren't
there second of all is very hard to get
there so what we decided to do is to
bring the artists to them and and then
once the youngsters are involved within
their visual arts workshops then they're
not we can take them out on a field trip
to amuse them or whatever and then
they're not just looky-loos you know
they actually can talk about shadings
and colors and and they feel a part of
the community on a whole so when Nick
asked me to ask us to come to explain to
you our organization we were very very
pleased and I know that we're very close
to it so we may have a not answering a
lot of questions that you may have so if
you have any questions or if you'd like
to chime in or Caitlin or like the time
in that would be great do you have any
questions at this point yes so well okay
that's a good question we go into
schools community centers homeless
shelters detention centers and probation
camps now we're looking at probation
alternative schools alternative schools
are schools in which the youngsters have
been asked to leave their public schools
because of behavioral reasons or because
of learning disabilities we work with a
lot of kids with a DD and learning
disabilities special needs kids and as
you saw on the tape what Shirley rude
said that a lot of our underserved and
address
they have learning disabilities and
they're not really looked on as you know
they just think they're lazy or whatever
but they have a learning disability the
arts and a lot of you guys may be
artists here I or have something to do
with artists being google or whatever we
take the kids around the back door when
the youngsters feel good about
themselves in terms of their self-esteem
all of a sudden they start to want to
participate in the world and in a
positive way so just recently I went to
a theater project that we did and these
were for underserved and teenage
pregnant minors we did a theater
workshop with them and we did the final
work in progress in a church now this
church had nothing it had really very
little nothing at all not only did they
write their the script not only when the
little raggedy curtain opened up there
was a whole set where a young lady took
something from nothing and made this
amazing set the talent is the the young
woman that directed it the teacher said
that she never ever raised her hand she
was almost they thought she was mute
because she never asked a question she
never did anything but when the artist
came in to start to work with her not
only did she become the narrator of the
piece she became the director of the
Peace the reason why I'm so passionate
about this is because I see the
transformations on an ongoing basis I
see these kids you know transforming I
see them you know wanting to be a part
of the world you know that they they
start to become excited about their
school work they start to ask questions
critical thinking I mean all of you guys
here sitting here
you have to solve problems every day a
lot of times in school no one's asked to
solve a problem no one's asked to finish
a project they just go oh they can't do
it but within the Arts you have to
finish you have to meet your challenges
you have to move forward and this is why
the arts are so important to the
fundamental component of education and I
have many many many stories to tell you
but that's just one of them mark would
you like to say a few things
and we excel at something sports or
mathematics or art or something that
we've been able to throw education take
advantage of most of these use have
never been empowered it's the opposite
they it's everything for them has been a
struggle and puts them in a situation of
never feeling the success of
accomplishment and with art music dance
these things allow and cheat a set of
perfectly they're really an art there
isn't necessarily a right and wrong you
may not appreciate it someone else may
appreciate it but yet you're still
accomplishing something that empowers
you to feel I've been artist using my
whole professional life and the
interesting about arts is whether it's
commercial the weather's fine arts
there's always passion involved in it
and there's always someone who
appreciates it even if it's just
self-expression and you realize that
you've expressed something that's within
you that you can share with others that
may appreciate or not but that
expression is the empowering part and
you know I some of these pieces I've
seen a hundred times and some of them
are new to me but this is this is crazy
when you look at this these these kids
are in situations where some of them
have been incarcerated and really are
struggling to even do through the daily
function of even breaking a smile out
yet they can with the help of Sheila's
artists can come in and all of a sudden
they've got something they grab on to
and that's it it's incredible any other
questions you were to get the brochures
are any good yeah
we work with youngsters from four years
of age all the way up 18 years of age
and each program is custom designed to
suit the needs of the age range what
their needs are so we're not a cookie
cutter organization they just don't go
okay we want dance we want theatre we
want visual arts we go in as the experts
to work with the coordinators or the
Phil Silla taters or the teachers to
really design something that's going to
work because the main thing we say use
first we want these kids to win we don't
want to give anything that the kids are
not going to win and that they're going
to be challenged the professional
artists that are on our team are just
that they are professional artists who
have a heart but who really challenge
these youngsters to do this kind of work
so we're not doing so called Kitty art
we give them the best supplies we give
them the best that we can I mean in
terms of theater we don't have the funds
to do big designs and things of that
nature but we do what we can yeah
hi again bye
well usually it's it's like word of
mouth we're on the LA Arts Commission
directory has programs me you know
meeting the critique particular for the
standards of Apple standards we're also
LAUSD were on that directory the RAND
Corporation has given us in 1997 best
practices working with the underserved
youth in the arts so you can find us and
usually when we go into a facility they
tell others one school or one facility
I'll say you know these this is a great
group they really really are able to
work with the kids the teachers you know
sometimes we've gone in and they've gone
you know yawn yawn in the very beginning
because they're burned out you know
there's a lot of challenges of being a
teacher and they really feel that a lot
of times there's no hope for the
youngsters at their teaching which is
sad to say but it's true but we kind of
go in and give them a little bit of
infusion so when they see their kids
starting to you know come alive based on
what Mark was saying they start to be
energized they start to be renewed again
as teachers and they start to use some
of our techniques as that the artists
are using in math or language arts or
reading so it's a win-win situation a
lot of times I have to really say that
the kids really know if you're giving
them really not very good programming
they can tell and they don't want to
know they're turned off because a lot of
stuff is thrown at them when they're
given a program that is really quality
you've got really great artists working
with them that really know what they're
doing then the hope that everything
starts to change you know they start to
feel oh I'm worth something
I'm really I'm not just thrown something
yes you mentioned techniques that some
of the teachers carry on
examples of that are also wondering how
isn't something that just happens
organically or you guys okay yeah that's
a good question to that knowledge not
only do the students with to the
teachers yeah they're okay there's two
ways there's two ways first of all we're
a long-term program meaning that we're
working with the kids at least 13 that's
like three months either once or twice a
week so they're getting trained all the
time when we're in there we make sure
when our orientation we're training the
teachers or the coordinators to stay in
the room so they're working alongside
the youngsters so therefore they're
being trained they're having you know
they're being trained right along with
the youngsters and in the curriculum in
terms of how to integrate that into
their curriculum for instance we have
visual arts what will hear it is visual
arts and you look at in terms of if
we're saying okay we're going to take
dinosaurs for instance you know they
start to read about dinosaurs they start
to read about Picasso they start to read
about Latino art they start to read
about or tell a story which is literacy
they start to read about how I felt when
I did the picture and then they write
about it so it's all interconnected so a
lot of the teachers start to infuse
those techniques within their curriculum
we also do do though on teacher
development training alone with the
teacher if they so choose to want to
just kind of get in the muck themselves
and work out we do do that as well yes
any other questions yeah Nick
from schools or school administrators
and teachers who will step down are they
very welcome well they're full I
advocacy is what we do all the time by
doing a quality program by going in
we're not always welcomed in the
beginning as I said you know they they
may go you know we've got enough on our
plate there's these folks coming in you
know yawn yawn yawn yeah they say
they're going to do everything you know
they've been jaded a lot of times
because there's a lot of programs that
don't deliver but most of the time by
halfway through when they see the kids
really engaged they start to change
their tune like we've been working at
some sites for 10 years because they
were turned around and that's a
continued no they start to you know turn
around the teachers start to ask for it
you know they start to say you know I
noticed that my this guy didn't even we
didn't even know what to do with him and
then we were working with some kids with
special needs and you know there's a
timeout room you know because they're on
meds and so forth and so on when we did
our work in progress presentation and
when the artists are there they're never
in their timeout room they love it so
and this is was said you know by our by
the principles and the teachers they've
never seen anything like it so the arts
really transform and I'm not saying that
we're the answer to everything that's
not what we're here but it is a
component that really works for most of
the young surgeon when we talk about
underserved at risk all of our
youngsters are pretty at risk these
today you know it's just that some have
more funds to think well you know maybe
I can try this or that or something else
but there are others that need the step
up
well we have evaluation we do a pre and
post-test with the kids prior and that's
like on vocabulary what they've learned
because most of the youngsters that we
work with they haven't had arts before
we do an evaluation that's measuring
their grades their attendance they're a
team work and other kind of issues there
what I can't remember what else is on
there well one thing that I how our
program profess their work and other
area so I
mark about fractions for career
in secondary colors
all the kids that I started do
or reading
I mean exactly
how's your illusions mentioning the
right
after
if they have trouble learning may be mad
or something
full with art suddenly they
sure
so yeah we've got
so we've got the evaluation from the
teachers we've got a survey from the
kids and a lot of times we get the
administrative evaluations as well so we
get new your national endowment grants
all the arts grants we get I mean we're
very well recognized in terms of an
organization that does quality work so
we're funded by all of the arts folk
that sanction arts education you know
money has to flow in the community in
arts is something that a lot of times
you know people go arts you know it's
like we don't have to pay for that you
know you can volunteer for that but
there's another thing is also the
youngsters we contract those the artists
because we don't want them to be
abandoned yet again usually if you're
doing a long term or a program you know
a volunteer can say I can't come in
today I can't do this today I can't
whatever and the kids are really
disappointed so when we contract an
artist they know that they're going to
be working for those 13 weeks they're
not going to get rich with us but we're
also going to respect their craft and
talent by paying them so that's a big
part of our you know we have we want to
respect the work of the artist and their
craft in the talent that they bring so
yeah
general sense prefer that the schools
were better funded for our education and
I mean of course it's us if you work a
lot of organizations a lot of centers
that down font color school doing but
focusing on the schools for a moment do
you
I wonder what whether you do any work to
lobby for State Long House to take
change the state funding missions not
you directly what organizations we do it
all the time letter writing our
constituency there's a part of the
Alliance for the Arts is we're part of
that you know I've gone and board
members have gone to Sacramento the
California Arts Council which we're a
part of we've been funded by them they
pull us in we're always lobbying I mean
the but the the lobbying we have to do
to fold doing the work in the field and
doing the work with our legislators to
show you show
you show the positive effects yes of the
effort that you're putting closer
unfortunate count unfortunate to counter
balance that against choosing what
children but people spend their money in
time yeah do you know what I have to get
credit to California right now because
like I sit on a steering committee for
the county and they are really looking
at trying to provide all 82 school
districts with arts education now that's
going to be a while so we're still going
to have to be in the trenches really
fighting for that but at least there's
an awareness now where when we first
started there was little or no awareness
and I think that because of you know the
folks like our organization and others
who are out in the field they see the
transformation so we're getting more and
more support of course the dollars we're
always looking for the dollars that's
that's going to be yeah
I had
okay she was it la unified and I had
night a ton of our i took i could take
industrial arts I could take painting
photography I could do all this stuff my
kids couldn't take any and they went to
a very privileged school but just didn't
exist that they county decided that arts
education it wasn't money for it so and
then they started segregating the
schools into well we're going to do this
school it's going to specialize in math
and the school is going to specialize in
science and reality is that the arts
component got just pushed away so to get
to see it coming back is incredible yes
oh it was I was wondering what sorts of
what kind of training you give the
artist people when I go in the train I
you from Daddy out of the arm yeah they
do need guerrilla training and we it's
pretty much guerrilla training on the
way our program they they are gorillas
trained by our staff at the office
they're given as much information as
they can we do an orientation and depth
orientation with the artist and the site
where they're going so they know what's
going on with the kids the door is
always open for them because it's really
kind of on the job training when you
first go in a lot of some of our artists
have worked with everyone and they can
work with everyone because they have
that personality to do but some of our
artists can only work with middle school
kids some of them can only work with a
for little preschool and four-year-olds
some really like to go into the
probation camps and alternative schools
so we have to give them that kind of
ongoing reinforcement and training when
they're new when they're new so the door
is always open for them to talk to and
we also leave the door open for them to
be able to speak to the administrators
into the coordinators on site and we
always say you know there is nothing
that can't be solved so don't hold on to
it really put it out there we have
guidelines very
very strict guidelines for the artist to
follow very strict guidelines for the
administrators to follow when we're on
site
professional artists and and the reason
why we go with professional artists
because that is another educational
component for the youngsters they they
don't have the same structure as an
administrator or as an arts educator as
well as the youngsters yeah but there is
a criteria of getting in our program
yeah sure the quarter versus follow me
question regarding
how do you choose
you're going to focus on you know
we could choose to try to get more
children involved our program or we can
choose to focus on the children that are
already oh that are already sore
that you can order to get
schoolyard have access to so what I'm
sort of wondering how do you a DS how do
you see organization in terms of
uh
I guess are you more it are you more
interesting focusing on I'm sorry is a
tough question because it's tough to say
we're going to choose on giving exit
shield for a better quality art
education program as opposed to we're
going to try our focus is to try to give
the entire state for instance a
reasonable about my heart a teacher so I
guess what are you what do you more
focusing you fixing local I don't have a
fancy to go so sure sure sure but I need
your loving you know as much as we can
we do what we can with what the funds
that we have I mean that's the bottom
line well the vision we have a huge
vision I mean that's the organization
we're the artisan resident program is
there I mean we've been going for 15
years we have a deep and wide of what
can I say it's we go deep and wide in
all the different communities throughout
the county do we do the program in order
to reach more
which is a really Lucien this in some in
some people's perspectives it may be
just you know I think you give our
program we implemented the way that
third session and that's how can we if
we
get as many schools as we can to
implement
that's great but it's going to be that
program yeah we're not going to do less
and give the youngsters less because we
know it doesn't work it's just a
band-aid kids expectations this is being
parted with we want we want in the water
with us and skills so if you only do it
like a couple days they have no skill
level they have learned anything that
it's like a band-aid it's like a fun
enrichment kind of situation which is
not what we're doing mm-hmm bit about
the mentoring program and how you let
the kids because you talked a little bit
about how certain kids are picked to
mentor the younger children how does
that program well that just just kind of
by osmosis when we're in the class room
there are definite leaders that step up
artists all of a sudden they see a
leader that becomes the artists lead
youth artist where they will step up to
the plate it just happens on an ongoing
basis when we're there so mentoring
program what for the kids for the kids
as far as having some of the older kids
come into the classrooms for the younger
children well you're thinking as a
school kind of setting but we go into
various different classrooms so it's not
like it's all cohesive that we're
younger kids I mean because the arts
some of the schools are like 3,000
youngsters so we may be in eight
classrooms and then we if we have the
funds we rotate it into the next eight
classrooms and that's how it kind of
works mm-hmm let's say that I
I know child who's
school isn't well-funded at this kids
pretty kid
I might want to try and get involved in
this program how could I do that that
you want to get involved that if I know
something I know individual children
okay but you got to remember that we're
an artisan resident program so it has to
if a school is interested in the kid is
in that school then the principles can
call the parents whoever can make the
contact and then we try to figure out
how we can work with them either people
walk by and ass
mark it
or we have phone calls and basically
what we recommend is that the parents
are whoever it is talk to the school
talk to the principal
figure out way to get us connected to
the school we can't just have one red
child
side or anything like
so it's really a matter
that's cool or so
but they can't talk to us personally and
said it well
and also we if a kid has talent but
talented they really want to do
something in the arts we can try to
connect them we've had kids go and work
at Raleigh studios we're connected with
UCLA writers program we have seven of
our writers work with in the extension
program some 8 17 18 years old but they
have to sign a contract with us in their
garden has it and they have to go
through the whole thing so they have to
really be committed for us to take them
to that next that next step but we're
there to connect them if they're really
serious about wanting to get connected
with the Arts and they feel that this is
something that they want to do we try to
help them with that
scholarship
superstar kids
be my
we don't have a scholarship program
that's not where we've been coming from
at the minute as we say we try to
connect them with people who would give
them a scholarship like UCLA Extension
like you know certain individuals in
different studios or wherever they would
go so we try to connect them in that way
our dream of course one day is to have
our own visual arts and performing space
I mean this is this is our dream one day
that we've got the residency program and
we have so many connections throughout
the county but wouldn't it be great if
we had our own visual arts in a
performing space that our most gifted
kids could come from from the artisan
resident program I mean that's our big
dream of course that is something that
we want to think about and hopefully
that I'll still be around of that when
that happens where the students can talk
to our stuff we sort of get an idea
after a serious
in our arsenal that stuff so do triumph
instability we don't
have you were the artist contact and
kids like
Ferguson around here so what we had we
are
just recently a youngster who was in our
program in the earlier time and she came
back through as an artist so you know it
takes it takes some time and because we
don't have a facility a lot of times the
teachers they'll return to the teachers
and they'll give us you know this girl
is doing this she's doing this she's
whatever so that's kind of how we can
keep track of it's a little bit it's
harder the way because we're an artisan
resident program we're moving out all
over the place but the schools come back
to us and let us know yeah or yeah
program to school or other gender well
it depends on the it really depends on
the discipline that we do I mean visual
arts is really more expensive and we
kind of work with numbers when you look
at a program we're looking at classrooms
you know so it can go anywhere from
3,000 to five thousand dollars depending
or even more if we're doing more for a
school
yeah we've been doing are we would be
working with sort of 60 youngsters or
even more so it depends because the
alternative schools when I throw that
number out there it's kind of a number
because we also work with the
alternative school there every this
custom design so we have to look at it
all differently yeah one thing that we
did want to talk to you about was the
art lending program and the art learning
program is we just kind of launched this
art lending program we have I guess one
of the largest collections of use art
maybe in the county I'm not sure maybe
even in the United States who knows but
we when we do a visual arts program we
ask the youngsters would they mind
donating one of their pieces we never
ask them to give them give up their only
piece because we're there for so long
they have you know five and six pieces
if they're walking out the door with
sometimes they'll say no I don't want to
I want to keep it all and sometimes they
go yes I'd like to donate something back
because I got so much out of the program
I want to see other kids get out of it
get as much out of the program as I so
this is what this is all about and what
we do is we you can pick out the art
that we have this is just smidgens of it
but it would go on the corporate balls
or wherever you felt it would be its
kind of fun and great and it's a one way
of giving back to us to keep our program
going and yet you get something as a
suggested donation to put some of the
youth art on on the walls of your we
have one of our one of our let's see
presbyterian he's a CEO anyway we put it
up on in his corporate offices and he
said it was so easy to do business
because they come in and they look at
the kids are they see the age range of
the youngsters you know seven years old
eight years old nine years old and they
just start a conversation and before
they know it you know businesses started
and everything's great oh so we're we're
kind of looking towards you guys if you
come to any kind of decision to have a
section in your in your corporate
offices that you'd like to see some kids
art up it would be really great for us
and I think it would be great for you
yeah any other I'm sorry no we have not
HR
how does it yeah how do you get me hard
oh well we you come and choose it
depending on how many pieces you want
and then we will install it we are
located near downtown Los Angeles at the
edge of mid wilshire were not downtown
but right at the edge of mid wilshire on
Lafayette Park so you know you make your
choices I mean we last week we had a
construction he just picked up like 16
or 20 pieces for his corporate office
and he came and he chose sometimes
they'll say well you choose you know
based on your space but you can always
change it but you can you know everybody
has their own kind of taste and art you
know I don't know how you do that but
everybody has their own kind of taste
and you would you like to add to that or
anything
under eyes
here
right next to it
yeah I mean I can just run down real
quick
this is middle school
this is also middle school here this is
I love it
call the wrong path and it's uh it's a
print though but it's I hope they're
going this way and that way this is her
five that that was charcoal down paper
and that was done by nine year old again
this is this is done by eight you're all
this is mixed media clay and marker and
all kinds of beautiful things
uh
or sometimes we
this is a clay mask this is done by
Charlie roll
thorough
so and then these are and then these are
you know prints that we have this is
done
this is a pastel on paper
yeah it's hard to work with pastel on
yeah so it's it I mean that little it's
amazing yeah so anyway these are just we
wanted to just show you and here is like
a Basquiat kind of a which is it's
called finger and socket it's wild isn't
it like finger and socket and this was a
kerlik on paper and let's see age yeah
he was he was eight years old so this is
a print so you said you just went ahead
and the kids kept down and used maybe
print because it was really cool or you
have we had the original yeah yeah does
it really yeah we we have in and you
know we put the prints up as well I mean
we kind of mix it up with the original
imprints you know yeah you're showing I
saw that it was artwork be exhibited
celebrities of the artwork
yeah you do that you have given
we had in fact one of the first youth
exhibits we had was a brewery site
gallery we had a huge thing down there
we also had a huge art exhibit at the
skirball the Ruby gallery and that was
the first time that they had we
approached them and they said I don't
know we don't do kids art and then the
then the curator came down and saw the
art and they were just like yeah we'll
put it up yo yo yo Oprah we were the
beneficiaries of her beloved premiere so
the we hung it at the arm and ham and
museum that's what you're seeing in the
in there where the artwork of the kids
were hung there we try to weave last
we've had it at the Mexican Consulate
and we exchanged with kids from Oaxaca
and our kids here so and at the Czech
Republic we at their consulate I mean
we're all over the place we're kind of
all over the place because we feel that
you know art is an international
language whether kids or what so it
really speaks to your heart you know and
like so mm-hmm arts program only work
through businesses or people can
purchase it you can revive it
collections you can
but the usually the arts lending program
that gives us some constants
sustainability people get to see it
others like a word of mouth and kind of
roles it's a great way that it's a win
points
not want to have business
when
it's not
that's where
crazy bad
sure
look
and of course is testable you know
suggest a donation taxi dark roll you
get you know to have some art up for a
while but yet you get your text right on
we've been doing it for a year and you
feel like this is a well it's a good
opportunity for you did can I tell you
you know i mean you know raising prices
are going doing you events labor tent
intensive so we thought we'll drop the
art wouldn't it be great if we could
earn some income this way it would
certainly help the program the kids
everything else people would get what
they need and it's a great way that we
shall a quick visit to move and in terms
of doing it so we really want others to
tell others about it so we can perhaps
really raised the bar and we'd be able
to serve more kids more stability the
whole thing
my schedules businesses in credit check
look back
that
statements for each piece where the King
Hamor talks about her
they're so cute hit'em a friend who's
called alien mask and you would like I
want the Nega an alien but half of
