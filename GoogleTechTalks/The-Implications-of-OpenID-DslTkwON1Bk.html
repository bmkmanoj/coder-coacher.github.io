really brief so we have plenty of time
for Simon and just quick introduction
we've been hoping to get Simon here to
give this talk for a while now you may
know his work either at Yahoo or as one
of the cofounders of Jango the web
framework for developing content and I
Simon is in Maya is one of this new
generation of identity Crusaders people
trying to break down the identity silos
and he's here to give a talk on maybe
the most interesting one of those open
ID Simon Wilson okay does that work
sweet so hold on I'm going Yeah right oh
good afternoon so I've been thinking
about an experimenting with open ID for
well over a year now and I basically
convinced myself that it's represents a
major step forward in the way we do or
thumped occasion on the web out of all
of the options it seems like the one
that's most obviously correct and is
most obviously actually going to go
somewhere and while open idea itself is
pretty straightforward the implications
of adopting it really aren't and this is
there are a huge number of questions and
issues that always come up when people
are thinking about this stuff so the
format of this talk is essentially
series of question answers it's
basically it's an FAQ and like so many
faq is I made up all of the questions
myself but I will be taking extra
questions at the end of the session so
let's see if this clicker works okay so
firstly a question for you who here has
used open ID that's that's a decent
number and who actually uses it
regularly like on a bet yet hardly
anyone at all we're going to try and
make that better like that the lot of
what I'm doing at the moment is trying
to get people to adopt it so those of us
who use it have more stuff that we can
do with it so we'll start with the
basics what is open ID at night I
describe open ID is a decentralized
mechanism for single sign-on so what
problems does it solved well there's a
bunch of them the first in the really
obvious one is the too many passwords
problem we all have far too many
accounts on far too many services with
which which
protected by usernames and passwords of
course you should never use the same
password on lots of different sites
because if one of them gets compromise
you lose all of them but who can manage
an individual password for everything
they sign up for and this is probably as
okay some of us can burn that you're a
statistical anomaly let's face it so so
we've all got too many passwords and as
early adopters and technologists this is
a big problem for us but it's going to
be a problem it's a problem for regular
users soon and if it isn't it regularly
users right now and it'll be an even
bigger problem for them as as the stuff
we do becomes even more pervasive so
that's problem number one second problem
someone also it already grabs my
username you go to a site it asks you to
pick a username and you try using them
after using them they've all already
been registered and there's another
problem which really affects those of us
who have chosen to expose our lives
online and that's that my online profile
is scattered across dozens of sites I've
got a flickr account to twist a twitter
account youtube accounts I've got
accounts everywhere and personally I'd
quite like to be able to tie those
together into a more of an integrated
whole so that's what open idea is what
is an open ID in an open ID is sit quite
simply a URL here are some of mine I'm
site I'm s willison dot livejournal com
I'm Simon wmi open ID com Simon with us
and dot net which is domain that I
actually own and thanks to AOL I've got
open ID door AOL com / Simon with us and
we're so I'm Wilson is my AOL screen
name and in fact 63 million people who
have AOL accounts actual have open my DS
already and they probably just don't
know about them so that's what an open
ideas but what can you do with one and
really open ID you can only do one thing
it's very simple you can claim that you
own it I can I can make an assertion to
someone that I own Simon Willis Annette
or Ione s we'll listen I've junk on and
then I can prove that claim and that and
for that reason white like why is that
useful it's because you can use it for
authentication the fact that you are the
only person who can assert ownership
over a particular URL means you can use
that fact to authenticate with services
so it might work like this you go to a
site and the site goes who the heck are
you and you go well I'm Simon willison
dotnet prove it magic happens this is
I'm going to be jumping I'm going to be
skipping most of the technical details
because you're smart smart people you
can read the spec okay you're in so I've
logged in to the site
so if it's doing single sign-on it's a
bit like Microsoft possible well it is
but firstly you don't need to ask
Microsoft mission to implement this on
your site and secondly Microsoft don't
get to own your credentials and
credentials of everyone else in the
world which even if it's not Microsoft
that's that's still a little bit creepy
when I don't know if that's what we want
to happen so who does get to own your
credentials who gets to look after your
identity for you and with open ID you
the user decide who that is so you pick
your own provider you find a company or
organization that you trust to when
you're open ID for you just like you do
with email and so does this mean I'm
still giving somebody the keys to my
kingdom it does but it can be someone
you trust and again just like email if
you have the ability to run software on
your own server you can you can be your
own open ID provider you can answer
answer to no one so how do you use this
thing and this is where the embedded
videos will hopefully work I'll show you
this is an example of signing in to a
site called Zoomer calm which is a
online photo-sharing site you go there
and zuma says login with your open ID so
it gives you a box and asks you for your
open ID so i'll enter my open ideal
enter livejournal 1s wilson livejournal
com i click the button there and I'm
redirected back to my provider so Zoomer
says okay that's their open ID who's the
provider for this it's livejournal say
they redirect me over to live journal
site live journal says you need to be
logged in to go out another site
permission to know your identity so i'm
going to log into livejournal using my
regular livejournal username and
password and once I've logged in
livejournal asks me a question it says
okay now you're logged in another site
on the web wants to validate your
livejournal identity essentially zuma
wants to know who you are is this okay
and there are three options I can say
yes just this time I can say yes always
or I can say no I'm going to say yes
always and I'm redirected back to Zuma
and I'm signed in with that livejournal
account so I've signed in to Zuma
without having to give to Zuma password
and that's like it's kind of nice but I
still had to enter a username password
didn't actually save me any time nice
thing about this is if I log out of zuma
zuma because I'm now permanently logged
into livejournal I've got live journals
cookie on my machine if I should I try
and login to zoom
again it'll get it'll oh so my geezers
don't have to sign for an account hang
on oh here we go so now I'm signing out
of I'm signing out of zuma and I go to
sign in again I really hope I've got
that video in there there we go but this
time i'm already logged in to live
general and I told like gentleman I
always trust Zoomer so when I click the
button instead of being I get redirected
to live jaylen you can see that
happening if you look at the status bar
and then I get redirected straight back
to Zoomer and logged in so that's single
sign-on why we're wearing you only enter
your username you don't even have to you
don't enter a password at all a nice
thing about open ID is in the same way
that ecommerce sites have standard names
for your address field in your postcode
and so on open ID does the same thing so
your browser can even autocomplete that
field for you so does this mean that my
users don't have to sign up for an
account does this mean I'm basically
saying to hell with accounts i'm not
going to have any accounts and hence I
don't really have a database of the
people using my service well no not
necessarily an open ID actually tells
you very little about a user you don't
know their name you don't know their
email address you don't know if they're
a person or some evil robots or a dog or
anything and so where do you get that
information from well obviously you you
ask them just like you would with a
regular person who comes up and signs
out for the count on your service an
open ID can even help them answer your
questions and this is another demo this
is a feature of open ID called simple
registration and the my open ID com
provider lets you set up personas so it
lets you set up essentially collections
of attributes about yourself here I've
saved a persona with a nickname a full
name and email address and now if I go
to sign up for Anna site for the first
time magnolia here is a online bookmark
site it gives me the option to sign up
normally or it lets me sign up with an
open ID so i'll put in my Simon Wilson
doc my open ID com address I'm sent back
here and in addition to asking me if I
want to sign of Magnolia it also says
Magnolia also wanted to collect your
nick name and your email address and
your full name and I can say yes that's
fine or if I don't want Magnolia to get
those details I can edit them but again
I I say that's okay I click allow
forever when we directed back to
Magnolia but it pre fills in some of the
fields and the registration form so it
is just a smart way of them
simple way of pre filling some fields
but it does help out with that initial
account creation process and again
create my account go straight through
and now I've got a brand new council
Magnolia but I didn't really have to all
I really have to do is enter my open
idea and click a couple of buttons how
do I tell if someone's an evil spam bot
well again it's just like you would with
a regular account you get them to you
challenge them with some kind of capture
so how does open ID actually work what's
really going on behind the scenes well
an open idea is a URL and the URL you
have a web page in this case um Simon
will send up my open ID com is this
weather an attractive page they've
actually redesigned since I took these
screenshots I'm tell you this is not an
identity page but if you view source on
this page you get this you get a little
link element saying link rel equals open
ID server and href equals my open edict
ID com / server and that link element is
what turns a URL into an open ID so you
go to a site you say I'm Simon listen
top my open ID com a site fetches the
HTML from that page passes it and looks
for that link element which tells them
where your identity provider is and at
that point they know who they're going
to who they're going to send you to they
then establish a shared secret with
their identity provider they use
diffie-hellman key exchange that and
that's because the site you're logging
into in your provider may never have
heard of each other but they do need to
transmit a little bit of information
securely so that they know that you're
not sat in the middle like lying about
so they can assert the claim that's
being sent between the sites the site we
directs me to the identity provider if
i'm logged in now I got read it get
redirected back so that that link tag is
all that is all you need to turn the
page into an open ID let the site you're
signing in to know where it can wear it
should send you to check your identity
how does your open ID how does your
identity provider now how you are well
so far I've shown you stuff with
usernames and password but open ID
deliberately doesn't specify how
authentication with the provider should
work so while usernames and passwords
are common providers can use other
methods if they want to and providers
are already experimenting with things
like clients ssl certificates that you
install in your browser out-of-band
authentication via an SMS text message
or an email or a java message people
have worked with IP based login
restrictions there's one guy that
actually set up a dynamic dns think so
that his open ID provider would
recognize a few was on his home now
work and led him straight in but if he
was someone else who would ask him to
authenticate and people are working with
secure ID key files which i'm sure
everyone here has one of those little
things with the number that changes and
is part is part of the two-factor
authentication to get into an account
you could even have something that
there's no authentication at all it just
says yes to any to any question about
who owns an open ID like just say yes
why is that useful well it's the open ID
equivalent of a site you may have seen
called bugmenot calm and bug be not calm
is a site you can go to and you can say
I need a username password for the New
York top via New York Times calm and
it'll give you one and that the service
exists because there are lots of sites
out there that force you to register to
access their content but as a user you
don't care about that account you get no
value for it you don't care if lots of
other people use it so people are
already start already share username and
password accounts and open ID someone's
built a service which does essentially
the same thing there's a site JK Gigi
iron / open ID which you'll say yes to
any request that comes in and again
users give away their passwords today
this is just the open ID equivalent of
doing that what do you do if you decide
that you hate your provider you've been
using this open ID provider for a while
and then they do something really creepy
and you decided you don't want to trust
them anymore well you can use your own
domain name or a site that you own and
you can delegate to a provider that you
trust and I do exactly that on my my own
site this is Simon we listened on that
it's my blog and if you view source on
Simon listened on that you can see it's
got these magic lines open ID server to
say that it's open ID but also open ID
delegate and if I try and log into
something with Simon Wilson at that site
pulls back those tags MIT says okay well
his open ID provider is livejournal com
and his open and the open ID I need to
check is actually s willison livejournal
com so instead of checking that I'm
Simon Wilson dotnet it'll go and check
if I mess with us and livejournal com
and if I am it'll let me sign in the
Simon with us and dotnet nice thing here
is that if I decide I don't want to use
livejournal com anymore I can switch to
another provider change those two lines
of HTML page and I can keep on using my
open ID whilst well switching out the
provider that I'm trusting with my
identity and support for delegation is a
compulsory part of the open ID spec
which really helps minimize lock in and
keep this thing truly decentralized
there's so everyone
end up with one open ID that they use
for everything that's not actually the
plan and this is probably not going to
happen I mean I for one have half a
dozen open IDs already I've shown you
some of them so far and this really ties
into a bigger bigger thing where people
like to maintain multiple online
personas they've been doing that since
people started using the internet on
Usenet or whatever you might have the
personas you for your professional
things which is tied to your real name
and you use for going to conferences and
whatever you may have a social persona
used with your friends which might be
your mice sort of spin out from your
myspace page you may have a secret
persona that you use for doing things
online that you don't necessarily want
other people to know about an open ID
actually makes it easier to manage these
multiple personas you create a separate
open ID for each one because three
accounts is still better than three
dozen different accounts and it it makes
it easy for you to keep track of which
identity you'll put your presenting to
which particular site or service bill if
an open idea is just a URL is there
anything else interesting you can do
with it aside from signing into things
and well yes there is different open IDs
can express different things and I think
there's one of the things that makes
open ID so interesting so I've shown you
a bunch already but my air well open ID
embeds my AOL instant messenger screen
name so if I sign in to a service with
that the service snap now knows how it
can send me instant messages sun sun
microsystems recently in a launch an
open ID provider that's only available
to sun employees so if you see an open
ID from open ID suncom you can be sure
that the owner of that open ID code is
one of sons 33,000 employees with access
to that service and there are things you
could potentially do last.fm the music
sharing service knows a lot knows and
represents a bunch of stuff about your
taste in music so if they supported open
ID you could say if someone signs in
with open ID from last.fm i now know how
to look up their taste in music and
maybe provides personalized services
around that my livejournal open ID first
first ever tells you where to find my
blog and by extension it shows you where
to find an RSS feed about me but it also
links through to a friend of a friend
father livejournal have and listing
listing my friends on livejournal and
there's a service called do X or Y com
which already is already using this for
contacts import you sign in to do or
axial do X or Y comm with a livejournal
open ID and it'll look up your friends
on livejournal check if they're in the
do X or Y comm system if they are gives
you the option to friend
there as well I'm personally I think
friend import is a killer app for open
ID and technologies like it why would
you implement open ID over all the other
identity standards well quite frankly
open ideas do simple the specification
is about two pages long I think
conceptually it makes a great deal of
sense and also it follows the UNIX
philosophy of development where open ID
rather than taking on this enormous
problem of identity which can start
massive debates that go on for years and
never really get anything done it picks
one tiny little problem and solves that
with the idea being that you build this
thing that solves one problem then you
build all of the other interesting stuff
on that but on that one basis if you
enter if you know your internet theory
open ideas what people call the dumb
network so the Internet's described as a
dumb network because the internet knows
nothing of the packets that's
transmitting from point A to point B it
knows that it had its job is to get data
from one place to another but it doesn't
know what the data is it doesn't know
what it represents and the internet is
interesting because of all of the
applications people build on the edges
of that network that do know about data
format I think with open ID the same
things going to happen we're open idea
is a very dumb protocol for saying this
person there's this empty up can assert
ownership of this URL but people will
then start to build stuff on top of it
that do interesting things around the
edges without the open ID specification
needing to be changed at all and also
many of the competing identity standards
and now on boards the a now on board
with open ID about a year and a half ago
a bunch of people who are working on
competing standards for decentralized
and URL based identity got got behind
open ID and sort of contributed their
ideas to that so at least from the point
of view of the identity community it's
got it's got some pretty major backing
it will really looks like it's going
somewhere but a fundamental problem that
people have with single sign-on is
doesn't this mean I'm putting all of my
eggs in one basket and surely that's a
really bad idea what someone steals my
open ID they can steal everything and
this is absolutely true and the bad news
is that the chances are you already do
this and the chances are the people on
the internet are already doing this
because of the I forgot my password
feature that you get on pretty much any
website and I forgot my password means
your email account is already an sso
mechanism if somebody stole my gmail
account they could do a search for
password reminders
and they'd find accounts from hundreds
and hundreds of sites that I've coupled
with that gmail account so open ID
really just makes it a little bit
obvious that this is what people are
doing what about fishing and I know this
is the principal concern about open ID
for most people the ant fishing is a
major problem it's a big problem with
open ID because well I'll show you an
example let's say someone builds a site
called i can haz lolcatz and it's a
service where people can go and create
log cats and have fantastic fun
bothering their friends with them and so
here's that site it goes sign in with
your open ID and like yeah I don't even
have to create an account here so I
answer my open ID click the button it
sends me to my density provider but
actually it's an evil lolcat site and
it's some it serves up a fake edition of
my identity provider it it pulls down
the HTML it rewrites the forms so this
is a different URL but who looks at URLs
and so instead of lock out so I get
identity theft and so the fishing stuff
works because you go to an untrusted
site and it redirects you to supposedly
your trusted provider and this should
sound familiar because paypal do this
Yahoo browser based authentication do
this google or do this and Google
Checkout do this as well so yeah this is
a problem fishing is a major problem
it's a problem that you guys already
have and you really need to look into
solving open ID does not change this in
the slightest there are there are a
bunch of solution I mean the open ID
community is thinking very hard about
this and a bunch of solutions have come
up one solution that people have is
since the problem is you redirect to a
page where you authenticate just don't
let the user login on that land on the
identity private I provide a landing
page so I run an open ID provider called
ID proxy net and if you attempt to sign
in using open ID to there and you're not
logged in you'll get this screen instead
says you need to sign in you need to
login to ID proxy don't need to complete
this process you should use a bookmark
or type in the address to do this this
page does not contain any links to
protect you from fishing now this is not
the solution to fishing because a fish a
fishing site could serve up this page
and say new improved usability click
here to enter your password that kind of
thing and and most people will know the
difference but from my point of view
I've run this provider I do know the
difference and I find this makes me a
little bit more comfortable about using
it because I don't I
if I forget to check the URL bow I'm not
going to get fished there are better
solutions so one solution that's quite
important these days is card space card
space is a new thing built into Windows
Vista which i think is also available
for Windows XP as part of some enormous
service pack style net download but card
space is specifically designed to combat
fishing and it's a way of signing into a
site where instead of entering a
username and password you click to you
click on the use card space thing and
card space then takes over you entire
screen it's like full-page the idea
being that website like phishing sites
can't do that I wonder if they could do
that with flash I'm not sure and so but
card space is Microsoft's big bet again
big gamble on on solving the fishing
problem and this leads us through to the
to another idea which is native browser
support for things like Open ID now
verisign are doing a lot of work with
open idea and they put out this firefox
extension called seatbelt and seatbelts
basically sits in your browser watching
what you're doing and it looks out for
evidence that you're starting an open ID
transaction and if you are it makes damn
sure that you're doing that against your
identity provider and not some fake it
gives you other little things like them
the the seatbelt toolbar will tell you
if you're signed in to your identity
provider that will encourage you to sign
in to provide the first thing when you
launch your browser and that's that's
really good news and firefox mozilla
have announced that firefox 3 is going
to have open ID support at least it's
one bullet point on a massive list on
their wiki so hopefully in firefox 3
they'll they'll integrate something like
seat belt which will help help deal with
this problem but on a more on a on a
more sort of mana or the less technical
basis i think one thing we're going to
see is competition between providers as
a driver for solutions to fishing and
security if you're looking for an open
ID provider there are loads of them out
there and they're that there are more
there are more every every few months
and if those providers can convince you
that they have better security better
phishing protection than the other
providers then that's one way that they
can distinguish themselves and convince
people to sign up for them and again
we're already seeing this happen my open
ID com as I showed you earlier recently
launched client-side browser
ssl-certificates as a as a way of
securing your securing you open ID as
another there's another concept I heard
quite recently which i think is very
interesting and
using a permanent cookie set using an
out-of-band token so one great way of
solving fishing is you do out-of-band
authentication when someone tries to
sign in you SMS text message them a
authentication code which they have to
enter so then when they're trying to
sign it with phishing site they don't
get the message and they can't continue
and what you can do is use that open use
that out of ban token to set a permanent
cookie in their browser saying okay this
browser has done that stage of
authentication and then you won't be
bothering them without of bound messages
in the future but should they start
using a different browser you can send
them one time message to to set that
browser up as as authenticated and they
still have to login normally but a
phishing site which never got hold of
that cookie wouldn't be able to sign
into your system so I think that's
something people really need to start
looking at what are best practices for
open ID consumers for sites that people
log into with open ID well the first one
is that you need to you need to keep hot
keep on to that I forgot my password
thing but you need to offer it as I
can't sign in using my open ID so
there's something wrong and that's so
that when someone's provider goes down
they can still log into your site if
they forget who they're open ID provider
is which could potentially happen they
can still log in as well you also one
thing that's very important I forgot to
make a slide for is that providers
shouldn't be replacing usernames and
passwords with open ID because doing so
instant mean it's ninety-five percent of
your audience won't have the slightest
idea how to use your service open ID
doesn't replace usernames and passwords
it provides an alternative to them so
the sites i showed you earlier Magnolia
the sign in page says login with your
username and password and then
underneath it says if you've got an open
ID you can log in with that instead and
I think that's definitely the way people
need to adopt this stuff I said you
should allow people to associate Oakland
IDs I actually think you should allow
people to associate multiple open IDs
with a single account on the site now a
bunch of reasons to do that firstly and
again people can still sign in if one of
their providers is down if live gentles
down i'll sign in with my my open ID com
account and I can still get to my
account it also means people can
unassociated open ID without locking
themselves out which is quite useful but
most importantly it means you can take
advantage of these site specific
services around each of their open IDs
if you've got a single account on your
site and people have signed in use and
if people signed into that account using
AOL account so you know they ute there
AOL screen name and they signed in with
the last.fm account so you know that I
see music you can start gathering more
information more services about that
single user in your system are there any
other neat tricks you can do this stuff
well there's a ton of these and this is
open ID is at its core single sign-on
but because it provides a URL the fact
because it provides a globally unique
identifier for your users you can build
a stack of interesting things on top of
it and the first one of these and I
think this is the killer app is the
portable contact list though talked
about earlier with respect to a friend
of a friend and there's also work going
around or on around microformats of this
stuff so an open ID takes you to a page
with a microphone exif endless
ex-offenders a way of listing your
friends site can then pass that pull out
those friends and import them into your
new system so you don't have to go
through that rigmarole of signing up for
a new social software side and then
certainly adding hundreds of people that
you know jit work no just to try out the
service here's a great problem which you
guys have and that's the Facebook and
lots of other sides currently ask for
users Google user name and password just
so they can sign into their gmail
account and and look at their contact
list and I don't need to tell you why
that's a horrible idea that the sooner
the Internet can come up with a standard
that means people aren't doing that the
better then the damage in a way the
damage is already being done in teaching
users that it's okay to give your
username and password to any site that
asks for it and but back to cool things
you can do with you with open ID another
one which I really like is this idea of
lightweight account services where you'd
never normally sign up for an account
because it's like commenting on
someone's blog or whatever but you are
willing to sign in with an open ID and
so I think that and in that in that
respect open ID ends up acting as a
basically way of making persistent
cookies so whereas there are preferences
that you'd save in a cookie normally but
the cookie would eventually expire or
the user would switch to another machine
if you instead associate those
preference with their open ID then
you've got the same kind of dated store
in a cookie but it can be persisted
across any time they log in with the
same open ID another thing you can do is
pre approved account so let's say I set
up a collaborative weblog for members of
my band and then rather than sending
them all an email saying I've set up a
new wordpress install you guys should
log in and set a password and all of
that you just quit you pre-approved
they're open IDs you sticking the list
of the four open IDs of the band members
and then you can say and
then you can say to them hey I've set up
a blog and you guys can all login
already in a way it's like having a
public key for ssh authentication which
you distribute to anyone so they can put
it on their server and you can log in
without you without without you having
to do anything else extra another thing
for open ID Social whitelist so I do
this on my own weblog I've got a comment
spam filtering system which is has a
bunch of weird rules in it but one of
the rules is that if you saw if you post
the comment and you're signed in with an
open ID that I've already approved you
skip the entire comment spam system and
what's nice that is I can publish that
list of people I can publish the list of
the 30 or so open IDs that I trust to
post comments on my site and then anyone
else can say well i'm going to let
anyone post on my site who's Simon let's
post on his site so we can build these
white list and start distributing them
and sharing them across lots of people
and hopefully that will help to tied
some tight at least some of the masses
of comment spam that everyone's getting
open idea microformats I mentioned
earlier the idea of having xfm there but
really with microformats mean that you
have data on a page that that can be
extracted out an open ID is a great way
of essentially doing lookups for
microformats so you say here's my open
ID you can prove ownership over at the
site can then go to that open ID and
suck any and every microformats out of
that page so it fits in with my
performance really nicely and a much
bigger idea is this concept of
decentralized social networks and
there's a nice quote from a guy called
Gary McGraw who said people keep asking
me to join the linkedin network but I'm
already part of a network it's called
the internet and what I want to see
happen is open is services based around
open ID and coming up with ways of doing
the same sort of convenience that you
get from centralized social networking
services like Facebook and MySpace and
so on but in decentralized manner so we
don't end up all relying on on one
provider for all of our online social
network he interactions but back to
questions about open ID there's a
question you hear a lot and actually
this is probably one of the scariest
things for people who are thinking about
implementing open ideas a as a consumer
is doesn't having open ID mean I'm
outsourcing the security of my users to
untrusted third parties my site security
could be amazing but if my users sign up
with some completely untrustworthy open
ID provider their accounts ago
to get stolen I can't do anything about
it and well yes it does but again so did
these forgotten password emails and with
we've forgot like I said earlier
forgotten password you go there you
click I've got my password emails your
one-time token and so right there you're
outsourcing the security of your site to
whoever the user was chosen as their
email provider I'm not saying this is an
ideal situation but it does at least
mean that if you're willing to put it
I've forgotten my password link on your
site you should be willing to adopt open
ID the threat model is essentially the
same so if email is secure enough for
yep so email is secure enough you use
authentication then so is open ID and
really password emails these forgotten
your password things actually SSO
already they just SSO with a
deliberately bad user experience what
are the privacy implications and stuff
this is the other question that comes up
comes up frequently and well there's a
bunch of these that the most obvious one
is cross correlation of accounts if I'm
using an open ID and lots of different
services someone or something could tie
or some crawler could tie together BM
all of those accounts and build up a
huge profile of my activity online and i
think there's there's an important
lesson for open ID consumer sites is
that you should never publish your users
open ID without making it abundantly
clear that you're going to do that like
I will trust a site I I'm okay with
Flickr but with with different blogs
posting my open ID so I can tie my
comments together but at the same time I
need to know them that's going to happen
you should at the very least you should
allow users to opt-out of sharing their
open ID so if you sign up for a forum
you can if you sign up for a form you
can either say yeah display my open ID
under the posts i make or you can or you
can pick a username to em distinctly for
that forum is this going to lead to the
online equivalency the online equivalent
of a credit reporting agency if you can
tie these different things together and
yet again this is already a problem with
email you right now today you could a
bunch of sites could conspire against
their users and cross-correlate their
email date berbere email addresses and
build up a massive profile and I'm not a
lawyer but I'm pretty sure the legal
protection protections against that kind
of thing already exist beard in the form
of privacy laws data protection laws or
just and the ridiculous some privacy
agreements that everyone
nobody reads and every one click
straight through so again it's not a new
problem and there's a new feature in in
open ID to point naught but called
directed identity that's tacit that end
to solve this problem with directed
identity when you sign in with an open
ID instead of entering your open ID you
enter the URL of your provider and
provided then invents a one-time open ID
that only works for your account on that
one side so the very least the the
site's can't correlate you your identity
providers still knows all of the places
you're signing into but at least they
can't correlate your open ID and figure
out that your accounts are the same
patents patents are always scary and
there's some good news on this front
because both Sun Microsystems in
verisign have announced what's called
what's called a patent covenant and
again I'm certainly not a patent lawyer
but as my interpretation of this is that
both those organizations have said that
they won't smack you down with their
patents if you're implementing stuff
around open ID 1.1 and maybe more
importantly they will smack down anyone
else who tries to assert their patents
against open ID so patents are basically
this ridiculous Cold War but at least
open ID has a couple of massive allies
on its side looking at looking out for
it who else has involved with this stuff
well this is a slide I I stole from
David recordin who does a lot of talks
bad open ID I'm showing the total
relying parties that is consumer site
sites you can log into using an open ID
according to one provider my open ID com
which is one of the more popular
providers you can see that adoption has
been going up it's a pretty healthy
looking adoption curve there are now
around about 3500 sites you can sign
into with open ID and if the trend
continues we're going going to be we're
going to see that number keep on
increasing especially as open source and
open source projects like movable type 4
which is becoming open source now has
support for open ID so it'll get
increasingly easy for people to create
new sites that you can sign into with an
open ID one major backer of open ID is
AOL AOL quietly set themselves up as a
open ID provider back in February the
thing where any of six also any of the
63 million AOL user accounts workers
open IDs and they have announced at a
pretty dope conference in Paris a few
weeks ago but they're going to be a full
consumer by the end of July so any any
AOL service that you can sign into with
a free account
you'll be able to use an open ID instead
and that that's pretty exciting on the
Microsoft front Bill Gates expressed
Express Microsoft's interest at the RSA
conference again a few months ago and
unfortunately I haven't really I haven't
really found anyone who understands
quite what that means as as far as we
can tell it's mainly as good PR for
their card space thing he could say
Microsoft really like open ID and with
the addition of card space it'll be
secure from fishing so but but at least
they're both shown interest I mentioned
sun microsystems who have this patent
covenant and they have 33,000 employees
who have Sun only open IDs so they're
already pushing the boundaries on what
it means to have an open ID one thing I
forgot to put a slide in fall was the
country of Estonia Estonia a few years
ago introduced electronic ID cards for
one for their one and a half million
population and quite recently though
some evidently someone in the Estonian
government is quite forward thinking he
said well we've got these ID card let's
do an open ID provider as well so pretty
soon you'll be able to you'll see people
signing in for an Estonian open ID
provider that proves their name their
first name their last name and they're
in estonian citizen and that's like
that's pretty mind-blowing but it's it's
really interesting to see that kind of
stuff happening already six apart
actually invented open ID open ID was
invented by brad fitzpatrick of
livejournal and it's built into a lot of
six apart products so a livejournal is
an open ID at type kiev up and vox
accounts are both open ids you can sign
into some of their stuff with open ideal
though not as much as I'd like and
they've recently announced open ID
support for movable type force so
that'll again will really help push
adoption insights that you can sign in
to verisign i mentioned verisign
seatbelt stuff david record on who's one
of the key one of the principal editors
of the open ID spec is a full-time
verisign employee and they've got their
own open ID provider as well there's a
company called Jan Wayne which you may
not have heard of but they're pretty
important because they're based in
portland oregon and they're responsible
for basically ninety percent of the open
ID libraries the open source libraries
that people use the integrating open ID
so if you're building sites in Ruby
Python PHP you can go to these guys and
get a fully formed really nicely really
well tested like a library for to help
you implement open ID now Yahoo Who am I
Who I used to work for supporting an
open ID but only indirectly and this is
a there's a hack that I built back in
January called ID proxy dotnet what id
proxy net does it's an open ID provider
but instead of you creating an account
there you sign into it using your yahoo
account through Yahoo's browser based
authentication really the i did this
more as it more to prove a point than
anything else and the point was that if
you're going to do some kind of
authentication api if you're going to do
yahoo bb or Thor google earth or
whatever you may as well support open ID
as well because if you don't somebody
like me will crop up and build a
middleman in the middle i actually know
of one of these that have a similar site
that does this for for google accounts
as well i just don't think the guys
quite quite wrapped it up for release
just yet so yeah google that's the big
question are you guys going to do open
ID and I think there's there's a bunch
of great reasons to do it but there's
the fact that someone else would do it
for you there's the yeah i mean III was
quite tempted to just the original
version of ID proxy donut actually used
Google authentication but you're off API
doesn't really it doesn't really support
single sign-on at the time I had to ask
for permission to access the users
calendar even though I had no interest
in there Candace so I found that a bit
creepy and ended up not not not
launching that but there's a bunch of
things within Google that open IDs
really well-suited for there's things
like if you're if you're editing Google
Documents maybe you'll want to maybe you
want to share that document with a bunch
of people so you could instead of the
thing you do at the moment you could say
well these five open IDs have the
ability to see this document using the
account pre-approval stuff and again you
got you have your authentication API
when you what you solve the fishing
problems of stuff for that it would be
really great to have a Google open ID
provider that people could start like
trusting and then building other stuff
on top of now if you want anymore if you
want any more about this stuff and open
idea net is the user unfriendly but
develop a friendly home of the
specifications open ID enabled calm is a
site that links through to the open
source libraries full of these different
languages so you can start playing with
that and I'm a bit of an open ID magpie
I collect stuff about it from all over
the place and stick it up online at
Simon Wilson net / tags / open ID and
I've managed to leave 15 minutes for
questions so thank you very much
okay there's a question right there at
the front I would love to know the
answer to that um why now why didn't
this happen five years ago I have no
idea five years ago I was still in
school right now five years ago I was
just starting University and I think
people had already tried this stuff with
passport and so on but what they'd
missed is the importance of it being
decentralized no one's going and like
six apart had their type key thing but
no one's nobody wants to trust one
single provider that sits in the middle
and controls every one's identity and I
think we'll open ID it is it it's an
idea where you look at it you think
that's so obvious how could someone not
have come up come up with it already but
as it was it was brad fitzpatrick that
first put the proposal together in back
in 2005 and since then it's been quietly
brewing away and people have been poking
at and experimenting with it and
eventually getting excited about it and
i think it's it's about time that it
broke out and really started getting
popular there's question there at the
front I know nothing about Kerberos
early so I won't take that question
sorry once were in the blue to blue
shirt a man in the middle or something
would you change the data location
identifier linkedin your site yep to be
the one that accepts everything that
suddenly mean everybody can sign yes it
does and III and this really scared me a
few a few weeks ago when dreamhost who
are a really popular website house lost
3500 ftp passwords to in undisclosed
circumstances and that was pretty scary
because yeah if any of those people have
been using hosting an open ID and that
their past will get out then their page
could be changed and this is why I think
it's important that companies with
really good reputations for securities
start supporting this stuff like I I run
my open ID off my own little virtual
server and I I can't say for sure that
it's secure but if there was a if there
was a like if Google we're hosting my
open ID and promoting the fact that
they're really good at security that
would be a great thing for the standard
and again but yet again it ties back to
email like you could somebody could
crack my email account
steal all of my forgotten password
reminder protected things oh yeah really
I really should start doing that there
is a delete button in gmail now so so
maybe I should start using it there in
the gland shirts which so when you were
describing it before you started before
you answer the question about 20 the
first thing I thought of is gee I'm
going to want a dynamic number of these
with which are randomized and all focus
back to the same underlying I absolutely
what's the status of 200 I was almost
hoping people wouldn't ask that so 20 is
an ongoing effort to incorporate it's
got some great ideas on it like this
like this directed identity stuff but
it's also kind of it's a bit of a result
of all of these different identity
standards getting together a year and a
half ago and as a result it's quite big
it's a lot bigger than open ID for 1.1
there's stuff in there which personally
I'm not at all excited about and so I'm
kind of hoping that that that the
directed identity bit from 20 will be
back ported to 1.1 and maybe to create
1.2 I know people are talking about
doing that because that's a feature I
really want but there's other stuff into
point I which a lot of people aren't
quite as excited about I'm just in front
it front now
it seems like as a consumer why would I
want that allow any open eyes view
provider we make more sense to be
whitelist providers that I think of hot
so the question now is as a consumer why
would I want to allow any open ID
provider wouldn't it make more sense to
whitelist just the ones that I trust and
I think you're absolutely right now the
open ID there are people within the open
ID community who will strong will shoot
down that ideas being against the spirit
of open ID I couldn't disagree more I
think open ID like I said it's a dumb
network it's up to people at the edges
how they use this standard and what use
they make of it and if you want to
whitelist a list of open ID providers
who you've sort of audited and you trust
their security then then I think you
should be allowed to do that at the same
time it's again it's it's back to the
Forgotten for the gotten password thing
there are sites that won't let you sign
up with a hotmail account because they
think you're more likely to be a spammer
so and I think really with open ID you
can you can start what you can start
whitelisting accounts that would be fine
but again you what you want to be pretty
inclusive because at the end of the day
you want people to sign in to your
service and if you tell them they can't
sign in because they use the wrong
provider they'll get upset and they'll
go away and they won't they won't try
out your thing there is some1 interest
one thing that I've been thinking about
recently is the case of banks now banks
do not offer a click here to be emailed
your password thing because I'd
presumably because they don't want to
outsource the skills you account to your
email provider and so I think for that
so I said anyone who does that should be
a willing score dope ID that means the
banks shouldn't be willing to support it
but yeah if there are providers that do
two-factor authentication and a
certified and so on then why shouldn't
the banks whitelist just those and say
yeah you can use open ID but it has to
be from this list of a dozen or so
providers which we know are really well
secured actually also get back
and they won't even talk to you without
yeah right yeah that would be great I'd
love my bank spin I'd resuming they up
their security which is a bit bit weak
at the moment I what I don't know if I
think UK but banks have just started to
send out those those key fobs which I'd
love to get something that's a really
good idea yes absolutely so the question
was open ID can help you fill out a form
on a site but you're still like from a
like you're still copying your data all
over the place if you ever change your
surname then you have to go and update
it everywhere and yeah absolutely people
are working on this stuff there's a
emerging standard for open ID called
attribute exchange which is currently
been working on which takes the simple
registration thing and extended it means
that you can pass pretty much any day to
like back and forth and again but you
could you could invent your own scheme
for that right now on top of open ID and
it would work but it's no good if not if
people if other people aren't using it
so I think there's a lot of room for
people to get involved with helping
build the specifications for that kind
of stuff and Kevin that one the other
thing is because open
prl legally
gamespot of
to edit the page use
like that so what about using open ID on
applications which are my picks so at me
like you know like my submission or
email are you those things so that's so
that's a really great quest the question
was what about using open idea on
applications in the aren't web base so
desktop applications and subversion
things and so on and there isn't a great
story for this yet like I said open ID
chose to solve one very small problem
and that problem was web based
authentication but actually yeah that's
it's very relevant people want to do
that kind of stuff now there are some
crazy hacks there are people who've got
subversion command line subversion
authentication working where when you
try to authenticate with subversion it
launches a local web server and then
fires up your browser and does the
redirection thing to your local web
server and then click shuts down again
and that works but yeah it's not not
ideal I think it's an ongoing question
how that's going to happen but the more
people involved with that and the more
demand there is that the more chance
that somebody will come up with a decent
solution right there in the light blue
so you mentioned a couple of big issues
with open ID that scare big
organizations you're putting all your
eggs in one basket and fishing another
one is usability usability studies
really show that the average person
doesn't yet get type in a URL instead of
using my passport okay so the question
there is usability the average user
doesn't get typing in a URL instead of a
username password now I hit this
argument a lot one thing I will say is
most uses they have no idea what the URL
is but you ask them what their MySpace
pages and they'll tell you it's WWI
space.com slash whatever so they
understand the concept of a URL as an
identity even if they don't get what
what else but even if they don't get the
implications of that now from the point
of view of open ID one thing I want to
see people start doing and I've
considered doing already is rather than
you say sign in with your open ID or if
you have a livejournal URL paste in here
or if you have a myspace account type in
your myspace ID or if you have an AOL
account type in your AOL ID and of
course what yeah I'm not so much
usability person but of course what
you're doing that is someone gives you
an AOL thing and you back open ID doral
com on the front and it just works so
again it is a problem
and it's something which there are smart
people in the world who solve that kind
of problem all the time so I think I
think it's a mountable you just need the
right people doing work to explain it to
people and show how it all works are
there any more questions one way to the
front oh that's really meant to talk
about that so yeah this isn't it there's
an issue open ID identify recycling and
this is where again this relates to what
if someone else someone else gets hold
of my domain or whatever i'm sure you
guys do this loads of people with a
really big user named user name database
to do this they've got like 100 million
accounts all of the good accounts are
gone somebody hasn't signed in for five
years so you make their identifiers
available for someone else to register
again and obviously that means that
person can then steal convened like log
into any accounts they'd use with open
ID now there are a couple of things i'll
say about that the first is obviously
with identify recycling you do only do
it after like a five-year gap at least i
hope you do but what you could do is say
if you've got a user database that you
use a database that isn't primarily for
open ID you could say okay we do
identify recycling but if you've ever
signed into anything with an open ID
then we don't we we stick that on that
we're not going to recycle this list so
that's that's part of the solution and
again a defense you can get come down to
is that this already exists with the
email if you're doing identify recycling
on my email address then someone else
gets my email address and they can use
forgotten my part forgotten passwords to
steal all of my old accounts so it's
it's not ideal but it's a wider problem
than just open ID days a lot of sites
this hazard water we
password
I have absolute well I don't know about
numbers of people using the same
username password and every site the
same so I imagine it's huge one thing
that's really interesting is you know
myspace got myspace got 35,000 of their
user accounts stolen in the fishing
thing last year it's a great attack
because what happens is somebody wrote a
little bit of CSS that put that put
their own sign in link and absolutely
positioned it over myspace is sign in
link and use that to steal accounts you
thought was quite ingenious but um that
but the 35,000 accounts that were stolen
were actually then circulated widely so
you can get hold of this some of this
database of 35,000 accounts and use it
to analyze what kind of passwords people
are using and Bruce Schneier wrote
something up on this a while back where
he pointed out that people actually use
in quite good passwords like a lot of
the passwords with seven characters are
more a lot of them mixed up case so
people's passwords are a lot better but
yeah ask for numbers of people using the
same username password I have no idea i
imagine i imagine it's huge but i
haven't seen a study actually response
lat only because I happen to know some
of these things up mhm just draw some
turban studies and the Bruce manthang
you just submit I'd love to talk to you
about this later but what is that a the
average user has 18 accounts lupin sites
and the average unit hat user has 3.49
passwords so another factor in your
service ok that was that was people
didn't hear that was the average user
has 18 user accounts and 3.49 passwords
yeah
he was kind of encouraging but the most
common password in that list was Dale
password one yes it was a very small
percentage of users that had it it was
the most common but Sterling's it was
the small percentage are there any more
questions in that case I think I think
I'll wrap things up thanks a lot i'll be
around for quite a while if you want to
talk to me about this afterwards so
thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
