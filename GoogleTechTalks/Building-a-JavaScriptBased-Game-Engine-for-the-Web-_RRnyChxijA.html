to the guys in Santa Monica Pittsburgh
and Cortland for video conferencing in I
would like to introduce Paul buckles who
is going to talk about his Java pure
JavaScript based web game engine thank
you so here we go so yes my name is Paul
Becker just for a quick introduction I'm
the guy who has started jQuery UI for
anyone who has played with jQuery and
jQuery before and therefore I'm quite
experienced in all kinds user interface
and this led me to one of my really most
sophisticated projects yet with which is
gaming on the web and today I will be
talking about how to build a game engine
and what I learned from from how I did
it so uh thanks for joining so actually
first question why build a game engine
for the web right what is the purpose
first of all let me show you how the
game development industry right now
looks like if you look at browser game
development versus console games and PC
games there's really a big difference
but on the end if you're a developer you
have the same questions to answer first
so you have questions such as what kind
of genre are you building what kind of
game is it being what doing is
single-player multiplayer
what platforms are you targeting what
tools do I need for development and how
does this how does this game actually
scale if it's multiplayer for instance
so the questions the basic questions are
always the same however if you look at
the classical game industry you have a
lot of convenience already available
there's a lot of middle where countless
tools and frameworks to choose from for
any kinds of of things for scripting for
3d rendering for anything so in that
picture here you see just to quick some
quick names you probably might have read
somewhere quake engine unreal
in unity Aldo's engines are already
available and no game developer in the
industry which would start over from
scratch just not happening because that
would require many many years of work so
that kind of also those frameworks are
really very easy to extend with other
changes and with other combinations and
modules so most of the companies are
licensed the framework and then build up
in it which is fine however if you look
at the browser game industry it's really
completely different so our browser
games are often grown from hobby
projects and development is often copied
from app dev proteins instead of actual
games there's no real technical standard
so it's not either C or Java it's really
the open web stack or flash or unity
there's all kinds of techniques there's
a lot and three's a lot of legacy code
flowing around and and I'm going to talk
about why why in a minute so secondly
browser games tend to have a long life
span and that's the issue with legacy
code right and they tend to have a much
longer life span than a normal game if
you build a console game and release it
might be that the sales are holding on
for for about a year if you're building
a browser game like Farmville or any of
those competition competitors really
that game is being there for many many
years to come
and that's the issue right you have to
maintain a lot of old code so we're
talking to many game publishers and they
mentioned it's a huge pain because they
have to maintain code that is ten years
old sometimes so really it's a different
word and that code isn't using a
framework so it's really custom it's not
interchangeable which is really tough if
you're looking at the frameworks we can
use in the web write anything at this
place in the browser you only have a
very limited choice so there's very few
good commercial flash frameworks that
you can use and there's no commercial
jealousy
frameworks that I know of and there's a
couple tiny projects if you look at
JavaScript most of them are concepts and
most of them are debt unfortunately so
if there was a framework right now I
would probably be using it and build my
own games but there wasn't so the
logical consequence really for game
publishers everything is being developed
in-house and you gonna have the in-house
technical knowledge and you need to
build up on it you have to build
in-house tools and you have to build in
your frameworks but why are there no
frameworks what's the reasoning behind
that first of all the browser game
industry is really young if you compare
it to the classical gaming industry the
game industry the classical game
industry has an advantage of about 25
years which is not to be underestimated
so really we're just starting we're just
in our children children right now and
then also only very recently we got
powerful enough hardware to back up
games so to run lots of crazy JavaScript
new advanced technologies html5 you
probably heard the buzzword already css3
all kinds of things popping up and and
many companies are behind those efforts
right now and it's really changing and
finally we have the engines like v8 in
Chrome and nitro in Safari that can
power games so for instance in our case
we have been building prototypes for the
last five years and every half a year we
found out we found out that the time is
not ready ahead
so we tried again in another half a year
and once again once again and finally
last year we discovered it's time to
release something so this is why I
gained all this experience additionally
and this is also very important there's
lots of knowledge needed to build
sophisticated games and many started it
as a hobby so all the game companies
you're seeing farmville I'm also sure
about far more than that
all the big strategy games a strategy
based browser games are really how big
and they're grown from a hobby and ugiy
it was a web developer by himself who
started this and then it just exploded
very quickly but there's an issue with
that because actual web devs are seldom
good game devs and vice versa
so we have a problem here really it's
very very hard to find someone who is
experienced with games and can build
user interfaces can can build a game
code I can do mathematics and combine it
with the web word right HTML right
JavaScript right CSS it's a tough job
really and there's very few around us
that know both both will so reality
without frameworks really looks like
this
countless iterations of code you write
everything from scratch this is really
how it is we've been going to many
companies and they all share the
frustration so that I say sweet right
sweet because we have no competition
right now there's high demand and you're
at Google probably know about this
because you're trying to get into gaming
big-time so let's rock so let's take a
look at the open web stack and how to
choose the right technologies right as I
mentioned already we have a huge mess of
technologies right now and we have to
care and pick wisely so if you look at
flash for instance we looked at flash
and we investigated if it would be the
right choice really from from a from a
from a from a flower head approach so a
flash has obviously this the
disadvantage that it works almost
everywhere but not on any of the
smartphones and if you're building a
desktop engine that might be fine right
however if you're trying to run on
smartphones and dreams iPhone whatever
right you're targeting flash is not your
choice and well I mean you could say
we've been seeing flash in Android and
the newest version of Android but it's
not there yet and it's not not
completely there yet for the customers
so I think personally is this they take
some time until we really see flash for
the mainstream audience
so when we analyze flash we saw the pros
obviously it comes with a pretty good
IDE so the flash IDE is very powerful
and and this is why many developers love
to use flash it's installed on most
desktops multimedia handling is very
easy platform independent rendering
office obviously and we really have some
good communication protocols as well so
it's a lot easier to use binary streams
to communicate with the server than it
is in HTML well in HTML it's not
possible actually so we still have to
find some some patterns contra
third-party JavaScript API sandwitches
cannot be embedded into flash because
flash doesn't have an HTML rendering
engine so there's no way to actually
it's really a black box there's no way
to really integrate mesh apps and
widgets and the open web in general so
that is one big hole scalable viewports
are very difficult to do and I have a
nice example later on and this should be
developed and is also very painful it
has been getting a bit better with with
flex I think but still you are compiling
your code and then it's very difficult
to maintain them and obviously no
relevant relevancy in a smartphone
market so what we choose obviously is
the open web stack we choose to develop
plug-in less and let me show you what I
can say about that right so Pro it works
on every mobile device and on every
desktop it adopts many flash features
and recently adopt many flash features I
use for instance video audio socket
there's very easy integration available
for which it most of the time you can
use services like YQL Google Maps embed
all this automatically into your code
there are tutorials floating around
everywhere so you can build a really
nice social game with it it is in fact
closer to how to closer the hardware so
flash has been getting hardware
accelerated for some time but now we're
seeing css3 being hardware accelerated
on mobile devices which is quite some
big leap forward so
in the future the browsers will be a lot
closer to the hardware than flash can
ever be because the development cycle is
a lot closer and flash like animations
are finally possible for instance using
CSS animations and CSS transforms we
really have some powerful tools here and
yeah
engines are already mentioned so what's
bad about HTML and CSS and JavaScript
obviously there's no real front end
ideas some of you might argue that
Dreamweaver is a real front-end IDE I
won't say any more about that that
development of great games is very
painful using those techniques obviously
because you have to care about cross
browser yet very few JavaScript experts
in the industry still even into in 2010
and especially with focus on gaming and
those are really the problems that we're
facing and obviously you have to combine
all T of all kinds of technologies
you're not writing in one language
you're writing in CSS HTML Javascript
mix so our pic was still HTML vanilla
HTML for rendering JavaScript for
scripting on decline n on this server
and canvas but not for rendering and I
show you why in a bit but as a tool so
and this then for having cross brow a
cross browser support we're using a
canvas from Google and to bring canvas
to to a cross platform and CSS
transforms we're using as well which is
now in Firefox and most webkit-based
browsers and we're doing a cross
platform using transformer which is a
plug-in hybrid recently that our email
emulate CSS transforms in index block so
but think about cross browser right if
your engine is really platform specific
if you're building a engine for Android
right then there's really no point in
doing cross browser because you're
wanting to do android games with it so
example mobile WebKit or mobile whatever
mobile gecko and there's pros and cons
to that obviously you have a limited
audience there
and you can't push it to other platforms
however there's an extreme development
speed-up so you really have to think if
you want to do that or if you want to do
a real cross-browser efforts because
it's going to take you three times the
amount of work that's one thing to think
about right also and that might help you
as well don't worry about today worry
about the future and so you have to pick
the technologies from the future because
if you're building a game engine right
now and then building games from it
chances are that you will not be ready
by 2012 right 2011 so really building an
engine and then building a great game
off of it will take some time so think
about the release time what will be what
kind of technological technologies can
you expect once you release your game
and that's really a key effort that you
have to think about and of course what
we're also using is jQuery and jQuery UI
jQuery mainly because it's a library
focused on certain tasks therefore it
doesn't get in our way so it would be
unwise to choose a really big web
application framework in JavaScript like
dojo because that would really limit us
in some extent for exams or ext J's as
well so we cannot have a framework that
restricts us because gaming is so
different and Jake it comes with great
event support as well we're using a lot
of event-driven code for the games and
you'll see you see later why we need
this why jQuery jQuery I really we can't
use any of the widgets because we're not
building a web application but jQuery I
comes with some great core helpers for
Mouse interaction for instance so that's
why we're using from Jake VI and right
so let's continue we now know what we
what kind of stack we're using right so
let's think about architecture and API
design so what what you want to keep in
mind when building for the web
first of all impossibilities if you
think about games you want to build
genres that can't be implemented now but
pretty soon I'll for instance casual 3d
games
simple shooters using WebGL so WebGL and
how many of you have tried it all out
already but WebGL is a pretty fresh new
standard that brings 3d to the browser
using OpenGL it's a very it's kind of a
direct almost direct port interface from
OpenGL and that also means that you do
not have any advanced shaders or
anything you have an integrative
framework so it will still take some
time until you will see really nice 3d
games using WebGL and Java that can't be
implemented now and for many years to
come in my opinion our next-gen 3d james
game so if you want to see a new Final
Fantasy on WebGL it will take some time
so WebGL is simply not as advanced as I
want it to be so we decided to do
something different we decided to focus
on 2d and 2.50 so 2.50 is isometric
projection and 2d obviously allows you
to build puzzles adventure games board
games card games platformers jump and
runs all kinds of 2d games and 2.50
allows you to build any kind of freaky a
3d game well I wouldn't build shooters I
guess and I wouldn't build a a racing
game but then on the other hand it's
really great for strategy games it's
really great for RPGs turn-based
strategy real realtime strategy and
simulation SimCity Francis so there's
really a lot of games you can handle
already using those those two
projections so we choose really what we
wanted to do and we hired a designer and
figured out what kind of game do we
really want to do and we choose this
kind of game so this is some prototype
matchups prototype screenshots that that
looks like a game we wanted to build
so you see isometric projection this is
the actual world and you see the
interior of the of the homes of people
so it would be kind of social experience
here that's what we imagining force for
prototype right so this is the kind of
game we wanted to build and that was our
vision
and then we need to we figured out what
we need for that right so if you think
about what are the requirements for that
game you need stuff like free mouse
panning infinite real-time works so I
want to have a connected world animated
characters chat bubbles collision
detection pathfinding walking into
houses mashups sound effects scalable
viewports and the list really is longer
than that there's a lot of stuff you
have to care about so most of you might
say okay this is awesome but it just
sounds like the Duke right so um really
but yes it sounds like the Duke and it
will take forever if you try to develop
a classic game engine but we're now
trying to do that we're trying to build
an engine that says focus it focus on
the web so we're really optimizing for
the web and I will show you what that
means
so let's actually get over to some code
let's show you some of the techniques
that we found out works for for games so
first of all rendering rendering is the
most important topic of all how do you
render 2,000 objects onto a map right
2000 houses or child's or whatever so
how do you do that how do you do it so
that is PD right so in our tests in our
experiments we're trying to render 2,000
elements in less than 50 second
milliseconds which is quite insane but
that that's what we wanted to achieve
and the most obvious idea was to use
canvas so yes we'll obviously use canvas
and we tried that we try to use canvas
and render but the set experience with
canvas really have lead us to realize
that canvas is a lot slower than HTML so
why is that the canvas image API API is
pretty inefficient because you first
need to arm to actually have a dumb
representation of the image so you have
to first load it in JavaScript have it
load until the end and then render to
the canvas so there's a step in between
and this makes rendering very
inefficient I will take a long time if
you're playing with menu graph
fix so if you're working with a lot of
graphics canvas is not your choice right
now if you're one if you want to do
something that really is abstract right
and doesn't use a lot of graphics you
might want to do canvas but in our case
it was way slower so what can you do
what can you do with HTML so first of
all block rendering now what does block
running read block rendering means
Dively replace in an HTML with a youth
string instead of multiple dumb append
actions so this gives you a huge
performance boost because that string of
HTML you're constructing is directly
parsed by the HTML engine so the HTML
engine is parsing the content and
displaying it which is a lot faster than
going through the dominant pending
elements there so it's really fast and
reflow and repaint two things the
browser is doing to display content are
only occurring once that's another big
advantage so in a dumb operation your
pending and you're doing the next step
and your pending and all the time it
needs to redraw first until it goes to
the next step in most cases so but then
on the other hand we have a huge
disadvantage here the use the huge
disadvantage is that you cannot
reference individual nodes enemy anymore
so if for instance you're having 500
houses and you want a rendering to
render them to a map right you have 500
houses and then you want to pick out one
of them and actually animate it right
I'll display something and I'll do a
click action in that one there's no
reference anymore to that house so how
can you fix that
we fixed that using lazy node linking
which is really fixing the main
disadvantages of the reference and after
inner HTML has been set you simply run a
query in this case using jQuery so
basically what it's doing it's a
grabbing of everything we build right
now doing it doing a list from it and at
most of the browser's have query
selectors so this is really fast it
probably will take a millisecond or
something and now you have a collection
of all elements that you just rendered
to the map
and since you know the order of how you
render it you can reference back so
really you just have to care about the
order of the rendering and then you can
reference back to the actual elements so
this is how you fix the referencing so
let's move to smart rendering smart
running I call something different so we
have that first step and it's already
pretty fast and will probably take
around 500 milliseconds still to render
2,000 elements why is that so if you
look at the code that gets rendered
right here on the left on the right side
and this would be one of those elements
it has position text top tags all kinds
of CSS in there margins background
images so this is one block and you've
got to have to do that two thousand
times right so you have a huge string
constructed and but this is really how
most people are doing it right now
so they're building this and styling via
via JavaScript and directly on the
StarTAC render them through in HTML and
that's still kind of slow so we really
want more so what did we do we realized
that we kind of forgot how to build
websites so the web method really is
don't ignore the layout layers so
especially not external CSS so one thing
you could do is actually keep the style
tag very very minified only use some
class names to actually hook them up to
CSS classes which then define background
images and all those things there's
still it sounds easier than it is
because those external style sheets
later on need to be rendered by the
server in real time but really this is
fixing so much of your pain because this
will render ten times faster so I don't
know why but it seems the parser is
really taking much longer time in
constructing that use string and then
depositing it instead of external slide
sheets so that would be one method also
what I also mentioned everything then is
rendered through the CSS rule right
including background margin padding etc
so that was rendering how about
delegation so how do you actually make
sure that someone can click on a house
so first of all event delegation how
many of you have heard about event
delegation already some hands okay few
event delegation is a technique to
forward events to implicit listeners so
in web development that Duty means the
following bill then find an event to the
root node so to the body tag for
instance except for the actual child
element for instance if you want to
click on a link tag on an a tag and you
want to bind a click event to it you
would use your binding to the a check
directly but in this case you bind it to
the root node and then filter out in the
call what kind of notes you clicked on
so this is event delegation which means
if another if you if you actually
replace that dead link later on and
bring another one in again it still
works because it's not really bound on
the actual node it's bound on the top
node and then references back so they
move the processing efforts and that's
also very interesting really moves from
when the event happens sorry truly event
happens so usually it takes a long time
to initialize all kinds of events but
what this means is you only initialize
an event once and then when the event
happens the processing is used to
calculate is this what I want to click
on so this really helps on speeding up
your applications so for us that means
we realize we only really need three
events and that are bound on our
prototypes so the one event is mousemove
which handles positioning a position
detection and dragging the other event
is mouse down which also handles drag
start and clicking and then they smell
sup which also handles direct stop and
clicking as well so those are the kind
of events that we're using and we're
only binding them once to the document
so get cool we have events bound and we
can click on houses now in theory but
what we also realized if if you see that
house here right now
this is a P&amp;amp;G that has some transparency
in it and obviously all developments are
rectangular so if the user actually
clicks on the left top corner it will
actually still trigger the click on our
house but he did click on that house
graphically so that's not what we wanted
so what we figured out this kind of
sucks and we really wanted to match the
users intent so you really need to be
creative about that we choose not to use
canvas but what we did now we build
click-through Maps so what I mean using
click by click through Maps means I
build up a pixel map for each of those
pngs and objects that tell us where the
transparent pixels are and then in the
event delegation I'm filtering those
transparent pixels out so that means if
you click on a house and you click on a
transparent pixel it will not execute
that click and this fixes our issue
which is really nice however building up
those pixel maps is a huge pain because
it really is not not fun if you want to
do it manually right you have to
seriously find out all the pixel
positions and get them into a map so
this is really not very effective so
we've realized we can have canvas do it
so what we're doing is canvas can
actually read the pixel data and from
images and then we can check if our
pixel is in fact transparent and save
this to a false value into a new
optimized smaller array and that array
is build up on real time every time the
engines loading for any kinds of
graphics so it just works and this is
really the only code you need for
building such a pitch pixel map which is
quite efficient so that's how you match
the clicks the clicks intent different
one this is actually one I haven't
talked about yet at any of the
conferences and any of the talk it's
brand-new and we're still working on it
it's called action surfaces so this is
something you can do in the web but not
anywhere else action surfaces really
means
it's basically a droppable for witches
or other objects so if you see the TV
here the black interior of the TV will
be the action surface and the action
surface is transformed to isometric
projection in real-time using CSS
transforms and that really is cool
because it allows you for instance to
drag Flickr pictures to your action
surfaces and those pictures transform in
real time to that isometric perspective
and to really show you how it works I'm
going to show you one quick example in a
bit so this is the code actually that
that gives you all all you need
basically in CSS so you define rules in
CSS for isometric angles and those tools
transform your elements to isometric and
to have a proof that this is working in
fact I made a quick text let me quickly
switch so here we go this is a simple
test to show you those classes are
actually working so we got the newest
Google logo here and this is just a DIF
with a background image and I can
basically append those classes and they
rotate to isometric projection so using
those I could build up a simple cube for
instance so this really works and it
works quite well and it's quite speedy
and let's see if you bring this like I'm
not connected I'm going to show you
later on if you want to if you bring
this to a certain extent you can build
great action surfaces so this is action
surfaces and I'm going to show you life
what is means of it
next stop it this was all about the
front end but let's talk a bit about the
back end I mentioned already we're using
javascript in the service well so why is
that um first of all why do we use
JavaScript JavaScript really many might
think is really painful on enough
already right if you're working in the
backend you might have that opinion now
you want me to work with that in the
backend as well and many gave us some
very puzzled face
but seriously why javascript single
scripting language is so efficient per
project so if you have a single language
you're working on it all your developers
are working on it makes developing so
efficient because you can share code in
the backend and front-end and distribute
it to any any people and everyone
understands what's going on on any site
which is huge to me and well in my
opinion also javascript is awesome it's
just very amiss misinterpreted language
and I really hope people would think
about it in a different way in the
future so this one interesting project
we're using it's called no js' it's a
JavaScript runtime so I'm going to
really quickly show you what it means
first of all javascript in the browser
looks like this right many deaths don't
want to work on the server because they
really are afraid that it will hack down
the server but and and and that's really
that fear I know where it's coming from
it's coming from the browser because if
you look at Java to the browser the car
is JavaScript obviously and everything
around the car is overhead attitude so
in the browser environment you have D
rendering you have B Dom everything you
have timers all that really slows down
JavaScript but if you really look at
JavaScript running without all those
layers on top it kind of looks like this
right this is JavaScript in the backend
JavaScript on the backend is almost as
fast as C which is quite significant so
really there's there's a huge
performance increase if you work in the
backend and also obviously you don't
have to mess around with cross browser
implications so you only write using one
engine it really speeds up your coding
so notes features it's Google v8 running
on the server in the scripting runtime
it is server and scripting in one kind
of process and it comes with some sugar
on top
Freddy modules for system servers etc
and everything and that's a key fact
everything is non-blocking in note so
notice completely event-driven file
system calls
etc our non-blocking I'm going to show
you what this means then since it's you
its students using v8 if using XML ACMA
script five as well so you get some nice
sugar on top as well so for the modules
it's using the carbon J's module system
it's very handy for organizing code and
there's really no way around it in no
chairs without modules there's no use
flap some common modules six five system
HTTP for creating your server and
process so ACMA script five already
gives you some nice features as well
gather status some array extensions for
each reduce filter and especially JSON
support is really nice so you got
chasing stringify jason pars i was a
great innovation about now anyway we had
reno before which was a different
interface but not really is different
note is completely event-driven
so for instance in a normal environment
if your program in PHP for instance
you're doing a call to a database and
then you're waiting in the next line
you're waiting until that call is
actually finished and then progress so
it's in a linear fashion and it has some
advantages because it's easier to
understand easier to grasp when that
call when that line is finished move on
to the next one
notice completely different notice
event-driven so if you do a database
query you need to have your query and
then for everything you need a callback
so in that callback that callback will
be executed once the database is ready
and the next line will be executed
immediately so it's not waiting for your
call at all and if you if you look at
sample code right and that is running a
node you have to take this with a grain
of salt because those are early versions
but this is just one of the images I
found in the in the World Wide Web that
really shows how notice I notice doing
is doing quite fine so this is a those
are the requests on the y-axis are the
requests in ten seconds and note really
is at the top and the concrete see isn't
bad as well so those are the quest per
second so so really no scales really
well and and you don't have to fear
about any of those Java
great mess you have in a browser but
then I also have to tell you that no js'
is pretty new the API is not frozen yet
and it's really only for adventurous
people but everyone who is building
games in the web right now is
adventurous already so the benefits of
using it completely make up for the risk
non-blocking was that was that not what
does non-blocking really mean
non-blocking also not only means
event-driven code it also meant means
the server is not not threaded because
you cannot thread v8 actually you do not
have multiple processors and it can
serve and handle a lot more requests at
a time because it does that because it
eats a lot less memory than for instance
Apache so that is really one big
advantage if you look at i/o API I
mentioned already accessing external
data is always non-blocking so you
really got that right this it's really
hard to stop node from functioning so
it's very efficient to write
event-driven code so why do we need that
for game obviously if we want to build a
game that handles thousands and
thousands of players possibly millions
of players this is really the kind of
environment we need we need event-driven
environments we can't build a game that
has many hundreds of thousands players
on one server using PHP it's just not
going to happen so this is I I explained
that already so I'm just very quickly so
look at the hello world example in no
tears I'm not going to go into this much
but this is really very easy hello world
example you create your server and this
server is taking in requests and you
execute any kind of code you want and
send back the answer so there's no need
for patching no need for second server
it's really just this runtime runtime
and it will do everything you need so
finally and this is a very strong
message that I want to give you finally
get rid of limitations and what I mean
by limitations get rid of limitations in
your hat so and what I also mean about
but that is do not copy
if you're looking at the games right now
so first of all console games are
displayed full screen on your TV this is
a no-brainer right if you put a console
game in your console it's scratched
stretches to full full screen always
right how about the browser games if you
look at browser games this is one
browser game from Germany grepolis very
small viewport right it's not full
screen at all
second game you might realize all those
games kind of look similar this is from
a different company entirely it looks
the same next game how the hotel some of
you might notice how the hotel also has
a very small viewport and even use a
flash farm where farmer is not
stretching to the browser window farmer
is not an immersive experiences or at
all as well so think about MMO G's in
browsers almost all games are limited to
a couple thousand players per word
instance and what we really want we want
stretching viewport we want multiplayer
real multiplayer words with millions of
players so no tech technical stripping
fragmentation between word and more
characters than there's 20 in a room on
a singer viewpoint this was really like
that's what I mean by getting rid of
your limitations not just because
everyone else is doing small viewports
there's really no reason why you have to
and there's really no reason I want to
prove that there's no reason and this is
really how our test that we did looks
like so we're testing sometimes on quad
HD resolutions this is an early
prototype of the engine rewriting and as
you can see it's a 27-inch iMac which
has a pretty significant resolution
already and stretching to a complete
viewport and it's really running fast so
let me show you what we have been
building
so obviously this first part was about
how how you build stuff but obviously we
have build some stuff and I want to show
you so meet the others engine the
obvious engine is a professional game
engine full web it is commercial license
away and it's cross platform
yes it works on smartphones it works on
Android hopefully it works on iPhone and
iPad and comes with all mention features
and a lot more currently in alpha so we
don't have anything to sell and I just
want to show you because it's quite cool
in my opinion so demo time here we go so
this is our new prototype of the others
engine let's just turn this big I guess
here we go so this is the prototype that
we've built you might have seen this in
one of the earlier slides it allows you
to pan in real time it's loading new
patches the patch loading kinds of works
like Google Maps for anything whoo for
anyone who works on Google Maps or have
worked on Google Maps so it uses a patch
mechanism all those objects are
referencing in real time so you have
those click through maps going on as you
can see I can drag around that object
and you can hover it right so this is my
character and that character can walk
around you have sprite animations going
on here pathfinding I mentioned so if I
want to walk across the street it's
actually walking and following rules so
it allows you to chat as well and we
have been doing quite a lot of
performance tests as well so right now
I'm pretty lonely in this world but
let's add some players right so we're
going to add some hundred players tube
map and you probably can see them
walking a bit and chatting so there's
our 100 players lounging lounge in the
word right now and it still scales very
well because it is using experience
daichi's for everything and it's using
all those techniques that I explained
before so let's see let's actually
switch a word instance so you can move
into houses and switch its high
resolution so we launched a house as you
can see our characters bigger we can
switch our cake as well so let's see get
some male character going and those are
the low
those are the surfaces I was talking
about there's no wireless available
right now here at least I didn't turn it
on but you can get the idea here so this
is a surface that is using CSS
transforms and the basic get some
surface window and you can drag those
widgets to the surfaces and they
transform and and drop and basically you
can drop them anywhere where surfaces so
this is really the kind of vision we're
having and our first our second
prototype that we will also show up in
the next couple of days anything I
missed
I guess what I can also show you and
really if you want to start building
your own game engine 20% I guess is what
you see right now 80% are the editors so
the admin of interfaces all there so we
also build some quite nice admin
interfaces forward you can see them here
so you can you have a tile editor you
can grab some object allows your model
editor and then add surfaces to it drag
it around and it will all synchronize in
real time in the world so here you go
this is the kind of things we have been
building so I guess we almost finished
thank you very much for attention
there's more textures been calm and also
at our blocks we are writing a lot about
our technical stuff and we have a lot of
demos using CSS transforms and CSS
animations there's a lot of interesting
things to check out follow me on Twitter
if you want to and also if you do have
any context to share with us we are
currently currently - in California so
if you have any context you want to
share in the game industry in the VC
industry contact us and I'm really
hoping to see people building games not
only with our engine but if you do
something you own that's perfectly fine
and I want to see competition thank you
very much
yes now we have room for questions yes
can you tell me a little bit about what
you're doing for audio follow you that's
a very good question um so we haven't
done audio yet and the prototype we have
been playing around with it and we're
using html5 audio however it's quite
buggy still in most browsers so I hope
it will change in the next couple couple
months so we're using html5 audio this
has some problems for instance you
cannot run html5 audio on iphone right
now I'm not sure about Android but it's
very hard to start audio in the
background in most browsers right now so
yeah we haven't done it yet any other
questions I'm sorry so is this engine
kind of geared towards building these
type of isometric games or is it
flexible enough to do platformers or
it's really flexible so um as I
mentioned this is just a prototype right
so we really haven't finished the
engineer and and it's just showing one
aspect of the engine but yes the engine
is meant to also allow to build
platformers jump and run games all kinds
of games all kinds of games that you had
on that list before so 2d and 2.5 G and
we simply choose isometry because it is
a kind of cool
a prototype yes quite a good experience
and it's it's really the most difficult
experience to build so this is why we
choose it so any other questions how
much of a performance difference TC in
different browsers especially mobile
browsers um there's a huge performance
difference in mobile browsers you mean
mostly yeah so if you look at desktop on
mobile browsers and there's a huge
difference already
but then there's there's really many
kind of quirks you're realizing with
when working with multiple smartphones
for instance we've been working with
iPhone and iPad and we figured out that
so our prototype works really flawlessly
on iPhone 3GS and
that's really nice
it's also working on 3G not as fast as
3GS but it's kind of working
however we had huge issues together
running on the iPad because the iPad
itself is almost as fast as the it's a
bit faster than 3GS however it has a
much larger viewport so the viewport is
much larger which means you need a lot
more processing to display full screen
so obviously we could leave it as the
eye at the iPhone resolution but as I
mentioned this is really not what we
want to do so we had to optimize
specifically for all kinds of mobile
platforms and use techniques for
instance CSS transforms and CSS
animations our hardware accelerated on
iPhone and I think pretty sure pretty
soon on Android as well I'm not I'm not
sure yet but um you have to use features
that are hardware accelerated anyone
else alright then thanks again and have
a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
