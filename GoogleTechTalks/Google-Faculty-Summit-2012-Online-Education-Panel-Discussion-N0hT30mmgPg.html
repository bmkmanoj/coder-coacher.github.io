immigrants is important aspect of online
learning like you're showing is the time
and effort it takes to build good labs
or learning module they have good
feedback to be able to parse you know
the expected input and give that good
reloading back its kind of thing
probably that pilot for a long time we
still get really bad error messages
especially for newbies do you see
significant changes or improvements in
that coming that's been significantly
speed up the times and built these so
just I'm going to before I'll give it to
Daphne first and then maybe Peter but
let me just ask the panel to try to keep
answers brief what often happens with
professorial type panels is there are
three questions each question gets a
five-minute answer from each panelist
double time is on so let's try not to do
that okay with that warning we haven't
done a lot with that we think it's a
really interesting direction to take we
do think that the power of big data at
least identifies the error modes that
are most interesting and important to
deal with and that it's okay to have a
human in the loop as we have done in
identifying what is the feedback that
one off to give for those comedy remotes
so I think that really is the promises
big data as identifying a place in Omaha
to manage
so I'll so I'll agree with that and not
add to it much except that i'm also
interested in this problem of compiler
and i think that that's also an area
where we took all the programs that
office programmers wrote and figured out
where they were wrong get much better
brother messages just on that very same
point another approach to it would be to
take advantage of the M in MOOC that
these are massive and because they're
massive the expense of somebody
developing a good response can be
amortized over a huge community that is
true but when you have thousands of
classes then it is still a fairly
substantial effort to do this for every
class I think for some of the classes
that really are used year after year
after year intro calculus intro stabs
into a programming whatever it'll
chemical physics is worth putting in
that big investment for the classes that
then you must teach which change in
quite a bit from year to year I'm not
sure that actually important to that
and you give an example of student
asking a question and this question
helping a lot of other students that's
actually one of the central message of
like Mizzou there's a student each
student better than professors so one of
the things that I would like to have in
the world I live in is a video server
where students can submit three minutes
explanation of what they learn and then
evaluate them and then share them and
that this fits anywhere I mean video or
explanation in texts or sound but
material created by students for
students and then may be validated
through crowdsourcing and finally
validated from the professor what once
it has been filtered the zip fits in
your vision well so video aside which we
haven't done the QA form is exactly that
that is students ask questions other
students answer those questions the
questions are validated like if other
students and the instructor ta has the
option of marking certain answers is
being right that is exactly what we do
módulo the video which you know is an
infrastructure question and they people
get twitter maybe not clear that video
is necessarily useful here but i should
say i talked about the class that Dan
did and we built that on our own
technology and we're in the process of
looking into how we can kind of wrap up
that technology and open source it and
put it in the hands of anybody who wants
to then but make something available I
think it's phenomenal to have 20,000
students please your class but how do we
get the other 85 or 90
people to finish I think it has to be
about motivation and I was wondering
about what your ideas are I think some
of it is is motivation I think some of
it was you know just over an enthusiasm
of well look all these classes are
available I'm going to sign up for ten
of them and you wouldn't really expect
to get one hundred percent completion
from that so I'm not sure we're really
that far off I'm not sure the that you
want the rates to be that much higher
than they are so I think Peter is
absolutely right a lot of people signed
up for the class just because it sounds
cool and they wanted to see what it was
about i think the right denominator to
use is the number of students who
submitted the first assignment because i
think that is the ones we engage with
the class at least in some meaningful
way our completion rate for that is
close to fifty percent not all of them
passed the class but if you count the
number per pass the class a in the
machine learning class that's about
thirty percent thirty percent I'll pass
rate is actually commensurate with a lot
of physical universities and I don't
think it's that bad you know these are
hard classes and people say oh machine
learning sounds cool let me try it and
they realize that it's well actually
involves math oh my god so so I think
it's quite reasonable to have a
30-percent pass right now there are
various things at once I think social is
a big aspect of improving retention
right now study people's freak downpour
kind of tangential their external power
system but they happen i think they help
retention think if you embed that more
intrinsically in the platform you're
going to get increased retention because
people are going to be unhappy about
disappointing their who plays so I think
there's ways to improve retention but I
don't think I mean Peters right you
cannot expect a much higher retention
maple what we have
so as Peter sort of intimated at the
beginning these online classes I see is
sort of the evolution of the textbook
and like the textbook I expect that most
faculty are never going to create one
but also like the textbook I expect that
many faculty r want going to want to
consume the ones that are there and
something that worries me a little bit
about the way they're evolving now is
that they're extremely monolithic it's
not really possible for the faculty
member I mean the textbook days you can
say well read chapter one and then you
know skip over all this stuff and then
do the following problems and this looks
building your own course out of the
available textbook read material what is
there can there be an analog for that
with peace with these online course
materials is it important or are we just
going to give up on all of that and
hapless one course and everybody in the
world makes exactly the same way so
first of all I don't think there's going
to be this long course I would expect
that already starting to see two and
three courses on the same topic offered
by different decisions and I think
that's order of 10 k or 250 you can see
the David's a theoretician he used to be
um so that's I do think that it's
possible to then to mix and match in
fact one of the original visions that
drove me into this is that I am sick and
tired of the set of options that are
available to me when I rely on some
material that I don't want to cover in
class so what are my options I can add a
prerequisite increasing the prerequisite
change stronger and that's called so
common engineering I can do a half-assed
job of teaching that material in 10
minutes or I can assumes the students
get it by osmosis which is what I
typically do none of this is a
particularly good solution what might be
a much better solution is to say here
I'm David teaches a really good
introduction to you know Flux
computational complexity and
completeness and I'm just going to send
them to watch 3 of David module Davis
module on this and then I assume that
they know that and so I think that you
could definitely make some magic
ecosystem is so new that we just haven't
walked around to that yet I think that's
right I think part of what's going on is
trying to break things down into smaller
pieces you know so historically classes
have been a semester-long because when
you had to sign up for class in the
physical world there were long lines and
we didn't want to have to do that now
we're seeing the online classes are much
shorter a lot of them or five weeks or
so we may go to even shorter units and
then an individual professor can
customize them and figure out yeah a
question for the educators here so when
I was at IBM I remember there was a lot
of discussion about things i think they
were called learning objects or there
were standards that people were trying
to create with standardized prerequisite
labeling and grew and object objects and
was sort of an ocean of life
object-oriented computing being applied
to education at least theoretically made
sense what happened to those ideas
because they would seem to be relevant
to the discussion that the paper
mentioned why did they die so there are
several sets that there's two big sets
of standards um squirm is the older one
and then there ILS i think is newer one
and currently most platform support
support only a very tiny fragment of ILS
which is joined sign on as opposed to
any object as to why I died you know I'm
a newcomer to this community psych
we do sometimes find is that is that
ideas die because they're not practical
at a certain point they come back again
later a different guides so I don't I
don't know whether that won't happen
here but it does seem that if we want to
mix and match the notion of a spec as to
what what that module teaches is
actually using kind of eating something
Vivian work where are we so at Georgia
Tech we created a android app and let
people learn sign language of the mobile
phones we found that's twenty percent
more effective than doing the equivalent
thing on computers for eight so I'm
wondering for the list got those of you
doing stuff online how many of your
lectures are viewed on mobile devices
and is there some correlation with
success with the spores so all of our we
have full support for mobile in the
following sense that you can use the
lectures into the quizzes on either a
smartphone or tablet but we don't
currently have is the ability to have
that work wins when the device is
offline so you can download the videos
you can advise is all fine we realize
that support for offline access is
critical especially with developing
world
advice but you do not have stats in the
class yes I'd like to hear more about
either what you're doing or what you're
planning on doing regarding crowd
sourcing and peer assessment so that was
the slide that I skipped on what we we
have put together I think what is
currently the largest pipeline for
crowdsource debating ever devised it was
used for classes that have you know
enrollments at thirty forty thousand
student range so Scott plumber Scott
warrior thoughts right there was our
guinea pig he was the first to try out
the cute the nuclear interaction class
the peer grading pipeline and actually
helped find a lot of input into how did
both the pipeline itself as well as how
to construct a good grading rubric it
turns out that it's very easy to
construct a bad rating rubric so you
need to be careful with that so let me
talk a little bit about the pipeline and
then they stalk them soft mice and jump
in on the the students submit the work
they get a grading rubric telling them
how they ought to create the work one of
the things that we found with is really
critical is that you don't have students
grade on a range of 0 to 30 or something
like that you break it down into much
smaller pieces much in the way that you
go an Amazon Amazon Mechanical Turk so
you have smaller tasks each on a much
narrower scale like 0 2 3 4 5 and then
you aggravate the results so the
students go through a training phase
based on on assignments that the
instructor grades that the students
don't know the great so they're supposed
to grade and the system compares what
they did to what the instructor did so
the bacon so that they're tested as to
whether they're reliable graders and
once they pass that training phase or
calibration phase as it's called they
can go out and raid the work of their
peers we have each assignment graded by
about five people at least principle and
practice it ends up things all between
three to five and the results are
aggregated using a robust statistics so
that
we have some outlier or mobile and so on
and the student gets both the numerical
score as well as qualitative feedback
about how why the wiping off the grades
that they did now one of the really cool
things that happened in the peer grading
pipeline is that we first tried it in
Scotts class which is you know computer
interaction class where students with
grading web designs what we learned
about the peer grading you can
immediately transition to Princeton
sociology class and pens bioethics class
which is one of those unusual cases
where pedagogy actually makes this way
across both disciplinary and
institutional boundaries so that was
kind of a unique thing and we were by
happy with that um so anyway one of the
things so in the princess of sociology
class they did their entire midterm this
way and two interesting things happen
first the students asked that the peer
grading process be kept open longer not
because they couldn't finish their peer
grading was because they wanted they
wanted to peer grade more stuff because
they felt it was actually a valuable
learning experience for them and the
second thing that happens is after the
grades were made public there was a
whole forum thread about how people said
they were concerned initially that the
grades they would get wouldn't be
reflected the quality of their work but
they found that in fact it was very
consistent with their own self
assessment of their work and so it was
actually working so people are pretty
happy with the rules you wanna okay
I just wanted to say I haven't done any
experiments but that yet but one thing I
wanted to do was think about using
clustering so you get 100,000 essays
back we have good algorithms or saying
how close are to text to web pages to
each other so maybe cluster those
hundred thousand into a couple hundred
clusters and then you can have TAS or
somebody great the median of each
cluster and see how well that goes to
the other members so just as as we think
about this and we heard from Bradley
about social this is where all the so
connects and social I think there's just
a tremendous opportunity to see how
these things integrate an existing
social someone you have any thoughts on
a breath well I think a couple that were
mentioned that i think are huge
opportunities are both formalized study
groups and ad-hoc study groups and sort
of one-to-one tutoring we've been
approached i mentioned language
instruction is happening on google+
people want to turn this into a business
they sort of want to be able to do
language instruction and music
instruction at a distance you know so
that a great instructor in the
philippines can sort of help someone
anywhere else in the world and make a
living doing it so there's all kinds of
peer to peer interactions that are
happening there's a huge culture of
generosity on the service it's amazing
the amount of time people will invest
helping others for no material return at
all but there's also the opportunity for
businesses to actually make a difference
in people's lives so that people with
skills that they want to offer can also
get compensated for that and I think all
of these are opportunities that are
really nascent and platforms that we're
building at Google will help people
explore the spectrum of what might be
done have you thought about academic
misconduct and wondered what are you
planning to do about it
it's called collaboration now we know
cheating happens we've seen for example
Jennifer Widom has written a blog post
about her experiences in the database
class about how people took the final
exam which was supposed to take three
hours and they walked in and they did
the whole thing in 10 minutes of the
perfect scores and what turned out is
that they had three accounts we could
you they trace it back using IP
addresses they did the first time they
got like seventy percent they did it the
second time they got eighty percent and
then when they got third time nailed it
so we know that happens we've seen that
happening in other ways in other classes
as well it's definitely an issue but let
me add that it also happens in much more
proctored environments I mean who
remembers the s80 scandal at the
beginning of the year where this guy was
taking the exam for twenty of his
closest friends of Home Tour girls so so
it shows i mean i don't think it's
completely avoidable I think there is
technological as well as physical
solutions so for example a Udacity has
talked about doing Pearson testing
centers is one possible solution there
is technology so Western Governors which
is one of the biggest online programs
out there it's a very nice program does
proctoring using a 360 degree camera
plus a microphone so that the students
is doing the exam with a human as well
as a computer kind of doing some clutter
monitoring Oh what's going on so I think
it's an eco it's it's a technology that
already come a long way and there's some
interesting ideas out there so let me
ask this question what is the industry
of Education structure itself as time
goes on so we've admitted to the
possibility that faculty members from
one university may create modules or
courses that are used others we've
admitted to the possibility there may be
standardized testing centers which may
be used or broadly from many classes in
many disciplines they have the cameras
and check people's driver's licenses and
faces and such there are enormous
opportunities for some different ways
that people can aggregate themselves
into groups and hang out together
different structures we've also just as
one of the underpinnings of this John
Hennessy spoke at the CRA snowbird
conference for Dean's and department
chairs on Sunday night with his last
week basically he elucidated and
highlighted the enormous cost of
education today and said we just can't
afford it so there is going to be
radical change of he was quite i would
say incendiary as parks particularly for
university president about the fact that
they're just had to be enormous change
in terms of the cost structures at
universities and then k through 12 which
means less employment for the same
amount of teacher so how do you think of
all this is going to play out everyone
can welcome to speculate i think it's
quite interesting effects that affects
many of us you're working out of
canceling and then let's get about the
chance to comment over here michigan in
recent is you can give it Northern
Michigan University Central Michigan
University Western Michigan University
of Eastern Michigan University and in
five years they're gone yes that what
they're all about a social right that's
all those places are all about it's
about social but getting together about
a history and what you do all the
courses that we're talking about those
kids can sign up there's no president
about it and so the question is how the
transition is going to happen as a
transition is going to happen and I
think it's going to happen five years
I don't know but here's a representative
of a university I think will be around
in five years well so I think that um I
think it is a really interesting
transition that we're about to see and
there are clearly it's clear i think
that universities that want to survive
are going to have to rethink drastically
what is the value proposition that
they're all three of your students and i
think universities such as Peter said I
think Stanford is probably safe um but
it's not clear that many of the other
universities out there are safe unless
they really think carefully what it is
that they're offering to their students
besides content because content is going
to become Vic witness it's going to
become free and it's going to be
available frankly a higher quality than
most universities can produce themselves
and so what are you offering to your
students beyond that and does it really
require four years of residential
education or can you make do with
something that is a lot shorter and more
more efficient in the resources that are
required and I think universities that
do do that have a chance of surviving
but those that bury their heads in the
sand probably are going to be in trouble
yeah what I heard is that they'll always
be a future for the universities as a
proctoring center for Udacity and
Coursera so there's that yeah I think I
think that there is a value propositions
University i think that the
socialization the flipped classroom the
kind of face-to-face mentoring for
students who are not getting the
material quite so well i think they're
just tremendous value for the kind of
interaction with an instructor we can
get together a small group of students
and we're all struggling with the same
material have a small tutoring session
for 10 or 15 of them I think that is
where you're going to see the big value
and that's what I meant about rethinking
get a few in a second but let me just
add it I think there's another
opportunity is that universities have
been missing a large part of the
potential audience at have they get
students for four years and then let
them go but I think it's clear now that
that's not enough that people are going
to need continuing lifelong education
and the universities could perhaps
capture some without that now for it if
with your permission I want to make a
comment rather than ask a question the
dis pertaining to David's wake up
comment and it's I think kind of good
news in the gloomy news of consolidation
and this into your mediation the the new
on a kind of package online courses are
the new tactical and and the units are
small and even so I caught one of the
thought one of those classes with
another instructor from economics and
even when we teach the course our sail
with you to slightly differently because
he's an economist and you decide this
and what we're doing now is we're
opening it up as a platform inviting
colleagues bring you to submit their
modules and really turning to a platform
and so just like it's not necessarily
the people from the top university wrote
the best textbook is not pretty free
individual to write super modules so I
think that's kind of party the age of
the academic remix maybe ganas
I have a higher level question so how do
keep the panel people feel about what
kind of a material fishing this massive
online teaching well what kind of
material does it do you is this
specifically for university course
teaching where you you envision this
will go beyond that Oh clearly I think
there is some limitations to this at
least using current technology I mean
anything that involves an interaction
with a physical object is going to be
difficult to do in this medium right now
so you're not going to learn to do
surgery in this using this technology or
to play violin but I think we're
starting to see that more in or to the
lab works for example even though you
know chemistry lab or biology lab
simulations are still not like there yet
maybe for physics yes but for you know
the wetter disciplines probably not
quite um you know technology is
improving all the time so I would
hesitate to make a prediction than a
five years this will be a breach and I
think that this is something that will
available not just academic University
content but also for a lot of the skills
based activities or courses that would
help close the skills gap that we're
seeing in the structural unemployment
that we have right now we're at the same
time that we have in all nine ten
percent unemployment more so in certain
states there's still large numbers of
jobs are going unfilled so I think it is
possible to use this technology to help
deal with some of those fundamental
problems we have a society so following
up on that actually following up on that
if this structured education which is
possible to do online with structural
grading or the structural instruction
becomes cheap then more people would be
able to import that education but not
the hands on which is your learning
doing like a surgery like the lab
courses and so on do you see that kind
of model now of shifting creating a bias
which we shift away education for the
skills that our hands online I think
that the solution will come to meet the
needs so you could easily imagine for
example as anyway the physical study
groups form you will have small physical
centers and different towns where people
can come and do the hands-on practice
that is needed for the kind of skills
that required that so I think that this
is a problem that will be solved on
money so what's the financial argument
for an institution to dedicate the
resources to retool a class to offer it
to tens of thousands of students for
free um ok so I think that's a good
question and it has several parts of the
answer Brazil the costs are not enormous
I mean you could design and that's what
I think both Udacity then and we then
and others is that you can you don't
have to pay several hundreds of
thousands or millions of dollars so some
of the online offerings previously if
I've multi-million dollar fifteen
million dollars per port you'll really
need to do that if you're not aspiring
to Pixar quality production values which
I actually don't think our pedagogically
all that useful and so we're talking on
the order of ten to thirty thousand
dollars basically a cost of one or two
TAS that often amortizes over time
because if you move your class to an
auto braided format you need less
grading down the line and future
offerings of the class to your on-campus
students and so I think the cost they
exist but they're not enormous and then
of course there's the benefits of that
in terms of impact outreach attracting
people to your institution there's other
I'm gonna stop playing the role of being
a moderator and actually be a debater
just for a moment not that you like to
debate anything
but but i think it's an open question
essentially as to how much money we
should be spending on some of these
courses and whether there are some
courses that maybe we shouldn't be
spending 10 or 20 million dollars i'm
not sure we know how to do it yet but
here's my here's the point so let's say
let's say outta here okay so if we want
to teach algebra to the students say
just in the United States there must be
there totally coated million people so
it must be like five million kids or
something like that to take algebra or
that he shouldn't if you get five
million kids at ten bucks a kid which is
a very small percentage of the cost of
course being offered you can you could
hypothesize you can spend 50 million
dollars now you don't have to teach the
variability in ability that Peter talked
about is a problematic we could break
those kids down into different
categories that are suitable for
different modes of instruction the
possibility of online simulation and
games and things like that it's not
inconceivable to me that we wouldn't
want to go to a lot of research and
simulation gaming all manner of machine
learning really turn the way we teach
algebra completely upside down so the
reason I'm being a little bit
argumentative is that we can do videos
or easy right at what YouTube makes this
trivial camera in a video video and we
can do multiple choice profits that's
extremely and record the data that's the
present that's great that's going to be
something which is going to make
Coursera have lots of course in audacity
all manner of other things the law it's
going to get out there or what are we
going to do is computer science
researchers that really completely turn
everything upside down with a lot more
power but these machines have little
arguing today I don't know what you guys
think that's trying to be lowered
yeah I think there's going to be a big
range right so there's going to be these
head courses that are taught to lots of
people and are expensive and then Gail
course only a few people like I've seen
it so complete the tools that means of
production and so on table all I think
that's right i think there is a small
number i don't know how many it's more
than 10 maybe maybe more than 100 but
certainly not much more than a hundred i
think weird sports investing that's not
that amount of money but i think that
there's a very large number of courses
that changes what that really if you
start investing that amount of money in
it then it's just going to become
unsustainable because people are going
to be so afraid of making any change in
the material because we're going to cost
so much and you have to bring in the
whole production came again to shoot
that one ten-minute segment that you
want to change that i think it's going
to become unsustainable so I think for
the vast majority of courses you don't
want to go to that level of production
galleries because it's going to assault
apply innovation so I believe you heard
twice from both Daphne and Pierre that
would really make this last that of
course is take off supposed to previous
free online content was that there was a
structure there were assignments it was
a community run on some schedule and I
wonder what we can learn from these
experiments and formal education for the
type of informal education that Bradley
talked about where it's maybe
woodworking or kiteboarding are there
with the platform's look the same or are
there important differences if we want
people want to enable people to teach
each other but maybe in a more
structured setting than just having
video chat or a hangout yeah I think
it's a great question I think one just
to reflect a little bit on the questions
that have been asked before and how they
relate to that question we have sort of
seen this movie before I think it's a
very good question what is the financial
model that will sustain everything we're
talking about up here and I think
collectively absolutely don't know
that's clear we know there's a
disruption underway we've seen this
before with the music industry where you
know they control distribution they had
a certain studio model and label model
and marketing model and physical
distribution and it all blew up over a
decade and changed everything and
they're still figuring out what it means
for the industry I don't know if people
are previously bootlegging your lectures
with you know surreptitiously recording
them in class and posting them to
YouTube you know I I'm not sure it's
exactly the same but I think there is a
disruption happening right now and I
think it's generally better to get in
front of these and be part of the
solution and drive toward that then to
cling to old models that are slipping
away before your eyes so that's my
commentary there the other previous
answer that occurred to me is you know
what do universities become every
professor I've known and this says oh
this isn't true I know many of you so I
don't want to I don't want to generalize
most of the professor's I know a lot of
the teaching they do is attacks that
they pay so the research that they love
can can happen and you know at least
some fraction of teaching might be
tedious for folks you don't want to tell
the same jokes you know for 250 years so
that part I think everyone would breathe
a collective sigh of relief if you're
sort of cognitive load doing that part
of your job was relieved so you could do
the part that is valuable and fun and
invigorating for you now to the question
about you know informal ad-hoc learning
that's mostly what's happening on
Google+ right now and again it's sort of
staggering to think that it's happening
without any orchestration or incentives
from us people are just finding each
other in doing this and frankly we're
not making it particularly easy we do
have tools like white boarding and
screen sharing we do not have
sophisticated tools for monitoring
measuring picking up where you left off
and you know bringing like-minded people
together all of that is happening in an
ad hoc way so I hope that there's a
continuum there that the tools that they
are building for very specific higher
education use cases could apply for
other sort of
less you know academic pursuits but more
sort of skills based learning as well
and I do think you know you mentioned a
couple examples of surgery and music
instruction both of those things are
happening on Google+ I wouldn't well I
mentioned an example it's not surgical
instruction I wouldn't want to go to a
doctor who was trained on Google+
Hangouts today and I wouldn't want to
hear a symphony that you know played
together we actually did a YouTube
Symphony actually but they were
generally trained musicians brought
together at that point but I do think it
is interesting to think about the
spectrum of things you can learn and if
you look at the tools that we're
providing many of them are shadows of
real-world experience you know much of
learning is visual and much of learning
is reading and we can provide reasonable
facsimile of that the tactile aspect of
learning and the opportunity to interact
with physical objects is something again
we can't completely provide today but I
think much of learning can be
approximated through these means and
it's not just a pale shadow of the
classroom interaction it's actually as
you have pointed out an opportunity to
get a much improved experience that's
what's really exciting is that it's not
degraded it's actually a higher order of
learning that we're able to provide I
think so one thing I just wanna say is
virtual knee surgery is actually a game
about learning surgery skills um an
online game up I was just curious to
know you said this sort of fidelity of
production values which I sort of agree
with a lot um I'm curious if you guys
have any assessment of bandwidth
necessary to interact with these
interact with these of courses you're
talking about reaching audiences in the
developing world you know I'm thinking
about even here in the US you know
penetration of fan of broadband is
really poor and a lot of the areas that
can benefit from
post from these kinds of things are
rural and poorly connected and is there
some sort of push that needs to happen
in that in order to support somebody out
there were talking about I think the
answer is clearly yes one of the things
that modern encoding technology has done
is it allows especially the cob web
based recording which is a lot of what
we're currently seeing is much more
efficient than bandwidth and a professor
moving around in front of blackboard and
so it actually can be done a fairly well
bandwidth limitations I but that said I
think in order to really reach the
developing world who will need to come
up with better technological solutions
both in terms of improving the
infrastructure in those countries as
well as by constructing mobile solutions
that people are offline so that you can
come in download whatever the course
needs to do and then you can go off and
that is definitely on our to-do list
because we do really want to be
developing world and even in the advice
so Peter I really all of you talked
about the importance of motivation and a
few things are more motivating
especially to teenagers and video games
of BC have you say a little bit more
about the gamification of learning and
what we expect to see more of that
that's something that you could do a lot
more in an online environment that in
the classroom yeah yeah I think that's
right there's a lot of work in that I
mean in some ways the traditional
education is already gamification right
because we have this great you get it at
the end of the class and people people
play the game to do that more than they
do to learn and so you have to be aware
of what are you motivating people to do
and we want the the carrot there to help
them but not to get them too distracted
and because what lots of interesting
research and how that works okay well
we've kept you a little bit long um
thank you so much pedal we appreciate
it's a great
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
