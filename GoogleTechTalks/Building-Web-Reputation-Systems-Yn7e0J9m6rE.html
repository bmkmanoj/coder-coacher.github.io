years ago an anomaly conference and when
I heard him speak it was one of those
things where I don't necessarily say
this often but you know listening to him
was one of those rare experiences where
and I realized that everything that I've
taken this fact I had the question and
maybe it wasn't necessarily true
so at that moment I knew this was
someone that I definitely want wanted to
get to know better and I'm not going to
say that he's been a very generous and
patient teacher to me over the last
couple of years I think those of you
who've seen him speak elsewhere or at
our online community guide conference a
couple years ago definitely know what
I'm talking about and I think for those
of you who are hearing and seeing them
for the first time you'll get to know
what I've talked about after you hear
him today
so Randy has so many accomplishments we
were talking about that a little bit at
lunch
over the last thirty years then I could
go on for a while but I won't
I will though go through a few of
Randy's highlights then he sent a little
bit earlier so he wouldn't have to put
this in a slide in his freezer so I
summed it all down to this Randy is a
social pioneer who's had numerous
industry firsts which included the first
virtual world first avatars in the first
online marketplace he's an inventor with
more than a dozen granted and pending
patents in social media of virtual roles
and distributed objects and reputation
systems and online identity he's a
consultant who serves on many advisory
boards including the Rochester Institute
of Technology and he spent five years as
the director of community at Yahoo where
he worked on Yahoo 360 and many many of
the things that are going on at Yahoo
and he's also an author who's written
numerous white papers and chaptered lots
of chapters in different books but we're
fortunate to have him here today to talk
about the book that he co-authored with
Bryce glass of building web reputation
systems so please join me in welcoming
Randy from hi everyone thanks for that
wonderful introduction
that was very humbling today I'm going
to talk a little bit about some things
that are covered in high familiar faces
that are covered in in the book that
Bryce and I wrote but the reason they're
in the book is is really important and
we're pulling them out as the five
things we find we found over and over
and working with people about reputation
systems are common mistakes they're made
over and over and over again that's I
still hear them almost every week when
they start bringing up these subjects so
this talk is really in advance you know
if it helps I was a book fine but it
really is trying to advance the kind of
state of the discussion about reputation
on the web as Katina mentioned I
co-authored this book with Bryce glass
who was a user and experienced our user
experience designer for Yahoo while I
was there and he did experience design
specifically around reputation systems
when I left Yahoo a couple years ago and
I said I wanted to try to start writing
a book he just jumped up and said let's
write a book for Yahoo press slash
O'Reilly on reputation and so I went
great
I don't have to write my first book all
by myself I get to work with someone
else who's actually excellent at visual
communication and so the graphics these
little guys are all by him so that's why
I want to make sure to give him a
shout-out in this presentation today so
as I said we worked with dozens of
product managers I've actually been
doing reputation work for almost 20
years it didn't have that name we were
trying to figure out how people would
evaluate each other's content and share
with others you know people came along
and worked on things like search
relevance that's a former reputation but
we made a you know in all these years
we've observed that reputation systems
are kind of the player critical role in
the operation of all web businesses now
in fact I don't have a slide on to here
and at the end of the first chapter of
the book I call out the top 25
excites as of the published publishing
date of the book all of them used
reputation systems at least for abuse
mitigation and a bunch of other things
so these are the five missteps I'm not
gonna read them now because you're gonna
hear about them all in detail by far
these come up the most often when
talking about reputation systems not
understanding this can have significant
repercussions on your product designs so
the first one it's the people dummy
there's a just start a discussion about
reputation you have to get the
definitions right away because if you
ask someone on the street or even a
random product manager what is
reputation they'll say it's about who's
good and who's bad who's the good guys
and who's the bad guys the first thing
you think of is reputation for people
right can I trust them well eBay is got
reputation that's a whether or not I can
trust them as a seller so in order to
illustrate this I'm gonna ask Katinas
stand back up I'm gonna talk a little
bit about how to define it by use an
example so though we often say it's only
about people this conversation I hope
will elucidate why that's just to narrow
a definition this is a conversation
between Robert and Bill I'll be Robert
Katina will be Bill your voice is deep
but not that deep Robert has taking bill
to a business dinner at a Boston seafood
restaurant Italian restaurant that was
recommended by a co-worker and while
they're talking about business they
strike up a personal conversation
because they know each other and trust
each other a little
so our wind is going to Harvard next
year well harvest has a great reputation
especially for law yes she did but
Harvard's close to the house and we'll
see her more often yes but we'll make
the trade-offs our baby's worth it
thanks
now that was a very short little talk
and there was a lot of reputation that
went on in that story most most
importantly no one said anything about
how good or bad any other person was
there's not a person evaluation in there
at all and over the years we've come to
refine the definition of reputation to
be the words on the screen here
reputation is information used to make a
value judgment about an object or a
person in fact most of that discussion
was all about objects or entity
evaluations we've been able to simplify
the structure okay you know we were
talking about taking it's not just what
is reputation you want to represent it
in a database somehow you want to talk
about it structurally he want an atomic
unit for interacting so we came up with
it I was at Yahoo five years ago what we
call the reputation statement it's a
really simple triple-a source makes it
claim about a target it's the same thing
as I said before it's information used
to make a value judgment about an object
or a person so the object or a person
can either be the source or it can be a
target and the claim is the type and we
reduced that down we made a little arrow
and we transformed it to this unit and
it is an example implied in the
statement in the de conversation that
Wendy my daughter chose Harvard
that's a reputation statement she did
take an action and it has a reputation
effect on Harvard at least to her
parents and to their friend Robert I'll
go even further and lay out here in this
picture a small set of the reputation
statements they are all part of the
context and the discussion so you can
see this formulation used over and over
so bill likes Italian food and that's
why Robert wanted to take him there
but he didn't know a good restaurant so
he had to trust the tastes of a
co-worker that's a reputation statement
about a person and likewise down the
line Wendy chose Harvard bill chose
Harvard there's a special case in the
right side where you see that the source
is a
stur use our icons we call it the
aggregate source in fact the only stuff
that was explicitly discussed in the
corn in the conversation was aggregate
other than Wendy made a choice and by
implication Bill made a choice the
aggregates people recommend Harvard
people recommend Harvard for law people
say Yale is as good as Harvard for your
law right so these are reputation
statements but there's still a
discussion about reputation for people
is is there a kind of distinction any
and we found over the years that yes
there's a huge decision distinction
between reputation for objects and
entities and groups than there is for
people and we call the reputation for
people karma that's how special it is if
we make sure we carve off a special name
so sometimes they're talking about
entity reputation which is reputation
for short or user reputation which we
call Karma for short this is a list from
a blog post that you'll find if you want
to look it up that we put together
pulling all the karma rules out of the
book into one place so if you do a
search for building reputation system on
karma you'll find this post I'm not
gonna read it all here there's a lot of
qualifiers that don't necessarily apply
when you're talking about rating a movie
these are so important in fact out of
the five rules we're going to five
misconceptions we're gonna three of them
and we're already done with one three of
them will be about karma specifically
about user reputation just know for now
before we move on that adding karma to a
website meaning publicly displaying a
user's reputation is perilous and should
be considered very carefully so
reputation isn't just about people it's
any information used to make a value
judgment it's pervasive even when you
have a small conversation like that
there was probably twenty or thirty
reputations that went into setting it
and then they're folded into the
conversation we can't get through life
without it it's a given that it's such
an important primitive no one can
evaluate all the things they have to do
personal you can't test every University
by going to it you can't
test every restaurant by going to it we
know this this is what we build these
databases and we build these rep you
know even verbal reputation systems and
written ones it's pervasive so it was
very strange for us when we wrote the
book too because there was no book on
the topic through a book on page rank
that's great
and there were books about recommender
systems which means you know people who
like this also like that those are very
complex systems that's not what we're
talking about here we're talking about
this greater fabric of I trust who do I
trust
and why do I trust them but for all the
difficulty I just talked about now
pervasive it is karma is even harder to
get right in fact most people are
challenged to name more than one
successful karma system online there are
not very many most of them fail for
reasons and some of the reasons we'll
discuss so we'll start with the first
one there's this idea that you could
have a universal karma score so this is
the classic question should your
Slashdot karma count over on reddit
should your eBay score effect you know
some other shopping site or other
unrelated sites more than a few startups
have formed over the last five years to
create the grand unified Karma which is
enough to measure the man and tell you
is he a trusted person this idea is
pervasive Yahoo in fact during the five
years I worked there and I worked on
reputation from the very beginning to
the very end of my time there
consistently asked me to consider
building one of these the Yahoo karma
the idea is this would be the trusted
Yahoo user you'd be a real you know real
person or good citizen reputation system
across the entire web he could take it
everywhere
and the way they expressed it really got
at the point they said it would be like
a credit score for the Internet and in
fact some of these little companies that
have crashed on the rocks they've used
similar language so actually the cool
thing is is we can actually look at
credit score and talk about its global
applicability and just use the model
that they use the way you tend to think
about this intuitively and reflect it
back and say test it a little bit and
see if it'll survive so we're
talk about FICO probably the most
well-known American credit score there
are numerous ones but I'm gonna talk
about this one because I have a lot of
data on it it's an eight hundred and
fifty point score it represents
something called credit worthiness this
is the word they invented for it it is
affected and reduced by these scores
whether or not you make on-time payments
how much of your credit is used up how
long you've been a credit customer the
kinds of things you would normally fold
into a reputation like this you know
these inputs actually predict and
describe your credit use behavior the
inputs reflect the value of the output
for most of its 50 years this credit
score was used only for that purpose
then recently they decided that they
could expand their markets the people
who provide this in this case a fair
Isaac is the name of the company that's
what the FI stands for in FICO they said
oh we could sell this data to more
people I'm gonna take a little side trip
here
because I've discovered some more data
since I first wrote this one of the
things that people use this score for is
as a substitute reputation for hiring
someone so when you're gonna hire
someone in the old days like five years
ago you used to be able to ask for a
letter of recommendation you still be
able to call or call up the guys old
boss and say is this guy a good guy and
the guy could say when good maybe not
right we had these kinds of problems the
law has changed and basically most
companies and I'm sure Google is like
this will no longer give recommendations
positive or negative because if you
don't give negative ones then refusing
to give a positive one is a negative one
so this is what's happened is the
reputation system which is referrals and
recommendations and calling your boss
has collapsed and they were looking for
a substitute and they went whoa we've
got this global score called credit
score we're gonna use your credit score
to determine whether or not you're a
good guy right now you so you could
credit score to buy your house credits
maybe make sense rent an apartment
oh it's getting a little cheesy maybe
but to find a job leaves you with this
bizarre thing this thing I said before
about the inputs matching the outputs
well now you have this situation where
it's if you have a low credit score you
probably need a job so that you can make
money to pay off your credit and improve
your credit score if they're using your
credit score to deny you a job this is a
feedback loop that because the credits
because your deployability is in fact
not a factor right it's not like you
instantly get a better credit score
because you get a job so why on earth
should it be evaluated in fact since
this has been written since the book has
been written a study has come out that
said there's in fact no correlation
between your FICO score and your
effectiveness as an employee that in
fact this substitute global use is not
only meaningless in the kind of the
theoretical sense in the practical sense
so despite the intuition that a good guy
is gonna have a good credit score and a
bad debts and a bad credit score
therefore that applies to it's your job
it turns out to be false straight-up
false now this leaves employers and a
fix now we can't use the substitute
score either but I hope this makes my
point that the context for this is
creditworthiness the inputs are
creditworthiness and the output is
creditworthiness you shouldn't use it
across contexts all reputation is in
context and in fact if you remember I
asked earlier about these various things
these systems all the ones I have up
here eBay
SAT Foucault so these are all reputation
scores and they all just mean exactly
what they are right your eBay reputation
it's not any by the way it's not even
yours it's this account and this account
represents a business not you thank
goodness it's and it only represents
transaction worthiness you actually have
to complete a transaction to evaluate
the person right so at least they've
closed the loop up and said what it's
about
so people who say I want to use your
eBay feedback over on reddit don't even
know what they're talking about these
are unrelated things you can be the
chairman of Microsoft and cheat at
online poker and those are unrelated
things so there is no universal score in
fact there's there's a lot even when you
think of a score you're probably still
thinking of it too broadly reputation is
always an
the narrower the bedroom so the next one
all I need is five stars or thumbs up or
dick style voting and this is this kind
of goes after the the rating system of
Vogue today's it's like two years ago it
was five stars well it was stars five
stars than it was diggin and now it's
liking and these are the rating systems
of Vogue and I want to talk a little bit
about why you just don't get to pick
them random well you actually really
have to try to understand what's going
on so this is a story about a site
called Chowhound and this is an example
what we call interface first design and
I encountered this at Yahoo I have
stories I'll tell you off the record if
you're interested but I'm sure you guys
have them to about mock based design
where some well-meaning UI designer says
I'm gonna do a design for user
evaluation of some things like
restaurants will this drop in stars or
will just drop in likes or whatever
because they'll just pick the one that's
vogue well so here's an example of how
this can mess things up so Chowhound
was a community site for finding really
interesting things to eat in unusual
places that's its charter and it was an
initially a message for its message
boards so people would say oh I just got
back from San Antonio I found this
little taco truck in the corner that
goes over here it has the most amazing X
but don't eat anything else it'll make
you sick right and and the big
discussion that unfolds about these
diamonds in the rough is exactly what
the culture was built on right finding
the best pastrami sandwich in New York
means just the pastrami sandwich nothing
else right so twice the site got bought
and its last owner is currently CBS CBS
product designers said hey we can
capture more value from this site
because we have all these businesses
mentioned let's put in a five-star
rating system so that people can rate
the restaurants they added stars
this is the absolute wrong thing to do
first of all the community revolted
because now they were being asked to do
something they never wanted to do in the
first place that's if they wanted to do
that they would be overrun Yelp that's
what where you do that here they were
having these diamond arrests discussion
but you're also asking people to rape
things that the ratings are going to be
lower and less meaningful because what
you're saying is this is the best place
for pastrami but otherwise it's a two
star restaurant it's like why would you
do that you're trying to say something
nice you know this contrast doesn't
produce any value and in fact if you go
to the site they get no there's no up
pick no one's rating them it's very
pretty much all ignored this is the
wrong context for this kind of
evaluation in fact I suggested in a blog
post the correct valuation for this is
probably freeform text for best for and
you put in text and you can do
recognition you guys are really clever
you know where to take this so that
pastrami you can say gosh lots of people
say this is good for pastrami so when
you type in pastrami it gives you the
best pastrami place and it doesn't have
any stars whatsoever it just says 67
chowhounds think this is the best place
for pajamas drama in New York so let's
look at some other ineffective data this
has been stripped of its quantitative
value but it still has this these are
the five star ratings distributions for
nine of Yahoo properties as of a couple
years ago all of them except the one in
the center which you probably can't read
is says autos custom have the same
characteristic and something we call the
J curve the J curve says that basically
people only rate things five-star and
maybe a little bit one stars if you see
that curve what you're getting is this
distribution telling you there's
something about your design that isn't
really reflecting what people
intuitively think is a star distribution
the one in this auto custom in fact does
have a good distribution so when we talk
about J curves it turns out most of the
Internet has J curves
most of the review sites have this
problem I think it's because when you do
when you do design like Yahoo Local or
Yahoo shop or well let's do you know who
local is easiest you say I want to go
someplace for good pizza
so you type in pizza and Palo Alto and
it gives you the list of the best places
in Palo Alto which are the ones you're
gonna rate you're gonna rate the ones
that are displayed so there's a bias in
the presentation that says only rate hi
Wall Street Journal reported that
they've done a comprehensive review and
the average five star rating value is
four point three stars
that's way high given what and there's a
bunch of things packed in there and a
book talks about things like
acquiescence bias and a bunch of other
things but what I wanted to point out is
sometimes the scale should be reviewed
in the one about oddest custom was
special because it was users evaluating
user content and it was never
highlighted as the best content is at
the top of some search you would type in
Ford you know basically cars had their
own little profile pages called garage
pages and you you could do searches
across your favorite kind of car and you
would find everybody's stuff and they
would evaluate it and this is the only
time I've ever seen one star as almost
as high as five with a distribution in
between the one stars if you observe
them what they were is you didn't upload
a picture of your modified car or worse
you uploaded a stock picture of your car
this is a mod site and you'll get a
one-star rating for that let's dig into
a example close to home YouTube recently
changed its interface for evaluating
reviews our evaluating via videos this
is a video as of several months ago it
used five stars I'm sure you all know
this if you're paying attention but if
you haven't been paying attention I'll
share it people only ever rated the
thing five stars in fact this is the
distribution for YouTube it's AJ curve
with no J so basically every video on
YouTube was a five star video every
single one or it had no stars at all
it was either unrated or it was five
stars the average here is 4.8 okay this
is an insane number good news is the
product manager here figured it out and
figured out that the users are just
liking the video so you need likes great
good news the implemented likes down in
the corner here on the left it says like
there's a thumb with a like next to it
that's correct that's matching the user
behavior but what kind of surprised us a
little is there's a little thumb down
next to it with no text and I
encountered this at Yahoo on Yahoo TV
when they put in they they I convinced
them not to rate TV episodes because
only fans rate episodes so you're
wasting your time it'll be just like I
party that YouTube is it's going to be
just like YouTube don't do that they
said okay let's put in thumbs up I said
well I want you to do favorites but
thumbs up will work and then it couldn't
resist putting in thumbs down because
let's look at the distribution of thumbs
up for thumbs down guess what it's
exactly the same as it is it was with
the ratings I've had so YouTube they
know if you don't like it you know how
they know you don't like it not because
you put a thumbs down on it it's because
you didn't watch it all the way through
right so do you need downvote so
whenever you're thinking about an upvote
this is another one of those intuitions
I'm cracking at intuitions that people
have if I have a thumb up I must have a
thumb down well part of that is maybe
you shouldn't be using a thumb up you
should use a star like Facebook and
favoriting because once you get that
icon
everyone goes I gotta have that this is
a result of what my co-author calls oh
sorry
symmetrical thinking versus balance
thinking so symmetrical says if I have
enough I must have it down well in fact
you only need it down in a cut in a
situation where you're making a decision
between things like if you're gonna vote
for a or B then you have a reason to
choose between them or if you're trying
to pass a piece of legislation and you
want your vote to be counted and either
you know it's going to actually make
something happen
evaluating a thing saying I like it is
not symmetrical in that sense there's no
need to say dislike because no one knows
what they mean and in fact I always says
I was saying at lunch we've seen what
happens when you create those systems if
you look at I like to point at movie
sites like Yahoo movies or your favorite
one that allows user reviews if you
helpful votes if you look at the movie
reviews that have the most helpful votes
in total helpful plus unhelpful you'll
find an interesting pattern whether or
not the majority of people say it's
helpful or unhelpful it there are best
written reviews what happens is at scale
people start using these things to say
agree or disagree they get repurposed
and when you put in a thumbs down that's
one of the things that happens they're
saying something else and now it's all
confusing your signal if you have a
better way to get at negative feedback
get it that way if you want negative
feedback like this person is breaking
the rules have a different interface
which is usually what people call
flagging interface for Terms of Service
when talking about write facts about
balance versus symmetry we saying is
when people first set things up like I
he talks about a train set people will
put three soldiers on one side and three
soldiers on the other side to make it
the same because they can't figure out
that sometimes you want to tank in a
soldier against three soldiers it'll
give you that same aesthetic feedback
but it looks looks less awkward so when
you're thinking about designing for your
what reputation scores you pick try to
pick the ones that fit the pattern
you're trying to accomplish not meet
some unique measurement if no one's
saying no don't ask them to say no don't
ask for information you don't need and
you don't want so obviously whatever the
hot thing is what you need to do instead
is figure out from your context what's
the right thing and be sparing there was
an example at Yahoo where they had a
rating for the show and they had thumbs
up and thumbs down for each episode I
was telling you about it turned out
people missed the rating because they
were just clicking on the thumbs up they
were rating the episodes but they
thought they were rating the show
because no one rates episodes and so
they were gathering the same I like this
show data on every episode and
completely missing that there were stars
as a way to rate the show and so they
were going don't don't ask for two
ratings that are the same thing and
don't play the down vote
next competition is always good these
days
game mechanics for software for web
software are all the rage
you only need to add points or you need
a leaderboard so that people can compete
with each other participative incentive
so I'm going to tell you another story
about another site called consummating
you may not have heard of it because
it's not around anymore it was a dating
site as you might guess from the name
and it's point it was a the the
designers thought well we'll add some
game mechanics to kind of spice this up
a little bit get it going we want people
to be nice to each other there being a
little snipey so we're gonna give them
points to give to each other for being
nice and of course guess what they went
with symmetry instead of balance and
they said well we also allow you to give
negative points so when you go on a date
with someone you can either say I was a
great date or that date sucked and in
order to get the ability to evaluate
people had to evaluate you so they
created this chain where it was supposed
to build up it completely and utterly
destroyed the business as people started
playing that game instead of the dating
game of actually meeting people and
right there was trying to get other
people now this is one of the places you
first hear the term point whoring which
is the process of doing whatever it
takes to get people to give you points
so then you can evaluate other people
the the this Ben Brown I highly
recommend you read his blog post about
this it's called I love my chicken wire
mommy and this is excerpted from it but
the way I like to put it is when you're
creating a reputation system for
incentives when you're using it in
gaming mechanic if the only thing that
in said if that's the only reason people
are participating in the action you have
a real problem with your site people
should be motivated to do the things
that provide the most value for you and
them in a mutual way and these are
supposed to help you what happens is
these sites these mechanisms often
decayed to be the only reason to
participate
and when you do that you'll lose all the
value because now you have people
playing point games with each other who
are providing no value to the service
and your company tanks in our book
actually we talk a lot about different
incentive systems we talk I talk about
altruistic intercepts where people are
cooperating with each other or providing
information at large just because they
think it's important have some
subcategories of that I talked about
egocentric egocentric Oh which is you
know things for personal use probably
the most important yok Google is that
Google search is the ultimate example of
egocentric is incentives I type
something and I'm trying to get an
answer to something and I click through
and I got it that was successfully
playing on the egocentric incentive
model but sometimes egocentric means I
want to show people that I'm better than
other I want to be a master at something
and I want to demonstrate so leader
boards and stuff tend to live in
egocentric space and then what does I
mean I call commercial where people are
interacting with each other with a clear
output in mind so a lot of bloggers I'm
a commercial blogger I'm building my
brand by and I'm doing commercial
activity now by talking about stuff I've
learned so there's a you know if you
think of these across this spectrum
which Bryce glass developed while he was
at Yahoo on the left is caring and
collaborative that's where altruistic
incentives tend to live cordial through
collaborative is where commercial tends
live and competitive and combative are
where a lot of the egocentric incentives
live and hopefully from the story I
already told you you can see that you
really don't want to mix these so you've
got people over in collaborative for a
dating site you last thing you want is
leaderboards and competition between
them I certainly surfaced on the site
you know what goes underneath is what
goes on so it doesn't matter none of
these are good or bad you just want to
line up the the things you're designing
with the right kinds of things so
competition is fine if the context calls
for it if you are a World of Warcraft
player your reputation what level you
are and how quickly you beat this
monster and everything
excellent leaderboards local
leaderboards with your friends all kinds
of patterns it's a game game mechanics
are perfect and even some things that
aren't already games adding game
mechanics is great
Zynga and places like that are making a
fortune out of that but don't assume
there's cooperation when there's not if
you have an altruistic community and you
start like you have a message board for
cancer survivors and you turn on points
they're leaving they hate you now
because you've turned their altruistic
community into a competitive community
without even asking
and when Karma's involved user
reputation it escalates the fastest so
you know if you get incentives her for
writing reviews and you get a piece of
camera but no one else knows maybe that
makes sense for some things but as soon
as you create a leaderboard one of the
things to learn about leaderboards is is
they only incentivize n plus one users
and those n are the the size of your
leaderboard right everyone who's on the
leaderboard is incentivized to stay and
the one person who's just below it is
incentivized to try to get up everyone
else is basically disincentivized if you
start late we have a post on this called
leaderboards considered harmful you can
read all about it and the last one today
is negative karma will out the bad guys
this is another idea that is very
pervasive is that you know you could
assign a public score to a user that
says how good they are in some context
let's keep it in context I'm gonna say
it's global it's a context in this place
couldn't consummating her or this
service or that service and in fact eBay
does this they have a reputation score
they have green stars and red stars
right so even in context this provides
some real challenges so this is an
example simple model where the users are
getting positive reputation for doing
good things and negative reputation for
doing bad things in context whatever
those are so we have this guy is an
angel he's got 60 points and and a devil
who's minus 30 points so just hold that
simplified model in mind as we talk go
forward
so I'm gonna tell my favorite cautionary
tale about user rep negative user a
public reputation it's called the
virtual mafia shakedown this occurred
while I was running this the sims online
for about three months I ran the sims
online right after it came out and now
it's an online virtual world based on
the sims and you can control a little
avatar running around playing with other
people and you could chat
you could run little businesses and
classic virtual world stuff but done by
Electronic Arts slash Maxis it had
in-game currency called the Somalian and
you earn some of those by doing tasks in
the game and you could pay some of them
to other people to rent houses and
things like that so I don't have good
graphics for it so I'm using these Bryce
glass produced abstractions but it still
works one of the important mechanics
that were in it I was created by by Will
Wright and it was his first multi-user
online game involved a graphic display
of your friends so it's actually ahead
of your time you you have to use a
special Facebook plug-in to get this
which would show all the people who said
they liked that there were your friend
rendered as arrows pointing into you
with circles so there was this you press
f11 and up would come your face in the
middle and little green circles all
around you from all the people who said
you were friends and you can leave a
little note and they could say why they
liked you and if you like them back the
arrow would be bi-directional so you
know so this is a really cool early
friend's graphing technology and it was
fine as far as it went but unlike other
social networks will really liked
playing with social mechanics at first
and he allowed users to declare that you
were untrustworthy so I would say no you
suck and I would attach a red arrow to
you and I could leave a message on why
you suck it didn't take long before a
group came along self named the sims
mafia and if you look them up you can
read about them and they figured out how
to use this to shake down customers and
it would work like this
new customer would come in to do oh this
is kind of fun come out and say hi I can
see you're new to the Sims and yeah if
you could figure out how to type yeah so
it would help them figure out how to use
leave our physical yeah then you say
give us all your money it's like what
yeah give me all your samolians or I'll
make it so you cannot rent a house I
will block that function for you first
to say why I said well here bring up
your friends graph and that's usually
when someone would say what's that
and they'd say pray press f11 and when
you press f11 this is what you would see
all of the similar that the guys on this
on the Sims mafia had all posted I hate
this person messages saying don't trust
them whatever you do they cheat don't
rent to them they'll steal your stuff
out of your house because renting gave
you access to the house contents so
Trust was critically important so they
could literally sabotage your trust
level with the entire service with all
the other users would all go crap I
don't trust this person so think of this
it sounds weird and then you know wait
oh that's how eBay works if you ever
bought anything from an eBay vendor with
more than three stars I think not more
three three red stars I mean three red
stars these are exactly the same as that
in this game it was completely broken
because this person who was paying $10 a
month quit that's how I know this story
so well because a few people were paying
$10 a month were churning through my
customers by shaking them down
so with that lesson in mind let's look
our look at our original simplified
model again here's the same guys but
you'll notice the the double guy somehow
now has a zero above them he's declared
reputation bankruptcy he abandoned his
avatar and created a new one and his
score went up to zero isn't that awesome
so you can't actually have a negative
score anything below start equals
restart right so the first premise is
that greater and lesser is you know
positive and negative or possible to
measure in fact again using eBay how
many red stars
green stars are equal to one red star
before you understand it you think we'll
one in green equals one red no three
Reds cancel an infinite number of green
stars because that account gets
abandoned three stars is exactly equal
to negative 30 in this example it's
unrepairable and you get rid of it
likewise think about it a little more
subtly mister sixty there what if I told
you yesterday his score was 360 does he
look so angelic today you can't tell
this is a failure of the scalar model or
you just have a vector where you're
adding positive negative and you don't
show any of the history you just show
the result you're in trouble
so the general lesson here is is avoid
public karma period if you can if you
don't need it don't show it you really
want to know who your bad guys are keep
those scores private and I'm gonna share
a detailed the summary of the detail
that's in the book chapter ten is all
about this one reputation model the case
study we did for Yahoo Answers so I was
the in charge of the replication portion
of Yahoo Answers user user content
moderation model and we made a model
which is it was in this little box as
people would report a Content item
there'd be a reputation model run and we
would actually hide the content in
effect removing it from experience if
enough users said it's bad simplest
version of a model is three strikes in
your out it became much more complex
than that but the easiest way to
describe it is when enough good
reputation people say this is bad
content we'd hide it and there was
enough there's a procedure to the right
for dealing with the exceptions when you
know if someone if someone ganged up on
someone who didn't have bad content and
so it was a abuse mitigation mechanism
so here are our goals at the time we
started the reason we started this
project is if a user flagged an item is
bad on Yahoo Answers it would take 18
hours before it was reviewed and taken
down because it went through a customer
care queue customer care queue was
costing about a million dollars a year
to handle that with an 18 hour lag our
goal with this model was to reduce that
to one hour
so that the content would go away faster
bad content we found out not only there
are customer care agents we're having a
10% accuracy or 90% only 90% accuracy I
meant one in 10 items that should have
been hidden wasn't getting taken down
and one in 10 items that should have
been taken down wasn't we didn't expect
to have any influence on that we assumed
users were going to be just as bad at
identifying bad content as our customer
support people and like I said we
originally were running at a million per
year we were hoping to cut it by 90
percent if we were successful so we ran
the model and we saw the following
results the amount of time it took for
us to remove a bad item dropped to 30
seconds literally a bad person would
post some you know troll would post
something or a spammer and post
something and by the time they could go
back and look to see if it was still
there it would already be gone that
users were sniping that stuff as fast as
it was being produced that's because
there were a lot more good users and
there were bad users it didn't take long
the interesting thing was the evaluation
error rate dropped to less than 1% less
than a tenth of a percent that in fact
they were actually really good at
determining what was the worst stuff on
the site they were better at it than our
self now mitad Lee that happened because
they weren't making reviewing any they
weren't trying to hide any content that
was questionable but by definition if
it's not reported it doesn't matter so
this is the actual rate and this meant
we were able to reduce the overhead to
the fraction a fraction of a person less
than $10,000 to moderate that a year so
we say better part of a million dollars
a year we found out something very
exciting when we ran it we originally
saw that that exception on the right
which we called the appeal process if
you you would get an email saying your
stuff had been taken down you could
appeal and then it would finally go to
customer care and so this last you know
fraction of a person was handling these
Appeals they only had to handle Appeals
the appeal rate after two weeks
precipitously dropped and it was
freaking us out it was a few a day up to
10 a day and then it dropped below 1 a
day
rapidly and we couldn't figure out what
happened at first we thought maybe the
users had given up or something but no
reporters were continuing to increase
their reliability a test of the data
suggested that the quality had continued
to increase overall and what we found
out happen is is the second-order effect
from a feedback system this is a
feedback system when you start hiding
bad guys contents in 30 seconds guess
what the bad guys do they leave they
find greener pastures for trolling
because they eventually just give up we
literally drove spammers and trollers
off with this particular mechanism the
benefit they were getting they were
never seeing they were only getting
their jollies if someone commented and
say you too whatever it is they posted
now no one was saying that and the
content was disappearing so as
addressing the the complaints before or
the all you need is negative karma karma
is complex I didn't talk about that too
much
it's made of indirect of inputs Marya
bout the about the mafia is why you
shouldn't allow users to directly
evaluate each other you want them to
evaluate content the Yahoo model works
because they're not evaluating users
they're evaluating content and that
content reputation then rolls up to the
users the ones who are accurately hiding
to get an increased score those who have
been had their stuff hidden have a
decreased score they keep it but it's
secret
score it's not public so public karma is
puzzled positive karma and although I
cross out karma will out the bad guys
I'm going to modify that to say secret
or what we call corporate Karma is in
fact good in fact at Yahoo the head of
Yahoo security says this is their
favorite and most important use of
reputation for them is tracking various
attributes I'm sure Google does the same
and then taking action about those
interactions so they'll track IP
addresses and if they think it's a
spammer they'll they won't take active
action against the spammer necessarily
but they'll do weird things like slow
down their inactive rate of SMTP calls
and things like that I'm sure you guys
do the same kinds of things without
having
confirm it I know what the general
practices are once you know you've got a
bad guy you don't have to lock him out
you just have to slow him down until he
doesn't cost you anything
so this is a summary list I call the
missteps corrected I'm not gonna read it
again but it's time for questions
yes all right so I don't have a copy of
the study yet I only saw two reports of
it but it was a government with studies
so if you just do a search for actually
no I have a bookmarked if you go to the
reputation site reputable des reputation
comm which I mentioned at the beginning
there's a page which has reputation
links one of the most recent links will
link to that specific article and link
back to the study yeah that was a big
win I've been giving this talk
previously and I'd said you know there's
no evidence that there is a correlation
now there's evidence there is no
correlation yeah
you know as far as I know using credit
score is still it's never been
legislated for or against I have links
to that also there's a pointer in the
book to the place if that has changed
there's a thing called the fair
employment fair employment org or
something like that I don't remember the
exact URL I'm sorry but that would have
everything about that because they're
particularly miffed about this practice
yeah does anyone out there in the VC you
have a question yeah we can't see you
all right one in the back first before
so well so I think I know what the
question is because the way you asked it
you said those who are already using
five stars should continue using them
and I'm going to say well maybe I
but at YouTube was a perfect example of
it being wrong
so Meyer answer about whether or not to
use five stars based just on user
experience I think data is saying
otherwise in some cases some cases it's
the correct thing to do that's all I'm
asking you to consider but just because
other people have doesn't mean it's the
correct choice if you're seeing it just
like it wasn't for YouTube it was the
wrong choice for YouTube absolutely
once the day you know once you look at
the data you go oh this is obviously the
wrong choice and change it so you can
certainly experiment with anything
because if you don't know what your
committees going to do keep in mind
Amazon actually was suffering from the J
curve about four years ago I went to a
talk where I learned the phrase J curve
and you curve and there's that we did a
bunch of discussion about this and they
were so frustrated by those results that
they released this thing that when you
mouse over those scores now it gives you
a distribution curve because here's the
problem if you all assume there J curves
then you can interpret four-point-three
as a median score right if you don't
know that the distribution is like that
and they suffer from you curve
distributions here's a distribution that
will really freak you out a top ten or a
note of the top number one selling book
three weeks ago four weeks at four weeks
ago New York Times top selling book on
Amazon which is a four point three
average rating service had a three star
rating right why well if you look at the
curve it was a u distribution why was it
u description you look at the ones the
answer is because Amazon's pricing
policy for the Kindle edition of the
book prevented the the Pala publisher
decided that this $54 book they would
not sell it on the Kindle for $20 Amazon
had to change their policy if they were
going to sell their book on the Kindle
edition
or they were gonna wait until the value
of the book drop such that they could
sell a Kindle for 20 so these were users
who owned Kindles who were pissed off
that they couldn't read the book right
so if you look at the average score
there's an indication there all the
average core is telling you is
something's horribly wrong I have to dig
in deeper so they put these mouse over
so you could see the distributions
because a u-shaped distribution average
of 4.3 it's a completely different
meaning than a j-curve distribution of
4.3 so you are really stuck if as long
as you have only one number you need
most x provide more data or be
absolutely sure like the example I gave
you that you're getting this really nice
distribution and it doesn't matter and
the ins what you don't want to do is
just because users say they are familiar
with it
they're probably if you ask them what
the interpretation means they probably
don't know if five-star on on YouTube
means a lot of people like it and a
three-star on certain things on Amazon
means some people are pissed off at
Amazon I mean how do you interpret
alright yet there's a lot of
conversations going on across the web
now the federated identity of global
identities and I was wondering what your
thoughts were on that yeah it's the
question is about well I have a lot of
thoughts about identity in fact I'm
thinking about my next book being on
identity but the question was about
reputation and federated identity I'm
gonna defer that to another discussion I
don't know a way to say something
concise no I can't think of it I keep
trying to pack it down it won't pack
well sorry he'll have to answer it
separately yeah
generally yeah some people been trying
to make some counter arguments but I
haven't seen any all right so what kind
of reputation systems are good for all
twisted communities is kind of the
question if you don't have a leader
board it so in in the book I described
three kinds of reputation displays the
public one which is kind of the one
where the competition comes into play
and I talk a little bit about the
corporate or secret one which is some
data your company has for making
decisions about people there's one in
between called private which is between
you and the service and gets reflected
back to you and so for example Google
Analytics provides private reputation to
lots of people who are tracking their
blogs that way so that they know what
people think about you know their
visitor traffic and where they're coming
from right so altruistic communities
often look for a peer feedback so oddly
if I can give you a gift point and it
just just you know writing is not being
reflected to everyone else that can be a
very powerful motivator so basically
look at private reputation systems and
private incentive systems so I know I'm
improving so I can still it's
interesting you can be altruistic when I
when I break these incentives out
sometimes you have a combination
sometimes it's like well the community
is altruistic but there's a sense of
mastery which is an ego centric thing
driving some of the behavior but it's
private so a lot of of sites that are
interesting behavior give lots of
feedback individually to people telling
them how many people saw read your post
right it's a really good example of me
getting feedback from our altruistic
behavior without being compared to other
people so that the competition part is
is kind of manifested most of the time
is public comparison which is different
from acknowledgement of of contribution
so some communities do that some people
actually some sites actually give awards
to people so you they literally give
physical awards and have dinner saying
these people have the biggest effect on
our altruistic community
those are a form of recognition that are
are fairly common they can become
dangerous if they become competitive all
right if you ever start exposing the
metrics for how those are generated next
thing you know you get your mom you're
creating people trying to do those
behaviors instead of actually you know
doing the good doing the good work last
one yeah yeah so besides the obvious so
the question was how does this change
internationally the answer is a lot I'm
not an expert in international I'm
familiar with many of the issues from
the five years I was a yahoo some of the
I'm just gonna tick some off they're
kind of a random hodgepodge I don't have
a concise answer for this one is
cultural indicators of things like
thumb-up watch out thumbs up doesn't
mean the same thing here as it does
elsewhere
I won't I won't show you the same symbol
here on my hand but so there's kind of
basic cultural stuff there's a sense of
sharing like the difference between what
I call the favoriting pattern which is I
like this thing and I want to surface it
on my profile you know how people feel
about privacy so there's a whole bunch
of things associated with privacy also
where things live on the competitive
spectrum some cultures are way less
competitive they basically you never
create a leaderboard in certain cultures
that's just a bad idea so the other one
I wanted to point out is tied in to what
Dirk asked about which has to do with
identity a whole we have a whole section
or book on reputation is identity and
identity in other countries is
fundamentally different in Korea for
example every transaction you chase on
the Internet is traced back to your so
the equivalent of your social security
number your citizen identity is tied to
your connection and so everything about
your behavior is more tightly
constrained with
of an internet anonymity doesn't exist
there in any way like we think about it
here and so it's I'm just accentuating
the question without answering it saying
there are fundamental cultural root you
know root cultural differences that
would affect these choices and so I'm
not making you notice I didn't make any
recommendations about choices those
would fold into the context so I have a
different talk I gave called context as
Kings where I break out various contexts
and international is this one really
important context so yeah it's not just
whether or not you're doing ratings and
reviews for movies it's ratings and
reviews in Korea means something
different than reading the review in the
United States thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
