and living his passion health wellness
and performance a three-sport scholar
athlete in high school mark attended
Harvard University where he continued
his pursuit of academics and athletics
after receiving his undergraduate degree
in psychology from Harvard mark went on
to study at the University of North
Carolina Greensboro where he graduated
with a master of science degree in
exercise and Sport Science dr. mark been
attended naturopathic medical school at
bastyr university these experiences
sharpened his insight into health and
wellness both in theory and in practice
dr. mark began to question the factors
that most influence how people live and
often the misguided manner in which
people try to improve their health he
came to two significant conclusions too
much of what we are told changes too
often and our scope of Health must be
magnified in 2004 dr. mark founded onvo
a health and wellness company offering
program solutions personalized coaching
and consulting services as a personal
client I'm very excited to welcome dr.
mark adams to google thank you very much
thank you and at least from the west
coast time thanks for joining me on your
lunch hour and hide everybody your your
over my right-hand shoulder so if I look
at you that's where I'm looking I
thought we'd start by going around the
room and sharing what everybody had for
lunch no thank you said everybody scared
about that right I want to thank you for
having me out here today and I've really
been looking forward to I think Google
does an outstanding job of supporting
your health and well-being and not a lot
of companies do that so I think that's a
lot of accolades to go to Google now
before you get started anybody here and
they're not like food you guys tell me
if they raise their hand anybody not
like food okay I just want to check
because i don't i don't want i might
have to ask you to leave the room if
that was the case that i love food I
love to talk about food and we think
about it we're going to get into this a
little bit just kind of scrolling
through some pictures here when we talk
about food we a lot of things come to
mind but I always like to think about
food that really just elicits kind of
young response over here we like those
don't we and those what comes from those
right
how about that you think we can eat that
today for dessert okay so what that is
it's strawberry shortcakes almost
strawberry season that's why put in it
wait wait what as I said I like to talk
about food three basic main reasons
number one no matter who you are where
you live who you voted for what your job
responsibilities food matters to every
single person in this world in fact it's
one of the greatest common universal
denominators we all have okay number two
it's just huge why in the road or really
a fork in the road to play it on word
that really can take you one direction
or another in the positive way you go
this way it can be one of your greatest
sources of health joy and nourishment in
your life you go the other way go down
the other path sometimes with good
intention or sometimes just stop
ignorance or just you don't care you've
got down the other path well food can
become when their greatest sources of
disease dysfunction dissatisfaction
really your life so it really matters
quite a bit and I love wanting and
having people experience food and much
more the joyful pause away where you get
what we all kind of want anyway but we
sometimes don't know how to get there
and then lastly which is I think it's
really kind of interesting okay is that
food is the mirror of us and we're a
mirror of our food now what does that
mean yeah we build our bodies out of
food but I find over the last several
years working with folks from all across
different walks of life that how we deal
with food is a mirror image in fact if
we deal with food and very positively
very calm way very joyful way that
really translate it has parallels the
rest of your life but if we have a bad
relationship with food a negative
relationship with food with a rigid
relationship with food or we're scared
of food we feel guilty guess what that
shows up in other aspects your left so
before we get going I always like to
think about not making any assumptions
to say hey is there a problem okay if
there is a problem what is the problem
then how we can go about solving it well
I'm a big a fan that you can always
judge what you're doing no matter how
good it sounds how smart it seems how
effective what
are you getting that at the end of day
is the bottom line singular measure that
we want to know am I getting what I want
okay and if we look at this if you think
about what we look what we want versus
what we got how many of you want to look
better you want to feel better you want
perform better anybody right just one
two three okay got a few more people
right well is that where we're at now
I'm assuming you're here today because
either you just your you like to soak up
knowledge and information in your sponge
and or some combination that maybe
you're not a hundred percent satisfied
with everything you are personally doing
or think you're doing in your life right
now we have what i call this heaviness
epidemic in our country now both
literally and figuratively well
literally right okay two-thirds of
americans are overweight okay and that
number is growing that little map right
there you don't need to really know that
much about except with the darker and
the more read it gets and the orange
gets the more they'll be seein
overweight interest growing and these
mass or I think if I mistake not
mistaken are only about a 25 year gap
okay no surprise we know this but really
when looking around here most folks here
at Google don't deal with that but also
with blue translate to how you feel day
in debt you think about your chronic
health your chronic illness seven out of
10 Americans died from chronic illness
two out of three health care dollars get
spent on on chronic illness okay but
here's what the we translate to a little
bit i think more personal and really
more about who we are it's beyond the
heaviness in our waistline but it's
really the heaviness in our life I love
to watch people okay it doesn't take
much to entertain me I could be at an
airport I could be on a park bench and
you just look at people maybe you look
at people walking around the hallways
here people walk around like with this
sense of heaviness right they don't feel
great they have maybe lower energy
they're getting tired they're crashing
and craving all day or we know we're
just getting older and that's just what
we're supposed to expect okay that to me
this this heaviness when our life and
how we feel to me is the biggest problem
not just the waistline okay especially
and a
hard working environment where you're
you're going going going your high
performing you may be at your desk all
day you try and get a lot of things done
on a deadline okay now why do we have so
there is a problem okay what is the
problem okay but then it's we don't have
it because there's a lack of information
in fact we're kind of in this land of
the lost what I call noise and confusion
okay problem number one everybody seems
to be saying something different right
you've probably had folks up here
talking to you through the stairs
telling you a lot of different things
doctors will tell you one thing your
trainer the FDA your dietitian
nutritionist right your friend the
person next door to you your mom okay
Oprah you know just tells us things this
year next year you know something is
different from everybody so we're not
there's no shortage of solution is no
shortage of ideas okay and here's one
thing that bothers me what we're told
changes way too much okay now i know
from a technology standpoint there's
always upgrades those are always
advancements in like what's the next
best thing but you know here's the
fundamental truth about our bodies our
big our bodies are designed to function
a certain way and that's not changing
okay so why does it make sense that
everything we're told often changes so
for example i have a little egg here you
can see that okay and say this is i
don't think it is because i just grabbed
it quickly at the store to this morning
but say this is an organic free-range
cage-free eggs no no hormones you know
none of that stuff so we take out all
those variables if we look at the egg is
the a good or bad it's good right right
everybody calm fuh de of that right now
we don't have to go back too far in our
recent history to say there's been
judgments I said hey no wait the egg is
bad or avoid the egg or only eat the egg
whites or don't eat the yolk in fact if
you look over the last 25 to 30 years or
so we've probably flip flop back and
forth about two or three times on on the
egg so I want to ask you has the egg
changed what has changed
but our understanding never right I mean
to me maybe you have kids or a pet
you're like okay no you're good you're
bad in the egg is like am I good and my
bat I don't know make up your mind is
having an identity crisis right well
that the problem is what we know our
understand what i like to say our
current knowledge which is our current
state of knowing changes so what we're
told today about the egg is different
than what we were told in the past and
it's not just yet so you can imagine
from a nutrition standpoint specifically
what you're told from how to eat what
eat imagine that it might be different
tomorrow and what you're told today but
we've got a couple options right do we
wait around till we know it all I would
suggest not doing that because we're
never going to know at all okay or are
we going to come up with the way to
think about things a framework to give
us lasting guidance to way to where we
can harness the natural power by toward
health that's what I focus on and that's
what i like to do because here's the
bottom line your body naturally tends
toward health if given the chance think
about that tends toward help if given a
chance so you cut yourself what happens
that cut you don't do anything what
happens that cut it heals right you
might just wash it and forget about it
and I never really think much think
twice okay so some mechanism in your
body is pushing you toward health your
basic job your basic responsibility its
kind of push that along or help it go
along that way and you really remove the
obstacles okay so the idea with this all
this noise all this confusion I always
like to tell people it's almost like
your computer sometimes we need to hit
the reset button sometimes we need to
need to wipe the slate clean reset
yourself and we're in amin the notion
that and i'll get to a second here that
food is one of the greatest starting
points that you can start with okay now
before I go further I'd like to always
like to just take a minute and tell you
my story a little bit and really my
lessons not to tell you really about
myself but really because they will help
you understand the approach that I take
and really how I try to help people day
in and day out because I think there's
some interest
lessons on he gave you a little bit of
background I grew up in the Midwest a
big family sports and fitness went out
to Harvard was able to play football
studies there didn't really know what I
was going to do but I've always been
interested about health and life and
performance at that point more about
athletic performance decide to go down
to North Carolina to get my master's
degree in exercise and sports science
and I was going to focus on peak
performance so I went down when the best
programs in the country work with a lot
of faculty members who dealt with
working with the Olympic athletes were
11 teams that's where i went to go but
why was there my personal interest just
kind of started shipping more to
wellness my own health oh by the way at
the same time my father at the age of 57
had almost a fatal heart attack just
what seemed like at the time I had the
blue and I'm like how could that happen
you know nothing there was really no
warning signs that I thought but looking
back obviously knew that so my interest
just kind of like boom wellness mine own
health nutrition going from athletic
performance the light bulbs because no
matter who you are where you're at you
are performing day in and day out if I
decide to come out here to bastard a
naturopathic medical school many of you
are probably familiar with it a
wonderful school got my my ND degree and
went through the training and anyway the
last part of the training school we have
a clinic that's in Seattle and it's a
teaching clinic and we'd have people
coming in from colds and flus all whips
to aids cancers you name it everything
in between and people would either be
coming to seek either alternative care
or complimenting care with what they're
doing and what would happen we'd have a
supervising doctor we'd have a primary
doctor which is a student clinician and
a secondary doctor which is a student
clinician the person would come in so
you say you came into the office say hey
what's wrong with you we'd asked what
was wrong we go through a case history
way they do some physical exam then we
all go out of the room and we put our
heads together and say well what should
we do we type up a treatment plan and
maybe we had ten things on this list
we go back into the room and we're going
to present you and hear how it kind of
pattern repeated itself a little bit
number one eat better number 2 i'm
simplifying a little bit too you know
sleep more three you need to exercise
and be more active number four reduce
some stress in your life will ya what
can we do but then there's almost it's
like but I know you're not really going
to take time to an effort to do that so
number five what can I give you and that
happened enough time times and I'm like
well how is that different than anything
else how am I going to try to fix you
right and i understand i'm not i'm
pleased i understand I'm not dismissing
it's a teaching clink I know why but for
me personal personally kind of where I
am and what I want to do in my interest
like that just kind of bug me I'm like
well wait a second what if we just don't
give up on the top of the list because
if we're saying these things have the
most impact why can't we tell people
like why can't we go up to the top
a-list help people do those things more
not perfectly but better and then maybe
you don't need five six and seven
because it's a pain in the rear end
right that get sick to deal with disease
illness we talked up we saw those stats
they're a little bit while ago so it's
obviously much better harder but much
better take care of yourself okay so I
came out of there with not only seeing
this this this process happened over and
over but also to from just again I
wasn't I was not immune to the idea that
well what about this diet what about
that diet what about this fat or what
about this or even what we learned in
school in the textbook sometimes change
and I basically decided I needed to
start from scratch here I'd complete 11
years of school three different degrees
and I'm like I just need to start from
scratch because you know what I'm
frustrated I'm confused so I understand
what people come to me and they're like
I don't know what to do so I just
started from scratch I asked myself to
basic questions okay how is it human
being designed to live and how do you
get the most impact those are my
focusing questions from the very
beginning because I learned very quickly
that is so important to have a framework
that you understand that you believe in
her
Lee that will help you guide decision
otherwise you're going to be all over
the place ok so now developing kind of
approach that we work with people over
the last seven years and as I said these
are people like you they want to feel
better they just they don't want to be
ok they want to be better some people
have serious health condition but they
really just really want to perform
better day in and day out so our basic
philosophy is very simple nourishment
gives us life movement expresses life
and relationships or the meaning of life
everything in my world and how I work
with people in the framework can kind of
fit in that guess what we start with
nourishment that's why we're here today
right well why is it just because that's
what I like no remember this is how
about how is the body design how's that
human being designed to function live
how do we get the most impact you get
the most impact with nourishment and
specifically nutrition why is this the
case as a human being we have zero
capacity to create energy zero think
about that ok don't go into a lunch coma
on me we have zero capacity what we do
have the capacity to do is receive
transform and redirect so we were we are
wholly entirely dependent on external
sources of nourishment including food
but not just limited to food to give us
life so I would say a little bell should
go offer and say well ding ding think
those things should be pretty important
ok and in fact they are not just in
theory but in practice ok so our
principles of nutrition that we develop
and have worked within the framework
that I teach is number one eat real food
that sounds like really interesting
doesn't it ok number to honor your
hunger and number three find your rhythm
all three are essential the biggest
mistake I find most people make is that
they think number one it's just about
food and if I figure out the food
everything else will come it will help
quite a bit but it will only get you so
far the hunger and the rhythm people
well tie things in where all these
things work together now I'm going to
try to squeeze in your the time we have
left really what takes me I would I
teach a 28-day program i'm going to try
squeezing it in the next 20 to 25
minutes or so and give you a little bit
of taste and overview about how we want
to approach us because these seem great
you seem interesting but they're like
okay what does that mean but there's a
lot of things behind it so let's break
them down just a little bit and we'll
focus on real food a little bit more
than the others real food anybody have a
good definition of real food yeah
provides nourishment but but a Twinkie
provides nourishment yeah it does pause
not positive nourishment but negative
nurse but it provides nourishment
because if you were going to be on a
desert island and there's a box a
creative twink is floated up on the
beach would you not eat them you were
nothing good okay but you should belong
to our club that's good no but the idea
the nourishment could be positive or
negative but yeah okay any bells any
other definitions natural not process
that's good what does that mean so
natural but not process with those who
can hear ya no plastic wrap okay stuff
that grows yeah good okay you guys would
kind of on the right path so what we
like to say when I say eat real food
notice I didn't say diet food notice I
didn't say health food okay real food we
have some basic kind of definitions that
we talked about that we try to teach ok
can I hunt it can I pig it can I fish it
can I harvest it right all these old
world food categories did this food
exist before 1900 I don't break food
down into pieces and parts so when I
work with folks I don't talk a lot about
protein I don't talk a lot about fat or
carbohydrates okay so let's let's take
an example okay water bottle low support
here okay
I'm going to test you okay so we have a
water ball that has a nutritional label
okay those of you who aren't here we've
all seen this so let me ask you
something how many calories on water in
water okay because we're looking at a
nutrition label right so she said zero
how many you need your glasses how many
how many how many how much protein zero
protein how much fat zero fat carbs how
many carbs zero ok can you do the math
for me what does that add up to zero ok
so here we go we've identified you know
we collectively have said these we have
a nutrition label calories fat protein
carbs and maybe a few other things we've
collectively identified these to be the
most important attributes to decide what
we put in our body right fair enough
right we all know like how many how many
calories that have our looking at labels
how many protein grams right I think we
even have some labeling around here like
that so here's the thing though we would
be dead sooner without water than food
by a long shot not even close we could
go weeks without food if we had to as
long as we had water we could only go
days without water we're seeing that in
different parts of the country different
parts of the world right now that
they're shortage of water so here's the
thing a little bell should go off in
your head and say well ding ding ding
maybe those numbers don't tell me
everything I need to know and they don't
I'm not saying they're not interesting
or amusing or useful from time to time
but I actually believe and we've seen
that that breaking food and dissected
into pieces and parts calories fat
protein carbs I believe has been one of
the worst mistakes we've made in our
culture when it comes to nutrition
education trying to get healthy because
we dissect and disconnect from the food
dissect the food down and we get
disconnect we don't know what food is
anymore some of you are a little bit
ahead of the game but we this is where
we get into diet food and health food
okay but hopefully we go down we look at
the ingredients and we say what's in
there
hopefully I just should say water right
so the idea and this is where it becomes
problematic if we take this next step
forward now that we've identified those
numbers book look sexy 8 on the label we
start manufacturing food to meet those
numbers and that's where you get into a
lot of diet food and health food so
obviously we want to focus on the pause
but if we think about real food the
negative is that we want to avoid foods
up in process there's only three
fundamental ways food gets processed by
addition subtraction and modification we
either add something to it we pull
something away or now in this day and
age this whole genetic modification
which to me is a very scary thing cuz we
are we are fundamentally changing the
DNA genetic sequence of food that does
not happen in the natural world there
are going to be consequences but does
this make sense there's only if we have
real food and I hunt it pick it fish at
harvest it what are these food
categories real quickly fruits
vegetables meats nuts seeds beans
legumes right dairy eggs meat fish
seafood that type of thing these are
real food so either we we change that by
adding some things pulling it away or
modify it okay case in point a couple
examples okay in this day and age
there's quite a few corn soy wheat and
rice buy products okay this is where we
teach people to look at the greens I
personally don't care what the top of a
nutrition label says in fact I tell
people if you can not to look at it
because it's going to just throw you off
the front of the label number one food
without labels is better than food with
labels right but the front of something
the packaging whatever says does it
always tell us much the back at the top
of the nutrition label I don't really
care I want to know is it real food is
enough I want you to look at the
ingredients so when we look at food
you'd be surprised go home to your
pantry go to the grocery store go to
health food stores you will fit you will
see things that are basically corn soy
wheat byproducts rice buying products
everywhere so by definition these foods
have been changed by addition
subtraction modification okay and here's
something I'll remind you at the end but
you need to do
the hard work to figure this out and
believe it yourself but when we food
that's been changed bad things happen
okay remember we said nourishment gives
us life right so when we food that's
been changed bad things are going to
happen yet to our waistline but it will
happen to our life that's what the
degrees of disease dysfunction
dissatisfaction I talked about so it's
not just oh no big deal it's mostly
healthy it's I'm not even hear me
calories I'm read enough protein it's
really more about the food itself okay
enriched or fortified foods okay this is
a red flag if something says its
enriched or fortified survey your mind
kind of all those foods what that might
be I go what happened to that food that
it needs to be enriched and fortified
cause I'll tell you what real food
naturally comes enriched and fortified
so something's been processed and change
that they need to do that and typically
enriched and fortified foods are
enriched and fortified with either it
like synthetic chemicals or materials or
not not the sources of those actual food
so for example I always say it's kind of
like when we processed food it's like
it's like humpty-dumpty kind of falling
down and we're going to take mr. Potato
Head parts and try to put them back
together it just isn't going to work
okay we're going to create some some
problems I'm low-fat foods I took this
picture i think i was down portlyn it I
believe walking by I love ice cream just
so you know I always like put that out
there because people think oh you don't
have fun with good I love I wouldn't
want to live in a world I can eat ice
cream okay so you know I always look at
signs like this but this is for a yogurt
stand okay I like ice cream butter and
yogurt just personally but you go
through it's just real oh yeah healthy
hmm nonfat oh cuz low-fat foods or
processed foods a foods that naturally
have fat in them we remove the fat you
funda- trishul makeup of that food and
how your body is designed for your body
to deal with it break it down and
nourish you major cause of crashing
craving
when folks I work with I don't let them
eat low-fat foods where I highly suggest
they don't yeah I've a low fat foods
okay here's the interesting thing when
you eat low-fat foods you will have
probably a higher chance of being fat I
know that's a big statement but we
talked about why that's the case and so
I always tell few have permission just
did like never have low-fat foods again
okay and who likes those anyway
genetically modified foods we talked
about that sweeteners Adams chemicals
flavor enhancers this is just kind of a
broad generic category lots of chemicals
in our food okay I use msg as an example
okay now we all know know who eats msg
and you're nobody goes out and says can
i have some msg right just a little
history of it introduced in 1947 it's
like cytotoxins so you can just kind of
get all these crazy things going on with
your body if you have too much of it we
all know not to have that right
restaurants say no MSG food say no msg
that's not the problem right so you
think you're avoiding msg but if you
look at your ingredients and we have a
we had basically have a test it says hey
if a ten-year-old can recognize the
ingredients from start to finish it's
probably real food okay so you see these
categories of food will msg is if you
see any of these categories in the
ingredient list msg is always in there
okay some of those like there's a
ten-year-old no with us I don't know
there's a lot of health food and diet
foods that have those ingredients okay
now also to you think you're avoiding
msg so these foods often have it I'm not
going to go through that list but we
don't we try to stay away from things
that might have multiple dextran in it
for examples one big category natural
flavouring you ever get something that
says natural flavoring what is that if
it's natural flavoring why don't they
say it it's a very vague term so this is
more truth and labeling comes out what
it doesn't automatically mean it's bad
but it can be because there's no defined
definition what is so usually I get kind
of cautious where I'm not going to
always avoid it but if I see if I see
natural flavors I'm like I'm
that's not something I want to have all
the time or as a staple ok so we talk
about food eat real food this is the
foundation this is the cornerstone
because its own if once you eat once you
have an understanding of what real food
is and a framework it becomes very easy
one of our goals anybody golf in here ok
yeah are you washed off and you see they
get up to the hole and they're getting
ready to putt and the golfers kind of
looking around and looking at all the
angles right to get to get the best
angle best shot well when I work with
people i have people do that for a
little while but long term you don't
want have to do that the rest of your
life right you want to be able to have a
framework in your mind that you can
filter all the onslaught of information
coming at you things that you see that
you can say be like a triage real food
not real food real food not real food
boom boom boom where you don't know how
to expend the mental energy so we teach
people a framework to really think about
this and really you broad last seen in
very specific definitions that's the
starting point and it's just a starting
point but once you've got that you can
check the box because that will never
change the rest your life and it's the
only way that you can have a chance to
do number two on your hunger and most
people think about hunger in this
country and I think a negative way we
have commercials on TV take this pill
take this herb suppress your appetite
here's the funny thing though hunger is
not bad even though we have an avoidance
behavior like avoid getting hungry
hunger is not bad in fact it's normal
it's part of normal daily physiological
function you breathe in you breathe out
you should eat and you should get hungry
every day okay when we're not eating
real foods or we're taught to eat a big
breakfast eat before you work out eat
after work out eat every two or three
hours where we're always eating we're
not going to get hungry most people
because they do not eat real food number
one up there you will crash and crave up
and down blood sugar levels go up and
down
probably being in a work environment
where you can't go belleville you like
what happened I need something let's go
out and get something now Google does a
great job of providing some really good
things but there's also some things
around there that are going to
contribute more to our crashing craving
right so here's the thing that is not
hunger it's crashing craving I'm not
discounting it because it's actually
real physiological distress it's not a
lack of willpower when we're not eating
the foundation of real foods most of
time we're going to be like this all
time and then we're going to have to
medicate we're gonna have to read
something medicate to stabilize and like
I would give my right arm right now to
have some food that type of mentality
and in the long run that's going to get
closer you just day by day closer the
disease dysfunction dissatisfaction that
we all talk about so will we find when
we people eat a comment when we in the
context of real food okay not diet food
not health food you get more stable more
steady more consistent energy and over
the ton of course the time if you don't
eat you've gradually get more hungry I
don't die right you don't just fall off
the cliff where's how many of you think
okay I better eat now or I better eat
before i come i know it's lunchtime so
it's a little bit different but I better
eat now or before I go in this mean
because I'm not sure I can make it
through the next 30 minutes or an hour
without food right why again to the way
we're taught the way we're conditioned
but also the context of real food okay
how many of you are getting a little
tired right now you just have lunch
either I'm boring you or number two here
you're sitting here just eating food and
food is an eating food is a highly
energetic process where when you eat
food you go into digestive rest and
digest mode where olson like I'm getting
sleepy i wish i could lay down where is
the worst time to have a meeting
probably right after lunch so the people
when you get done with this I feel sorry
for the next folks right you're going to
be like oh and that you might be fine
normally but again it's an energized Lee
demanding process that's crashing and
craving what happens when we allow
people to get hungry is you're really
when you're hungry you're kind of in a
high performance mode so I work with a
train
one time who told her client show up
hungry because hunger is hunt mode think
about that so what happens when you eat
food and get bogged down the last thing
you want to do is really perform okay
but when you're hungry in the context of
real food not crashing craving you still
have plenty of energy I'm hungry right
now but notice I'm not like oh I need to
sit down because I'm just going about
class I'm interject I'm alert I'm
engaged and that's possible so what we
try to do with people is a kid teaching
this process of real food hunger so
number three you can personally find
your rhythm okay what does that mean
rhythms kind of a strange word but it's
appealing in some ways but it means
types of food some of you we know we do
better with more meat less meat more
grains less grains more dairy less dairy
you all need to eat your vegetables
because grandma was right about that so
there's a type of food ok anybody
vegetarian in here okay we've got number
anybody love me okay what if we cross
you say we're gonna make you do that you
do the other you wouldn't like that very
well with yet everybody has a personal
rhythm that they do best with so the
types of food the timing of food some
people do really well in fact do much
better not having breakfast in the
morning and I know we're told eat
breakfast is the most important meal of
your day but for some people that's the
worst thing they should do because it's
going to upset the rhythm the rest of
the day and they do that day after day
and they're going to be just out of
sorts for a lot of people I think dinner
is the most important meal of the day
the way we have our culture's Desai set
up and so the idea find your rhythm is
that types of timing the frequency it's
all your individual blueprint or
fingerprint that makes sense for you
that's why sometimes all these diets and
all these pads there's elements of truth
that sound interesting they appeal to a
small segment of population but maybe
not to you or maybe partially to you so
what you need to do is have a framework
again I go let's go back to importance
of having a framework that you believe
in and understand that will help you
filter and guide your decisions and what
we try to do is with this three prong or
three principal approach where all three
are important is to give you a framework
that will never
change the rest of your life real food
will never change no matter what no
matter how smart we get ok on your
hunger find your rhythm those three
things this is a lasting framework that
will never change that applies to every
single person in here yet because your
get you you understand what your rhythm
is you start to experiment about what
foods you do better with in timing
you're going to experience that uniquely
just for you that's kind of a cool thing
and you can you can just stop playing
the game of like a coop what right are
we on what's next ok so we start with
food as i said we start with what ye've
because we believe it does change
everything not just your waistline about
how you feel one of my favorite quotes
i'll read this to you i know you can
oliver able to pretend this a story hour
when i was young and free my imagination
had no limits and I dreamed of change in
the world as I grew older and wiser I
discovered the world would not change so
i shortened my sight somewhat and decide
to change only my country but it seemed
immovable as I grew into my twilight
years in one last desperate attempt I
settled unchanging only my family those
closest to me but alas it would have
none of it and now as i lay my death but
i suddenly realized if I'd only change
myself first then by example I might
better might have changed my family from
their inspiration and encouragement i
will then been able to better change my
country and who knows i might have even
changed what look where this is written
and a tomb in western mr. Abby 1100 ad I
love this because this is just as true
today here's my corny part of this you
guys all have gifts you all have talents
you all have abilities and if you are
not your better self your best self you
are always going to feel dissatisfied
falling short personally and also the
people around you whether it's worth
your family your relationships they're
going to suffer for it too okay here's
what's happening here's what I know is
we as we wrap up here and we'll stick
around for some questions for those who
want to stay stay at the ground when you
eat food that's been changed
bad things happen and if you're sitting
here today and you're not kind of sure
what to do what's going on I'm a big
believer this is a simple idea you truly
do not know what's wrong until you allow
your body to do is right you know what's
right about every single one of you your
body naturally tend toward health if
given a jam no budget in the world is
big enough whether as an individual as a
family as a corporation you don't give
help a chance the only person can do
that is the person that you look in the
mirror every single day we can't we can
have other people support us we can have
a force at work but we can't look to
other people we can't live to agencies
experts to do the work for toys tell
people just what if this whole idea your
body tends toward health if given a
chance you need to give your healthy
chance so what if just for today what if
for a couple days we asked people to
commit to 28 days but what if you give
your body more of what it needs take
away what it doesn't need and you just
get step back and you get the heck out
of the way of yourself think about that
just what if very good things will
happen not just in your waistline but in
your life you'll be smarter be more
creative to be more generous to be more
giving you'll be closer the person you
know you want to be and you are does it
all relate back to food not all of it at
a heck of a lot and we get work fortune
we get to see this every day with folks
where they do this and I tell you in
this well leave you with I don't want
you to trust me okay because we're all
thrown we all get lots of information
you need to be the judge you need to
decide for yourself
because you need to find what works best
for you so here's what I suggest for a
couple days for a week for however long
reset yourself just start with scratch
forget everything you know start with
food see we're surprised any questions
yeah tofu oh yeah it's not real okay so
usually most tofu is processed soy be
awesome from our oh I'm sorry I need to
repeat the question so somebody asked
about to food if it's real food or
prostitute so tofu is typically made out
soybean see if they make soy beans 85 85
nine percent of soybeans are genetically
modified red flag number one and usually
and also tofu this process in a way
that's not that the violates our
addition subtraction modification
soybeans itself or edamame great but if
you were going to eat soy like the
fermented soy sources like tempeh me so
which is in the traditional Japanese
culture those are the sources of
soybeans that would be better okay lots
of examples okay here's one okay I
brought my last prop here okay bread dip
bread exist before 1900 yeah like thank
goodness the bread and butter yes okay
good but what type of bread okay well
here we have bread we leave read the
frontal label right if you guys can see
that one hundred percent stone-ground
whole wheat bread is it real food should
we eat it you know that's a trick
question don't you have it well here's
the thing we like bread but if you're
going to buy this you're not doing
yourself if you're going to buy this as
a staple you're really not doing
yourself any favor I'll give you a quick
little we don't have necessary time to
dig into all that here's the wise in
this session but here's a quick little
tool
to go out into the world to judge your
bribe if we have blindfold you and go
into the grocery store or just line up
all this bread in front of you we
blindfold you and we hand you the bread
and you start to squeeze it remember
that commercial don't squeeze the
charmin any of you guys remember that
okay don't squeeze the charmin toilet
paper if you can squeeze the charmin you
just need to kind of put it back okay
okay but if you all of a sudden i'll get
to that in a second but if i'll send
your squeeze and squeeze in squeeze
bread that's hard you want to open your
eyes and actually look at it and do the
ingredients list test where you look at
your ingredients salt crusted bread okay
grains a big one grain to grain it can
be very very good or healthy for it but
it also can be very very negative and
not so healthy because it's not just the
grain itself it's how its processed or
change soft crusted bread you usually
made with commercial yeast quick rides
bread okay so it short changes the
process it changes the glycemic index
probably by x 125 points compared to
what we call old world crusty bread the
kind of bread that you see at the
markets or that you if you cut and you
don't eat that day they spoil you look
at your ingredients test okay this oil
this this this has about this bread has
about six lines of ingredients from high
fructose corn syrup yeast which we saw
sometimes can contain msg it has
vegetable oil like canola oil and soil
those are very not so good oils even
though they're loud it is health food
oils they're very highly processed oils
okay there's a lot of things here that a
ten-year-old can't recognize and
pronounce let alone me let alone me and
so we look at this and we were just
judging it here we buy that okay now
doesn't mean you can't go out to like
baseball stadium or football field never
once well if you have a hot dog it's in
a wife but no big deal okay but if you
think you're buying that as a staple of
doing something good for yourself that's
not the case okay so breads granolas
rolled oats granola bars that have
rolled oats in instant oatmeal certain
things health food diet food very
irritating on the
gut inflammatory we're not getting the
nutrition out of it so grains by
themselves are very packed with
nutrition but it's all how you handle
them to access the grain most grains
that we have in our society with the
cereals breads crackers and certain
things and flower base are not prepped
the right way to give us some
nourishment as you say hey I'd love to
get I spent a whole session on grains
and dairy because it's one grains in
there I think our to the most misguided
and I called to the most violated forms
of food we have we mess them up quite a
bit great yeah good question Greg very
good question yeah no good question so
the question is how do you consider
basically cooking and food preparation
yeah that that to me is not
fundamentally changing or processing so
I'm not saying go out here and I'll go
eat raw or go just go eat some raw meat
and everything so our traditional you
exactly set it right the traditional
methods we have for preparing storing
preserving food that have been around
for thousands of years those those are
not fundamentally processing the food we
can overcook food though we can overheat
food in fact pasteurization oftentimes
because it's high heat killed the
bacteria also has collateral damage in
the negative ways it fundamentally
changes the nourishment the food so
that's a whole nother topic too but
you're right so just that the
preparation food prep methods they can
be they can be prohibitive but with the
ones that we that you're talking about
that have been around those are that's
the way to go that's what we've been
doing for a long long time okay thank
you any other questions I know we're
running short on time yeah let's go back
here but we'll come back since you just
yeah yeah good question because there's
a lot of them out there I like to keep
it simple i have three fashion oils that
i love to your kind my go-to okay i love
butter number one just real good butter
or I mean I I'm like I'm like I'm like
president of butter fan club it's it
you know good source of butter not
afraid of it whatsoever if I'm going to
cook if I need no heat or low heat or
maybe even modest heat a great source of
olive oil I think is the way to go now
if I'm going to cook over high heat
meaning like stir fry and I prep one of
the very best and healthiest oils you
can possibly consume is organic extra
virgin unrefined gotta be those things
coconut oil okay and coconut if you grab
it you look at its hard at room
temperature you pop it down I make
popcorn out of that I stir fry it it's
just kind of my go-to oil and I don't
even like miss a coconut but you can
find oils to have more or less of a
coconut flavor your canola oil your
sunflower safflower your vegetable oil
is your your soybean oil okay very
highly processed i call them supermarket
oils contribute a lot of problems to our
health condition that's another idea to
I don't like I said I don't them
protein fats carbs calories I don't even
focus on fiber starch saturated
monounsaturated fats because it we know
the food categories if you eat the real
foods those things could take themselves
our body actually does well with having
certain levels of various fats from mono
unsaturated to saturated fats in fact we
need that for healthy brain function
it's just I if you'll find out I don't
pit food against each other because I
want to want to put the vegetarians
against the mediators in a fight right I
don't get food against each other
because that's part of your rhythm I'm
more concerned not about the cross
comparison but what i call the vertical
in comparison in the food pyramid that i
use that i want to know how change the
food is because every food category can
be changed do we take an apple over from
Yakima we have a client who brings over
bushel of apples every every fall and it
I mean sometimes it's picked that very
day that's what i call someone or real
food but we can take that same Apple
process that refine and add some high
fructose corn syrup see some food
coloring put in a jar all sin that
becomes a very highly processed suit
even though it says apples okay every
food category can follow along those
levels of whether they're real or not
that's the tricky part okay yeah anybody
anybody joints from afar have questions
can you repeat what the three oils you
recommend are pleased yeah really good
butter number one that's it as they're
yelling out here olive oil and what
comes the oils spend your money on
although you kind of get what you pay
for it makes a difference in not only
the source of nutrition but also the
taste experience so spend your money
Sarah who's our food nutrition coach she
kind of recommends buying two levels of
oil a really more expensive kind of save
and used for special occasions or
certain dishes and more of a mid-level
oil that's still really healthy but also
you can use it more day to day so butter
coconut oil olive oil and then coconut
oil the coconut oil and this is how it
needs to be extra virgin unrefined and
organic coconut oil those are the three
Biggie's there's a few others are out
there but those are the three big ones
that I think are the way to go and they
handle then they handle our situations
okay yes mustard or you know much about
Miss Rose Sarah you know I don't have
lunch much experience but I I'll look
I'll look at that okay I would say if
it's been traditionally used that's a
good sign if it's been used for more
than fifty or hundred years that's a
good sign okay well yet high heat yea
high heat cooking that's a tricky way
yeah saltador unsold I personally like
slightly salted butter okay big fan of
sea salt or slightly salted butter but
sometimes you can get on salted butter
and add a little bit of sea salt okay
and all depends on what you're putting
it with it sometimes if you're adding it
to something that already has some salt
content or your a is a recipe you might
not need it in otherwise i want to thank
you for joining us today I know it's not
always the easiest thing to come out in
the middle of your day but thank you and
please let us know if you have any
questions we try to yeah answer the best
we can okay thanks so much
