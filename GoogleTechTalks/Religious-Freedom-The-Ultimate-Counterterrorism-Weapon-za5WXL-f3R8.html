Chris ciple
here with us today he has a long bio but
just to give you two line bio he is the
president of ige intern Institute for
Global engagement he is a stanford
graduate and also graduate of the Naval
Postgraduate School and the Fletcher
School of Law and Diplomacy he is the
founder of the review of faith and
international affairs and a senior
fellow at the Foreign Policy Research
Institute and a member of the Council on
Foreign Relations and among other things
so I was told not to talk about politics
religion and sex during dinner but Chris
engages with politics and religion on a
day-to-day job so I would love to hear
how it plays out in the global arena in
this modern day and age so please join
me in welcoming dr. Chris cycle thank
you good morning I don't talk about sex
but I will talk about religion and
politics with you today and as you may
or may not be able to tell I am from out
of town I'm not native to the Google
campus but it is good to be back in
California we were at Stanford earlier
today I have a colleague Mike Gerson
with me in the back there and I
appreciate your time this morning to be
clear the Institute for Global
engagement is not a international dating
service that brief is someplace else nor
are we international spousal mail-order
business but we are a think and do tank
that builds religious freedom worldwide
through local partnership a thinking do
tank that builds religious freedom
worldwide through local partnership as I
understand the essence of Google and I'm
looking forward to be educated more in
many ways we are about exactly the same
thing that is to say that we are about
creating an environment where people
have access to free information to make
better decisions
and in our case make sure that they have
the freedom to live out those decisions
and if they choose to revisit those
decisions through more information or
analysis later in life that they can
change again bottom line is a level
playing field where the customer decides
that's the essence of freedom of
conscience that's the essence of
religious freedom we are motivated by a
Christian faith but we are pluralistic
in our means and ends and what does that
mean it means that we take the command
to love our neighbor seriously so
seriously that we struggle with what how
does it what does it mean the love of
neighbor in a practical fashion who
doesn't look or vote like me it's pretty
easy to love somebody who looks or votes
like you or hang out with them we all do
it it's human condition but how do you
reach outside of your cocoon that's the
christian side of the house but we are
fiercely fiercely 3 and p is how we say
it nonprofit nonpartisan nonprofit izing
nonprofit nonpartisan nonprofit Iseman
we want to engage the world as it is we
want to create a level playing field
where people have freedom of conscience
to choose or not choose faith freely we
think that's the foundation of civil
society and how we engage with each
other we think that's ultimately do the
best counterterrorism tool that exists
it's a form of pre-emptive peace if
people understand and respect the
minority that's ultimately what freedom
of conscience is is societies where
people protect and promote the minority
ethnic racial otherwise in their midst
those types of societies don't go to war
with each other those societies don't
allow for the extremism that can
validate violence so what I'd like to do
today briefly is tell you a little bit
about the Institute and what it looks
like in action what does a thinking do
tank do and then provide some background
on our philosophy of engagement that has
been revealed over the last eight and a
half years of our existence we're coming
up on our ninth birthday on sep tember
first and then get into pakistan
because Pakistan is the world's most
dangerous most difficult place and if we
can't figure out a way to be relevant
there we're toast to use an academic
phrase okay sure I am open to I am yeah
I am if you're not buying what site will
say hey cycle and I'm buying it just to
interrupt me I'm happy to do that I'm
very you can't offend me I mean freedom
of consciousness freedom of conscious
right interrupt at any time there's
something that's not clear or you don't
like and will I'll give my best
explanation or understanding or we can
have Q&amp;amp;A at the end also I should
mention that we've got some handouts
over here that explain who we are and
what we do with recent trips to Syria
and April and then Vietnam and Laos last
November so we're a think in do tank
that builds religious freedom worldwide
through local partnerships if you're in
the we believe you got to think before
you do Americans out too often are ready
aim fire ready or fire aim ready we want
to think before we go into action think
before you do we have conversations we
have an annual global leadership forum
this is with a member of our Board of
Advisors nate'll and Albright this
conversation is about how do people as
individuals steward their identity as a
global citizen as a citizen of the
United States and as a person of faith
how do those things influence one
another what takes priority fascinating
conversation the guy on the left is
actually my father and the founder of
the Institute nine years ago along with
my mother I should also say natalie is
going to be a part of our 10th
anniversary in 18 to 19 September next
year in Washington you can come to
Washington wear a jacket be a part of
the cool crowd and participate in the
10th anniversary that third weekend in
September we're also talking to other
secretaries of state to get them
involved and talk about what does
relational diplomacy and citizen
diplomacy look like in the 21st century
we publish a journal on the think side
this is the review of faith and
affairs it's available at RFI a review
of faith international affairs are FIA
online org it's the best journal in the
world because it's the only journal in
the world there are no other journals
that look at the role of faith
international affairs there's there's a
multi-faith board of advisors and board
of contributing editors and the whole
purpose is if you agree disagree are a
humanist whatever the case might be tell
us what you think about the role of
faith and religion in society in
realpolitik those kinds of things this
is the winter issue where we took on
Islam and pluralism and we had a ground
table discussion about common word where
Islamic and Christian theologians have
talked about what it means to love God
and love your neighbor we publish policy
type things you know stuff that's only
read in the Beltway but important stuff
what is the future of religious freedom
what should the Obama administration be
doing on the do site exists we do this
thing called relational diplomacy
relational diplomacy has three
characteristics but it's founded on one
basic foundation that is you seek to
understand and listen first and then
continue to do that as you engage now
this might seem simple and obvious but
it is not simple and obvious for
American engagement worldwide we have
worked with in east asia as i mentioned
earlier and i had a former senior
communist officials say to me who had
served three tours in America UN and
Washington said you're the first human
rights group to ever talk to me and not
give me a list and not tell me what to
do and I said to him that doesn't excuse
how your government has treated
minorities nor does our treatment of you
Nord and let me apologize for a hard
treatment of you personally because you
are an individual you have inherent
dignity and we have to be able to talk
to each other that's how you begin to
build respect and
a concept of mutual hospitality if you
will between people between countries
there are three characteristics to
relational diplomacy one is top-down and
bottom-up government state is top-down
you work bottom up with society and with
the grassroots level lots of NGOs do
bottom up this is the century of
bottom-up but you still need especially
in Asia top-down approval or at least a
Lincoln a nod to do the things that you
have to do in some of these cultures and
stakes secondly bringing private and
public spheres together at the top down
in the bottom up levels and in third
kind of living roadmaps roadmap
agreements where you come together in
partnership with local folks you develop
a plan in partnership with them you
don't come with a cookie cutter approach
you need it here I come these are your
needs these is your assessment here's
how we can come alongside you to make
you look good to make us look good and
to be a friend of religious freedom as
well in a manner that's consistent or
sensitive to the culture and consistent
with the rule of law and what's
important about these agreements is and
often in places in Asia the culture is a
shame based culture and what we'd love
to do in the West and feel good about
ourselves is named blame and shame is to
point the finger write an op-ed feel
good about ourselves and that changes
nothing on the ground and actually makes
those responsible for persecution or
repression they dig in deeper now
there's a time to write an op-ed don't
get me wrong there's a time to yell it
from the mountaintops but ninety percent
of the time my experience has been it's
better to build the relationship and
show how what you're doing is not some
western form of cultural imperialism but
it's consistent with the culture every
culture has a mechanism for respect
every culture has a mechanism for
hospitality and then anchor it in that
tradition so this is relational
diplomacy we've got a board of advisers
we like to say that we operate in the
radical middle somewhere between the
leftover left and the self-righteous
right
nonpartisan nonprofit nonpartisan
everybody from metal and the top
department of state officials former
directors of the agency for
international development Brady was in
the was President Clinton's a ID guy for
four years Andrew was President Bush's
guy for five years and then also a
leading academics John Esposito probably
one of the top experts on Islam in the
world at Georgetown a dear friend we
just did a conference with him at
Georgetown on Evan Jellico's and Muslims
having an honest conversation about
reconciliation that was fun and then
mark open leading expert in conflict
resolution and transformation also an
ordained rabbi at George Mason
University religious freedom folks is a
big tent issue it is an issue that we
can all get behind I don't care whether
you are a secular humanist in American
patriot or someone who takes your
Abrahamic faith tradition or other faith
traditions seriously expect for freedom
of conscience is something we can all
find a way to work together on and to do
so in a practical fashion okay question
of the day how do interest in values
balance out for common purpose now I'll
let you decide who represents hardcore
hard power interest and who represents
soft power values between the dog and
the cat there's dog people there's cat
people but the common purpose is clear
the common purpose is clear how do we
balance those things out how do we do
hard power and soft power together such
that we apply smart power that we
promote values in a way that preserves
interest promote values in a way that
guarantees stability in very difficult
and complex places this is a difficult
thing to do as Americans this is from
the West Bank side of the of the wall in
Israel Palestine
okay can someone dialing into the VC
mute themselves we can hear you thank
you this is great line from bono from
the Joshua tree where he talks about the
flame of liberty and being burned by it
being burned by her and by the way this
has nothing to do with Democrats or
Republicans we are the big elephant in
the room we are the hundred pound
gorilla when we use words like religious
freedom democracy human rights that is
often received as disguised for American
Empire disguise for we can do it because
we can might is right the right the week
do it because they must you have to be
aware of that I don't care what your
politics are this is the world as it is
and many people in the muslim-majority
world tend to see this mix of values and
interests of hard and soft power in a
negative way now our philosophy of
engagement there's three approaches that
you can take in my experience and
understanding of doing this for nine
years about how to engage the other this
is mr. magoo on the floor of the Uzbek
parliament in Tashkent and too often our
engagement strategy whether it's
democrat or republican is you need to
look like us its mirror image engagement
we have more NGOs will have pluralism
because we all know NGOs equals
democracy I wrote a dissertation on
whose Becca Stan and this was AI DS
fundamental driving force we could not
compute how to deal with religion and
clans in that cultural context which was
their pre-existing civil society and all
of us came in and said you don't have
civil society because we know that civil
society equals NGOs in equals XYZ and
democracy
just ask us we're good at it you need to
look like us now as opposed to realizing
that it takes time from 1776 forward
mirror image engagement I don't
recommend the second one is the monolith
okay we're not going to mirror image but
we really know who all those Muslims are
right especially in this culture
especially in the Christian context we
loved a stereotype it's very hard to
conceive of the Muslim as our neighbor
if he's got a turban and a long beard
he's the boogie man that's a budget
thing to fund my intelligence program or
my military program that's a little glib
in a little bit little overstated but
not much I'm the guy on the right by the
way Islam is differentiated as much as
Protestantism and Catholicism you have
to understand Islam in its local culture
and its local context and you have to
engage them in a conversation the first
thing out of this guy's mouth this is up
in the Northwest Frontier Province is a
the Jews and CIA did 911 okay let's
let's move past that for now and talk
about other things and see if there's a
way to partner in this case it really
didn't seem to emerge but it did with
others the last thing you've got again
mirror image monolith and then what I
call the micro are you going to
understand how that person's worldview
is shaped literally what is the
geography social and human and physical
that is shaped how they engage the world
anytime we go into somebody else's house
we are a small person we think of
ourselves as bigger because we have the
money we're used to it and face it if
you traveled anywhere in the world you
dig the fact that you've got an American
passport in your pocket it's to get out
of jail free card right I don't have to
live here sucks to be them I'm going to
do my part but I want to be home and
then I want to do something for that
child on my refrigerator and sponsored
him at 30 or 40 bucks a month you got to
know what the local nuances are and
understand the intellectual and his
store
forces that have shaped them and to
realize that you are just but one small
part in it from a very distant part of
the planet and if you begin to
understand that local context you have a
much better chance of listening and
understanding and most of all
communicating respect okay segwaying
into Pakistan there are three irony's to
the 911 attack and if you can make it
out the World Trade Center towers are
back over there in the right hand side I
took this picture July fourth two
thousand this is the stern of the John F
Kennedy an aircraft carrier these symbol
of American might in the world the three
honorees are this R only going to dwell
on the third one but i want to mention
the first two anyway the first one is
that we were warned this was the second
time that traded towers have been
attacked first time is in February 93 we
continue to treat it like a trade or
like a legal issue a law enforcement
issue wrong approach that's a part of it
but not the whole approach second thing
is that the John F Kennedy had been in
the harbor on 911 it could not have
prevented the attack we think of NAT our
national security has been militarized
throughout the Cold War we think of
national security as the military and
something that takes place over there
national security is about much much
more than that it's not just hard power
but soft power interesting values as two
sides of the same coin the third irony
especially for those of us among the
elites and that's who we are if you're
working at Google and you go to some of
the schools in this area on the East
Coast you're part of a elite class
whether you like to think of it or not
with 911 religion was back and that's
not something we've been taught to think
about I've suffered through 36 graduate
courses to get a union card called a PhD
in international relations two of them
mention religion two of them and only as
a catalyst to conflict because god is
dead secularization is taking place and
in my cocoon there's no place for that
we don't talk about religion
Dixon polite company assuming you keep
polite company the bummer of it all is
our global society our global security
and our national security as a lesser
included set exist at their intersection
so you got to get comfortable talking
about religion and politics and if
you're feeling a little squirmy you
should but for the rest of the for much
of the world eighty percent of the world
or so takes faith seriously and in the
muslim-majority world at least ninety
percent of them take faith very
seriously and you have to be able to
relate to them religion isn't that part
of the problem that's the way we've all
been taught to think about this this is
mallanna binary he is the head of the
largest Madras India shower which is the
capital of North West Frontier Province
this is October of 05 and two things I
will always remember from this
conversation one is I went there to talk
about Islam and learn and listen about
his perspective and how we saw the world
then we got to talking about politics I
said well what do you think local
political leaders think about this he
literally said well I'm also the head of
the majority political party they don't
separate is politican in many places in
the conservative Muslim world that's
when the light bulb went on is that okay
it's time to be even more humble and
listened more clearly and intently
because this is not what I I just didn't
know how to think about it the second
thing that he said to me is back to
interests and values I continue to think
about and he said this you Americans you
want respect we want tenderness this guy
has prepared there's 800 students there
any one time students are called tal
leaves it's the Taliban comes from the
madrasas this Madras is the largest one
of the shower it sent young boys into
the Taliban old and new 90s and now it's
a fascinating statement and what he
meant by it was this because I asked him
two years later when I visited
because I thought about it and I he had
said it just as I was leaving and he
basically said this you guys need
respect or want respect because you're a
great power you do what great powers do
I don't care what your self perceptions
are great powers interfere in the
internal affairs of other states and
societies that's the world as it is just
be nice about it just engage us in show
some respect for our culture as opposed
to coming here doing what you need to do
and then not taking care of the people
this is in the context of all the Afghan
refugees that came into Pakistan after
the Afghan war and if any of you have
seen charlie wilson's war that last seen
after they've raised a half a billion
dollars to arm the Mujahideen they
couldn't get 1 million dollars for the
school that's what he's saying obviously
it's also much more complex than just go
get the bad guys there are issues of
justice issues of governance that have
to be taken into account it's not an
excuse but it's certainly a factor that
contributes to the rise of extremism the
Taliban along the Durand Line the border
between Afghanistan and Pakistan their
anchor their legitimacy in justice they
provide local dispute mechanisms on land
and on criminals and people who are
being on Islamic viewing pornography and
things like that and it's so bad because
the government in Islamabad has
underfunded this area for so long that
they want any decision at this time as
opposed in no decision so they they
listen to the Taliban them by the way
there's nobody to fight against and
nobody has a credibility or legitimacy
to say we can do governance better
counterinsurgency at the end of the day
is a competition for governance who has
the better idea about how governance how
security and services are delivered to a
local people now the strange thing as
you spend a bunch on to time in this
part of the world and in other Muslim
countries you begin to realize that the
best of faith is the best way to defeat
the worst of religion the best of faith
is the best way to defeat the worst of
religion this is a madrassa
this is madrasa in bhanu the northern on
the border of northern Waziristan just
down the street from where John Walker
Lindh from Marin County was trained it
says in the hadith of the sayings of the
Prophet he who helps the orphan gains
the keys to paradise as a Christian I'm
down with that these are orphans their
learning skill sets now of course the
same madrasa can also treat teach
extremist ideology but there's a reason
the madrasas are popular they provide
meaning and identity and practical
vocational skills not to mention
education in the total absence of an
educational system run by the government
what would you do you'd want to raise if
you're from a conservative religious
family I don't care what the faith is
you want to rage god-fearing kids that
don't get to watch Madonna on the
satellite TV same is true for
conservative evangelicals as it is for
conservative paasschen Muslims in the
frontier now this is the guy that was on
the campus flyer that you saw his name
is a chrome khan durrani he's standing
in front of our house and in particular
the sun room that he used to pray to
Mecca which caught us by surprise when
he visited us and we were happy to honor
him with that and give him that prayer
time and his three sons I was approached
in February no fall of oh 3 by a guy
from Reading Pennsylvania was a
pakistani-american he had just been to
North West Frontier Province and he came
up to me and said this I don't know what
you do I think you build bridges how
would you like to meet a guy who just
got freely elected in a rule of law
system on an anti-american pro Sharia
platform and my response of course was
now we know but but he'll know we're not
doing but that's not what we do that's
dangerous we can't be involved in that
and then over time it kept coming back
it kept coming back and finally we
invited him and I brought him to America
as my guest it was the first time that
he had traveled outside the
muslim-majority world it was also in the
wake of him being quoted in local papers
about saying that the Jews and CIA did
common myth over there did 911 so here
we are talking to a no kidding Islamist
who says he wants to implement Sharia
law but is in a freely elected
parliamentary system he was the chief
minister the Northwest Frontier Province
from 0 to 208 and now he is the head of
the opposition they're still
participating in the rule of law system
when we brought him over I had the
neo-cons writing let's arrest these
bloodthirsty bigots don't let him leave
our country and then I had the New York
Times writing that we were a right-wing
Christian organization because we
thought God was sovereign over all
things and therefore according to them
we didn't believe in church-state
separation that's the radical middle
between the leftover left and the
self-righteous right so I figured we
were doing something something right as
an aside try try funding this try going
to a donor and saying hey I went to talk
to this Islamist guy who wants to his
anti-american approach to Rhea we
couldn't find anybody from any community
until a guy by the name of George
Russell Stanford grad at 54 says I don't
believe what you believe in terms of
faith but I believe in that value and he
funded religious freedom freedom of
conscience and engagement and he funded
this whole thing literally the week
before and then I called him up on
Friday the 13th july two thousand five
is this going to cost thirty thousand
more and he said I'll do it so it's a
strange thing how all these things came
together makes the case for God if you
didn't believe in one because there's no
way that you can write this kind of
script and so when I met him for the
first time we put them up at the
Fairmont Hotel in 24th &amp;amp; M Street
washington DC he's the six ranking
political figure in all pakistan no
American official would talk to him at
this time because he was in Islamist
even though he was freely elected and I
had no idea what to say to him except
why do you do what you do
and I was almost embarrassed because I I
thought that's all you got that's all
you can say his response was this I
believe that on the last day I'm going
to stand before my Creator and be held
accountable for how I govern my people I
said you know what we have differences
theological and political and they are
deep and many of them irreconcilable but
i believe that too let's find a way to
work together so i took him around the
u.s. for 10 days i made a point to take
him to Ground Zero in New York City he's
not been quoted since saying that the
Jews in CIA did 911 and then of course
we began to get to know his culture and
how he thought about things which is
very different than how we thought about
it this is from a briefing at the Khyber
Pass which is between Afghanistan and
Pakistan and they're talking about the
pasta and tribes if I didn't tell you
that and you didn't see the title you
could think I was talking about any girl
part of the United States especially my
texts and friends freedom-loving tough
and Hardy proud and courageous excellent
fires respectful women that elders and
then this last one is the most key
highly hospitable ready to protect their
guests at any cost the reason we
wouldn't be harmed when we went to
Pakistan the same reason we can't find
bin Laden when you come under their
honor code it's a different game you're
no longer in America and you're one of
them you're a guest and this is where
you anchor a concept at a conversation
about freedom of conscience about
respecting the other it's going to be
very different words in very different
people at that table but the same
principles so we signed an agreement to
politically promote religious freedom in
his province now what's fascinating
about poked in Wally and how serious
they take it this is october nine 2005
this is the day after the earthquake
killed 139,000 people in that province
in the one adjoining it he's in the
middle of coordinating the entire crisis
response
and he makes time to sign this thing and
say that we believe in this we want to
find a way to implement it what does
that look like well we did a conference
on religion and respect held it in the
pearl continental which was recently
bombed about a month ago this is May of
07 and to our great surprise we thought
we were just doing Muslims and
Christians and what he did was he went
further and invited the other minorities
in his province which are very small
Sikh Hindu ismaili Shia all at the same
table literally for the first time in
the history of Northwest Frontier
Province how many of you heard about
that on Fox News or CNN for that matter
and then we held the conference and we
the audience that we invited were the 40
top and moms and the leading student
leaders from the three universities in
the region and you know what the metric
for success was the Hindu and the smiley
the Christian and the Shia took twice
their podium time they had never been
given the opportunity to explain to
their fellow Pakistanis that they were
proud Pakistanis and wanted to
contribute to society as well this is
not my interpretations is what they told
me after so that's a top down but bottom
up what does it look like we took a
delegation down to bondo on the border
of northern Waziristan and in that
delegation we had a Peshawar born elder
while he's a doctor from Cleveland Ohio
he speaks Pashto and we had I'm speaking
there I spoke third this day at the
University of bondo but he spoke first
he spoken Pashtun and he told the story
about how in 911 his neighborhood in
Cleveland locked arms around his whole
mouth so that would be protected in a
place where they think every American is
a Christian is in heaven gel has a sword
one hands Bible another that makes a big
difference hearing it from somebody
speaking their own language a
gray-haired man who is held up in his
team in that culture but also on the far
left we had Sarah karam speak recent
graduate of Wellesley speaks Urdu and
she
karachi covered showing respect but also
saying we as muslim americans are a part
of this delegation that also includes
Christian Americans and we literally
embody this idea of not just tolerance
but respect then you get a chance to
hang out with some heroes now this is
not what you're expecting and you can
have all kinds of stories about whether
they should be liberated or not covered
whatever I really don't care this is how
they honor God and how they honor their
society and honor the gifts that God has
given them they speak better English
than I do and they want masters in IT
and MBA so they can stay in the region
near the future that's success in the
war against the terrorists right there
and so we're funding two cohorts of
students paying sixty percent of their
tuition books and fees and the
stipulations our men and women are
together you have tribal area in nwfp
you include minorities and then as part
of the curriculum you have a dialogue
that meets once or twice a week and you
talk about Islam and global society
which is another way of saying what is
the pashto Islamic understanding of
showing respect for neighbor for
demonstrating respect for the minority
in their midst and we have these
conversations the school has just
recently opened its been the middle of a
war zone and they just started back on
three August but they're doing this and
we're the only NGO to my knowledge
Western of American NGO doing this kind
of work in that part of the world which
is ground zero in the Taliban now in
conclusion you probably lost sleep last
night thinking about why there were no
witch trials in Rhode Island raise your
hands I see him
why is America well let's put it this
way I think the greatest gift we have to
give to the world and I think every
culture and every society has gifts to
give is this principle of freedom of
conscience it's important that we don't
export the American form of it it's
important and imperative that we come
alongside this principle and other
cultural context in the way that it
existed there before we arrived but
religious freedom and security values
and interests have been a part of our
founding and the reason we are successes
society I'm convinced is the difference
between massachusetts and rhode island i
lived in massachusetts i'm a part of the
boast the Red Sox Nation follow them
religiously but Massachusetts was a
theocracy a theocracy and Roger Williams
fled there he fled west in the winter
1730 or 1635 1636 established Rhode
Island and came up with the Rhode Island
colonial charter 1663 that's not my
spelling but that's the original English
and the purpose is this the point is
this if you let people practice their
faith freely they are less likely to
agitate against the state violently and
so Rhode Island quickly becomes the home
to Quakers Jews Indians Baptist and
people of no faith at all and what's
fascinating about Roger Williams just
one second from finishing up will come
right to you is it because he lived in
Plymouth when he first came to
Massachusetts he actually had
pre-existing relationships with the
Indians and so when he fled west he
didn't flee into this vacuum where he
knew nobody he knew them and then he did
something radical he paid for the land
he imagined something crazy like that we
didn't learn that lesson the whole next
two centuries and then showed respect
because of freedom of conscience as he
believed was consistent with the
Christian faith and that has made all
the difference
how do we do this it takes time we have
to take a long-term multi-generational
approach and understand that it's not
going to look like us at the end of the
day condi rice when she was testifying
before Capitol Hill on a number of
occasions that i saw on TV she was
always getting hit with why does
democracy take place faster why doesn't
take place overnight and she just noted
the irony to the congressmen and women
who were asking the questions you know
that constitution said that I was
three-fifths of a person when it first
started out and it took a good two
hundred years and from the Emancipation
in 1863 to the civil rights act in 64 65
this stuff takes time it's delicate it's
intricate but our job is to keep pushing
the ball forward with that I'll stop and
take this first question thank you so
the notion of religious freedom is a
little challenging um I notice you know
there's the bit that's not highlighted
which basically says yo religious
freedom you know grab out and grounded
of course on gospel principles and you
know I've encountered this when i was
living in france and went to in the UH
and ecumenical service it was you know
um all religions are welcome you we all
believe in Jesus there's a welding I'm
actually I'm a Jew and this oh hang on
so you know I think there are a lot of
societies that that that believe in
religious freedom you know but their
definition of what religious freedom is
of you know which flavor of Christianity
or which flavor of Islam or which flavor
of Judaism and do you want and so that's
I think I think it's crucial in it looks
like you've been very successfully in
getting others to question Matt but I
think when people talk about religious
freedom there is this presupposed
context that you need to get beyond
absolutely in fact you know the u.s.
gets hit hard on we established the
International Religious Freedom Act in
1998 my father actually was the first US
ambassador it is often received as
cultural imperialism and Americans only
looking out for Christians overseas and
the what's beautiful about this language
is we happen to be Christians and these
are principles but precisely because of
these principles we are not going to be
a Christian nation we're going to allow
for any faith or none to flourish and
prosper in the Jewish synagogue that
takes place in newport is actually a
seat a newport rhode island is also a
key element of the religious freedom
evolution because George Washington
writes them a letter in 1790 and he used
to thin the famous line to bigotry no
sanction to persecution no assistance
just a year before the First Amendment I
mean so this is stuff is key but it's
the the judgment the capacity of
judgment and say these are principles
they do exist in other cultures but we
can't come in with our cookie cutter
approach and say you need to look like
us so I point well made sir hi my name
is Xia and I'm from Pakistan i was born
in lahore all right yeah so first of all
thanks for i mean this talk i mean i
really appreciate that you're trying to
work on these kind of things pluralism I
in bringing people from different
religions together but the question that
I have is you are trying to tie
religious freedom and terrorism together
as if religious freedom lack of
religious freedom is resulting in
terrorism which I which I don't agree
with I mean a the do you think I mean
for example the 911 for example you gave
the example of 911 and people denying I
understand that people in Pakistan and
other Muslim countries the neither of
fact that 911 was carried of carried out
by Muslims and they try to think of it
as a conspiracy
and what not and I don't agree with them
but isn't that itself a proof that they
don't think that this is something that
Muslims couldn't have done or Islam
doesn't support it because if they
really thought that there is this
religion is teaching that they would
have said yes this is what religion says
and this was a very religious thing to
do they denied outright because they
cannot believe that religion can
basically teach those those kind of
things and secondly you mentioned that
Pakistan being the most dangerous
country in the world but I mean think
about it like before two thousand one
that was not the case right so do you
think religious freedom decreased after
that that certainly resulted in Pakistan
being being the dangerous country more
the most dangerous country of the world
and terrorists and suicide bombings
happening there resulted from that yeah
the great great questions President
Obama's is taken to court he one of the
Supreme Court justices from the years
past lately saying sunlight is the best
disinfectant it's a really good line I
think what Google is doing in terms of
being a global public square and what
religious freedom practice at it best
does just that I don't think you get
extremism and you don't get terrorism
where there is a public square where
extremists can be laughed at we don't
have it in democracies in countries
where there's religious freedom
extremism cannot take root and validate
violence because the majority doesn't
accept it and that's what we have to
move towards Pakistan before 2001 was as
dangerous and complex as it is now just
that we didn't know it I as to what I
think and there's other issues involved
to include the underfunding of the
tribal areas in nwfp by Islamabad for
the entire existence of Pakistan but all
those things play into it all at once
and now we're at a place where we have
to engage the muslim-majority world in a
thoughtful fashion I think we have to
engage it according to the best of their
faith and I think that is the only way
that you defeat extremism as a working
example of that Mike Gerson my colleague
wrote a piece in The Washington Post
he's a columnist for The Washington Post
and he wrote a piece on Afghan women and
how are they combating
the idea that they should not be
included in society then these are women
in Parliament these are women and local
sure Azure councils or whatever you know
instead of appealing to Western law and
Western norms and those kinds of things
where do they go they go back to the
holy texts to al quran kareem the holy
quran in the wife of the wife of the
Prophet she was a businesswoman she's
the first Muslim Muhammad demonstrated
respect for her now whether you agree or
disagree with whether that is or not I
don't really care in a conservative
society where Islam is the prism through
which all of life is seen that is the
only way in which you are going to
defeat these cultural traditions that
they claim as Islamic but are nothing
more than cultural traditions that's the
only way you're going to stop acid
getting thrown in the face of young
Pakistani and Afghan women is to route
the answer in the holy texts as opposed
to saying oh this is the latest NGO to
come through for women empowerment
they're not going to buy into that so I
think this disinfectant thing has to
come in and it has to be done away is
consistent with the culture and the rule
of law respects both and says we don't
have the answers but we want to listen
to you and what you have to say about
how you address grievances and that
takes a long long time and whether it's
you call it religious freedom freedom of
conscience a global public square that's
what we're all sort of working towards
in very different fashions and then
there's a question in the back okay so
I'd like to ask about how do you view or
contention about land we should be
capricious a little bit okay how do you
view contention about land issues
specifically for example Jerusalem we're
both face wants the same part of land
yeah and where religious freedom is not
allowed to choose to go and pray on
Temple Mount because that's an explosive
sure dynamite which can ignite the whole
area
it's a great question I'm not going to
give I have my own ideas about specific
answers there but that's I'm not going
to get into that just yet let me just
paint the conceptual parameters in all
of the Middies peace talks religious
leaders have never been included which
is a very bizarre thing to me and now
we're at a point before we had strong
political leaders whether it was Arafat
or beggin beggin my sense sorry Robin
sharone but no religious involvement now
we have a situation where there are no
strong political leaders on any of the
sides and the religious people are not
included but what is happening is been
the absence of strong political
leadership religion is being used to
validate more and more extreme positions
to the point where they feed off each
other settlers in Hamas whatever however
we wanted to find that and what as a
friend of mine who was just got back
from Israel Palestine on an interfaith
trip with cardinal mccarrick a friend
the former Archbishop of Washington DC
for the Roman Catholic Church he was
explained to them is you have secular
yuppies from Ramallah talking to secular
yuppies from Jerusalem with secular
yuppies from Washington and the quartet
in the EU and Russia and so faith gets
left out of it and now I think what we
need is people of faith saying we're not
the answer we're not a panacea but we
can work according to the best of our
traditions to honor that neighbor and oh
by the way give you political legitimacy
and maneuver space to get back and have
conversations and I think that's the new
and most interesting twist in the
two-state process right now I'll talk to
you afterwards about all the other
specifics but if that happens I think
then you can actually have an honest
conversation about the land there was a
quite that yes sir
so in the spirit of listening what would
you like Google to do to help very kind
question I would like to continue the
conversation most of all I am fascinated
by the idea that Google has essentially
created a global global public square
you know in many NGOs work on saving
lives but they don't think about the
life that person is going to live you
have a global public square but how are
you going to exercise and live that
freedom within that public square now
i'm not putting the moral burden on
google or on NGOs like world vision and
world relief to say you know it's your
job to determine that they have these
four freedoms as FDR would say etc etc
but it's a conversation that we need to
have how do you steward this space that
you've literally created out of nothing
how do you make it possible for these
kids in bono in waziristan to
participate in a global public square
and challenge others about their to take
on the stereotypes about paasschen
culture and yet learn from others
starting with English labs and computers
they don't have those things how do we
encourage social and financial
entrepreneurship among those young women
it can be done we have the relationships
we have the trust we have the access to
do that the global public square with
foreign direct investment and religious
freedom are two sides to the same coin
as I said initially there's freedom of
ideas and his freedom of product and the
two go hand in hand and a lot of people
have not thought that through what does
that look like if we take an interfaith
delegation to Syria or to Pakistan who
are also businessmen and women we're
demonstrating that faith is not a threat
it can be a part of the solution we're
demonstrating the businesses are
successful when they have faith and
morality as a part of their culture it
serves as a bulwark against the
corruption
the transition to market economies but
when they're together what does that
look like what is that that new sort of
culture look like that's a traveling
public square it's a traveling
advertisement for the best of American
culture it's a traveling advertisement
for what that culture could be according
to their own principles and values that
has not been thought through in part
because we all get real squirmy talking
about religion and politics still and
it's hard to do there are no USAID
programs that are funding religion
discussions of issues of religion in the
Northwest Frontier Province that is
astounding to me astounding you want to
know what the number one issue in
Pakistan is if you want to deal with
justice figure out the role that
religion plays in local dispute
mechanisms all these people came out of
Swat 2 million people out of this one
district north of a shower because the
Taliban took it over to may beat that
woman we all saw it on YouTube well now
they're going to come back and there's
going to be a whole bunch of squatters
and you know what the Taliban is going
to come back in and say we'll help you
do the dispute because the government's
not there we have to have a competing
vision of social justice that comes out
of this idea of a public square whether
it's informational virtual or actual and
if we can continue to have that
conversation and look at how technology
enables that and works with NGOs like us
who are trying to do the same thing
social justice in a way that is
consistent with the purpose of google I
think that is a much needed conversation
I wish I could be more practical but I
think it's that nation and that emerging
any more questions or comments okay
um I work at menlo park presbyterian
church and I have lived in Amman and
Cairo and traveled in the Gaza Strip cuz
I'm struck greatly by your comment that
are the best of faith is the best way to
defeat the worst of religion I i love
that math statement and i fully agree
with it and in the conversations and in
the ways that i have learned to have
conversations and listen to others I'm
struck by what you said up also at the
beginning about being non pro Sol's
proselytizing sorry braces because at
the end of the day the best of my faith
comes back to the best of Jesus and the
best of Muslim faith comes back to what
the Prophet says so I'm having a hard
time reconciling what you do after you
do listen what do you do after you do
establish the conversations and and and
the common ground because at some point
it does come back to my faith in Jesus
or my faith in the prophet or my faith
as as a Jew so how do you reconcile
those that's a great question and and
two things one is I get all my best
lines from Jesus plagiarizing
unapologetically you know Jesus has the
toughest words in the entire Bible or
for the religious establishment and he
says you go and cross Hill and Dale to
make a convert proselytize and you turn
them into twice as much as son of hell
as you are that is unbelievably harsh
and very unpleasant when T is this later
in that chapter you're good at counting
quantification of converts but the other
day that's really about us that's us to
find success as opposed to be no beating
and loving our neighbor and so he says
this you've forgotten a larger picture
faith mercy and justice so when we
engage Muslims we say look at we differ
about the person of ISA which is Arabic
for Jesus the Holy Quran says he's born
spirit of god so is greater than profits
but he's not the Son of God I believe
he's the son of god those are
irreconcilable theological differences
let's be good with that what do we have
in common peace justice mercy compassion
love those are action verbs and for true
people of faith they take those
seriously and think about ways to work
together and that's when I get back to
the to answer your question directly
relational diplomacy its third
characteristic is that is defined by
practical agreements with people on the
ground who no kidding live there and
what I have found every culture every
faith has somebody thinking exactly the
same way as I am and they want their
people to be a part of a global society
a global economy a global civilization
they want to be a global shareholder
they're angry as all get out that their
part of the world is portrayed as the
home of terrorism or the home of
repression or the home of
authoritarianism and they want to fight
that so you'll find ways to work on it
together the most developed example of
that is in one of these handouts our
trip to Vietnam where we've been doing
this for quite some time and we have
actually four agreements and if you
really want to know i'll send you those
four agreements the least developed is
in Syria where we're still trying to
think it through with them and there's
another trip report that talks about
Syria where we don't know where we're
going but you know what we're okay with
that because the relationships have to
be strong and the strategies are
revealed through the relationships with
government officials and grassroots and
leaders it has to be both simultaneously
and transparently or you get no where
you will be received as a Christian a
Bible in one hand a sword in the other
even as we receive Muslims as the Quran
in one hand and a bomb in the other we
got to get past that and that's the way
to do it I think okay so all more
comment okay last one on I'm wondering
what kind of experience you've had with
saying okay you don't believe Jesus the
Son of God we don't believe the prophet
is whatever i'm not sure out to say that
properly but he said these things and
they he being both of them
and you can act on them you can believe
on them believe in them even if you
don't believe in the true power in the
in the power of the source that is talk
to the statements not talk to the uric
irreconcilable religious differences
does that work yeah you're really
getting to the nub and I know we're at a
time but very briefly i'll use the arab
are the muslim theological context they
have a word called each to HUD jihad
jihad there's the internal and the
greater struggle for spiritual self
discipline and then the external or
lesser struggle against those who attack
the faith how that gets interpreted of
course is everything and so in each too
hot it's a reinterpretation of the holy
texts what do these words actually mean
how do we think about them if i'm a
christian and i only read joshua six or
it says they dedicated the city of
jericho to destruction and killed every
man woman and child i I don't have a
whole lot of places to go with that but
I need to think through my theological
construct and how that old testament new
testament relate and all those kinds of
things they're doing the same thing
they've got the mecca period they got
the medina period they got the period
when Muhammad had no political power and
they have the period where he had power
and then how do we think about these
holy texts and these teachings and then
relate them to the sayings of the
Prophet the hadees that get later get
recorded by people like Al Bukhari so it
varies all politics is local all
theological interpretation is more local
and you have to get really one-on-one
and talk these things through and this
takes time and Americans don't have time
and so in the global public square of
one click away in Google advertising
those kinds of things we have to do the
exact opposite and say we're going to
sit down and drink some tea with you and
we're going to have 10 days and get to
know you over tea and over long nights
on Peshawar rooftops and the irony is if
you invest in the relationship up front
and spend 18 months getting to know
these folks or three years practical
results happen
because they respect you because you
know who you are and you respect them
because they know who they are but
you're never going to bridge that gap
probably theologically or even
politically but the common values about
serving the other and serving your
neighbor and providing governance that
gives security and services to the
people around you is in everybody's
interest because everybody wants
stability to live a life free of
violence it just takes a while but our
donors are American Western system don't
like that they want to see a quarterly
report with a quantifiable measurable
result a relationship is not that but it
will yield those precisely yield those
results if you allow the time for the
your VC money to expand the
relationships because you've chosen the
right partner and the right NGO with the
right leadership who's asking the right
questions okay if you have more
questions feel free to join us we're
going to charlies with chris as well as
his guest mike garson so feel free to
join thanks so much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
