see that such a nice turnout I think
it's testimony to Eddie's great talks he
gave you and previous visits as you may
know I'm what fire comes by them to
visit see Google LA office every what is
it every few times a year to help with
our project on quantum artificial
intelligence which actually was thinking
at some point we should give you an
update on how this is going because this
field has come a long way actually some
people accuse I may not know if you go
to our rooftop and look in this
direction towards information Sciences
Institute there's actually the first
commercial when of computers installed
there which is actually based on the
computing principles that Eddie invented
but this time or it has become tradition
that whenever an Eddie come through Iran
for cultural enrichment will give a big
physics talk and today we'll talk about
the Higgs boson in this any of you may
have seen in the news as some may be yes
no evidence as he Hicks is being
discovered in the law pattern collider
and Eddie will talk about this today
maybe many of you have seen him before
but those also don't know advil to see
the rector of the center of theoretical
physics at MIT ok thank you ok well
thanks
okay so um I i'm going to adapt this
talk as I go along based on what I feel
the audience knows about this subject so
we'll see how it goes so thank you for
having me so I'm going to be talking
about the large hadron collider and
about the Higgs boson a little bit and
why why it's important or interesting to
us in in physics to know about the Higgs
boson now so we're first going to talk a
little bit about the large hadron
collider and just I'm only going to have
slides about the Large Hadron Collider
because they're there are pictures we
can visualize things once we get to the
theory end it's going to be much harder
to visualize so I'm going to drop the
slides otherwise I could just assault
you with giant equations which I don't
think you want to say so I'm going to
try to talk about the Higgs boson
without visual aids we'll see how we do
there is always the blackboard so in in
2008 in September 10th 2008 the large
hadron collider announced that they had
collisions and that was to turn on of
the law Hadron Collider of course they
turned it on before but that was the
official announcement and this was the
google website on that day so Google
acknowledged it by turning that into
there what he called the homepage the
front page do but the google doodle okay
i didn't know that i'm not an insider
and of course that was a big deal now
for those of you who don't just help you
a little bit with what the Large Hadron
Collider is the Large Hadron Collider is
a machine that collides protons on
protons and these protons go around in
two rings which are going on in opposite
directions and then the protons have
enormous energy I can tell you how much
energy they have in a minute and when
and they collide at a number of
collision points and what happens at
those collision points is the debris
from the collision goes showering out
and that gives us information
about elementary particles at the most
fundamental level but the lodge Hadron
Collider or what happened I logged out
because we were touching it enough okay
it's a good thing you're here okay so so
just to give you a sense of the scale
the arm no didn't go down oh yeah there
we go just press the spacebar okay thank
you so that's to give you that is an
aerial view of well that's not an aerial
view the collider is underground so that
just shows you the size of it this is
the edge of the airport in Switzerland
and this is 27 kilometers around so this
is the largest scientific project ever
belt as and so this accelerator sits
under ground and it straddles the French
Swiss border and the little circle in
there is a little pre accelerator that's
been used to get the protons up to even
higher energy where they go encounter
circulating rings to collide oh let me
just make another disclaimer here i am a
theoretical physicist I don't really
know too much about how this thing works
it's sort of you know so I'm just have a
g-wiz attitude towards it I know about
as much about how this works is I really
know about how my television works you
know I kind of know but really if you
press me I don't know the details so but
I I do know something about what the
results mean so there it is it's very
massive and inside is a is a tunnel and
there's me in the tunnel I got a I got
to take a tour so that that's my that
proves that i'm a real physicist because
i got
to go underground into the tunnel and
that's the actual Large Hadron Collider
where I got a tour you can only go in
there when it's off you can't believe
you would be fried if you were to admit
I was on so and yeah who is this which
yeah I don't think it will go on if
there's a person in there yeah but it's
actually there's a huge the amount of
energy that's carried in those beams is
absolutely enormous you know it's and
and the energy that's kept these these
are two beams of protons and you know I
think it's the energy it's like it
probably has the energy of a missile and
that in itself is not so impressive lots
of things have the energy of a missile
like a missile but what's amazing you
know is that it's all carried by very
few particles so you have very few
particles which are moving at very high
energy so the individual energy of the
particles is enormous and that's what
we're interested in here is colliding
together particles with tremendous
energy traveling where you are yeah it's
doing through that thing no it's in a
tube and it's being bent by magnets and
those magnets have to be to the magnet
the strength of the magnets these are
you know magnetic field bends particles
so you have to put these particles in a
magnetic field to bend them but the
reason the accelerator is so big is
because you want the you want to get
them to bend as much as possible but the
particles are really energetic so to
bend them you need very big magnetic
fields because if you remember your
elementary physics you know the faster
you're going the harder it is to bend
and these magnets are operating at such
a so so intensely that they're
practically shearing the metal that's
holding the magnets together and so if
they increase the strength of this
magnet that thing would rip apart so
these are the most intense magnets and
there are 27 kilometres of them and in
order to get the magnetic field so high
they need huge currents and those
currents are maintained by using
superconducting coils so the whole thing
is super cooled
it operates at just a few degrees Kelvin
it uses half the world's supply of
helium just to keep it at that
temperature and you know uses and just
to keep that the the thing running it
uses you know the energy of a city it
has it's very energy intensive and it's
just two collide together these
particles anywhere i'm standing there oh
I I think room temperature it a little
bit later oh I know no because of
magnets I mean all that super cooling
stuff is all in that stuff on the left
yeah no no I i believe it's room
temperature i'm not really sure but I
mean the really cold stuff is all in
that stuff to the right in the picture
yeah how much mass to these particles
okay well okay that's a great question
he's asking you know um how much some of
you know that in relativity that people
sometimes talk about the mass of
something increasing because it's going
faster we usually talk about that as the
energy of the particle so proton in
units that I'm going to talk about in a
few minutes a proton its rest energy in
some units which i'm going to use
throughout this is we use what's called
a GeV that's a 10 to the 9 electron
volts that's the energy and electron
would get if across through a billion
volt you know if you had a billion
batteries and you've moved an electron
Billy 1 volt batteries the energy and
electron would pick up is a giggle a GeV
that's about the rest energy of the
proton that's the rest energy now these
beams are at the design is a little
higher but presently the beams are at
3.5 tev and a TV is a thousand GeV so in
other words these things are 35 there
their energy is 3500 times their rest
mass it's 3500 times the rest mass and
you know that's a huge energy you know
if you look at let's say an atom bomb
and you say you know what's the energy
released that's a fraction of the rest
mass of the particles
uh you know in an atom bomb they're just
you have gev pro two nuclei and their
MeV which is million of electron volts
released so you know these energies are
huge by the standards of nuclear physics
it's designed to go twice that the total
it was 3.5 g eb it could be TeV i
misspoke it's 3.5 TV / beam now that's a
total of seven and it's designed to go
to 14 and the reason they haven't gone
to 14 as some of you know that after it
was turned on there was an explosion
because there was a bad solder there was
just a bad a little just some little
place in this whole superconducting wire
where there was a bad joint and suddenly
this huge amount of current had no place
to go and the thing exploded and that
set the project back by about a year but
there now beyond that and the thing is
running and that's why we're talking
about it now so after the start update
which I showed before there was a
setback and now the thing works well so
the LHC works well but it's not at its
full energy because they wanted to be
cautious about going up to full energy
because higher energy means more stress
on the machine and so it's running at
half its design energy but let me say
one other thing about that see they're
really when you collide together
particles you collide with the other
protons on protons and you want those
particles to interact and there's only a
certain probability that a certain
interaction will take place so if you
have a fixed probability of interaction
and you want to get events you have to
do that by increasing what we call the
luminosity you have to have the beams
have to be intense so that you have a
lot of particles seeing a lot of
particles and therefore the actual
probability of getting an event of
interest is higher so there so that the
crucial thing is not just the energy but
we call the luminosity which is some
define it doesn't matter it's the number
of particles bring in an area per unit
time I just defined it you know you know
you need to get that high and that means
you have to be able to really focus the
beams and so you know here you have
things these things are moving to get a
relativistic energy factor of 3,500 you
have to be going at ninety-nine point
nine nine nine nine nine percent the
speed of light I may have that off by a
thing but roughly ninety nine point nine
nine nine nine nine now don't know how
many nights present the speed of light
so these things are really moving and
then and they're like these beams are
like tiny needles and they have to
they're going to speed all right you
have to hit them head-on and otherwise
you don't have the luminosity and so
what happened with the LHC is even
though whether they achieve the energy
it took turning to get the arm the
luminosity up and this is an art to turn
a machine like this to get the
luminosity up that's an art that takes
time but if you looked at the luminosity
curve as a function of time it really
has shot up you know and so as after it
turned on the luminosity kept increasing
and increasing and now the luminosity is
at the point where experiments can
function so in that sense it's not only
its it half its energy but it's close to
design luminosity and therefore it works
and it's a huge technical achievement to
just get the accelerator to work but now
when these particles collide so you have
these protons and protons they come
together and they come together a place
is called at intersection points there
are four intersection points at the LHC
and the two big ones which I'm going to
emphasize we're going to talk about it
two of these points there are giant
detectors one is called CMS which stands
for the compact compact muon solenoid
and the compact is a joke because you'll
see how big it is and the other one is
called atlas so these are the two things
CMS and atlas those are their names and
these detectors what they do is the
particles come together the protons and
they collide and after they collide they
make stuff
they make other particles and those
particles shower out and they have to be
picked up by giant detectors which track
which track the particles through the
detectors and then what they try to do
is arm so firstly we have to do is I
have to track what comes out and then
they try to use the tracking of what
comes out to try to recreate the event
that occurred and try to deduce
something about fundamental law but the
first thing you have to look at is the
detector to see what does it look like
you know I mean to see that to
understand the collision first have to
see it so there's a giant detectors a
belt so let me show you pictures of the
detectors this just gee whiz stuff so
that's a pig's ample of the detective
look at the person can you see the
person in the bottom of the picture so
this thing is enormous and this is
before the thing has been locked up so
this is the two halves of the detector
are separated and it's going to be then
squished together and I don't have a
pointer but you can kind of guess that
you know the collision is going to take
place about there and then what happens
is after this thing is locked up is the
particles will fly out but every of
every centimeter of that thing is a
precision detector is is you know it's
been precisely built with silicon is
wires and that's that can study the
outgoing um what comes out and these
things are just these are I would guess
these are the most complicated things
ever built it's hard to imagine anyone
has built anything technologically as
complicated and it's sophisticated as
these devices all the layers are there I
I don't want to explain it too much
because first of all I'm not an expert
but what they're doing is they are
detecting various attributes of the
outgoing particles some of them look for
Energy deposits some of them track the
particles curves they're all there there
there each layer can consists of see
what happens is the particles fly out so
you want to have a picture you want to
track of where it went so it has to it
and that particles pass through
successive layers and as it goes through
the success of layers that have to be
detection so that's why it's like an
onion and as the particles go out it
goes through successive layers and we'll
just so some more gee whiz pictures he
has another picture of what it looks
like but each of these things you know
if you took one of these elements and
you took it out and I put it there would
look like the inside of your computer
and this thing is that big so are these
things these detectors they are if you
look at a paper by these the the groups
that make these things typically there
are 3000 PhD physicists on this thing
then that plus their engineers and
support staff so when papers are
published in this field there is a 3000
person author lists and you know to rise
to the top of that collaboration
requires skills that could you know
those people could you know run armies
and they takes various magical it's very
special skills to you would not want to
be in a fight with the leader of CMS
this these people are very skilled on a
lot of levels because you have to
coordinate this um so there's another
devious picture and here's another one
of the side of it before it was being
assembled then this one is Atlas that's
the other giant detector again this one
is bigger than the other one this has
like more iron and I think in the Eiffel
Tower
hmm know that the scientists detect the
same things and therefore there's
another picture of it look at the size
of the person here there's the person so
these things are astonishing so you know
if you ask me you know what's really
going on in there I don't really know
that well so that's so so these things
are now closed these are the pictures
are only good before it's locked up so
this is now sealed up and you could just
imagine the engineering feat just to
assemble it and to make sure that the
whole thing did fit together it's well
it's impressive can I say now why do we
bother that becomes the next question
let's see if I have any more pictures I
guess so now there's a collision now
this is a that's a sort of a
representation of the collision and what
happens after a collision is there can
be thousands of particles streaming out
and this is some kind of graphical
representation of what's been read out
now the other thing I should say about
one second I'll answer your question one
thing i should say is that when the
particles collide there's a collision
now there are so there's so much data
being generated by these collisions that
it all cannot be read the data stream is
too intense this the data coming out of
this the data stream is you know like
all the cell phone conversations in the
earth something like that could
constantly and you cannot they cannot
read all the data because it's too much
of it so what they have to do is have to
do what are called triggers and a
trigger is you look at an event an event
means a collision and you have stuff
coming out and you look at the event and
then you ask a question does it have a
characteristic that makes it worthy of
keeping the event and reading it to
reading it to tape they say you know of
storing it or should be passed on this
event now you know that's a vet you know
if you don't know what you're looking
for because you want to explore unknown
physics with this device so if you don't
know what you're looking for and you
have to make a trigger well that's a
scary proposition because you may be
triggering on
wrong attribute of of what of
interesting physics so you know there's
a whole discussion of how do you how do
you set your triggers and but they
cannot record all the events there's too
much stuff coming out the data and the
numerical analysis is beyond what could
possibly be done I don't know I don't
know those numbers I that's just not my
job I just don't know but you know you
create many events many events because
each beam contains many protons ariados
also note so there are I think the
bunches of beams come every I think the
bunches are spaced by nanoseconds and
the bunches of space by nano seconds and
then each bunch and each and each bunch
produces I don't know how many events I
just don't know you see that's the kind
of question they would ask me Google but
I don't know you know just I all know is
it's on the edge of what can be handled
and there are vast computer operations
here attempting to analyze the data and
everything's done the special purpose
code yeah oh the experiment how okay
when it's on it's running 24 hours a day
so when they turn it on it runs 24 hours
a day but then there are definite breaks
when they are they when they shut it
down for maintenance so and for tune-ups
because this is a very complicated thing
it's like a race car you know you just
can't run it 24 hours a day 365 days a
year it's got to be shut down sometimes
and tuned so it presently it ran the
what's important to know is is run long
enough in two thousand at the end of
2010-2011 to collect a significant
reasonable amount of data it then it
would I think it's now ramping up again
it then went into some scheduled
shutdown and it's going to go into a
year-long scheduled shutdown in about a
year and in that year long scheduled
shutdown they're going to raise the
energy to the 14 TV
okay so uh so that's just you know and
and what this is really what this is
only wants to represent all these dots
are like firings of detector elements
which are being recorded which are then
of course there are numbers associated
with all this stuff to help reproduce
the event this next picture i have i
believe is actual that may be simulated
data this is an actual event but shown
by CMS in some way that you know I don't
know precisely what all these bars mean
their scale to some attribute of the
energy deposit but the data analysis
problems here are huge and you have to
be able to pick out a tiny signal from
huge amounts of data yeah yeah yeah
that's right they have to sort that out
that's right that's right they have to
track that back that's called yeah they
have a problem with that and that
problem of course increases as you
increase the luminosity so yeah they're
at the point now I think that's called
pile up when you know they sometimes
have difficulty distinguishing between
different events but somehow they know
how to do it they know how to tell
separate the events I don't know what
they do it in time or I'm not exactly
sure how they define large like our
events happening like once every oh yeah
there's no they're hundreds everywhere
and you're just crazy well I think it's
much more than hundreds i think it's
hundreds of thousands per second and you
know it's because i think it's i think
it's much more than hundreds i think
it's i don't know i wish i should look
up all these numbers i shoulda figured
you would not ask me these things but
yeah I I don't know the numbers it's
it's it's enough well I guess it's just
it's enough that it's at the limit of
what the biggest computers can and and
devices can process I don't know if
that's that sort of sets the scale of it
and and all the computing is done on
large-scale computer form spread out
over the world
and for each event yeah i mean what
order management of self articles are
coming out there could be hundreds to
thousands of particles coming out of an
event hundreds to thousands of particles
and and then what you want to do is
reconstruct something that happened and
you know I think Fineman described this
kind of physics is you want to know what
try to understand the Swiss watch by
taking two swiss watches and smashing
them together and then looking at what
comes out you know and then looking at
the debris and then trying to figure out
you know it was made of us if we had a
Swiss watch in there it's kind of like
that so now what happens is that you
know this is the this field is is
divided between theorists and
experimentalists there are no there are
no there are no there are no people who
are working on this who have the time
and the inclination to actually get
really deeply involved in theoretical
physics and there are no very few
theoretical physicists who work on these
experiments and it to enter the
experiment if you were a theoretical
physicist and you said you know I want
access to everything I want the data
early they would say you have to join
the collaboration and if you to join the
collaboration that means you have to
work they have to you know help build
parts of the detector you have to run
chefs which means you have to be in the
control room while things are working
you would have to be responsible for
things so the field is very divided in
probably the last great theorist whose
experiment list was Enrico Fermi and
since Fermi I don't think there's been
another you know really great arm freely
was both the great a theorist and a
great experimentalist but there hasn't
really been another one since that time
this is just too complicated to have
well to divide your time on so the
community is divided and there are the
theorists who try to speculate about
what's going on and try to understand
that they're the experimentalists who
are really interested in the device and
pulling the data out okay
so so now okay so now we're going to
talk about the Higgs boson a little bit
now you probably have heard or I'm going
to tell you I'm going to tell you more
about the Higgs boson in a few minutes
it we have something in elementary
particle physics which I'm going to talk
more about but as a prelude to that the
in there is a thing called the standard
model and the standard model consists of
a list of elementary particles which I
will show you on the next in a couple of
slides and of elementary particles and
it also and those particles include
quarks and leptons and the photon and a
bunch of particles cousins of the photon
called gluons the W and Z well I just
listed the whole thing they'll let the
leptons the quarks the gluons the photon
the W and Z and then there's one other
particle which sits in the standard
model it's called the Higgs boson okay
and but the Higgs boson had not been
seen and one of the goals of this just
of this device is to create the Higgs
boson and to create it in a fashion
where it will be made and then these
parts it's very unstable and it's made
and then it's the k's and you want to
see the debris coming out of the k and
say we made a higgs boson now the theory
which i will talk more about says that
the Higgs boson exists and there's a lot
of evidence for its existing because the
theory which I'm going to talk about the
standard model is very very successful
you know there's never been a prediction
of the standard model that has ever been
nullified by an experiment so every
prediction of the standard model is
consistent with every experiment that's
ever been done but it has an ingredient
called the Higgs boson and that
ingredient the Higgs boson it's not its
mass is not specified by the theory its
mass is an unknown parameter so when
you're looking for the Higgs boson you
don't know its mass you just so that
means that it makes it harder to know
exactly how to look now the mass of the
exposÃ© on affects the way it decays
because particles could only Decatur
things live
than themselves that just follow some
simple conservation of energy and
momentum if you go to the restroom of
something and decay is you can just
figure out quickly that it can only
decay the things lighter than itself so
when you make a Higgs boson it's got a
decay into stuff that's lighter and what
that basically means is the heavier the
Higgs boson is the more channels it has
to decay into so the moats and since
there are more channels it's easier to
see so a light Higgs boson is harder to
see than a heavy Higgs boson so with the
amount of data they have they have been
able to make plots like this I'm only
roughly explain what these plots are but
it gives you a link you an analogy to
what you do with your fixed data suppose
I told you I have a coin and it may or
may not be biased but you don't know how
much bias it has so maybe it's a 50-50
coin maybe it's a 60-40 coin maybe it's
an 8020 corner maybe it's a 99 to 1 coin
ok now you flip it 50 times let's say
that's a fat a hundred times you flip it
a hundred times ok and you get fifty
three heads in 47 tails well probably
not a 99 to 1 biased coin that would be
very unlikely but maybe it's a 50-50
coin maybe it's a 60-40 coin so with a
limited amount of data you cannot
analyze your certain possibilities or
less likely than others does that make
sense so you know if you clearly do 100
coin flips you're not you're not going
to have a 99 to 1 bias coin if if you
get fifty three heads I mean it could
happen but it's extremely unlikely so
but these plots represent is a this plot
as the on this axis is the Higgs boson
mass the means I'm showing that this is
real data so this is the Higgs boson
mints this comes from CMS and but this
includes all the data that has been
taken up through about a couple of
months ago so that's data which has been
analyzed the unit's here in verse femto
barnes a barn is a unit because it has
to do with how big something is and the
universe is the size of a bar
so the side of a barn you want to say
something big yet the biggest the side
of a boat so anyway these are inverse
femto barns and anyway so so as a
function of the Higgs boson mass this is
data and this is data and what this data
is supposed to indicate that if the
Higgs boson were produced at you there's
a certain expectation for what how much
the Higgs boson should be made but you
can't really be sure oh I should say one
other thing excuse me there's huge
background here okay let me take a Lego
set back one second I forgot to say that
when you make a Higgs boson it decays
into stuff but there's a lot of other
processes which are making decay
particles which look like that so
there's background the Higgs boson
signal sits on background it's not a
unique event that you know poof you see
a Higgs boson it's a signal and it sits
in a sea of background which can mimic
it okay so what you have to do is you
can say as a function of the Higgs boson
mass when what is the how confident can
I be that we would have seen the Higgs
boson if its mass was let's say three
hundred GeV and what's without
explaining it if you'd below the red
line it means you didn't see it so
they've been very confident now that the
Higgs boson most of this stuff is way
below this line remember the GV that's
the unit i told you about 1 gb is the
best energy of the proton so they can be
very confident that the Higgs it doesn't
wear this is like is gone it doesn't
exist between 140 and 550 because most
of this stuff is really blow the red
light but there's a little upward
fluctuation here and there's a little up
with luxury this is expanded a little
upward fluctuation but it's not really a
huge fluctuation and the other this is
from CMS and the other Atlas which is
the other detector here is a similar
type plot same
integrated luminosity means stuff
absorbed remember I told you the energy
with seven TV because that's the total
center of mass energy this is all to
2011 data and there's a little upward
fluctuation here or this blue thing at
about 125 GeV the only trouble with this
little blue thing is one channel it's
called gamma gamma that means two
photons now so what's happened is is
that there's an upward the Higgs boson
has many ways of decaying so you would
expect that if you make it you would see
it in in this channel but you would also
see it in other channels so this is the
like this is the one where the signal is
biggest they happen to see an upward
fluctuation in gamma gamma that gamma
gamma is the same as two photons
physical photos gammas so so there's an
upward fluctuation but um it's though
there are not up with fluctuations in
other channels so the whole combined
effect including what's called the look
elsewhere effect because if I tell you
that I'm looking over an enormous number
of masses and I say what's the chance to
set there's an upward fluctuation well
there's always a chance that there's an
upward fluctuation somewhere so if you
take into account look elsewhere and
then and you combine all the data it's a
three standard deviation effect that's
basically what it is three standard
deviations for the observation of the
Higgs boson so that is not a huge signal
just three sigma so they are not
claiming discovery they are only saying
that they're seeing the hint of a signal
I'm showing you the data nothing to
expect you to understand it but these
are summary plots from Atlas and CMS and
it will talk about that in a minute so
um is it you know so can we say the
Higgs boson is there let's talk about
that for a minute what I say it's there
I would say yes I'll tell you why first
of all I believe the Higgs bosons there
because that's the most likely
explanation to fit the standard model is
that there is a Higgs boson second of
all the Higgs boson remember I told you
it's exists as part of the standard
model
so because it exists is part of the
standard model its mass is a parameter
in the standard model and you can
calculate processes in the standard
model certain other decay rates and
certain other things and you can then
measure those other things and you can
try to fit the mass of the Higgs
inferentially so this was direct
detection but you could say giving the
fact that it's a parameter infects are
the things let me go measure those other
things and then fit for the Higgs mass
okay so if you do that if you fit for
the Higgs mass based on existing data
other than this you find a value of I
think 80 GeV the best fit value is a TGV
now it was known that the Higgs boson
had to weigh more than 115 GeV because
of other direct detection measurements
which had taken place okay so now I tell
you have a parameter and the best fit
value is 80 but I know it has to be
above 115 what do you guess for its
value 116 I mean that would be your best
guess right because you want to be as
close to the 5th value as possible at
the right at the edge of the exclusion
does that make sense so you know the
best guess is 116 you know 120 low based
on the previous low i mean not 500
because five hundreds were away from 80
so you know there was a pre even before
this there was a that that Higgs mass is
probably not what much above 115 it's
been excluded from that other picture I
showed you it's really excluded above
140 everybody thinks the Higgs is there
and suddenly we've seen upward
fluctuation so what would you conclude
well my conclusion is if the Higgs boson
weighs 125 GeV they saw it I don't know
is that
what the best fit they gave 80 and also
the thing that said had to be greater
than 115 were these equations or no no
okay nope the best fit that said it
should be armed what 80 is you take the
Higgs i'm going to i haven't talked
about the standard model i'm going to do
that in a minute but we have an existing
edifice that describes the interaction
of elementary particles and the Higgs
mast is a parameter in it so given that
parameter you can then say let me look
at other observables other things that
have been measured how do they depend on
the mass of the Higgs so they'll hunt
there unknown maybe 100 things you could
look at and then you do the best fit to
the mass of the Higgs on using not
direct detection but inferential e and
that gives you a tea the 115 came from
previous accelerator experiments whose
reach was as far as 115
no no because if the best fit was 80 so
that means that you know if you're doing
the chi-squared fit and the best fit is
at 80 so it's not as good a fit at 90 it
gets a little worse than 100 it's
terrible at 200 but you know if I tell
you no no no once that's right above 200
would break would be trouble for the
model right given the statistics the
weakness of the statistics 125 is is
still acceptable but 200 is getting to
be it would stress the model the model
would be stress yeah that's what I'm
saying I I want to remember yeah yeah
that's right you know there's a standard
deviation around the 80 the oldest the
central value and you know maybe the
standard deviation only at least 20 or
something so you know couple standard
deviations where you can tolerate but 10
or 20 standard deviation can be
nerve-racking so so you know so r is the
Higgs there I don't know you know and I
don't think the experimental snow and
nobody is sure they're not claiming
observation but they kind of think
they've seen it they're in a tough
situation and the only thing that's
going to prove this is more data taking
it's just statistics it's just a name of
the game of statistics if the LHC
continues to run well the statistics
will improve and it'll just be a
statistically more significant
observation okay so that's sort of the
background on on you know where the
experiment sets as of now again it's
turning on I think it's running now but
the data taking will take again we'll go
on and the expectation is if it
continues to work well then in about a
year the statistics will have improved
significantly enough that they'll be
able to make definitive statements
there's a huge investment of time and
energy to get you know this kind of
weakish signal but you know they're
doing the best they can so now I want to
talk a little bit about the this is as
 I stole from a colleague that's why
it has his name on the bottom so this is
a picture of the elementary particles as
far as particle physics concerned you
know we all know that
made of atoms and inside of atoms
electrons and then at the core is in
nucleus and the nucleus made of neutrons
and protons and inside the neutrons and
protons or quarks and our most
fundamental understanding of elementary
particles has crooks which we'll talk
about now there's the quarks come in six
varieties which we call flavors and the
flavor is called up down charm strange
top and bottom okay those are just their
names I don't know how they got those
names doesn't matter they're just names
up down strange charm top and bottom now
the the up charm and top quark all have
charged two thirds and when I seek two
thirds i'm working in units where the
proton charge is one and the electron
charge is minus one okay so they have
charged two thirds the down quark has
charge minus the third as does the
strange quark and the bottom quark so
those are the quarks and one thing
that's really interesting this gives the
mass of these in GeV so the up and down
quarks way about 10 to the minus 2 GeV
that's about 10 mev remember the proton
ways one GV so the and we know we are
made of up and down quarks inside the
proton or two up quarks in a down quark
that the charge is two thirds plus
two-thirds minus the third which is one
and we're all made of up and down quarks
but the up and down quarks are very
light compared to the to the proton mass
and that's because the proton is held
together by other particles called
gluons and the proton is made entirely
of binding energy it's not it doesn't
the mass of the proton does not come
from the mass of its constituents it
comes from the interaction of the
constituents and but what's very odd is
that the up quark weighs between 10 to
the minus 2 and 10 device 10 devices
three in ten minutes to GeV and the top
quark happens to weigh 175 GeV so the
top quark remember
the proton ways one GV so 175 GV that's
like that's like the rate of a big MOOC
of a nucleus that's like the way to I
can remember my chemistry well enough
whose atomic weight is 175 somebody up
there in the periodic table so there's a
quark okay which looks just like the up
quark which raised much more than raise
as much as more than 175 protons with
protein that's actually point 938 GV but
anyway let's call one so it was like 175
GV and accordingly the bottom quark has
a friend the strange quark and the
excuse me I misspoke the down quark
which we're made of has a friend the
strange quirk in the bottom quark and
the bottom quark ways are five GeV so we
have a quark a charge minus the third
core that weighs five times with the
proton made ways in addition that we
have the electron the electron weighs
half a million electron volts which is
mainly that remember the proton as I
said is a billion electron volts the
electron lays half a million electron
volts and because I say way in mass
because I said C equal to 1 you know
equals MC squared but if you work in my
units with C equals 1 energy and mass
have the same units okay I can't not do
that that's just too that would be the
hardest thing for me to live in a world
where C was not one so I'm forced mass
and energy of the same units I can't
help that okay because C is one so this
is two units ok so anyway in my units
mass is measured in energy units and
weighs half a million electron volts but
it has a friend called the muon which
weighs about a hundred something million
electron volts and there's another guy
called the towel which weighs 1.5 GV so
their motor three electron these guys
are very much alike the electron them
you want to tell there are three
particles which would like in all
respects except one is having the other
and heavier than the other now why are
you familiar
with the electron and not with the
others and there's a very simple reason
for that the electron is the lightest
charged particle okay now if you believe
in the conservation of of charge which
of course you do then the lightest
charged particle has to be stable
because the lifto decay you have to
decay into something lighter than you
and if there are no charge particles
lighter than you then you're stable so
the electron is just stable by accident
it happens to be the lightest charged
particles there is no place to go so
therefore the particle physics point of
view that's not that interesting it just
happens to be stable which is a good
thing if you want to make people you
want to make stuff you want to make it
out of stable particles but its
stability is sort of you know an oddity
from a particle physics point of view it
just happens to be stable because it's
the bottom of the chain but other
particles can decay into it it's just
got nowhere to go and so you know we're
very familiar with certain particles
which is stable or almost stable like
neutrons and protons because for similar
reasons well the neutron isn't even
stable but let's say the proton is a
stable particle it may not even be
stable but anyway let's let that go the
assignments there enough that you can
make stuff out of protons and neutrons
and so we're familiar with certain
particles but from a part of the
participants not fundamental and these
all these particles are equally
interesting and so there are six quarks
and there are three electrons they're
called with your friends of the electro
know there are three more there's a
three charged electrons and then there
are three neutrinos called the electron
neutrino the muon neutrino and the town
neutrino and these are known to have
very tiny masses on this scale in fact
they're of order an electron volt or
less less than electron volt which is 10
to the minus 90 GeV so we have these
other particles now what's really
strange here this is V I'm going to now
reveal to you the biggest mystery in
particle physics okay it's this
disparity and mass scales it's
completely not understood why it is that
there are elementary particles in nature
seems similar in many ways but have
radically different masses you see it's
very very hard to understand that if
usually if you imagine that things are
composite like if i said to you you know
why does helium way twice you know when
you go up the periodic table and i look
at the masses you know how can I
understand that order well it's pretty
simple because once you realize that
elements in the periodic table are made
of constituents if you have three
neutrons and protons you're probably
worried about three times with something
with one proton ways if you have ten you
a ten times and in their pattern it
makes sense it's not so mysterious the
pattern of masters once you understand
the made of constituents but here we
have mass disparities of between similar
objects the top quark in the up quark
where the mass disparity is I think it's
a factor of 50,000 the disparity between
the mast electron in the electron
neutrino is a factor of I can't even get
these numbers right some big number of
millions of billions or something right
some crazy amount yeah so so you have
articles that's an elementary particle
yeah yeah there's nothing it's not not
leave to be made of anything how have we
seen it like the world oh because it
gets created in Collider experiments it
decays the debris from the collision is
then reconstructed to see the particle
in it collides it actually sort of bums
particles together to make a bigger
right I didn't really say that too
clearly right so what happens in the
collision as the energy you see you know
that equals MC squared and you know atom
bombs that you take mass and you make
energy here going the other way we're
taking the energy of the beam of the
particles and the beams and with
colliding together to make new forms of
matter and they decay pretty quickly oh
yeah these things have these decay into
what's called jiffy which is you know
it's about Ted I think that if he is 10
to the minus 24 seconds some very fast
amount of time yeah
or just because of their decay
characteristics right that's a great
question everything else in this diagram
has been seen and it's just a question
of what are the characteristics of its
decays that make it amenable to
detection and a lot of the production
cross-section probabilities it's just
characteristics of these particles of
course these particles up here could
never have been made until we had
accelerators capable of reaching these
energies but you're asking a great
question it looks now like the top quark
weighs more than the Higgs but the top
quark has discovered earlier and that's
because the method for production is
more just more amenable to detection and
its characteristic make it more amenable
so the the Higgs boson or it may be a
little high here I mean maybe should be
down a little bit the W I guess so a
couple of other particles I didn't
mention is the photon which is massless
in the glue on the grill under the
particles that quark that are carry the
force between quarks and responsible for
the binding of quarks together to make
protons and neutrons they called gluons
you know very witty what is the
horizontal position like the many ways
oh oh yeah well that's a great question
why what is this position okay well this
one is a separate column these things
are called these things are grouped in
generations and this is a substance an
arbitrary grouping there are three it
turns out there's three electron like
particles there are three neutrinos
there are three down quarks and there
are three what I mean by down quark is
charge minus the third course and there
are three charged two thirds quark so
there are three of each but they kind of
film sets of Thor because the up quark
likes to decay two down quarks and
electrons like to decay two electron
neutrinos but there is some
arbitrariness in this that is a kind of
attempt at a periodic table structure by
just grouping the light ones you somehow
another you want to put the lightest
ones together and then the next slide is
the next
there's no so-called generations that's
a very arbitrary grouping but it's one
that physicists huge use and there are
three there seem to be three generations
and not more we know there is not
another generation yeah well yeah it's
not that yet the ratios are kind of yeah
you can play you can do numerics with
that you know you can play games the the
pattern of elementary particle masses is
a complete mystery there's no
understanding of its 0 and I've been in
this game for a long time and it's a
there's absolutely no understanding for
why these particles have these masses
they're all input parameters if you and
i'll talk about the Higgs and its
relation to this in a second yeah how
what benefit you get by bumping up the
electricity is more luminosity oh he say
why okay that's a great question if the
Higgs is light why do we have to go to
high energy it's because they're
smashing together if they were smashing
together electrons and let arm will and
president because the proton is made of
constituents to upside down and a bunch
of gluons so even when you smash
together a proton and another proton the
actual things that are interacting or
the quarks inside and they carry much
less of the energy than the total object
a lot of that energy is actually being
carried by the gluons and you move the
quarks to fuse together to make the eggs
so what's happening here is that these
two the proton is a bag of quarks and
you have another bag of quarks and
they're hitting together the
constituents interacting and those
constituents do not carry the full
energy the only carry a small fraction
of it so you need to ramp up the energy
of the of the proton to get the
constituents to have sufficient energy
now had this been a different type had
you used electrons electrons don't seem
to be made of anything that might have
you wouldn't have had
problem but then the production cross
section for electrode electrode Higgs is
practically zero yeah so that's yeah
that was not it's not yeah that why
you're why go to seven TV when you're
only producing something that weighs 125
GeV and it's because what I just said
okay so everything's been discovered on
that plot everything has been seen every
single thing is seen except the Higgs
boson and what hat so so no no no the
neutrinos are actually all these
particles here or fermions which means
there's been a half they obey Fermi
statistics and these particles are
bosons which means that their spin zero
or spin ones they have a bow statistics
so the neutrinos to spend a half there's
no yeah there's no friend to the Higgs
so so uh the situation we're in is this
we have a mathematical description of
these interactions of these particles
that mathematical description that
mathematical description allows us to
write down a set of equations which
describe the interactions of all these
particles I probably should stop now or
in a minute and then let people go who
want to go and then the other people can
stay and ask me more questions is that a
good idea so um what do I'll do that
because I gets people with some people
are asking anyone who wants to go it
needs to go can go and those of you who
are interested can stay and ask me more
stuff okay because I didn't you know
we're wandering a little bit yeah
oh ok so if they don't find the Higgs on
in fact I would say that from a
theorists point of view the discovery of
the Higgs in some sense is a
disappointment because if you said to me
what do I learn you know I now live in a
mental world as most of my friends do
where we imagine the Higgs boson exists
and it's just been hard to find and the
exact value of its mass is not too
important to us so if you take my point
of view you know I look at the equations
of elementary particle physics I presume
the existence of the Higgs I don't know
its mass and you know it's probably not
too far from 80 because of what we said
before so then what changes in my world
view when it's discovered and has a mass
of 125 GeV and it decays exactly as it
should in the standard model I haven't
learned anything and in that sense it's
a great experimental achievement I don't
mean to diminish it because it's it's
like a it shows that our standard model
is correct but in terms of theoretical
advanced I would say it's very minimal
quite honestly because it just it just
confirms a worldview which most people
have already adopted and so you know for
me it would be much more interesting if
the Higgs boson were excluded those
turned out to be just statistical
fluctuations they come back and they say
you know with ninety-nine point nine
percent confidence the Higgs boson does
not exist between 115 and 500gb or else
we would have found it that would be
much more interesting and that it would
be no one knows how to deal with that
and that would be great because you know
that would certainly be great I think I
think this is sort of the boring outcome
and there's a whole other question here
which is maybe the LHC will uncover
something else you know they're not just
looking for the Higgs boson we've barely
been talking about that today because
it's a lot to cover and one talk about
what's going on the LHC once he's
looking for a lot of other stuff that
could be anomalous stuff of new
particles which are unanticipated
particles which other people have
predicted nothing has been seen zero but
God yeah tiny intuitive not exactly the
question was this you know very often
you read that the Higgs boson gives mass
two particles and um because of symmetry
breaking that was those are the right
words and let's see you see if you dare
say I'm a a description of the
elementary particles in terms of an
object called the Hamiltonian it's like
the energy function but you know I have
to think about the Hamiltonian in
relativistic quantum field theory and so
I'm just going to write something on the
board and we'll just live with it okay
so is it going to be a turn if I have if
I have our a term in this relativistic
quantum field theory for let's say are
the electron mass I'm going to represent
the electron by a field you know this is
ian ibarra these things represent
relativistic quantum fields and I'm not
telling you what those are these are
functions of space they're complicated
things but this relativistic quantum
field call E and there's one called e
bar which is the anti particle job this
term exists in the Lagrangian ok this is
the floor the description of the Higgs
boson this is what Fineman would have
said but now we have a more modern
language and we have a thing called
lambda e ba e times the Higgs boson we
have a different coupling so this got
replaced by the modern world will have a
coupling lambda e bar e times Phi Phi
represents the Higgs boson but what
happens is that in the vacuum of the
world so if i write that in the quantum
state for the vacuum of the world and i
write Phi and I right back this thing is
not 0 it has a value which we call V so
that means that this field that's what
he meant by that there's this symmetry
breaking that this thigh field has a
nonzero vacuum expectation value I'll
tell you more about that what that means
if you want me to but when
happens then is that i plug this in here
this becomes lambda v e ba ii and the
mass of the electron is now lambda v so
that's the way it works okay that's the
way it works the mass of the electron
returns girls from a couplet from a bear
turn to a couple times the the vacuum
expectation value V but I should put a
little lamb to e here for the electron
okay now in the old days we had I had
the mass of the electron the mass of the
muon the mass of the towel or unknown
the mass of the top quark or unknown now
I have lambda electron V lambda mu V
lambda tau V lambda top V so now instead
of having no idea where these come from
I have no idea where these come from and
so when they talk about you know the
Higgs boson resolving the mystery of
mass I think that's oversold because I
just um it's true though that the
coupling of the hague's to the particle
after it takes its vacuum expectation
value is responsible for the mass but
finding the Higgs boson is not going to
change anything about our understanding
of what those masses are I don't need to
be so negative about it it's a great
triumph flesh to find the Higgs boson
yeah
that's a great question you know well
you know that's a very interesting
question you know from it depends on who
you are from with um uh you know I said
before there will be much more exciting
if the Higgs boson was not discovered
because then I a theorist would say look
we don't understand anything we have to
go to a bigger accelerator and you know
we need a more powerful machine and
that's so great because we can
understand it but now let's look at it
from the point of view of the
experimentalist you've gone to Congress
or well with we could talk about in
America what happened to the
superconducting supercollider but you've
gone to the world bodies and you've said
I need this machine to find the Higgs
boson and it's not there it's not great
and then the world the world who said I
want a new accelerator
where are the pulse of his set from the
experimental point of view you know not
finding the Higgs bosons disaster
because they set out to find that it
didn't show up so no that's the better
outcome it's it's a terrible outcome
from the point of view of the
experimental or so you know how you
phrase your argument depends on when you
said and so I think in a way you know
fight not finding the Higgs boson would
be turned around as a failure of the
detective the machine whereas I would
see it as a success because it would
have excluded them it would have meant
something's deadly wrong with the
standard model so depends on how you
frame it but you know there are many
other things going on in the universe
cosmologically that have bearing on
particle physics I mean most of you know
that when we look out in the universe we
only see we look at all the matter out
there only four percent of the observed
matter is made of this stuff this dark
matter and this dark energy the two
separate things right there's both dark
matter and dark energy that you know if
you look at the if you go out and you
look at distant stars and you say how
much matter is how much how much do I
see that's only a small fraction of the
matter the noticeable that's a fraction
of the matter that there is and in
addition there's dark energy and these
things probably have explanations in
particle physics so definitely the field
is continues to go on but I would say
that I I would be unhappy if from my
point of view if the LHC finds the Higgs
boson weighs 125 GeV yicky said there's
a big you know this the statistics is
significant enough to be conclusive and
nothing else is found it would be very
challenging for me to know what to do
that's one reason i work on quantum
computing because i like to work on more
than one thing and it's very interesting
for me to have another life there's
other things on
well I would have to say that you know
theoretical particle physics well you
know experimental particle physics is
already you have to have a very special
type of personality to want to enter a
3000 person collaboration and if they
get larger or it gets more complicated
there are sociological effects of that
certain people will just not go there I
mean certain people want to work on
experiments that are you know they can
control it all in a tabletop experiment
or in a small lab then I want to work on
a 3000 person collaboration so that
that's definitely something and um the
amount of time it takes to do these
experiments is very long and it could be
setbacks you know I mean I said that
they will find the Higgs presumably the
thing will be resolved in a year that's
assuming everything works you know maybe
there'll be another mishap and the thing
shuts down so um so from a theorem an
experimental point of view there are a
lot of challenges about going into this
field but people still going to it and
they very excited by it from a
theoretical point of view you know I
would have trouble really I would say
that if I were a young theorists now I
would concentrate on cosmology and
looking for hints about elementary
particle physics that come from a
cosmological observation because I think
this is just getting very slow and very
hard who paid for this okay so this is
totally paid for by Europe cernus
Jefferson this sits in a laboratory
concern cer n which stands for salt row
European pull a refresh nuclei or
something like that and that's there's a
consortium of European nations including
Germany France England who paid for a
but the United States has pays big bucks
for the detectors now and they're
they're a big United States groups
working at both Atlas and CMS and that's
funded by the Department of Energy so
and they pay both for the salaries of
people to work there and they pay for
some of the sort of some of the hardware
that goes into the detector the
detectives are big ticket items there
are billions of dollars those things I
showed you they cost billions and the
u.s. pays there but us did not pay for
the accelerator itself and the high in
higher and she physics in this country
accelerators this country's really
turned it or when stitt you know in the
there was a proposal to build a machine
which would have been more powerful than
the LHC called the superconducting super
collider was 50 miles around they
started to dig it in Texas the tunnels
for it and it was set to go and then for
a very complicated political reasons it
was killed this was in the mid 90s and
that would have been great had the
superconducting supercollider had built
all this would have been done years ago
it would be more powerful than the LHC
and it didn't happen and now if you look
in the United States Fermilab has shut
down as a high-energy it's run the
Tevatron which is the biggest ring of it
collides protons with antiprotons that's
been shut down and Stanford Linear
Accelerator Center is now not a particle
Labadie more to user facility where they
shoot down they use electrons they do
things to create booms of intense
photons which you used to study
materials so it's a user facility for
material science so this country has
turned its back on high energy physics
and you know we better really watch it
because they're starting to turn that
back on NASA to write all these
spacecraft things being unfunded and a
high-energy physics has a lot of trouble
defending itself we live in tough times
and it has real bearing on on scientific
funding so you guys have like this
problem seems like we're the
experimental evidence is explained by
the current model pretty well so it's
hard to have this like big miss
model and exactly that's what I'm
confessing to you yeah at this moment
assuming that that little signal grows
then i would say that um from my point
of view the field of high energy physics
is just getting confirmed again and you
know but you know depends on your
perspective it was really the late 70s
and early 80s that the standard model
was written down where people wrote down
the actual equations that describe the
strong the weak and the electromagnetic
force okay that's three out of four
forces in nature gravity is a little
different but that's pretty well taken
care of by the general theory of
relativity so we have the week
destroying the electromagnetic force we
have these particles the force carriers
are listed the photon the glue on the W
and the Z those are all force carriers
for those for the week the
electromagnetic and strong forces now
that theory was written down with three
parameters in it lambda e lambda mu
lambda tau lambda top all these free
parameters relating to the masses and
there are a few other three parameters
which then get measured and if you then
take you take the experiments that allow
you to determine the parameters then you
look at another experiments at determine
the parameters I'm going to predict
another experiment okay everything works
perfectly there's never been a violation
of a prediction made by the standard
model since it's been developed so since
the early 80s which is you know thirty
years we the standard model has been
raining perfectly it has no it's ever
been contradicted and this will continue
in this vein it's a kind of a strange
place to be you know we were very very
successful in elementary particle
physics incredibly successful but on the
other hand even though we're successful
we laughs deep understanding of certain
things like we don't understand the
disparity of NASA's they just don't put
parameters and that's really
unsatisfying so most of us believe no I
shouldn't say that because there are
people who believe in the multiverse and
people who believed in the multiverse
think that there are other universes
where these parameters or just have
different values so but I don't believe
that you know but it so some people some
people believe that this is the end of
the line for
physics needs a random numbers and they
have about as much X you can understand
them about as much as well as you can
understand the earth to moon distance
you know what's the earth to moon
distance I don't know it's what it is
what can you write down an equation that
gives it no it's just some rock that
ended up a certain distance from us
right Kennex not here yeah the tropics
so then he's saying does the anthropic
principle you know we should ask
yourself suppose I have the mass of the
top quark which suddenly you know the
universe or the world around us look
different I don't see how so yes okay I
had you oh oh when I say Dark Matter
can't be seen yeah we're dark matter it
can't not be seen I mean assuming that
it has some interaction when we say it's
dark it means it's not interacting
electromagnetically it's not glowing but
that doesn't mean that it doesn't have
any interactions so dark matter is stuff
that is known to be out there but it
doesn't have it may it may interact with
another yet to be determined force or it
may interact with these forces but have
very weak charges so that the
interactions are extremely weak and it's
possible that the LHC could make a
particle which could then turn out to be
the dark matter but it doesn't dark
doesn't mean it has it had zero
interaction if doc except gravitational
because everything that weighs something
or even if it doesn't anything with
energy gravitates so if you had sterile
particles meaning they have zero
interaction other than their
gravitational interaction they would be
very hard to determine find and it would
not be produced at the LHC so where I'm
assuming that dark matter is not a
hundred percent sterile it has some weak
interaction I don't mean we can the
technicals not in that sense but some
you know not strong interaction i mean i
don't know not strong in that sense you
know what's the word
tiny interaction it's possible yeah yeah
yeah I'll be boring yeah well yeah so
for example if Dark Matter turned out to
if there's another force and that you
know and and you know that yet to be
discovered which it lets to interact
with stuff that would be very very good
another force but I wouldn't finish my
thought before about the success of the
standard model so you know since the
eighties till now we have this amazing
thing where everything works but their
mysteries and people are very frustrated
because they say particle physics is
making progress well it depends on how
you look at it right if you look go 300
years in the future and say look in the
1980s you know in the 1920s they
developed quantum mechanics in the
1980's the they wrote down the full
theory of the interaction of elementary
particles it wasn't till you know 2029
until somebody figured out what the mask
pattern is you know is that slow
progress and that it depends on how you
look at it these are some of the hardest
questions in all of science and you know
just because we haven't broken them down
since the 80s I don't think means that
theoretical particle physics is done but
I think it's really hard yeah yeah oh
well each one is different the electron
like I said it's stable because of the
reason I said that for example like a
top quark will decay to a bottom quark
and a towel and a neutrino they decay
two things lighter there are these decay
chains Oh
um what yeah I guess it's just a name
when I say a fundamental particle I
guess it's fundamental because doesn't
look like it's there's anything inside
of it would that mean I don't know how
we're going to define fundamental I mean
it's a proton fundamental it's made of
quarks so probably would say it's me
these things don't seem to be made of
anything well not while I could tell you
for that it's pretty interesting we know
there's not another neutrino I can tell
you how we know that the way we know
that is this you see when when particles
are decay when particles are if a
particle can decay that means it has a
certain lifetime and that means that
there's actually an uncertainty in its
mass there's a thing called them at the
time energy uncertainty principle which
says that if there's an uncertainty in
Hell in I say this yeah it turns out
there's a principle in quantum mechanics
that essentially tells us that if
something has a lifetime which is not 0
so it has a width it has a decay it has
a lifetime that's not zero that its mast
is not certain and maybe I can make well
I know if this is going to help but it's
sort of interesting so if i look at the
if I if I want the Z boson likes to
decay to neutrinos the Z boson it likes
to decay to a neutrino and an
anti-neutrino likes to do that and it
likes to decay to all that it can the
electron one that goes to the mule one
and it goes to the towel one it likes to
decay but it against other stuff too and
you can edit and and you can make Z
bosons by colliding together electrons
and positrons so you can there are
colliders where you make the bosons and
as a function of the energy you can
count you can see this is this is energy
and this is sort of the number of Z
bosons I make as a function of the beam
energy in the collision and
is what happens is this the the
production cross-section pinks at a
value here which we call the mass of the
Z in other words you tune these beams
and the electron and positron come
together but when their energy total
energy is exactly the mass of the Z
suddenly we start making a lot of Z's
okay but if the Energy's off you don't
but it's not perfect as a whip to this
because if you're a little bit of them
the central values still make them but
you make less and this is called the
width of that gamma the width of the
particle in terms of making it
energetically but that width is
determined by its lifetime that with
goes is determined by its lifetime so
the faster that particle decays the more
narrow it's with oh no don't get that
backwards yeah Mon yeah yeah yeah so
what that means is that by looking if if
the neutrino decayed to another type
there was a net excuse me if the Z if
there's another neutrino odd and it
decayed to that that would change the
width and so you can actually count the
number of neutrinos by looking at the
caves of the Z boson and where they
count the number of neutrinos they get
like three point 0 plus or minus point
you know 001 something like that so you
can actually infer that there are no
other neutrinos and there are other
experiments cosmological experiments so
you could be sure there are no other
light neutrinos so if there are no other
light neutrinos then you know it makes
you wonder well if there's no other
light retreat over give me more of these
jobs and then I could talk about other
evidence for why there aren't more of
these things but it really looks like
they're just three generations yeah
oh that's a good question you know
recently Fermilab just went and looked
at its old data and decided they had a
little signal maybe for the Higgs boson
or out 125 GeV there does you know this
is it's a great question i mean how do
you when i talked about that before when
you collide these particles together and
you have the shower of data right and
you're triggering it so you may be
throwing out stuff so you're only
harvest what you choose to read to tape
they call it now if somebody very clever
one day says you know let's go back to
that old data and let's reanalyze it
let's plot X versus Y purse where no one
had thought of it before maybe a new
discovery will be made a public wouldn't
help you in other words i'm sure you
could have you know having access to
this data would be very unhelpful
because it's so complicated the way it's
Bend and you have to take into account
all kinds of things like the acceptance
of the detector you know if you plotted
the angular distribution of what's
coming out that's not the true angular
distribution because the detector may be
more efficient at certain angles may
have a it may have a structural element
blocking something at 23 degrees so you
know the data is pretty meaningless
unless you're totally immersed in the
experiment so you know I think if you
talk to someone in the experimental
collaboration and you had a good idea
then um you know they would help you
analyze it but I think if you had access
to the raw data I can't imagine it would
help you it was just I can't imagine
yeah
absolutely what the proton decay oh well
look well first of all the proton is the
lightest particle made which may it's
made of three quarks and if a quark
scary out a quantum number called
quickness let's say and so if the proton
and quarks are always bound together to
make things so if the proton decayed it
decanter Kate there's no other object
lighter than it that has a net quark
number which is not zero so if the
proton decayed its core it's quoc number
would disappear and that means that
there will be a conservation law would
be violated they'll be like as big as an
electric charge were violated so it'd be
HUGE if but there are theories where
people talk about proton decay it would
be very interesting if the proton decade
but you know the proton lifetime people
believe this is a great story because
you know people are will convince
themselves that the proton had a
lifetime of around 10 to the 30 years
now Tim to the 30 years is much longer
than the age of the universe so you can
ask yourself also that lives along the
edge of the universe how am I going to
see that well you can see that if you
have a lot of protons because if I tell
you that the lifetime is 10 to the 30
years that means if you have one proton
here the chance is a 10 to the minus 30
it will decay in the next year a
lifetime 10 to 30 does it mean it rates
10 to the 30 years it means that in the
next year there's a probability of 10 to
the minus 30 it will decay so if you put
Avogadro's number of protons Avogadro
numbers 10 to the 23 so if you ate so if
you take together if you have 10 to the
7 proton if you have from 10 to the 7
moles of something whatever it's called
you can get you can get a lot of protons
together so people built vast
underground detectors we're filled with
material and they rated to see proton
decay because once you had a big enough
volume of stuff you can look for proton
decay and they went deep on the
to do this because they wanted to be
shielded from cosmic rays so there were
these amazing underground caverns where
people have built giant detectors with
filled with fluids and they with and
around it or detector up stuff and they
wait for a proton decay when the perfect
indicates they would see it they never
saw that the lifetime of the proton is
now I think 10 to the 34 years
experimentally at least at least ten to
thirty four years experimental II but
those detectors deep on the ground they
saw so neutrinos from a supernova
explosion because in 1987 there was a
supernova that went off and when the
supernova went off it shot neutrinos out
and those neutrinos were detected deep
underground so suddenly had this deep
underground detector seeing a supernova
going off on the far side of the galaxy
so sometimes you never know what you're
going to find but um yeah the proton is
stable at least his lifetime is I think
ten to thirty four years you seem to
know no no I'm saying I at least meaning
we've never seen one hey yeah we know
we've never seen one no no we've never
seen one okay never seen a proton tell
you yeah going back to see
it takes boson was discovered what its
impact would be on Maxwell equations
nothing Maxwell's equations are
contained in the standard model math and
also the relativistic quantum field
theory version of Maxwell's equations I
mean such as Maxwell's equations of
classical equations but we have but the
bachelors equations are consistent with
relativity and quantum mechanics so the
relativistic form of Maxwell excuse me
the quantum mechanical Maxwell's
equations already relativistic I
misspoke the quantum mechanical form of
Maxwell's equations is part of the
standard model and that would be
unchanged yeah oh yeah no no no no dark
energy and Dark Matter don't seem to fit
there is no good explanation for dark
matter and dark energy now and I think
that that's the great one of the great
questions if you said what would I work
on that's what I would work on try to
understand dark energy and Dark Matter
but you have to have ideas yeah what
engineering things might these be used
for to be useful like if we found a to
us on what could we make nothing you
know what can I tell you there we say
that you know the world wide web was
invented at CERN right you know guys who
you know that's how the world wide web
was invented bites people try to commit
you'll get to computers at CERN to
communicate but you know that's a that's
a spin oh fudge pie stop in that one
more question i'll stop okay tie up the
time back into the the question that
isn't wasn't voted up do you think the
time travelers are going to 7,000 LHC
again oh you have aside the time travels
yeah yeah maybe the time Chavez will
stop next time I'll talk about time
travel
