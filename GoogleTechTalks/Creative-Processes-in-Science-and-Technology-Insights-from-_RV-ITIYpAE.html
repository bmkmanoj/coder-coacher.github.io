more interesting to me at least he's
also an artist and he's going to talk
about creativity and art and science and
looking forward to it okay thank you
Yanks head okay so
middle of filming
so what I want to do is basically the
domain domain that one would call
science technology they overlap and art
and what I want to do if I should I stay
here I presume okay that's that's good
so I presume you have discussed like a
million times in here okay but this is
my own little list and I haven't done an
extensive study on the catalog let's say
of universities on how many things you
could do in nineteen forty fifty sixty
it will be an interesting exercise but
there is no question that the range of
things that you can do is increase in
prolly exponentially fast and the list
of professions but at the same time if
that's bullet number one is sort of
contradictory with bullet number two
because bullet number two more less
tells you that some of the most
interesting stuff going on there happens
at intersections between boundaries so
part of the motivation for me doing what
I'm doing is because I think that there
is a mead given the how by furcation of
things are taking place to help organize
thoughts on how people could navigate
these intersections so what I'm going to
try to tell you is some pretty broad
SEPs about in good ways to facilitate
this exploration of the in-between
spaces okay now this has been going on
forever I mean if you want to see in a
written form something that encapsulate
all three domains you have nothing more
to go and look at the in la biblioteca
embrace iana in Milan look at the Vinci
the Codex atlanticus it's it's all in
there and and then there are people who
have talked lysippos know about the two
cultures between science and art and I
was trying to articulate something in
this area about what should sort of be
my my mission in here and I came across
this this is the title of a journal
called transformation and the sort of
manifesto behind this journal goes that
I'm taking this verbatim and live in
lower case where it was lower case the
dots trying to cop it as faithfully as
possible so the goal of this journal
transformation was that art science and
technology are interacting components of
the total human enterprise but today we
are often treated as they were cultural
isolates and mutually antagonistic
transformation will cut across the art
and science by treating them as a
continuum now the interesting thing that
he was in 1950 and the guy Harry
Holtzman who actually had a long life he
did this 1950 and he died in 87 this
attempt to do this blurring guided tour
of this area it lasted for only three
issues so there are only three shows of
this journal but look at the people that
invited this is a random list of people
who contributed to those for free
i'm pretty sure that many of you
recognize seventy percent 80 prolly
Oliver okay they were a few misses but
this was in 1850 was not a given that
all of these people will be so famous
today so I'm going to live basically
curry Holtzman didn't have a really
distinguished career his main claim to
fame is the guy who organized the trip
opiate mondrian from Europe to the US
got the visa got an apartment for him
that what was he did okay so so this is
my object is a little bit how to
navigate this landscape and I had a
series of slides at the beginning that
there were no covers of nature and
scientific american and fishing that's
stuff that i have done and all the
paintings that you saw very stuff that I
have done starting pretty early when I
was 15 or 16 so it's not that I will say
I'm the best person to talk about the
three things but I see when I took with
people who are in the art sort of middle
of the Gaussian in the art help
misconceptions they have about the
technology side so I mean here to do a
kind of systems view office and I will
kind of refer backwards a little bit i'm
not going to refer backwards well I
refer something from the 13th century
but most of my reference will be Anna
eighteen ninety nineteen seventy kind of
things so i will tell you that i have
some reservations about these i'll drop
some comments about math and this is gh
Hardy probably one of the greatest
mathematicians of the 20th century and
he said that there is no score more
profound or on the whole more
justifiable that that of a man there are
several quotes that contain the were men
in what I'm doing okay they are all that
that of a man who make for the man for
the men who explained
you just exposition criticism
appreciation is work for second-rate
minds so it's not that I believe that
that's true but I have some degree of
apprehension in coming and explaining
things because at the end of the day
this is explaining although every
concept of what I'm about to tell you I
haven't really copied it from any place
they are my own ideas ok so the central
concept that i will have is and behind
this is kind of like the outline of a
book in some sense ok the book will be a
conventional book in the sense that
there will be chapter that will be the
main notes but then there are kind of
secondary nodes of which I'm putting
about furthering here these are things
in which you will look across on how the
three domains are and then i will look
at several of these i prolly will skip
several of them and at the end try to
distill some lessons and the lessons
that ugly still will go more or less
flow from art two science and technology
ok so this is part of this table in this
table i'll pick something like this and
then try to expose that so the central
aspiration of art is creation I'm
simplifying this has to be one word
technology is invention science is
discovery just to get the terms out
Hamlin was created the light bulb was
invented the DNA was discovered and if
you want to put to words to define each
other things i would say science is
explaining an unveiling you lift avail
and you reveal something that was
already there technology is making am
building art say creating an expression
but I know of no artist that will tell
you that what they do is creation okay
is a given so a word that probably will
be more
up for at least many of them will be
reframing that they force you to look at
something in some different way so let
me start with a few comments about the
outside is kind of like a random world
for for people who not maybe in this
sphere constantly so this is director
famous French sorry german artist I
think what is interesting is the same
guy who did the thing on the left was
able to do the thing on the right and
the right is also a painting is not a
photograph then you have and some
different gigantic installations this is
one of them this is one of his paintings
then you go to people i def cons in
which art is more like the head of a
factory and you may have seen things by
him then you have a guy who is almost
trying to change the equation of artists
dealer damien hirst english did also
they think that you may have seen on the
nose all of the stuff in there are
diamonds and then you see things like
this this is a colleague of mine Michael
Rock of it and this is a museum so it
must be art by definition but actually
if you see this inside this is what that
is inside there is a homeless person so
the fact that art should not be useful
this kind of a sort of easy counterpoint
to that now if you are coming from the
side of art and I have to explain math
to you i would use prolly this quote
many of you will know this guy feels
medalist is in the advanced analysis my
attitude towards math is that most of it
is lying out there sometimes in hidden
places like gems in case in a rock you
don't see them on the surface but you
see that it must be there and you try to
imagine were they are hidden
suddenly they gleamed brightly in your
face and you don't know how you stumble
upon them maybe they were always in
plain view and we were all blind from
time to time and i would say half of the
mathematicians out there they sort of
subscribe to this plateau nice take vo
and i think prolly in theoretical
computer science you'll find kind of
similar type of sentiments but the same
the same idea applies this is a much
shorter quote from Michelangelo the
marble not yet car can hold the form of
every thought the greatest artists task
and even extends to literature in which
a according to people I Jorge Luis
Borges from very fantastic writer from
Argentina is one of my favorite ones I'm
from there by the way here you that the
act of writing was actually discovering
not invention and by the way is
mathematics invented or discovered or
created it's so it's not so as to age
this is the simplest one you can argue
that art is as old as humanity itself
this is the Lascaux paintings or caves
technology well the Romans will build in
aqua dogs before the loss of statics
were in place or they dome in the
Pantheon in Rome before all the science
was there by the system that science is
kind of a baby because it's prolly about
500 years old if you have to signal the
birth with Galileo the methodology in
science there is a method but I would
say that they the biggest discovery of
science is science itself there is a
misconception that the scientific method
if you go on us there governs the growth
of science I mean governs atmo
post the growth of experimental science
the way that one goes about science on
the theoretical sphere is by induction
and I have this again a quote from Jacob
bronowsky having et ideas anticipating
things in which there was no grounds to
believe that that will be the case
technology is driven by results if there
is science you reach the sciences are
gaps you'll have to fill the gaps and in
art they know prescribe method now how
do ideas get incorporated into a domain
a domain by the way and these terms come
from people in sociology domain is all
they distill knowledge that exists in
the form of books papers subjects
objects that kind of thing the domain
will exist if all human beings were
wiped out of the earth the field are the
people who practice in that domain a
domain be lets say algebraic topology or
condensed matter physics or etchings in
inert the field is what decides if
something gets incorporated into the
domain and the idea gets incorporated
when something at the intersection of
the person or group they domain than the
field determines that the domain should
grow okay an example of a domain growing
this was a mosaic in higher Sofia in
Istanbul 13th century with in what
looked like a blink of an eye giotto
appeared this basically Giotto was the
first artist basically known by his own
name before that didn't happen and this
guy was the first one who painted sky
blue and basically you could say if the
guy who discovered depth everything was
flat okay so i would say that alter the
domain of painting or visual arts so
a domain will grow basically in two ways
either you discover an answer to a
problem that was already formulated
physics math is are the fields were they
are the most formulated problem
everybody knows what the question is
people do not know what the solution is
or can grow by discovering a problem in
which case posing the question is as
important as finding the solution but
that's basically how domains grow in
order for the men to grow and I put
problem breakthrough i put break with it
because in order for the new idea to
form part of the accepted set of ideas
you may have to break with something
that was part of the domain so in art
the field will grow because the guys in
the Tate Modern decide that something
belongs there or in the moment New York
or a more local example at the Art
Institute of Chicago in science you know
that you have made it when you will get
inducted into the National Academy of
Science what you have done is part of
the domain okay but the domain is full
of final pictures when you get a paper
young it all the grass of every with the
paper you get objects in there and in
science the those objects and the
linkage in between those objects is
traceable in some sense you look at who
refer to homeworld ideas came from in
technology is documentable to the
extended linkage of patents in art it
sounds magical because suddenly out
there appears but is in fact probably
the most traceable so in literature
theater opera architecture you see final
pictures also in scientific papers in
products you so you don't see the sweat
in visual art my I would argue that is
the one in which you see revolution
the most clearly and in fact that what
museums do so I pick this example
because I was there about two weeks ago
is in the Madrid at the reina sofia
museum and this is one early sketch by
gernika from Picasso and this is one
picture when because I was doing this
his mistress was a woman of named dora
maar and dora took photographs of the
painting as it was evolving and this
another thing and this is the final one
and with picasso because who did 43
sketches of these and remarkably all
survived in visual art that matters a
lot no one is interesting every draft of
a paper but in visual art everybody
centers in every draft that led to the
final picture so now people with argue
and I will touch this briefly later on
that in in very logical subjects like
math you could trace Hannity evolve
that's really not knowing much about
math because Sharon they know Gotham Art
who wrote a lot about this I wrote about
the psychology of mathematical invention
Gauss and women for example you can
return him from beginning to end and
everything is perfect and the conclusion
is something that you have to accept but
there is no trace of the path that they
used to lead to the inspiration of why
they did what they did Helmholtz have
the metaphor of how you go achieving a
final result in a very tentative way
going through a shaky ladder but when
you're out there and finally you nail it
you presented us the smooth royal path
beating Stein had another one much
shorter and he said is about kicking the
ladder or the quote that I really like
is this one by Einstein the secret to
creativity is knowing how to hide your
sources and in fact is not that you try
to hide it is that when you present a
result in a paper no one is interesting
how everything occur to you you
try to put it in the most clean concise
elegant way now sometimes is better not
to hide now Maxwell who is now regarded
as the purest of the pure among physics
when he was arguing about why was
pointless to try to calculate the
trajectories of an algal rose number of
particles if you go and read his
collected works the arguments that he
was using for why it will make sense to
argue in terms of averages and the
constancy of averages he was picking all
the stuff from this guy catlett who was
trying to do one of the main had many
attempts to put social interactions on
par with Newtonian mechanics the ones
who may be interested in this is in this
this paper by Philip ball now there is a
sequence to technology and this is one
of many but the sequin is is not like
this first of all in art I when I show
you pick a song gurnick and I could have
shown like 50 other examples is one
person sometimes a curator of an exhibit
will mesh to go ghana and bangkok
technology I don't have to tell you this
is much more cup caster there are lots
of big interruptions in there lots of
people and right and left but eventually
sort of macroscopically you see the
evolution as well now as to how things
go basically they are two ways in which
will grow either two ideas get combined
or more to form a new one or an idea
bifurcates and produce two different
ones and by that I mean that you start
with a concept like we have uncovered
how DNA can unfold and do this and that
and then you study consequences or you
can estella consequences from there many
of them but the thing is that there was
a convergence to get to a final digital
picture on the theory side or some
fundamental experimental thing and that
led to this wealth of
divergence of ideas now i'm not going to
go all of these but i'm sure showing you
some of the things that will be worth
exploring in parallel and by now one
conclusion that you'll get is i put art
technology and science and by any metric
that i have looked at technology always
falls in between science and art almost
always for example how the ideas evolve
they chronology the possibility of time
or during events for example if i show
you this in art and I ask you put all of
his paintings the second Vince kiss on a
leash a this a guy named listening I'm
trying to remembering here boy I'm
blanking out fenninger is probably least
known guy Chuck Close is a woman in the
middle if I asked you to time order
these days another one by another guy I
will not tell you the names another one
put them in order it's very very hard
unless you really know about that you
can be very bright but but just by
asking questions you'll not be able to
do that however if you are coming from
outer space here and I ask you order
these papers from these random journals
put them in kind some kind of order in
science you can time order things but in
no inherent our time in art something
that I also should mention is the
uniqueness of a product because this is
what gives rise to a lot of
misconceptions around give you one art
generally we can argue that another
Shakespeare had not lived we will not
have Hamlet in fact can't made a
comparison in between how much
creativity was inherent in the world
that Newton had done and compare that
with homer and put artistic creation in
much higher plane and this is something
that is still persists to today in fact
in this quote bernard cohen was a
professor in in harvard he said this
which is still a misconception I don't
agree with this I think that they style
in a way that they fear you get put
together but that has to do with a the
uniqueness of the product I think the
uniqueness certainly in on the science
side on how something gets manifested
and put together something that I will
tell you about what where is the
creative skill i mentioned this because
i mentioned in here all the intellectual
protection something that gas and get
mentioned but inside the intellectual
protection is basically you put it in
the open so science was open source
before the time open source was invented
really but i wanted to make this brief
deterring here or renaissance drawings
so this is an el prado I was as I said
mentioned two weeks ago and this is
another one this is by a fellow named
Tom term on Italian and primo pensieri
means the first thought okay the first
thought was what was the most prices
kill in Renaissance paintings because
based on these four thought there was
something that involved in that they
will call in lasagna in fact this may be
one of the first uses of the work design
based on these put in some grid on top
of ease in what eventually will result
on and
altarpiece will be finally put together
the Primo pensieri and finally the
design had legal force it was basically
like the patent protecting the design of
that thing and that was the most pricey
skill at that time which is not the most
crisis till now in how we judge
Renaissance paintings pipelines again
I'm not going to go into much detail on
these but the pipeline for science is
extremely well developed they are
virtually no Outsiders in science now
there could be they used to be more in
the 1800 troll format was not trained as
mathematician let's say technology the
pipeline is much more or less formal and
in art is very informal in art you could
argue that there are lots of outsiders
there is no place that says oh you're an
artist now you could be trained as one
but that doesn't mean that you'll become
and the other thing that the is an
equilibrium is in between the field and
the domain in fields that are
well-constructed like critical physics
they claim that someone could make as to
what constitutes a new thing in the
field is though is dominated by the
field itself however we skip this even
the complete outsider but when we say
for example that van GOG was
unrecognized a lifetime or that this guy
william-adolphe bouguereau who was the
french in the 19th century they were
fond of making surveys and statistics
and this guy who live at the time of the
guy goes by a claim of the critics of
the time at that point the most famous
painter of a time
and not we don't really I don't know if
any of you know him but it is not really
central figure now so what we basically
are saying is that by the way there's
something really interesting as a
sideline held reputations change after
death so for example reputations in math
and physics don't change much after that
I mean you can you can say that someone
has been unrecognized and suddenly after
all no Galois died we discovered what he
had done but those are in a blue moon in
art since the field is so important
compared with the domain you have very
big swift changes in reputation so for
example this guy tableau murata was the
most famous painter one that mean he was
alive it's kind of not nowhere to be
seen now passarelli who was the painting
of very geometric that I show when I
said about an ordering it basically not
regarded as one of the guys will within
the pantheon of great artists these some
minor switches in littell physics potion
door was the editor of the another of
the physique let's say when Einstein was
publishing and they power that he had
resided on the power that he had on
deciding what was going to be in there
but the guy's not anywhere in the
pantheon of great this is it now so what
we say when they be filled in the
overriding judgment over the domain we
basically sometimes overwrite the
judgment a posteriori so for example
reputations are revised in art sort of
constantly new people get elevated and
people get diminish that doesn't happen
on the science and certainly doesn't
happen on the technology side which is
technologies the closest that it comes
to a complete meritocracy because the
field is everything out there
so definitions of lines of mentorship
well in science is very clear it who
advises home the inert is very informal
they think I'm doing a study now this is
on the side with one of my students the
most complete genealogy out there of
lines of mentorship is in math and in
there you see that Euler sort of advice
Lagrange a Lagrange for en persona and
pasanda rich late and live sheets and
you go on and on and a question is are
there path in there were everybody great
good greatness emerged from some place
where people are not advised by great
luminaries so we are looking at this now
another one is the possibility of
one-hit wonders they are very the very
low probability now of hitting one big
thing in science prolly in math maybe
once technology moderate art is very low
in visual arts no painter is no by one
painting but in literature there are
many people who fall in the cattle of
the one book wonder and the Nationals so
one conclusion is that if you look at
the degree of entrepreneurship the
ability to fly without a net for a while
art you could argue the most
enterpreneur 'i'll of the three
activities because the pipeline is is
not very supportive clearly there is no
money until you hit the end it but and
something that kind of cuts across this
is a quote of a quote but it's something
that applies to art and applies to
science a lot so this guy were referring
to something that someone had told this
person
never forget what I believe was of self
to you by college that every great
writer great an original writer in
proportion as his great and original
masked himself created taste by which
his relish if you don't do that the
ideas will never form part of this
partner in the main you have to make
sure that that the the domain is ready
to accept this new thing and this in art
with people take the long view and hold
him Boris in here the fact is that all
writers create their precursors their
work modifies our conception of the past
justice is bound to modify the future
when your form part of the Canon the
fact that you get inserted in there
doesn't modify the forward part it
modifies the backward part as well
environment and timing fitting with a
canonical knowledge of the times I'll
give you something which is my own thing
and this is one example there are many
many examples but I just tell you this
because if I found this really
interesting if you study physics or
engineering you came across this guy
Reynolds is the one of the Reynolds
number brenell's within a year wrote two
things that had to do with kind of
mixing one that was completely
statistical that gave birth to
everything connected with a statistical
theory of turbulence in which at some
point in the development of things
people will write our God icity will be
part of this all those is homogeneous
isotropic turbulence something in which
no pattern could or should exist okay
the other one was completely geometrical
this when he presented in a meeting of
the Royal Institution appear in nature i
bump into this completely by accident
when I get stuck I used to go and look
at all
stacks of nature just to get inspiration
I discovered by the way that Reynolds
had died and they were the obituaries in
consecutive issues of nature at the same
time of pointer and pointer a was this
long long story here and if pointer Ian
Reynolds have connected something could
have click but the fact is that the math
was not ready for the geometrical
picture it was sort of semi already
because he didn't need that much
groundbreaking math to do the
statistical theory so when i came across
here i discovered that there was this
guy Stephen Ismail in Berkeley who have
created a picture that was the smell
horseshoe and the math was ready for me
to use and within oh no six months I was
in the cover of Scientific American and
nature and I got lucky but going through
the other branch and this is what
mystified me when I was doing my PhD
thesis there were 80 years of mixing
without pictures in journals it was
because of a quote that appears in there
because they what and train the point
that I'm trying to get across in here an
idea has to fit the canonical knowledge
of the times and for that to take root
besides the physical picture you need
the appropriate support in math and if
you don't have that then the idea will
not flourish groups I'm going to save
really level groups group sometimes get
formed the Futurist in Italy they try to
form a group from in a blast a very
famous group in art one that had
tremendous influence given the fact that
they lasted for only 14 years was the
Bauhaus so I give you a and to what
extent ideas can emerge from groups I'm
not going to go into much detail about
this you probably heard about the
law that the courier transfers were not
developed by Fourier and lagrange
Lagrangian method in fluid mechanic was
not done by lagrange that almost every
his ms named okay so this is sticklers
law that no scientific discoveries named
after the original Discoverer and this
applies to steal of law also because
this was he going by a guy named Robert
Merton but on on teams a they see lot of
work and I'll tell you this because it
came from my own institution a very easy
to study teams were there is a clear
outcome are to the result and got the
team boss so one of them and this is an
old like a footnote here a clear small
team producing something is Broadway
musicals you need about five people to
produce a Broadway musical producer
Liberty stay whatever and and then you
have the outcome how successful the play
was so these guys look at this and the
conclusion one was not that interesting
you needed a mix of people the second
one was much more interesting that we
mention it in here you had to have to
experience people but these two
experienced people it was best if they
have not collaborated with each other
before the longer the team try to repeat
past successes the impact diminish so
let me now go to the ending here I'll
give you a few i would say cross-cutting
lessons this is mostly from the art side
held a if you want rigor the art as a
metaphor for the lesson most of these
will be things that you know so the
first one is start with a solid
grounding no way around this one okay
and equate creation with hard work so
here we have someone who started
classically trained did this then did
this and this was picasa so picasso
started very classically trained this
other guy started here and then this was
william de Koning and i think that this
is a really important lesson in my
opinion and this is phrase in Italian I
do not know who said it first okay is in
peril arte a mattila de parte and this
says learn the craft and then set it
aside because if you become a slave of a
craft you'll never do anything no now as
to the hard part and the productivity
let me just flash some numbers Leonardo
7 disputed paintings is the record for
someone who is recognizing visual arts
with the least number of paintings
Vermeer very few 36 Rembrandt 630 van
Gaal 920 half years Picasso 13,000 now
learn how to thrive with constraints
I'll mention something here is not from
the art but it's something that I'm
close because something that we have
done is an HIV diagnostic kit so in
order to make a diagnostic kit for HIV
you need I know red blood cells you need
to break them apart you need to collect
the DNA you get the to get the junk out
then you need to put the clean DNA in an
appropriate chamber with an appropriate
solution and then you run a PCR reaction
so involves a lot of fluid handling okay
but the idea here was that this kid had
to be used in Africa it couldn't be
fancy microfluidics so someone made a
decision early on say let's try to do
this without moving fluid sounds
like is no way on earth that you'll be
able to do it but the solution was put
these cells break them by having
appropriate solution have the DNA
strands collect on the surface of taylor
particles all of these will be an eco
solution on top of that is an escomm
attic there will be an oily solution and
then drag the particles because they are
magnetic through the oily solution to
the where it says fluid three what the
reaction will take place and so this is
sample the parties are magnetic moved
apart of smoke and then you write the
reaction there and voila instead of
using micro fluidics and a symmetric and
all of that you can do this for one
dollar and the result of this was to put
a constraint into the problem that made
the solution almost impossible learn how
to adapt ok this is Picasso and you can
see how he did this this is a piece
called baboon and yang is in the moment
New York and these terms and adapt and
adopt okay but I think this applies to a
lot of things certainly applies in
technology okay there's a very big
difference between copying and outright
stealing stealing you kind of the idea
becomes part of a bigger idea that you
have do not converge to quickly and step
back and look at the entire picture
there are many solutions that are
arrived and it kind of place to look did
I get the right one when you think are
at the end and this is a very good
example this is a Picasso painting is in
they are in still in Chicago the story
is that a fellow who owned the painting
was visiting Picasso in in his studio in
France and mentioned that he had these
and because I said oh well that's
interesting when I was thinking about
the painting
initially I had something else in mind
and at the last moment I decided to
change the painting I have a man on the
left that was holding a fish and the
baby was trying to touch the finish by
the way if you want the piece missing
I'll give it to you and they are
Institute has it now this idea that you
arrive at something you step back look
and decide if that's what you wanted and
change it is not something that gets
done all the time but it's something
that in my opinion is essential and let
me just finish with what I think is the
most important lesson and you almost
have to train yourself to do this and is
the sea simplicity in complexity see go
from something simple to something with
all the flesh and bones needed and from
something complex go to something simple
so I'm going to go Picasso s again the
person that I use so I go in a sequence
through what is 11 stages of a
lithograph 1 2 3 this is the final one
the interesting thing I flash them very
quickly for you to look at the dates the
interesting thing is Picasso did it in
this order this was a first second third
and this was the last and it's only when
you're here is that you can understand
for example what it means when he put
the handlebars and a bicycle seat
together and he called the head of a
ball just that in isolation means
nothing ok so what I wanted to live with
you if you don't come from the artistic
side of things is art is a constant
search for breaking paradigms there is
no price for doing something second
okay science and within are you this
match even though I believe that things
have the stump of the person who created
a theory and i will use they were
created although for example that
stretching and folding thing that i
mentioned that i was involved with
that's more like discovered that that
was there all the time all what i did
was to reveal it that he was in there
and make it clear for others to see
technology is not inevitable there are
lots of dead branches in the three of
evolution of technology science by the
way has very few the branches the front
branch doesn't work he just gets chopped
off the tree of art has lots of parallel
simultaneous branches many of which
survive even though they may have not
led anywhere and the other one is
technology is more like art and probably
the thing that i want to leave you with
is that if you look at most matrix that
you can think of i show a few in what
this door day like this sort of
secondary nodes in this kind of book by
almost every metric technology sort of
falls in between the art and the science
component so that's all that i have
prepared and i will be very happy to
answer any questions that you may have
thanks
okay so there if you there are a few
things that don't fall in the three
categories for example architecture will
fall in all three a mass is a
singularity doesn't fall in any one of
these I think the sign kind of falls in
all three in some way a design still is
a subject were they filled dominates the
domain still and will continue to be
like that until some parts of the domain
get more formalized that may be the end
of the sign as we know it because too
much formalism is is good to create more
people to flock people flock to problems
once at least in science when things are
more defined but the more defined they
are the more carbon copies of people in
the field you create and the more the
creativity diminish sometimes until
there's an explosion so i would say
design false in all three but i think
the challenge in design is that some
parts need more definition they have to
become more like a some part of the sign
is a little be like performance art
someone comes as something if a person
dies they know it to hand those lessons
to another people so i think that there
should be some equilibrium on the
ability to hunt lessons but not to the
point that you fossilize everything but
my my my attitude is that belongs in
parts of all three domains yeah
yeah yeah science science now he's done
really gigantic ropes and i'm not
talking about particle physics which has
a couple of weeks we got two of these d
oesn't earth stimulus money is 19
million bucks each the smallest one
involves 12 people the other one is 25
so there are parts of science especially
social science or humanities are I would
say is the last enclaves of single gorg
but engineering is full of big groups
now biologists full of big groups and
let's face it some of the and part of
the argument for doing this these
problems that we have to tackle now will
require such a blend of talents that
having some degree of appreciation on
how the other domains work in my opinion
will become a must yeah
well I give you one two things because I
have thought about this on I meet with a
PhD student in northwestern they are
organized which is great because it's
there are about close to 900 and I get
to see light 200 in one shot and I see
all of those brains but all of these
brains are fully occupied working on a
PhD thesis and I know these brains have
capacity to do other things but the
major constraint is how the NIH or do II
allows them to deviate from that path so
that that problem will be an easy one to
solve a the one that is a harder to
solve and it has to happen on an
individual basis on how people get fed
into the pipeline of talent in
universities through the best high
schools the best high schools determined
that you are good in math so we'll try
to give you more of an option to become
better and at some point you bifurcate
and let you really work hard you buy for
completely from the guys who are
determined to be good in poetry and
visual arts and you start going through
this diverging paths and then you get
these people who are pre filter to you
where it will be much better to have
people who have both his together so I
do not know how to solve that one
through public policy but they the PhD
issue so it happens at one of our alums
is now the guy having the science and
technology committee in Congress so NSF
falls under him I'm dying to be able to
talk with him because I think that you
will you will attract an even broader
variety of people doing PhD seen
anything if you are telling them look
for six months you can take time off and
do
this other thing and in fact it
mandatory that you do so we get we don't
get to use all the brain capacity in all
the universities because most people
cannot do it if you are funded by the
Department of Defense you have to work
on these you have to report you working
with and that's it there was something
else somewhere okay okay so guess that's
it so I want to thank you okay for your
attention thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
