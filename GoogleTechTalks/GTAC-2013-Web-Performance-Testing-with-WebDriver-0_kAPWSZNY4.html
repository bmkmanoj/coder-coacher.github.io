cough who was also one of the organizers
of all of this so he deserves our thanks
for that
I also learned he's quite a risk taker
he tells me that he had proposed this
talk before he had written any code that
was going to be used as part of this
talk so with that I will let him talk
about web performance testing in
webdriver and as a shout-out to
performance and security I'm going to be
giving away some Android ease for good
questions so with that I'm going to
advance it over to you doc thank you
thank you and I would like to especially
thank the chromium team and Ken Kenya in
particular who was excellent talk you've
heard yesterday for working with me and
taking patches so I'm going to show you
how you can use webdriver to enable
performance testing in your existing
functional webdriver tests now why is
performance important I think most
people in this room it's safe to say
care about performance of their apps
faster app obviously makes e much better
user experience and there are studies
that performance is money and this is
all exacerbated on mobile on high
latency networks where even though
mobile is becoming faster mobile
networks are becoming faster latency is
going to continue to be a problem for
the foreseeable future
so why test performance why not just go
through our pages and optimize them then
be done with it turns out web
development is hard modern sites are
complex browsers are complex and as
people work on features it's very very
easy to inadvertently introduce a
performance regression alright and
that's how most of them happen and once
the regression gets into production it's
fairly expensive to get it fixed many
people are involved and you kind of
spoil the user experience and
performance
problems are especially nasty to debug
so it could get very expensive as
opposed to if you catch it close to
where it was introduced it's a lot
cheaper when only the developers
involved ideally even on pre submit
before the regression ever hits the
source stream so what tools are
available to test performance there is a
number of tools including for example
open source web page test which I happen
to be working on they've been focused so
far on page load performance testing
where you submit the URL and the transit
and their various conditions various
browsers and it gives you the results
and tells you what can be improved
what's fast and slow on the page there
has recently been webdriver integration
and web page test where you can submit a
JavaScript webdriver program we'll run
it for you so that's all good but it's
expensive to integrate it into an
existing tool chain that you may have
already as a continuous build and
continuous testing customized to your
organization's needs a web page test for
example has its own idea of what a test
job is and if you want is to start for
example a web server as part of the test
that gets tricky that gets very
non-trivial to integrate so how can we
make it easier how can we you know
spread performance testing make it easy
for ghen ization x' and for developers
especially why not integrate it into a
webdriver itself right so it turns out
webdriver already has a logging API
which fits nicely with that purpose
basically you ask when you create
webdriver you ask it to collect certain
types of logs and when you're done with
the test you ask quad driver give me
back those logs so why don't we enable
performance instrumentation of the pages
under test as the test runs that would
fit very very nicely into an existing
tool chain you can inject it
pretty much transparently a for test and
you can just use any existing functional
test that exercises whatever
functionality you care about and
instance that gives you a performance
instrumentation for that functionality
now how does that work in webdriver
there there's a notion of capabilities
that you pass when you create a driver
instance and capabilities are
essentially name value pairs and some of
them are designed to turn on certain
types of logs so in the latest release
of the chrome driver that can Kenya has
talked about yesterday
there is a profiler log type that you
can enable as you are creating the new
out driver instance and again you can
inject it as transparently to the test
as you like you can do it in the setup
method you can do it through a webdriver
build their abstraction you can even
proxy the webdriver wire protocol and
inject it that way make it as
transparent this makes sense for your
again custom tool chain the test itself
remains unchanged completely unless you
want to get advanced and inject your own
you know markers in the timeline that
you would ultimately get right to aid in
future debugging so it's free for
developers developers don't need to do
anything it's injected by the framework
at the end of the test again injected
you ask the driver for a certain log
type and the log entries in chrome dev
in particular are the dev tools or
WebKit remote debugger protocol Jason
events for the domains page network and
timeline and that lets you track
performance and memory consumption and
things like that will tell you when it
does reflows and runs JavaScript and so
forth and that you can submit into any
number of performance analysis tools
including webpagetest which I'm going to
use for that demo but whatever fits your
needs whatever your organization prefers
to use you can just use it on the side
run the regular tests and they submit
performance results and
become automatically available to
everyone now let's show how that works
let's switch over to the laptop so I'm
gonna start the Chrome driver and I'm
going to run the test which launches
chrome does a Google allows Google News
does a search for GTECH 2013 and then
switches over to web search results for
that same term and then at the end it
queries the performance results and
submits them to a web page test and
let's see what that looks like so here
you can see a network waterfall chart of
what was going on while the test was
running and you can open a chrome
developer tools timeline which gives you
a lot of info of what was happening so
imagine you are debugging in performance
regression in these tests that's
immediately very powerful now the neat
thing about the new chrome driver is it
also works on Android and I'm sure I'll
show you it's just a few lines of code
to run the webdriver run Android but the
test is otherwise exactly the same no
change so let's switch over to the
mobile projector see what the device is
doing while I do that it's launching
Chrome loading news doing search for
gtalk 2013 switching over to web search
results and let's switch back to the
laptop
it found 2,000 dev tools events
submitted to webpagetest and this is
what was happening in the mobile browser
while the test ran again full timeline a
lot of detail on what the mobile browser
was doing while the test was running and
again huge kudos to the chromium team
and the new chrome driver team for
making that happen now this idea in
itself is very powerful in the sense
that with all the webdriver based
products that were very well presented
at this conference including native app
testing you could enable performance
instrumentation at the level of the
framework and reuse existing functional
tests to get performance instrumentation
for a fixed small cost without changing
the real tests and you know you
presumably your developers or worst-case
test organization produce tests all the
time and any of those tests as your
functionality progresses can be used as
performance tests with near zero
incremental effort now as you want to
get more advanced in the testing you may
want to run the test for multiple
iterations against again it's at the
framework level right so that your
results are more statistically valid and
I'm gonna slide back to that nice
JavaScript API that exists in chrome
that lets you inject custom markers into
the dev tools timeline so that's a great
aid in debugging and there is no end to
perfection but the whole idea is
integrated into the continuous build
make it part of your regular development
process cache performance regressions
before they ever ever hit
action or even unprecedent before they
ever hit the source tree thank you
that's it yes thank you thank you
Michael I'm clearly a perfect night if I
call myself perf guy so I could spend
hours with your data and those are a
very cool graph so we have the we have a
couple questions up here on moderator if
we have a live question somebody will
earn themselves baby John Oh up here as
my kids call it otherwise I'll try to
throw it into the screen and whoever
asked this question can have it I don't
think that's gonna work it says is this
available is this only available in
Chrome driver if yes are any plans for
IE driver server right so the short
answer is sent batches to selenium but
the longer answer is there is already
performance instrumentation for IE for
example as part of webpagetest IE test
agents that could be integrated into IE
driver server and made available as a
log type through webdriver it's just a
matter of someone sitting down and
implementing it it was easy to implement
for Chrome so I sat down and did it it's
certainly possible to do for IE driver
server and it would be awesome if
someone actually does it all the pieces
are there it's just a matter of sitting
down doing it yeah sounds like a good
good opportunity for someone how about
the live question here yep
Alistair Scott from thought works and
the question was how is this different
to the inbuilt performance measurement
mechanisms in most browsers like Firefox
it's got a zone performance right so how
it's different from built-in performance
you mean like if you own Chrome
developer tools and they look
interactively at what's going on yeah so
that's what I was saying like why don't
we just go through all our pages
optimize the heck out of them and be
done with it the whole idea is
automation you are using the built-in
instrumentation I am using Chrome's dev
tools
I'm just integrating it into the test
tool chain I'm showing you how you can
take any existing custom test tool chain
that runs webdriver tests and enable it
very easily in that tool chain so that
you automatically collect that
information for all your tests that run
or for subset will have you write and
then you can go back and look at what
was going on when that test ran in the
past and you can automate
post-processing and automatically cache
performance regressions send alerts and
so forth but underneath it's absolutely
taking advantage of whatever the
underlying browser is great thank you
Michael and here you go okay great thank
you thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
