Martinez of Google Santa Barbara and he
will tell us about quantum hardware
development at Google thank you very
much my pleasure to be here you know I
really am enjoying this conference quite
a lot because there's a real focus on
understanding how to build a quantum
computer and I think the D way the V
wave machine are kind of been leading
the field in the sense of trying to
figure out how to build a useful machine
and I think we've done a lot of basic
research for a better years now and I
think it's time to get serious about
building a useful quantum computer and
in fact that's the essential reason why
I decided to move my research lab to
Google to try to do that I've been going
to a lot of conferences lately and there
seems to be a shift in thinking towards
doing that and of course there are
starts of several large national
programs around the world where one of
the goal is to try to do something
useful so what's great about this
conferences we're kind of leading the
field into thinking about how to do
something useful and how to build and
how to use this computational resource
for for you know doing some kind of
useful computation so because of that I
thought I'd first talk a little bit as
I'm looking around and hearing about
what people are proposing to do to kind
of lay a groundwork what I think is the
way to think about how to build a useful
quantum computer and there's lots of
different ways that people are thinking
about doing that I'm going to start with
what I call the digital approach which
is kind of the standard gate model
approach where in fact for the theories
you assume no errors and because of that
you have this hugely large Kilvert space
state space where you do your computing
that goes us to the number of cube
and what's nice is with this kind of
thing there are really good mathematical
proofs of what the power of the quantum
computer can be and you know Shores and
Grover algorithms are just examples and
there's lots of other algorithms too of
course
fundamental to this is that you have no
errors so if you want to do anything
there we can do demonstration
experiments on these algorithms but you
eventually have to go through error
correction to get something ok and we
believe this is gonna work and we've
done experiments to try to do that but
this is kind of a long road I mean we
have to do where we think we can get
there but and in do these very powerful
algorithms but it's gonna take some time
so I would say the advantage of this is
you have this kind of provable
exponential power you you know that from
good mathematical proofs everyone
believes it's correct of course and one
single error kind of destroys these
calculations so you have to do that
again you have to require large machines
and of course what we're thinking about
here today in terms of analog and kind
of anneal worse is kind of looking in an
an I'm gonna call an analogue approach
ok
which is where you just assume you're
gonna have errors ok and then you're
going to try to build something
practical even though you you have
errors now I'm just going to generalize
a lot here and I can happy to talk to
people afterwards but I'm going to say
compared to the digital realm we have
less refined mathematical proofs on how
to do this anything in general for the
analog of proof approach there's not a
firm of a mathematical foundation in in
digital but of course with errors you
can think about building practical
Sheen's and algorithms right now and
again this conference is all about that
now I want to also say as you do that
and think about other simulators there's
kind of it's been kind of couple things
that are sad about this kind of approach
in general that kind of parallel
this if you're building quantum
computers with errors it is really
incorrect to say that you have this
exponential state space this powerful
computing power using the digital no
error kind of arguments so you can't say
you have exponential power it's not
obvious at all because this exponential
power comes with no errors and we have a
lot of errors okay and that's sometimes
said and sometimes implied and maybe
I've done that on occasion okay I'm
sorry but it's just not true
but on the other hand there's a
conversely a lot of people say that the
only way to do this only way to use
quantum computer is to do that and
that's not correct either okay you know
this this approach you should be a you
you know it's incorrect to say you
aren't be able to calculate it's not
going to be useful because you have
errors and you don't have full quantum
coherence so the truth is somewhere in
between so I kind of like to think of it
as you have your you know linear scaling
of classical algorithms you have this
that's kind of unknown you have
exponential the power over here and
somewhere in the middle here there's
plenty of room in the middle to kind of
misquote Simon to try to do something
useful because xpx potential power is
really great so even if it's not
exponential power you know we can do
that so in in this we have quantum
annealing I think there's a lot of other
systems people are looking at I see a
lot of people kind of just building
these quantum systems and trying to
understand the quantum mechanics of it
and I call these kind of self simulators
you know simulating couple spins but
it's just kind of simulating the only
the system you're building and that's
not necessarily useful in the way that
lets say Fineman started talking about
it where he said you can build a quantum
system to emulate another system and so
I'm kind of breaking this up into self
simulators which are nice physics but
not necessarily useful to things where
you can simulate other things where you
can get you useful utility out of it
and of course the quantum annealer for
example it's fully programmable and you
can hope to put mathematical problems on
it so these are the two areas in the
analog they're doing it so given all
that I would say we have to have a deep
understanding of the power of these kind
of analog machines and the system
requirements to be able to do something
useful and I'm just going to say that
this is a frontier of physics right now
in our field and I'm even gonna boldly
say this is the big frontier of our
field right now if we won't really want
to try something useful let's you know
try to understand both experimentally
and theoretically what's the power and
how to get there and how to put together
our systems to give power maybe not
exponential power but again something
that we can be useful so I really like
this conference because we're really
trying to address that problem in a lot
of the discussions we're having here and
I think for example there's much more
things you can think about than just
quantum annealing to try to see that
power and in fact what I'm gonna do
today is I'm going to talk about a
recent proposal of our AI group that's
just about to get on the archive where
we're gonna do do just that we're gonna
try to look at some kind of power of the
quantum computer and in fact this
particular experiment more still sits in
the digital domain with a gate model
with a shallow circuits but with 50
cubits so that the to the 50 state space
kind of shows you that you have you know
huge computing power here yeah we we
aren't going to do anything useful right
now but we're gonna kind of show you
know show an example of how you might be
able to put together using the systems
you have right now something that could
be very powerful so I like to put it
this way here we are a bunch of
physicists with a little dilution
refrigerator and we're going to do some
kind of calculation
on the 50 cubed system that if we want
to check it is going to require the
biggest supercomputer in the world to be
able to check it ok now we're not going
to do something useful
we're just gonna check it but at least
you know you can show that it's powerful
so that I think is pretty cool so again
this it was proposed by the Google
theory group and Sergio this afternoon
we'll talk about this in detail and kind
of good theoretical mathematical detail
I'm gonna kind of discuss it on a high
level experimentalist view and explain
how it works
what's nice it's a simple qubit test
again results checked by a supercomputer
and that but you can do check it by
about up to about 42 to 50 cubits at
that point you can't check it anymore
but you know clearly you shown it's it's
powerful demonstrates exponential
processing power you have this huge
hilbert space that you're operating on
in in the system which i think is a good
fundamental test of quantum computing
sensitive and complex tests it results
fail if you have an error so you really
have to know about coherence and it's a
good test this scalable quantum
processing again you're testing it
you're testing your error models and the
light okay so here's the one slide that
explains how to do it in seven easy
steps okay and basically what we're
doing is we're taking qubits and making
gates between all the qubits these are
control Z's and these are single qubit
gates and what we're gonna do is for a
sequence of n qubits we're gonna choose
randomly gates here from choose a take
random picks from a gate set that either
are clifford's for the single qubits and
control Z which is a Clifford group on
two qubit and then we're gonna add in a
non Clifford to make it interesting and
then we're gonna run this algorithm and
check it okay now I don't think I'm
gonna explain this in a second but what
I'd like to do is kind of explain this
in a very simple way using a laser and
what I have here is a 300 mil elazer
that you can only buy from China okay
now and my credit card number was stolen
so be careful when you do that
and to make it safe this is really
dangerous
I put a ground-glass little piece here
that's gonna defuse the light okay and
that's good I'm not going to point it at
you but that's gonna make a little bit
safer and of course if we have white
light going through ground glass it's
gonna spread out the beam in a
homogeneous way but we have a coherent
source here so if you look at this can
we turn off this light here might be be
a little bit easier to see you can see
the light is spread out but you see a
speckle pattern can people see that
there are places a little brighter there
are places here that is more intense and
there are places that's less intense
okay and that basic physics is called
a speckle okay and what's happening is
you how you can turn the lights back on
that's the big demonstration do you know
about speckle you've studied this so
what's happening you have a coherent
light source and from the various paths
going through the ground glass there are
times where it coherently it's it's
interfering constructively to give you
bright spots and destructively to give
you dark spots and it has to do with
it's a coherent beam now if I wanted to
you know I could measure this beam okay
and I could knowing the ground glass
surface I could calculate what that beam
should be and I should be able to
measure the beam and calculate the beam
and get the right answer and in fact if
I knew enough information about that I
could calculate the response of this and
given that there's n pixels here it
would take about N squared operations
it's not that hard to do
that's a classically tractable problem
however when you'd instead of doing
light speckle you do qubit speckle okay
where you're running through these
random gates and getting kind of a
random output that is a 2 to the N hard
computational problem and what we're
going to do in the quantum supremacy is
come is measure the qubit speckle and
then compare it to calculations now when
you get qubit speckle
the intensity of the speckle is
proportional to the probability that
you're going to measure it so what we're
going to do is we measure all the
possible states you're going to pick out
the bright spots and we're going to get
that information of the bright spots and
say okay is that what we predicted in
the bright spots of the theory and
that's the algorithm okay and clearly if
things are working right we're gonna
pick out spots that are gonna presumably
bright and then we're gonna check them
and we're gonna see that that has higher
probability and that's basically the
algorithm
okay the check part of the algorithm so
let's go ahead now and then go through
the math now that I kind of explained
how it works so what we're gonna do is
take this circuit and we're gonna
measure a K and I'm gonna call K that
bit stream in integer that runs from 2
to the n minus 1 so it's a huge number
of possible outputs and we're gonna
repeat and sample this about a hundred
thousand times to get a lot of
statistics and in our next version of
the quantum computer that should take
about a second so it's about 10
microseconds per cycle through we could
do that really fast so in a second we
get huge amounts of data now it's a
random circuit so you would guess
classically that you would have a random
guess and any outcome K has a
probability plee classical over to the N
but I'm saying if you do a quantum
mechanical calculation which is just
running this through a supercomputer
you're gonna find an inside and you're
gonna get a probability K and you're
gonna store it in some kind of lookup
table and then you're compare it and
what we say is to calculate this for 45
to 50 cubits might take days and it's a
huge amount of data ok that's gonna go
maybe on 200 state-of-the-art drives
although I would recommend using Google
Cloud to sort the data that's much
better solution but if it's big enough
you you aren't even wanna be able to
store it on Google Cloud I mean it's
just too big so you may just store you
compute it and then just store the ones
that you found
but this is the trick this is a really
beautiful idea you do a cross entropy
calculation you take the case that you
measure and for those case you find the
peace that you computed here and then
you compare that to P classical now if
you were to randomly choose K the random
choice of Keg would give you a random P
which would be P classical and this
number would be 1 but since you're
taking the bright ones here and you're
plugging it into a matching bright ones
here this is going to be bigger than P
classical and then this number this
ratio is going to be bigger than 1 and
in fact the theory is that when you work
it out in detail and do all the
statistics this cross entropy is minus
0.58 of its classical and point 4 2 it's
quantum so you can readily tell what's
going on and the statistically since
you're taking a million events you know
very easily whether it's quantum or
classical okay so you did that for one
sequence then of course you try another
sequence you know one data point is not
good enough and you go through this all
again and you keep doing this until you
run out of money because this is taking
days on a supercomputer I mean this is
totally trivial my second so the quantum
part is trivial and this is your
limiting step of course that's what's
cool about it so let's kind of explain a
little bit more how this thing is
working ok if you take I think this is a
436 qubits you just take two index from
0 to 2 to the N you get probabilities
that are this kind of distribution and
this is actually an exponential
distribution here and this is the peak
classical right here so this is just the
output of a computer program and this
exponential distribution actually comes
from the fact that the real and
imaginary amplitude is Gaussian
distributed and then from that you
actually get an exponential probability
distribution and what you can do is you
take all those caves and sort them from
low probability the high probability and
that sorted is given here and if you
tilt your head to the left
this is probability and this is a number
and this is an exponential curve here so
this is indeed this exponential
distribution okay and that's you know
I'm telling you that's what we were
claiming now this is the interesting
thing
you put one error into the circuit okay
and then you you measure it at the end
and you get this blue line which is
basically flat so one error totally
destroys the coherence and you won't see
this quantum effect anymore and again
this is the fragility the power and the
fragility of quantum mechanics so you
can just say this cross entropy is just
the probability of no error with times
this s value that I told before and
thence the probability here and then the
probability of error forgiving single
and two cube and measurements you can
work this out easily and it's basically
called as east of the number the total
number of errors in your circuit and so
that this number here it's you can see
some quantum effect you want n to be
less than one or practically you know
less than three or so so the experiment
you do is is you're going to measure s
Toto - assess classical which goes from
zero to one and then as long as your
errors are small you'll be able to see s
greater than zero and you're gonna claim
quantum supremacy if this again our
errors are too small this is too small
and you know you won't be able to figure
out it's going so it's it's a very
simple test like that so experimentally
you could do this in a 1d chain with 49
qubits we know how to make a 1d chain
but in order to entangle the n qubits
you kind of have to do 49 control Z's to
get the states to talk to each other and
given what we're doing now that's that
any would be 12 it wouldn't work very
well for a 2d array to get them to
entangle across the array you're gonna
need square root a man or about seven
and for error - that's looks doable okay
that's something we do now it's gonna
take more depths of the circuit then
probably seven do this
details so I think we're gonna have to
improve upon this number but I'm just
saying that this is within reach for us
to do and it's you know one of the
experiments were trying and it's good to
you know push us to get the the
coherence just to let you know we have
done complex sequences with a thousand
gates which is within that so we know
how to do the control in torrance to get
it out of a 2d array we have bump
bonding working superconducting bump
bonds with a thousand bump bonds working
all the time so we think we know kind of
build it just it's hard to put it all
together and that's something you know
we're gonna work on ok so that's that's
the end of my talk let's my summarize
you know as we think about doing
something practical
I think the adiabatic quantum computing
is a great direction and you know we're
thinking about it really really
interesting it's possible maybe you
could do something with digital and okay
right now we're kinda want to
demonstrate this exponential state space
and you guys see if it works and you
know although that's kind of a just a
theoretical and a scientific advance um
I would claim that there's something
useful to this because I think if you
were to show this and show that you're
needing a supercomputer to check it that
would be very useful in the fact that
you would convince a lot of Silicon
Valley executives that this is like the
technologies maybe going somewhere you
know and then Google that's that's kind
of cool to do that and also I would say
well okay we have this random algorithm
but can some smart person out there
think about a short algorithm that
actually does some useful mathematical
function and if that's the case you know
we could maybe turn this into it into
something so it's kind of a call that
people can do that and you know if you
do come up with something we will
definitely try that and we're working on
that and we would do that so you know
we're interested to see if people have
any ideas so in that thank you very much
for attention
so the talk is open for questions please
well I would like to say that I think
there is evidence that there a low depth
circuit circuit model algorithms that
may be of use for doing approximate
optimization and I mean we my group
showed that such an algorithm with very
low depth could get an approximate
solution to a combinatorial search
problem and for a short period of time
we were outperforming the best classical
algorithm but then the classical
computer scientists teamed up 10 10
against the Ray and improved their
algorithm and so we differ by a log
factor now from them but our algorithm
is at the lowest possible circuit depth
and we had those results and if we
increase the circuit depth the
performance will improve so I would like
to see someone built a quantum computer
that executes a low circuit depth
optimizer in the gate model and I think
people at Google are interested in
variants of that which also people are
with this vqe but I think there are
things on the table which can be
explored and you know I have my own deck
but I think there are others and I think
we need to pay attention to these things
now thank you
I want to ask when you say you use
random sequence of gates what does it
mean random I mean are you ever a'junk
over different sequences or you just you
know you just you just for each element
in there you randomly choose a Clifford
and there you may have to choose a
little bit few more tea gates no but you
have to repeat and then we then we take
that given sequence and then we repeat
it like say a hundred thousand times
yeah but is it clear that averaging over
different sequences and averaging over
different repetitions are equivalent to
each other well every different sequence
you choose you will have to do a
different supercomputer calculation to
be able to compare the speckle pattern
and it should not matter you know you
should be able to do this with one
experiment and kind of show what's going
on but I think the the community would
like you to try it two three four times
you know that show that generically but
I would say part of the the interesting
part is that this works for a randomly
chosen circuit which kind of shows that
there's no information there that you
can gain to build a classical you know
simulator to kind of get that
information because the individual
elements are chosen randomly that's kind
of the thinking there all right thank
you so we have time for one more
question please there is one over here I
think oh just a clarification question
on the errors that are required to
destroy the defect right how do you
model this error I mean what kind of
errors are you sensing yes yes so we
have modeled them in the typical
depolarization model scheme where when
you do the simulation you just put in a
random flip the end to see what happens
and that's of course the way that we
model things for you know error
correction and whatever and what I would
it's nice because you know you can argue
whether that's a good model or not I
mean our data so far says it's a pretty
good model but we actually think this
this this experiment is actually a good
way to check whether those assumptions
are fundamentally sound because we can
kind of estimate the errors from single
and two-qubit experiments and then do
this big experiment and see if it makes
sense so I think that would be very
useful all right thank you very much
let's tango speak
thank you
