application space and we're fortunate to
have Michael Jones with us he is
Google's chief technology advocate but
also the either current or former CTO of
Google Earth and so those of you who've
enjoyed Google Earth applications Oh
Michael a good deal so Michaels agreed
to chair the applications panel and I'll
turn it over to him and have at it here
we are and uh we're right there just
underneath the shadow is where we are
and they asked us to talk a little bit
about applications I know you know you
had a lot of fun talking about dots and
commas and slashes and things but uh um
I was thinking what you were talking
good use dashes and dots and do it in
Morse code but um we got we have three
or four of us actually so so chamath is
going to tell us about Facebook white
works oh how that's going to change in
the future and how the inner needs to
change to make the next version of that
possible or some some version of that
something orthogonal sup something sort
of in that spirit Mike's going to talk
about how to make the internet and the
applications it bears be a spoken word
place a conversation a physical
conversation between computers and
people well you see that coming out a
little bit in Google search for mobile
mobile searching and Google goog ninth
of goog 411 so that the logic is a lot
of places where our keyboard is
ridiculous and and but you might be able
to say even if you couldn't key it in in
some complex kanji way so so that's
interesting concept Chad's gonna talk
about YouTube and then I'll talk a
little bit about just real quick I'm the
moderator so I don't get much time I can
talk a little bit about maps and earth
so I was going to do lunch production
for these guys here so starting with
chamath who's a vice president
everything important like user growth
mobile and international expansion so
imagine if he wasn't a facebook they
would be shrinking in users it would not
be on mobile devices and they would have
no international
law business operations I think I like
best about that was he was a twin yeah
that's awesome sauce so he's right there
and I'd imagined just sitting here but
nonetheless there we are um mike is with
me at Google here among a lot of us are
and he's this big area is making
computers talk which seems reasonable
since we talked it's the lower bandwidth
and what we see but it's nice in that
it's something you can do why you do
something else which has remarkable and
beneficial applications I worked long
time ago in flight simulation and
military fighter planes in one of the
biggest things was using speech to guide
pilots because they could do something
while they were being talked to I'd look
at display the guy's gonna shoot you are
you looking at the screen but if you
it's the same thing it's not yourself on
the car but if voices has come over the
years you're good good shape Steve's
different voices male female different
languages to an accents in different
spatial positioning 360 and you could
get all the target craft that were
coming toward you radially positioned
calling out their distances and threat
level and people could handle 15 20
people in the air around them perfectly
so I'm a big fan of speech even in less
thrilling you know context are and the
chat of course is famous for doing
YouTube and think about fun about chad
is that today we have to i'm saying is
building a web baby wired by google 29
year old chad hurley and his business
partner steve chen are mega rich they
founded youtube a mere 20 months ago and
now the global video sharing website is
being bought out by google 1.6 billion
dollars in google stocks it doesn't even
feel real like and your modeling
portfolio a little bizarre says hourlies
chatlin proud older sister she and her
mother both teach in the Twin Valley
School
John graduated from the high school here
back in 99 it's where he fell in love
with computers and graphic design
personally quite fascinating so uh um
that's what you get for making it user
contributed content ah um for me my
thing was I'm the guy that figured out
how to sell ice to eskimos this is using
google maps to find the ice store in
Fairbanks Alaska um and you can get the
number one rated ice place this is going
to the shonsu today and looking at some
of the sidewalk cafe environment there
maybe it's better in person but if you
can't go you know maybe you could go on
the computer uh you can drive around and
look and zoom in you'll notice that the
license plates are all recognized the
image processing and blurt out
automatically to meet the European Union
laws yeah and if you see sides of
billboards that people are bled out on
the billboards it's pretty funny oh they
also take people to the mars let them
drive down in valleys and canyons so so
my thing is about inflation in context
between the three of us that are
focusing a talk we have more than a
billion unique users every month use our
products and so they don't represent the
all of the internet are the most
important things maybe but they
certainly are a meaningful element of
what you guys r any build infrastructure
for and we thought if we all chatted a
little bit maybe we could give you a
sense of things that maybe hold us back
things that we'd love to see change and
maybe dreams we have that we need help
to fulfill just from the infrastructure
standpoint so if you guys to join me
we're good okay so but that is a little
personal intro to the people I love that
video you know your mom and your sister
talking about yeah so I'm just going to
end the phone at chamath and what I'd
ask you guys to talk to you basically
was just what I said oh not for me in a
formulaic way but just basically things
like what what constraints stopped you
from building what you wanted to build
even though what you built with any
brilliantly successful but maybe it's
not what you thought the same brilliant
successful you want to build what what
constraints reach would love to see
lifted that would really change things
in a dramatic way
things like that so it's a tough
question to start to answer but I'll
take an attempt at it so over like the
last couple of years I think many of the
constraints that we've had have really
been more of a function of time so when
you think about sort of like internet
behaviors and you know what's possible
companies like ours will sort of
innovate and move the ball forward and
set a new standard and sort of what
expectations should be but at the same
time you know you do that with a notion
of what the ultimate finish line looks
like and the how fast you get there is
really based on a combination of your
ability to innovate plus the ability for
the market to move generally in the
direction that you wanted to go to so I
remember sort of two years ago has it
been two years that's two years ago when
we were about to launch platform sort of
I was the first executive and services
like help pusher and facebook platform
and you know it was we thought to
ourselves how cool would it be to build
an ecosystem within the four walls of
Facebook but when we started talking
about it we actually started talking
about it from the guise of like how cool
would it be to actually have this really
amazing social context all over the web
but the reality was that at that time it
made the most sense to start sort of
where we were and then iterate make that
fairly successful then focus on growth
sort of expand the reach of the product
eliminate as many barriers as possible
expand internationally get to scale and
then allow sort of the entire ecosystem
to exist not just within the four walls
of Facebook but frankly you know on any
device within the internet net by or
connected to the Internet so in many
ways like what we realized through sort
of like that's what facebook connect by
the way but what we realized I think
through that process is that oftentimes
many companies I think have a really
great vision for what's possible and a
lot of the time the constraint that is
there is actually not something that you
can necessarily eliminate just with
technology you need to move standards
you need to move expectations you need
to sort of move entire incentives and
consumer dynamics to a place that allow
certain things to happen and I think
that entire exercise at first working on
facebook platform then working on Kinect
kind of like really brought that home
for me personally so you know I think
our ambitions
frankly you know fairly expensive I
think we can provide a lot of value in
the world I think that we can build a
really compelling service that allows
the entire world to connect and share
that will hopefully rusher in a lot of
transparency all of those good things
and we're going to you know try to scale
our company as fast as possible to sort
of meet those objectives but in many
ways what I really see is that we also
need to move consumer expectation and
sentiment along the way because in the
absence of that I think many of the
really potentially disruptive things
that are possible won't really happen
and so that's actually the toughest
challenge that we have is really trying
to identify what those expectations are
and then trying to figure out really
novel useful ways of showing people what
the value is of you know more openness
and more sharing and more content
production all of these things that may
seem tactical at the time but ladder up
into something that's very useful and
necessary for us to achieve what our
long-term vision is questions Jesus okay
you should not sure I should I pass the
mic down maybe and then we can come back
word sorry again i think it's i think
it's yes end oh I just I was just asking
if Facebook runs into problems with the
Great Firewall of China we haven't had
any explicit problems right now but I
think we go through the same problems
and we go through the same issues as
every other company with respect to
China so since you you gave a rather
positive you and didn't identify
technological hurdle let me see if i can
add another aspect to the original
question which may be can just be passed
down to those as well is there a
technology that you thought you needed
or a feature you thought you needed that
you discovered was not that you did not
need that if there was a perceived
impediment that in fact when you really
got down to brass tacks he said oh
really gee that doesn't matter after all
Justin you know just on the flip side
yeah I I think that that's like the
natural sort of like ebb and flow of how
we build stuff so you know I'll give you
an example of sort of our last iteration
which was to move to a an entirely
deterministic sort of real-time present
of information in doing so you know what
we did was we shifted sort of the focus
away from sort of an algorithmic
curating of content to an area I think
what you realized what we realized
through that specifically is that you
need to make sure that you balance both
of those aspects that there are some
people at the bleeding edge for example
who use the product so often that the
only way to actually meet their needs is
to have a fully deterministic real-time
environment that's just massively
shoving you know data down the pipe to
that person at the same time there's an
entire body of people that we've
acquired over the last year year and a
half who are you know what you would
typically call like sort of Middle
America just not in a pejorative sense
but just in general sort of
categorization sense um who you know
have other things that they do and you
know there may be still only login once
or twice a day and so that algorithmic
presentation is just as critical and so
you know I think like the challenges
that we have are really as you said are
very accurate which is to figure out
which things matter in what context and
how do you make sure you actually
present those at the right time and that
is something that you know we don't
generally just kind of like stick our
thumb in the air and just try to intuit
we do a fair amount of a/b testing which
is I think it's you know a lot of rigor
that I think you guys have adopted quite
successfully we test things and when
they work we kind of like you know roll
them out to a broad set of users and
when they don't work we kind of sunset
them and move on but if you've looked at
the evolution of the site I think you
see many features that have started
initially have been somewhat
marginalized and I think that's because
we've figured out that other things are
more important or the things that we had
at the time weren't as important I'm not
sure if that answers it but that's as
bad as precise as i can tell you okay
great um you know first of all thanks
for the opportunity to speak you know I
talk about our story we're coming from
and talk about some of the constraints
that we saw at the time and we still
sometimes see today um you know really
when we started YouTube we were looking
at our own personal problems that's no
nutshell how I explain kind of what we
were able to create is that we
frustrated with online video was an easy
to send wasn't easy to receive wasn't
easy to view this content and multiple
formats multiple players and we just
tried to simplify that we weren't
necessarily thinking about the
constraints that the bandwidth
limitations on storage or how we're
going to serve this video but it was
more let more or less how could we
easily get video to an end user in a
simplified way so we were taking these
videos multiple video formats with
multiple audio components and you know
re re re encoding these videos into
flash video and that sought the basic
problem of providing a seamless way to
playback this this video content through
one experience through flesh and that
people didn't have to think about the
type of media player or the type of
video file that they were dealing with
and obviously we tried to reduce the
file size and again that we weren't
necessarily thinking about costs or you
know how we efficiently push this
through you know a certain you know set
of bandwidth is available to us but just
simply how could we provide an
experience and user that wouldn't that
wouldn't buff wouldn't need the buffer
very much would be pretty seamless and
fast so we would reduce the file size so
that would that we could accomplish that
and I think from our experience we were
coming from paypal we were coming as you
know myself as a designer Steve as an
engineer from again the early days of
PayPal and us trying to figure out a way
people that people could easily deal
with payments and simplifying that
process and really giving them a
solution that they can take with them
and for form of payment buttons they
could put on auction listings and we
sort of looked at the video space in the
same ways you know how could we provide
a video solution for them they're not
only simplified the problem or created a
solution but something that they could
take with them so video embeds was that
for us that was our payment buttons it
allowed people to take any video even if
they didn't upload the video to their
own website or blog and gave them the
video solution and then that embed
primarily served as a marketing tool all
that extra bandwidth we are serving for
videos on other sites will drive people
back to our site with functionality and
basically entire video itself was was a
link to youtube and it was also
associated with our brand the YouTube
logo so it's kind of those little subtle
things that we tried to implement but
again with our backgrounds coming from
kind of the payment scene and not
necessarily knowing anything about video
I guess we didn't know the rules which
is a good thing when you're trying to
get into this world of video not only in
terms of technical challenges but
challenges that we didn't necessarily
for see in the copyright space is that
it's maybe the the bigger challenges
that have faced us today are within that
world I think technically we have a good
hold on the unstring a serving bandwidth
you know definitely we would love then
consumer to continue to have more
bandwidth they access more videos and
and ultimately for that bandwidth to be
cheaper for us but the world of Rights
is somewhat complex and we're trying to
create new solutions for for companies
around the world where they can not only
identify this content in a more
automated way and remove it from our
site provide maximum choice for them to
leverage what their biggest fans and the
community is doing with their content
and they can either leverage up for
marketing reasons learn how people are
consuming their content and and
incorporating that into future
development of content or leveraging
maybe how music music band is is
scheduling a tour or leverage a and for
monotype monetizable reasons they can
identify this content place ads against
it and earn an additional revenue source
so for us I guess being kind of naive on
all fronts with video it gave us an edge
of how we we were just approaching it
from I guess the users perspective and
what we would want they would want as
well and were able to get a few things
right and you know at the end of the day
be at the right place at the right time
where people had the devices and the
connections to participate in this new
world
yeah exactly that's right good okay
how's that all right I was asking about
standards and the role they play if any
in the current YouTube universe yep uh
you know flash has just provided a
seamless way for us to serve video and
it's pretty lightweight way for people
to consume that video and it's on about
ninety-eight percent of the browsers out
there so in a way it is a standard but
yeah its proprietary cuz it's owned by
Adobe we're looking forward to
potentially html5 and some of the video
standards that are coming out and how
that they're incorporated into some of
the newer web browsers I think you know
before YouTube came came around a video
was it was a piece of the internet
wasn't a large piece of the Internet I
think just like text and image video is
a very important piece of the fabric of
the web I think it definitely needs
there needs to be a standard and how you
deliver that and help people consume
that but you know again before we came
around when we we served about a million
videos a day we thought we were you know
that that was kind of a big deal then
you know who else could be serving this
much much video we're trying to plot our
growth you know at 30 million views a
day we would you know you know how could
we get any any larger than that and as
it stands today we're serving well over
billy and a half videos every single day
and it only continues to grow and i
think the rest of the web is you know
operating in the same way i don't think
i think again we're lucky to be in the
right place the right time build a
community around video but ultimately
videos a commodity anyone is going to be
able to build a video site video
technology certainly serves they want
videos over time youtube can adapt come
with a search product to index
exists on the web and it don't be easier
for us and our users if that those
videos are seamless and again kind of
going back to why we start the site in
the beginning is making a seamless video
experience and if that does exist on the
web and make sense for us to look for
video ever exist like okay well I just
wanted to make a comment I want to be
hearing so far because I'm just
intrigued which is at 15 years ago when
we had these kinds of discussions we
were hearing very clear statements of
things that the network didn't do things
that the network was impeding and
instead what I'm hearing from you guys
is that you're failing much more
constrained by reaching your customers
or your potential users then by the net
itself that is your real constraint is
how do I innovate to meet the needs of a
consumer of my product and the net isn't
it the Nets an enabler it's there but
but it's not the impediment it's not the
thing you have to fight your way around
to make it work you're dealing with a
whole higher level set of four different
set of issues that are much more outward
facing rather than inward facing and
fighting with the technology I did hear
about flash the fact that you had a
standard to enable you to reach out to
people but it's a higher level standard
it's not G how do I get them the bits
how do i get the storage I don't get the
computation those problems are all sort
of yeah they're there they're all
important back in problems but they're
not your front end problems is that a
fair characterization of what I'm
hearing because I'm intrigued so I'm
gonna I'm ask chad question so it's my
executive manager so uh so I'm it
consider YouTube is a failure rather
than a success in terms of this question
okay so brilliant flow successful it is
if you had enough bandwidth to send HD
to everybody's house would you have
already displaced television networks
around the world if you know we would
have a potential if we are connected to
the experience of how people consume HD
premium long-form content which is on
your TV I think there needs to be you
know better and corporations to the TV
itself any devices that are hooked to it
it's not very seamless I know we're
working on some of those problems to
make it easier for people to consume web
videos on their teeth on TV but you know
simply just you know providing enough
bandwidth that people are able to
consume this video on their laptops I
don't think is enough
and there are some people out there
starting to make some progress in this
world that Apple TV I mean Netflix the
roku box and DirecTV I mean they're
starting to incorporate these things but
it's still not easy again for the end
user so i don't know maybe some
standards of how you get that video to
the TV and how there's because I in
essence I'd feel like as video it
becomes a commodity videos everywhere
there there be some higher-level can
immediate RSS rules or something that
operates almost like what they
envisioned IPTV to be that all the
networks all the studios are going to
have a library of content that I have
some set of rules around it usage rules
either you pay you know certain rate
like a CPM or rules on how you're
pulling ads to support that content and
you you know I think at the end of the
day again it comes down to user problem
we'd love to have infinite bandwidth and
the ability to serve HD but users need
to be able to access to connect
experience where they want to consume it
so that's a great answer I guess what I
was and I great that what I was thinking
was in in computing just pure computing
no network monastic mode of you at your
computer typing in that mode about a 10x
performance increase is probably in it
in and of itself an able and technology
you know if you can support 10 times the
data you have ten times the CPU 10 times
to something Ram then then the thing
this scale of problem you try to solve
really is is a defining difference from
the one you saw before I'm pushin for
video uh it the irritation of it the
complexity of it grows with a square of
the size you know because it's a double
resolution your horizontal row to be
good for x here so so as the bandwidth
becomes to be 10x at 100x something like
that through its users the imagination
would fill that immediately but well
it's not like that then it's the world's
most popular place for living a
short-form qvg no tiny poorly encoded
videos so it's brilliantly successful at
something nobody want to do before and
they want that is the zeal for watch the
video is great so great that if it's
lossy encoding and it's bracelet you
know
that's okay but doesn't mean people want
that it's just they don't have a choice
to that if there was a like Korean
YouTube with you know 720p and
everybody's using that and we had
servers there and it was because they
all this great network I think you would
find lots of people all moved to Korea
but I mean I think you'd find a you
would discover what it was like you know
it's just that you don't people can't
miss it because they don't have it and
they don't imagine it but youtube is is
amazing and beyond general people's
imagination so they don't say i look
forward to tomorrow when this is HD
there's just not anybody's in managing
it doesn't mean that's not what the
future pretends and yet he can't get
there by himself because you have crappy
cell networks and slow routers and
everything else right so I think it's
important to understand that it's not I
mean you can't ask the fish about the
water because they live in that field
they can't really perceive it nothing
personal I think he needs more bandwidth
than he says he wants so let's talk to
let's switch the mic and we'll need the
projector on and if you guys want to
except to the sides will be better to
your eyes you don't come over here yeah
why not you can use this to the advances
lights if you like hi speech in the web
so um so speech technology it's it's not
really an application so my colleagues
here in vol built really revolutionary
applications that have changed a lot of
user behavior but my view of the role of
speech technology is really as sort of
an enabler or a compliment to just about
any application that might live on the
web and rather than you know although we
put out applications to start out with
like goog-411 which lets you do roughly
local search over your telephone that's
not really the long-term vision so why
why is speech important on the web at
all well you know an awful lot of human
communication is spoken much of the
world's information is spoken and what
concretely there are recent developments
that are driving the needs for speech
technology on the web obviously mobile
is becoming more and more important so
there
one or two billion people walking around
with these little devices that have
microphones that have tiny keyboards
that can be hard to type on that people
want to use in all kinds of different
usage scenarios even when they're
driving even when they're walking down
the street when it can be particularly
hard to type on those keyboards so
spoken input and output are very useful
ways for access also partly thanks to
things like YouTube there's an
increasing amount of audio online and it
would be nice to make that searchable
and discoverable not just buy whatever
metadata happens to be there as part of
these okay how's this great you have a
role in this speech group it's that our
technology walks works better without
the breath noise too with increasing
amounts of audio online it would be nice
to make that easily discoverable
searchable navigable by being able to
recognize what people are saying and
discover things of interest also there
are various emerging user populations in
other parts of the world that have more
and more of them have mobile phones now
in many cases low-end phones so for
example in India there's something like
350 million mobile phones only 10 to 20
million of them have data plans and so
how can we enable these people to get
access to the Internet speech technology
is one of the enablers and in some parts
of the world there are large illiterate
populations that now are starting to
have mobile phones and so they can't
read then speech technology will be a
pretty key piece of giving them access
so the long-term vision is really
transparent access and I mean a couple
of different things by that first of all
in terms of interaction modality
ultimately the goal is the user should
be able to decide whatever you know
depending on their usage scenario
depending on their personal preference
they should have ubiquitous seamless
access to speech if they want to be
talking they should be able to talk they
want to be typing they should be able to
type and it to just be available in
every application where it makes sense
and then content type things like online
audio should be easily discoverable so
this is part of kind of a bigger vision
where speech technology is just one
small piece of it I stole this slide
from Alfred Spector he used this in his
recent keynote at the world wide web
conference in Madrid and the point he
was making is that the direction we're
going in is totally transparent
processing so for example if no matter
what language you speak if you're
seeking some information and there's
something useful in some other language
it should be easily available to you
through things like machine translation
you should be able to discover things of
interest whether it's an audio and
images or whatever and in fact there are
a number of different efforts in Google
research in image understanding in
machine translation in speech
recognition and so on to enable this
long term vision so speech is just one
part of that so where are we today with
speech technology it about six months
ago we released google voice search so
this is now available on blackberry's
iphones and excuse me android and so
this is basically wide open google
search by voice anything you would type
to the search engine you can now say and
get back a result another recent
deployment is voicemail transcription so
this is part of google voice which is
the google
a capability that basically unifies all
of your different telephony interfaces
so into one new telephone number and the
idea is if you get a voice mail we
transcribe it and now you can listen to
it you can read it you can search based
on the text in it depending on what's
most useful to you at the time there are
there have been a couple of other
voicemail transcription companies that
have come along but I believe that this
is the first one that's totally
automated so the others have human
intervention at least some of the time
and for the sake of privacy having
complete automation a voicemail
transcription we think brings an
important value so coming to the
challenges and this addresses the
question that Michael was raising before
the the biggest challenge in achieving
the kind of vision I was talking about
of ubiquitous seamless access really has
more to do with the core technology and
core technology performance than
anything else it's not so much
constrained by the internet but rather
by speech recognition accuracy more than
any one thing so to do things like voice
search to do things like ubiquitous acts
access to any application we have really
huge vocabularies to recognize very very
highly variable language unpredictable
language lots of speaker variation
different accents different conditions
that cause people to speak differently
speak at different rates and so on and
also especially in mobile where phones
get used in all kinds of different
environments lots of problems with
background noise and that makes speech
recognition very difficult and what
we're finding what's making this problem
much more approachable now than just a
couple of years ago is sort of being
able to do things at internet scale so
with you know obviously much greater
compute power richer models one example
is um voice search you know just a year
ago I would have said yeah that's that's
in our plan but it's way off and now
it's been out there for six months and I
would have been surprised a year ago if
you told me how well it would be working
today and some of the leverage that
we've been able to bring to make voice
search work has been just the vast
amount of data available so although
when we deployed voice search those
notes we didn't have speech data but we
had enormous query logs obviously
billions upon billions of textual
queries that we could train models of
language on and based on that we were
able to get out of the box to start out
with good performance on on voice search
since then obviously we've been
collecting the speech data and been able
to improve a lot more since then but
just the scale of the data available to
us which was you know a number of years
ago you know totally out of the question
just made an enormous difference in
terms of what we could accomplish in the
long term to you know we still are
barely scratching the surface you know
my colleagues talk about having a
billion you know users of their
technology every month we were just
first getting our stuff out there onto
the internet so we don't have a billion
users a month talking to our systems at
this point but we have one thing that
we've learned even since deploying voice
search is that better performance gets
us more a lot more usage so for example
with them as voice search got out there
as we learned from data we release new
models that give us measurably better
recognition accuracy and all of our
metrics that measure usage things like
how many users that try our system once
start using it regularly stuff like that
to the day we deploy new acoustic models
recognition performance improves and we
see you know a direct correlation in our
metrics that measure how many people
become regularly uses or
how many people actually click or how
how many people no longer have to retry
after trying a query so you know we very
very direct correlation between growing
usage and increasing data one of the
important aspects to taking advantage of
that is what i call unsupervised
training and you know traditionally the
way you train a speech recognition
system is its enormous statistical model
of language of pronunciation of
acoustics and you get people to
transcribe you get you know a million
utterances and people sit and transcribe
exactly what was said we feed that to
our algorithms and learns things about
pronunciation but with that approach you
can't take advantage of the scale of the
internet you can't take advantage of
millions upon millions upon millions of
users every day so one of the important
research thrusts is unsupervised
learning how can we take all of that
data and improve performance without
even having a human in the loop and this
plot here shows you some early results
this was from a goog 411 system that
basically shows that with two two to
four times the amount of data
unsupervised not transcribed we could
match the performance of having human
transcribers so that's actually a pretty
exciting result and points the way
towards a means to really take advantage
of Internet scale as we grow this so in
conclusion speech is just one of a
number of technologies that we're
working on at Google that we need to in
order to have really transparent access
to all kinds of information irrespective
of language irrespective of modality and
everything else lots of research
challenges in getting there but the
internet gives us a lot of sources of
leverage the scale of the internet and
the data-driven nature of the kinds of
approaches with taking to these problems
really benefit from
working at internet scale thank you this
is the second time I guess in recent
times that I've I saw something on TV
about gathering lots and lots and lots
of data to get human speech I haven't
worked in the field for a long time but
quite a long time decades ago I oversaw
DARPA's research on speech understanding
where the emphasis was on trying to
actually understand and get an
explanatory model for what was going on
and so on to me and so I'm a little
nonplussed to see sort of don't bother
to try to understand that the actual
signal and so with just get lots and
lots and lots and lots of examples and I
can see that it works but it leaves me
with a kind of queasy feeling as to is
that all there is or at some point are
you going to be able to go beyond that
so so first of all one of the reasons
that we need ever-increasing amounts of
data is that we're building much bigger
and richer models that ultimately
capture more and more of the knowledge
and structure in the signal so if we had
the same models that were the same size
of the models as ten years ago you know
the extra data wouldn't buy us much we
do have enough you know data to train
what we had so it's it's not the case
that we're not making the models more
sophisticated we are that's why we need
more and more data but also an
interesting lesson for me in recent
years has been that you know the search
engine in a certain sense is a great
natural language understanding engine
you know back in my former life building
things that worked in call centres
wanting to move from simple menu systems
to more sophisticated things where we
would understand what a caller wants and
route them to the right place in the
company we spend a lot of time on the
natural language understanding how do we
find a statistical way to analyze the
the language and figure out what are the
important things that indicate which of
the hundred different kinds of services
the company offers do they really want
this time if we could just
you know for voice search if we could
just get the word string right somebody
may be asking a pretty sophisticated
question the search engine is doing a
lot of that work for us the search
engine you know we recognize a few words
that kind of indicate what somebody
wants and now the search engine is doing
some really sophisticated stuff because
of all of the data who can so
effectively search through and give them
stuff that's semantically relevant
semantically useful for what they're
trying to accomplish so it's in a sense
the search engine is doing a lot of the
semantic processing for us yeah just a
quick question is there any consortium
that works together on all of these
initiatives and research and
implementation and stuff because i know
i mean i can't help think of you know
different universities in europe that I
know that are doing similar kind of work
or even something as simple maybe as for
a set of stone where you know you have
all the languages and and there's voice
recognition when you speak into the
system right and that's unsupervised
obviously so I'm just wondering if there
is a consortium or same technology or
something so there are a number of
consortium that have come about the
linguistic data consortia consortium has
done a lot of data collections in
different languages and made it widely
available to companies and academic
institutions doing this kind of research
so you know the consortium have had more
to do with helping with gathering data
almost than anything else but to get to
the next level of scale my view is we
really need to to be learning from the
actual institue data real gift get real
usage get real data flowing in and in an
unsupervised way keep learning from it
so I'm not sure looking to the future
that having these big consortium that go
out and do explicit data collections is
the most important way to advance so
there's nothing like the IETF for DNS
technical standards for
or speech no so a couple of things
immediately occur to me and it's partly
link to youtube one of them has to do
with accessibility in general and it you
touched on a number of rationales for
wanting speech understanding if this is
also very useful capability if you can't
hear but you could transcribe that would
be a big help what I don't know and the
same thing would be true for YouTube
videos with audio voice is specifically
voice audio whether whether we are at
the point where the technology would
support real-time transcripts or
real-time captioning as opposed to what
we do today which is somebody manually
produces the text Oh is I don't want you
to give away any secrets I'm good
morning warning we have folks who are
not from google but is our is technology
at the point where real-time
transcription and potentially real-time
translation would make any sense so I
would say we're not quite there yet but
you know it also depends a lot on the
source you know even if you look at
youtube this some material is expert
village this stuff that we can
transcribe pretty reasonably there's an
awful lot of stuff where it's multiple
speakers this background music there's
all kinds of stuff that makes it next to
impossible with today's technology even
though human listening has no trouble at
all so it depends a lot on the source
material but even so there's also a
difference between the purpose of
transcription so even for things like
you know expert village or stuff like
that although we can probably today do a
good enough job of transcribing so we
can make it searchable navigable
important words typically happen
multiple times it's okay if we get it
wrong here and there it's okay if you
get a certain percentage of the words
wrong you can still make it searchable
in a useful way but that doesn't mean
you produce a readable transcript
so Oh have a good so I'm particular
interested in the technical challenge
you referenced am with variability and
accents this is something that users can
set or how you dealing with that so as
you can imagine living in the u.s. rope
and speaking into these systems I don't
recognize me uh-huh sorry so in general
the approaches we're taking our building
bigger models there are a lot of
different possible approaches to it but
building bigger models that capture more
of the variation I it most likely asking
users to explicitly say you know I'm
from Brooklyn so delete all the arse in
my pronunciation or something I can say
that because I'm from Brooklyn so you
know it is likely to be unreliable and
if somebody's picking up a phone just to
do a voice search do they really you
know you can't put those kinds of
requirements on users it's too much of a
barrier on the other hand you could
imagine over time as you have the same
people using the same mobile phone and
stuff like that there are things you can
learn about individuals that could be
helpful along those lines i'm also a
general magic refugee and one of the
last things Jim white sort of did who a
lot of the older guys here remember yeah
I went to nuance to basically develop
voicexml in the voicexml forum so sorta
to get into the sort of standards area
as well as nuanced had the best engine
in the valley at the time yeah I'm kind
of curious whether what the update is on
voicexml as well as new ones so I was
one of the original founders of nuance
and I agree we had the best engine in
the valley at one time um I you know one
of the reasons I came to Google
10 years at nuance was um data you know
massive amounts of data being able to do
things at internet scale and so you know
in my opinion we're positioned to to do
better than what nuance is able to do
right now nuance has a business model
where they don't build the final
applications they sell to enterprises a
big source of friction you know this
vision of wanting lots and lots of data
and always updating your engine is a
vision i felled for a long time at
nuance there was always friction you
know these enterprises don't want a
science experiment they want to be told
this will work and next month I want to
deploy and then go away and so Google
owning these services we can be
continually collecting data continually
optimizing performance in a way that you
just can't do at nuance so I promise to
be extremely quick since I'm just we
don't have any spare time here I'm just
going to show just two pictures real
quick just hang on to sit okay don't
worry it just just what the wall hurt
yeah it's okay so just just to give you
a sense of this so so my thing is about
context information in context googles
mission is to organize information and
making your versatile and useful I focus
on the useful part you know what all the
hospitals you want the one close to you
when you've been stabbed right so you
don't want all the hospitals are you
want like four mi whereas the hospital I
want to go again so so this is something
we have purchased example but all of the
Hubble Space Telescope pictures all of
these sky surveys in context of a
large-scale Sky Survey so you can zoom
in in the middle of Milky Way of the Big
Dipper and keep going and going and
going then you see the spiral galaxies
so it's like so the oh it's right there
I didn't realize that just like just
about to snap shots which you know which
it is but yes you know where they're
from which
you import information some of these
pictures are pretty huge
watch L sunbae sites
the lives building networks underwater
trying to discover the issuing the hose
world and then this other one here is
this is Mars again but these tracks this
is from a real time thing that's in
google earth is a real-time web cam from
Mars so basically there's a satellite
orbiting taking pictures every day it
sends it back to us we did it with us in
an hour we have it live on Google Earth
and you can actually follow the
satellite and see what's going on then
yeah mars one of those places like in a
great place to hemisphere so there's not
exactly there's not much going on there
so I mean it's not like you're some big
car accident or something big you know
mosh pit thing it's just the same thing
you know but there's confident data you
can click on those you consume and
that's from like a couple of hours ago
so if it had his sort of interstellar IP
of the scheme um they're actually doing
that we actually have a lot of people in
governments around the world who have
these sensors in sindh out that I really
want to get the data back then we'll
look at it right now they want in from a
scientific transparency and fundraise
they want to get the data visible to
their on senator type people they also
want other scientist will to click and
download that some of this data is
really really big we're already no more
than 10 petabytes replicated multiple
times through dozens of data centers
which is inconvenient from a disk drive
standpoint and you know I mean even if
you think about being wealthy and still
like you know the nightmare to keep them
you just bills going so it's the data
that people want to upload and see in
context is is hundreds of times greater
than what we accept right now you know
they won't give us 320 x 240 videos
because I could say that they call way
to Pluto and they want to see the actual
pixels right they don't don't it's
active file so to speak so that's a real
problem we have and we're definitely
constrained in Google Earth I just keep
your sense of that we have a
downloadable application it's pretty big
because it's pretty fancy we have the
equivalent of over 19,000 t1 lines doing
downloads 24 hours a day for the last
five years okay that's that's just a
download that's not the data and people
using it so it's you know it's great to
be a web app and may already have
flashes talk wait wait it's a real
nightmare of running big apps like this
and downloading them to half a billion
people um just my family Sam points
that's what I slide let's uh let's
reconvene here we could have the gap
that off again Wow okay so um
point of view it's not fast enough okay
edge caching really helps us a lot we
like it when I skis do that we do all
our naming of all our IP file fetches we
use HTTP to get our files that are
behind Google Earth and Google Maps if
they get cash that's good some things we
have very short keep alive because their
query results and changes next in it
other things we have a like picture of
Mars might last for a month or something
so caching is very important to us if
you know a world of edge caching is a
great world for Google Earth and Google
Maps I don't know how relevant dealings
it's not dynamic the way facebook is
dynamic is that the name is where
YouTube is dynamic but but it's a lots
of people flying all the time you have
more eyeballs so to speak integrated
time than any TV show these people is
looking at the earth so oh yeah we do
similar she'd to be fecha concept for
photos just cuz there's I don't know
what the numbers but like is that the
number of photos that we have I mean
it's just like it's insane than the
amount of content there and I agree with
you like I mean taking my comments
earlier sort of like for face value
which is I think the consumer incentives
are actually the hardest problem of
building a really successful big
consumer business underneath though when
you are generating reams and just
monstrous amounts of data and I think
we're sort of into petabytes of data
generating gigs of data a day doing that
intelligently and cleanly and elegantly
and fast and then managing that and then
just doing managing just the reeds of
all that data and then keeping
everything sprightly and fast is a
really hard technical challenge but we
have a somewhat of a similar concept in
what we used to manager for other
implementations called haystack he
actually just talked about it I want to
say about four or five days ago we
talked about it publicly but that's
actually a very great thing and then you
know we've also been just innovating a
lot on sort of Hadoop which I think has
been also fairly helpful for us and I
think will also be a leading
implementation for a lot of next-gen
companies that come down the pipe
well first let's go back to the voice
piece the voice recognition peas and how
we've incorporated that into YouTube
yeah obviously we have to leave the
closed captioning but that's kind of a
manual process uploading a separate file
and can also associate translations with
that file as well we did a limited test
with some of the political videos
because typically it's a speech it's not
a lot of background noise it's a little
bit easier to detect what they're
talking about and that was somewhat
successful I think to implement it
broadly it's going to be more of a
challenge for us but the reasons we want
to do it yes may make it more accessible
for you know people that potentially can
hear the words can read the words and
then implement translation on the fly so
people can understand kind of on a
global basis what people are talking
about whatever piece of content that is
and then ultimately yes it helps with
discovery so is you know the last reason
why we definitely want to implement the
video that would that were receiving
it's another signal that we could we can
interpret and understand how we can
present that information and relevant
way to our users right now it's pretty
hard we're just rely on metadata that
the up litter associates with their
video but any other input that we could
receive is greatly appreciated well
first of all the two things first of all
I ran into exactly the translation
problem with the video just last night
somebody sent me a video about a guy who
is Swedish and he was interviewed he won
an award he goes off and does these
incredible things treks across him
awliyas and so on but if the interview
was all in swedish and i really wanted
to know what he was talking about
ultimately i wound up turning to a
native swedish speaker at Stanford who
very kindly did a transcript for me so I
hope that our future somewhere someone
will develop a better tool I wanted to
ask a different question though one of
the things that we talked a lot about
in during the course of the day has to
do with making things interoperate at
various layers in the architecture and
as we work our way up into the
application space getting applications
to interact with each other is a
non-trivial enterprise and so it just to
pick the social networking space for
example causing the various social
networking environments to be inter
workable in some fashion is still I
think elusive and it's the same problem
that showed up with instant messaging
now there may be business model reasons
for reluctance to allow this kind of
enter working but I'm just wondering
about the potential for allowing these
various applications to exchange
information and to be to allow users who
are party to these various applications
to to cause them to later work in some
way is that a space of stand where
standards making would be useful or is
it the case that most of the
participants in these various
applications are have reasons not to
walk to that interoperation to happen um
so let me just start by talking about
the IM space before Facebook and after
winamp I built aim in AIESEC you and
I'll say they're the interoperability
thing was purely a business decision and
we just chose not to do it at the time
we were the leader and that's what made
sense ultimately in hindsight that was
the wrong decision and we should have
opened up a lot quicker and inter
operated faster and we should realize
the value is actually in the name space
in the network not in the UI in any
event moving to today ah i think the
standards may be fairly helpful but i
actually think it's a technical problem
that needs to be solved which will allow
people to have the portability of the
information to actually allow the
interoperability that you're looking for
and I think what most people would want
to see so specifically I think like if
you break the problem down the real
problem at least as far as I see it
isn't necessarily sort of like
bi-directional transfer
information between two sites where
there's a trusted connection and you
know of the privacy model is so for
example if you know i'll just use
facebook connect but it's equally
applicable for google friend connect I'm
on Netflix I rate a movie there's a
secure connection it's clear that i'm
the person logged in at facebook i'm the
person logged in and netflix the account
is bounded it's fairly straightforward
and you can transfer information back
and forth in a secure manner user
experience is straightforward value is
clearer it becomes much murkier when you
start to introduce third parties and
forth parties into that transaction and
you're trying to figure out what part of
the data should be shared to whom who is
it visible to and there some model of
understanding how privacy works that is
still lightweight i think is probably
the single biggest impediment that
people need to figure out i'm honestly
somewhat skeptical that a standards body
type approach is actually the best way
to make that problem more tractable i
really think you're better off with a
couple of companies going and doing some
lighthouse implementations of it that
prove how it can be done in an iframe or
via some simple thing that's secure
that's lightweight and that has a really
slick user experience and then working
backwards to figure out how to make that
generalized for everybody but i would
like to see the exact same thing you
talked about i really do think that
that's just really just a matter of
figuring out a elegant technical
implementation that's that that's
workable and i think that's probably
faster done by a handful of companies
just going and doing specific
implementations that figure out how to
generalize it there's probably still
some business reasons though it's not
implemented it's not you know on a
facebook side is that right I know
actually I don't think that's a case
like I think like I said you know
platform was sort of like an appetizer
for facebook connect I think in general
the ability to have all of the social
component REE as a layer that exists
across the entire internet I think is
incredibly valuable and there are
multiple parties not just us including
you guys they're trying to build and I
think those interconnects are awesome so
we will want to move there
quickly as possible and really I think
the more nuanced and elegant and sort of
more complex use cases just need to get
hashed out as people get more and more
comfortable this is why I talked about
you know this is really about moving
consumer behavior to a place where they
see the value oh cool this is cool like
I mean we start with something like a
you know Netflix where I rate a movie
and now I can see it in my feet and
people rate and I think that's cool you
know that's great I think then the bar
goes next to you know what happens in a
more sort of Sakura type transaction
type environment and iterating on a use
case there or something that you know
elegantly integrates an application with
that sits on the desktop with the web
that has the same componentry or that
takes a more complex use case that uses
content that's richer like video and
audio but all of those things happen and
you just need a starting point you know
and I think if you think about the fact
it's only been four or five months maids
fairly good progress you know yeah sorry
to give you a hard time but you uh yeah
well yeah it's sort of like a video
presentation intro it's a hard way I
know I again just coming from the users
perspective and get on what were
concentrating on YouTube we were
definitely have our hands around the
video piece I think the social component
you know more generally Google and the
social component we it's been a work in
progress I think Frank connect or
Facebook connects you know the
opportunity for our users to understand
how they're sharing information and to
whom and to do that a very seamless way
it's definitely something the entire
industry needs to work on and if that's
a no lightweight you know collaboration
to accomplish that you know considered
an open invitation for for you to work
with us at YouTube and maybe a facebook
connect to to accomplish that with our
users all right i want to ask how much
is the tension between security and
performance both at facebook and youtube
because more security may mean less more
latency or less ease of use it
such a great question there is a clear
trade-off the more sort of like overhead
you add that you know there's just more
checks that you're doing there's all of
these other things that just create
overhead and so it's it's not really
attention I think the thing is it's like
trying to figure out more elegant ways
of pushing as much data all over the
place as possible so that it can exist
closer to a user's but you can do the
necessary privacy checks to ensure that
the privacy model comes first and
foremost but then you can still deliver
something that's lightweight is probably
like the thing that we spend a lot of
time trying to figure out more and more
elegant solutions to and it is a really
tough problem the amount of dynamic
content so I mean like you can probably
just profile this yourself like when
your cash is cold and you load you know
home dot PHP of Facebook you can see how
much data has to come down the pipe like
there's a lot of stuff that's going on
and that's hard to you know to make that
light and quick and usable but at the
same time you know completely still make
sure that you see what you're supposed
to see also when you publish stuff it
only goes to those people you want to
publish it to and so that's probably
like the problem that we spend a lot of
time trying to make better and better
and it's a really cool problem but
there's a its attention and it's a
trade-off and you try to basically
figure out more and more ways of just
having as much distributed information
as possible that's still doesn't cause
us to like you know completely like slow
the side down so um I have a question
for I think a general question for this
panel or perhaps for the security search
speakers earlier today or maybe general
in the room I don't know and I guess
it's a day where we have to pick on
Facebook a little bit because it's going
to be based on a Facebook example I just
don't understand how do you figure out
what's bad content and what is so bad
content that you have to shut down
something or how do you define malware
or bad content or you know how do you
define stuff like that in a scalable
technical solution that at the same time
takes legal considerations
in to consideration and the example I
had was I was reading the Danish
newspaper and it says facebook is
closing down a Ronaldo site that has
three million fans and half a million
hits a month and you know absolutely
priceless easy what's the same the
Ronaldo site so football soccer player
so anyways just an example like how do
you figure out how do you decide to shut
down something like that when you know
what criteria makes it I mean I'm not
specifically facebook I'm more in
general like how do you figure stuff
like that out I'm going to pass the buck
here oh no you know so first of all you
obviously start out with your your terms
of use and your you know usage
guidelines you know as a baseline of
terms of what you're trying to
communicate communicate to your
community of how to interact
appropriately how do you know what
videos upload how you should comment all
these different things the user input
side you know and then you try to
automate some of that but for text
comments in general we try to detect
certain keywords that people should be
using there's different ways to kind of
wait how relevant that the comments are
and options now for users to turn off
potentially bad comments they try to
hide that you have some element of users
voting on those comments as well but
then looking at the video side just as
we're trying to become more intelligent
how weird identify what's in a video and
presenting that in a relevant way to our
users the same way for bad content so
basically we have to be notified so if
it was you know copyright violation or
something pornographic or violent on the
site for some of the obvious cases
people can visually detect if the video
shouldn't be on the site based on our
policies and usage guidelines and they
notify us and we have a team that
reviews and takes down that content 24
hours a day for the rights peace people
can't visually determine right so you
can't see right so you need the owner to
tell you who and so is right so you have
automated the DMCA procedure and it has
become
more sophisticated over time where it's
also included audio and video
fingerprinting just to make it more
automated and scalable if they provide
reference material we can automatically
detect and place rules against that
content however they determined police's
rules but you know at the end of the day
it's not perfect you're kind of relying
on it as some technology to some extent
users and then people using the tools
correctly to notify us when something
shouldn't be on the site yeah all joking
aside we have a very similar
implementation in the absence of the
audio and fingerprinting part that Chad
spoke about so we have a team of user
sort of operations people we have the
ability for you to report content and
then we also obviously you know when you
get in local jurisdiction notifying you
of copyright violation or otherwise then
we respect those so if you get a dmca
takedown notice as an example then you
know you look bugless it's a fair amount
that's a technical precise answer fair
fair amount oh how many resources of the
company and I said it's a it's a fair
enough there you go service is like 150
it was the publicly disclosed number
malware considerations a little bit
different than a child porn site or
something right it doesn't require human
being in fact it can't require human
being because it comes and goes so fast
has to be algorithmic we recognize that
when we're in a position of putting out
in effect announcing a website as being
bad Michael hopefully not all websites
but it when that happens we're sending a
feed out to Firefox and Chrome and
Safari and all the search results I mean
that's a pretty decisive effect right so
we don't take that lightly we have
defined what we consider pretty
clear-cut criteria so if if when you
just go to that site without even
clicking on things it's installing
software on your machine we figure okay
it's it's clear cut its malware but even
then it's not a it feels like there's
too much power in the hands of Google if
we're just going to make up those
criteria and impose it on the world like
that so there's a stop bad where
organization that at Harvard and with
other organizations as part that helped
you whenever you shouldn't be oh I'm
sorry yeah I didn't reduce early I'm
Eric gross I had the security team at
Google is there time for another
question before Tony gets his in thank
you so I just want to ask you this as
sort of application developers and
people who deal with issues of location
also issues of privacy it's something
we're grappling a lot with we do things
with location traces and we use location
traces over time and we want to use them
for history for health related purposes
and other things you want to compare
your location traces that are then
activity traces right now and later
we've talked about they would become a
nice little add-on to throw onto your
facebook page to describe you know what
kind of a person are you characteristics
of how you spend your time right so but
we also obviously the privacy concerns
are very high and so the notion that
this is just raw data that goes on to
your Facebook page that shared or a raw
data that even necessarily go straight
to Google Latitude right now it has no
memory but in the future interesting
apps useful things it might have memory
so I'm just wondering if you guys have
grappled with this question of the
combination of your location oriented
and and sharing or
architecture is what you're debating
internally if you can if you can share
that in terms of these questions about
location as a piece of information and
how that relates and how you think about
a privacy wise not just for me as an
individual but also in terms of its
availability for mining and
advertisement and such um I'll just go a
little bit further than what you said to
start by saying I think the next really
amazing Internet experience actually has
location as its core element and it's
probably purely mobile-centric with some
neat web add-ons versus sort of
unfortunate context today which is
limited availability of GPS information
or otherwise and location data string
bag that being said I think this is a
two-part problem the first part is how
do you make sure that users are in
control and you're given enough powerful
controls via very limited you I on the
phone to be able to know what's
happening and what you want to do
whether it's both passively passing
information up because that's what you
choose to do or whether it's because you
want to actively publish things like
location along with other information
but in both of those things the flying
grain controls are critical and how you
implement that in the UI is fairly
difficult problem because the UI is in
consistent across all manner of devices
but doing that in a simplified way that
can actually confidently exist in the
same manner in same behavior as you
switch devices from one to the other is
something that we're spending a lot of
time thinking about that's piece number
one the second piece though is that you
still need to provide a compelling
reason why people then go through that
context and set defaults change defaults
understand what's happening etc and I
think today I don't think I've actually
seen a really great location enabled
service and I think that is where a
company like us working by ourselves but
also working with others can probably
create something very slick that weaves
location is a critical part of a very
social experience so change the consumer
behavior and give them incentives to
want to share that information but then
also make sure that you can have a
confident implementation that
across all manner of you I that gives
people confidence that that they're
sharing when they want to and then
giving them the defaults to basically
change the velocity at which they share
that information that's so there's no
real raging debate it's really about how
do you solve those problems and it's
actually more a lot of like just a lot
of hard work like what does a product
experience look like what does the
implementation look like and then trying
to find a good medium between the two of
them and kind of move that forward I
mean quickly just on location Pisa mean
for us it's just another piece of data
that helps to present the video but I
think more supposition specifically your
kind of talking about how many people
are managing a piece of private data
that they don't necessarily want to
share broadly we we kind of deal with
that on the the video viewing experience
we try to track what people are viewing
the limited scale try to present them
relevant relevant videos more of a
personalized experience of you know like
this you also made like that but I think
again key just comes down to how you
present that how they can manage their
own data just giving them control of
their destiny this is how we deal with
it this is a google time to google
center he's cheating but uh so i look at
this stuff two ways and i want to share
this real important so one is like a
wristwatch okay the wristwatch isn't the
killer application for time you know i
mean time is an intrinsic attribute of
everything remains a noun has time with
it some way so people may be used to
respond or your clock on the wall that's
part of way of experiencing time or just
discussing the time attribute of things
but time isn't about wristwatches or any
kind of clock right time is broader than
that so location is is convenience got a
noun phrase it down complication at a
certain point I'm set a location the
geospatial locations so that that's an
attribute of every single thing it's
every going to say it's every single
thing so as it happens so that so that
the pervasiveness of location is much
broader than the pervasiveness of a
particular language a particular ipv6 or
there will be IPP 7th aloft but it was
always been time there always will be
you know some things are really really
pervasive in time is what location and
time one of those things those are both
amazingly enabled in a new powerful way
by GPS satellites not only do they give
you locations which we'll talk about
they also did 50 micro second a kiss
I'm all around the world which never was
this before nobody knew what time it was
over there until GPS went up so that's
that's the second key attribute of GPS
so that's that's the technical thing is
it's really important to shape half of
the experience going forward in all
things the other part is for me
personally I when there's new super
articles about government of X hates
google for something about Earth or maps
right undergone the plane flying to X to
meet President India ok so that's the
advocate part means right it's like the
chief arrow taker and it's something
really important about all these things
the things that Facebook does things
that Amazon does things that Google does
things that I Bay does these are things
that society didn't anticipate there's a
cycle time to the legal process which
codifies a human experience in judgment
it we're innovating faster than that
cycle so work ahead of the decision
about what's right and wrong so Chapas
of all these videos he didn't know that
it's going to be something that would
attract the interest of Viacom for
example he didn't know that it wasn't
like or China or anybody you know so
China shuts down YouTube and says we're
not afraid of the Internet well
obviously they're scared as heavily
internet and is headed down so so like
like so so so we didn't understand that
no I didn't know that I would get like
hate mail from like the president of it
of Iran in the middle of a war about how
he hates the word Persian Gulf instead
of Arabian Gulf ki think it's like
unbelievable they have time to talk to
me about that right it's really really
simple so the these
