and robot I know it's the last day
before a long weekend so thanks for
taking the effort to show up mark mark
always gives excellent talk so you are
you have come for her do you have come
for a birth while thing so I've known
mark for over five years now and every
year on 18 months he shows up in the
valley with some really cool
implementations mark actually has a
small company in England small but an
outstanding team of developers and he
usually does wonderful things inside the
browser leveraging most of the new
things that are showing up on the web
he's come he's given a couple of talks
at Google in the past on web
applications and web application
frameworks most of what he does you can
sort of one word describe as pushing the
envelope on what you can do on the web
with web technologies am today is going
to talk to us about what you can do with
rich metadata on the web in terms of
enabling a lot of dynamic user centric
interaction so rather than taking up
more of your time and hand it off to
Mike I'm and I'll go hand off my mic
strap to me so okay many thanks remand
hello everybody so my company is called
web backplane and we specialize in
anything really to do with the user
interface and in particular so kind of
rich user interface technologies
particular in particularly xforms is one
of the areas that we've been working on
for a number of years but in particular
also the idea of dynamic user interfaces
and this is really where our interest in
rdfa and the Semantic Web has come in in
exploring how far it's possible to use
semantic information to create dynamic
you is based on that information so what
I'm going to look at is rdfa which you
may have come across as a w3c standard
but really look at it so I'm going to
give an introduction to rdfa and go
through how you might use it and Mark it
up but then I want to then show how
we're using it in order
create richer user interfaces Richard
rich clients okay so perhaps you're
familiar with a Semantic Web I don't
know I'd imagine probably so but I think
it's worth mentioning what we mean by
the Semantic Web and in particular RDF
because there is a lot of confusion
around it and it perhaps gets a bad
press certainly a lot of people you talk
to about RDF in particular say that it's
very complicated people will never use
it and if the Semantic Web is ever to
happen is ever to take off an IDF won't
be the reason why so by the Semantic Web
you just simply mean the normal web but
with semantics digging out the meaning
digging out the kind of pieces of
information that that littered around
the web now obviously there are many
different approaches to this obviously I
understand that one approaches that are
kind of generally the Google approach
have sort of let's just dig out the data
let's not worry too much about it being
structured let's apply lots of clever
algorithms to deducing what this
information means and certainly you can
see that because the structured data
side isn't isn't very advanced then it's
always going to win out at the moment
the clever algorithms but i'd like to
show a few examples later where I think
that there will be a limit to that
approach and where we can start to get
benefit by encouraging people to add
structured data and what the Semantic
Web then to a large extent about is
about is how do we actually dig that
information out of the pages and
encourage people to add more so rdfa was
an attempt to try and tackle the problem
the rdf was too complex and I'll explain
why in a second and try and tackle that
problem and provide another way for
people to to provide their metadata in a
structured way so the kind of the
foundation really of what I'm getting at
when discussing RDF is that IDF is a set
of concepts rather than a particular
mean
of marking up information what we might
call a serialization so that the bad
press that IDF gets is really because of
RDF XML it's a complex XML markup it's
it's quite difficult to use it there are
many different ways of expressing the
same thing with this markup and it is
you know it hasn't gained widespread
adoption it is not the underpinning of
the Semantic Web and when people say RDF
is complicated they're usually talking
about rdf XML they're usually talking
about this particular serialization of
RDF but RDF itself is fairly simple RDF
just simply talks about what we call
triples it talks about we have something
that we're making statements about we
have a property of that something and
then we have a value of that property
and pretty much anything that you deal
with in the software world can be broken
down into those fundamental triples
whether it's databases whether it's an
object in an object programming language
the object has a property with a value
even HTML people put meta values in the
head of their document they're putting
in a name value pair that looks like
two-thirds of a triple but actually it's
a triple because it's talking about the
document itself so it's a fairly simple
concept that pretty much anybody could
grasp who particularly if they're
involved in software and programming in
any way and the other kind of key
component of RDF there's the triple and
then there's the URI the idea of a
unique identifier the idea that we can
give a name to things and know when
we're talking about the same thing and
the unique identifier might supply to a
person or a holiday or a city but it
also might apply to a concept and it
also might apply to a property so we can
name properties and know when we're
talking about the same property of
something so that's pretty basic stuff
rdf has the triple and it has the unique
identifier and everything else is kind
of layered on top of that but the real
advantage is that if we can get
information to be in this triple form
then we suddenly enter a world where we
can share information all around and we
can say things about the information we
can know when to
blocks of data are talking about the
same thing we can combine statements
that people make and all sorts of
information can start to be shared so I
would say that's why we need RDF I think
RDF as a concept rather than as a
particular markup language it's it seems
to me pretty obvious that that's what we
need but RDF is very difficult to
publish generally at the moment you have
to have an enormous database in almost
triple stores generally people are using
RDF XML or maybe some other languages
like n3 generally involves a kind of
pairing of your presence on the web with
your metadata with your semantic
information so invariably HTML and XHTML
are kind of how you you publish your
textual documents and then you have to
kind of have some parallel process using
RDF XML or some other language to
publish your semantic information and so
it's actually quite difficult it's quite
a maintenance overhead microformats is
is one way that people have tried to
address that where you actually start a
sprinkle metadata within your page and
come up with simple formats that you can
encourage people to add to their page
rdfa continues in that tradition and
takes it further rdfa says well let's
put the metadata into the web page and
because i doing that it means that we
then hook into all of the ways of
publishing HTML and XHTML that already
exist so suddenly a blogger is able to
produce semantic information or suddenly
somebody building a site with Drupal or
something like that is able to produce
semantic information because it's now
much more straightforward because the
publishing process which is now very
easy publishing HTML has been easy for
years is now the same process that's
used to publish metadata so that's kind
of a goal of put rdfa into the page but
not in the way that microformats does
put rdfa into the page in a way that
uses any possible RTF format rather than
having to come up with little
many kind of subsets of particular
vocabularies as they're often called
collections of terms rdfa says well
we're concerned with the with the with
the structure of the pudding the
metadata in not the actual language
itself if you're a chemist you choose
which vocabulary you'll use if you're an
engineer you'll choose which vocabulary
whatever if you're you know you work in
medicine you'll use vocabularies that
already exist in your sphere or we're
concerned about is helping you put them
in rather than inventing a new language
that can can do that so a kind of quick
intro to what rdfa looks like these are
slides from one of those 2020 talks I
did extech the other week but I thought
I'm as well use them here so you're
familiar with ordinary HTML the means of
putting metadata into HTML documents is
limited to the meta and the link element
here we can see I've got meta name
equals author content equals mark
burbeck I've got link rel equals license
and then a pointer to a Creative Commons
license and I'm basically making
statements about the document itself
this HTML document I'm saying who wrote
it and what the license is for the
document and that's basically it with
HTML that's about as much as you can do
you can talk about the current document
you can make statements about the
current document but but that's about it
so for example you can't say anything
about an image that's in a page here we
have an image within the page we have
the SRC attribute on the image tag
giving as the URL of the of the image
but if we try and add rel equals license
href equals and then point to the
Creative Commons license there's nothing
we can say there because that will apply
to the document I'm sure you're familiar
with that but you can put the rel
attribute on the anchor on the a anchor
in HTML and that indicates a
relationship between the current
document and some external resource so
we're limited here we can't say anything
about this image we've got a we've done
a flickr search we've got 20 your laps a
flicker in here or any way you know sir
and produced by another company but you
can you do a search all these images
come up but you're unable to put the
licensing information about each of the
images within the page so the first
thing that rdfa does is it adds a new
attribute and it says well let's have a
new attribute called about we put in the
URL of the thing we're talking about in
this case an image and now we're able to
make statements about that resource so
we're now talking about the image and
we're now saying the Creative Commons
license applies to the image rather than
to the page it's a very simple addition
one new attribute but it suddenly opens
up and a whole load of other
possibilities with when within your
document in terms of the metadata that
you're able to put in there so just
going to whiz through some of the other
attributes that rdfa adds it adds about
five or six here we can see the property
attribute and here what we're doing is
we're mixing the text within the page
that the author has added the author has
said a picture of Boston Harbor taken by
Paul and then we've said well it's used
that information Paul and make it the
property make it the Creator property
we've still got our about attribute at
the top so we're still talking about the
image and now we've said within the page
who took the picture so we're kind of
mixing the you know the dry don't repeat
yourself kind of approach we're mixing
the actual text of the document and
we're using it to be its own metadata
here quite a powerful technique probably
seems obvious you're probably thinking
well you know how else would you do it
but don't forget for the last kind of 10
years we've had rdf XML as one set of
documents and XHTML and HTML as another
set of documents so the idea of kind of
putting the two together is actually
quite quite novel another attribute that
rdfa adds is the content attribute where
we can further clarify the information
so in the pros it might be we just put
the word Paul but actually in the detail
the metadata we really want is Paul
Kayla who took this picture and so we'd
be more precise there about the
information
that kind of thing gets more important
when you start to deal with things like
dates so in line in the text we've got a
picture taken on December the first
that's a date there's no year on that
date the dates in English which
obviously makes it difficult to use that
if for example a search engine was
consuming this information I wanted to
find all pictures taken on a certain day
but here we've put in line in the
content attribute we've put an actual
string which is much more precise and in
fact rdfa adds another attribute called
data type which makes it even more
precise we can go further and we can say
that this is not just a string of text
that's more precise than December the
first it's actually off type date data
type equals excess colon date and we've
actually again be much more precise one
of the other things that rdfa does is it
allows us to use namespace vocabularies
so here you can see we're adding not
only the Creator information to this
image but we've now added a longitude
and latitude into the markup and again
some service coming along and consuming
this information could dig that out
we've added a longitude and latitude
from somebody else's vocabulary we
haven't had to invent it somebody has
already created that and the flexibility
of having namespace qualified properties
means we can just go along and pick up
properties from any vocabulary that we
choose which is the power of RDF as well
you're familiar with the kinds of things
obviously sorry to keep putting Yahoo
stuff up but that's just the slides I
just happened to have done you know I
can see you all shaking and so here you
know the kind of thing where normally
within the system itself server-side you
would kind of put the image on in the
right place and put the pins on well
what we're saying here is if we had that
property applied to anything not just an
image well there's no reason why we
can't overlay anything onto a map the
current event where somebody lives
because we can pull that information
from anything that the key indicator is
the geocode on lat long we don't care
what it applies to it's the power of
sharing vocabularies
here's another example where we use in
the friend of a friend vocabulary so
we're saying here this is a person this
time rather than an image and now we're
saying a property of that person is
their name and we've used the friend of
a friend vocabulary we haven't gone and
invented it so you can imagine now how
easy it is for people to put this kind
of information into their blog without
having to rely on some other publishing
mechanism to get their information out
there they can just simply say here's my
name a picture of me whatever and in
fact this is what I'll show in the next
part of the talk really i want to start
to focus on how to use this information
in the user interface but here's just a
screenshot are there some demos in a
second and you can see what's happened
here is that the text here has been
augmented with the name of the person
and a Type Indicator this is another
attribute that rdfa adds it says the
type of this thing in the about is a
person it's not just you know unknown
it's a person and then the user agent
here the web browser here is using that
information to add an icon of a certain
type to add a mouse over it's gone off
to another service to pull in Yvonne's
picture and then it's augmented and
enriched that whole user interface there
based purely on type of equals person
and then the URI that hook is what I'll
come back to in a moment and explore in
more detail it provides a hook onto
which you can add richer user experience
another example where you'd say type of
book with an ISBN number notice there
that there's no information there about
the title of the book or the image all
of that information is retrieved
secondarily in order to create the the
mouse over there with the picture of the
book cover and the title of the book
another attribute that rdfa adds is the
resource attribute sometimes you want to
be able to link two things together in
the way that we talked about with rel
but you don't want the thing you're
linking to to be a clickable link in
HTML href would obviously be a clickable
link so in this particular case we're
saying the person a nose person B and
we're establishing that connection using
the resource attribute another example
of using the resource attribute is when
in friend of a friend when you're
defining that somebody has a particular
online account you use the you make a
reference to the URI of the actual
service now you wouldn't want really
that to be a clickable link to point to
Twitter as in this example because it's
just a key you're just simply saying
this person has an online account with
Twitter we don't want to create an
actual clickable link and then what's
happening here is that information is
then used to actually go off to Twitter
and get the last things that the person
said and display them on the page so
again simply using some basic
information this basic semantic
information in the page we're able to
then enrich the user interface so that's
rdfa a little slight detour there just
to explain what rdfa is all about so
it's as you can see it's very simple
it's always the same no matter what
vocabulary you're using whether you're
using friend of a friend or geo
locations whether you're a chemist using
a particular vocabulary for conveying
specialist information for your vertical
it's always the same set of properties
the about property which says what is it
that we're talking about the about
attribute rather the property and
content attributes which allow you to
define properties that are textual the
data type attribute which modifies the
property and content and sets the
specific data type the type of attribute
which allows you to indicate what type
something is whether it's a person or an
event a calendar event or a location the
resource attribute exactly the same as
href except it allows you to make a
reference that isn't clickable
and then r l am rev which we already had
in HTML we're just using them in the
same way to set relationships minor
change that it can now also work with
the SRC attribute so on image you can
say image the image tag SRC equals point
to an image and then you could say rel
equals license and you could put the
license information directly on the
image tag all the way through your
document so that's rdfa so I think I
think this is quite exciting I think
this opens up immense possibilities now
for a kind of a another stage of things
that we can do on the web and for me the
kind of the key things are the ease with
which we can now publish metadata so
people are able to publish metadata in
exactly the same way that they can
publish HTML and XHTML so all of the
tools that they're already familiar with
canvas Lee to make it easy there would
need to be enhancements and extensions
WordPress plugins this kind of thing but
we've now got that possibility because
we're putting the metadata into the HTML
and XHTML so that then makes the
metadata available to be consumed
consumed in a couple of different ways
consumed by for example search engines
you know for example that Yahoo's search
monkey are now they're checking for
microformats and rdf a when they consume
information and what they're then doing
is storing that information internally
alongside the normal information that
one would search engine would retrieve
when consuming a document and then what
I think the area that I'm most
interested in is that then playing that
information back which search monkey
does to some extent as well search
monkey then in the search results the
rdf a can then be used to enhance the
appearance of the of the kind of blocks
that what do you call you call them rich
rich layout or something in your search
results you have the little boxes that
appear around
result which may not be the normal kind
of link and text it might be something
else it might be an image it might be
there might be a map next to it whatever
so consuming the rdfa and then using the
rdfa as it goes back out again and i
think you know the possibilities then of
making search results or improving
search results particularly for certain
sectors i think the issue here is that
obviously i'm aware that as i said in my
the beginning i'm aware that you can go
a long way by just simply hammering the
data and analyzing it in many different
ways but if you take something like well
maybe i should just go onto a demo and
show if you take something like
chemistry where the terminology used in
chemistry a chemical might go by a
number of different names including as
well I mean I'm no chemist I just kind
of looked into this very superficially
as I was trying to prepare demos and
look at the use of rdfa over the last
period go by many different names but
also sometimes often by a common name
that that we would ordinarily use as
well my in the world of chemistry
describes something actually very
precise so you can imagine for a chemist
using google to search or yahoo to
search is kind of useless is pointless
because you're going to come across tens
of thousands of articles before you get
to your specialist article about the
particular chemical that you're
researching or the particular features
so so what this simple example does is
I don't know if that's visible but I'll
point out the main bids so at the top
it's some just simply loading the RDF a
pastor so this is an HTML document the
source of an HTML document at the top it
just has a script tag to load the RDF a
parser then it says also load using this
lib XH colon include also load a
formatter for chemistry so i'll go into
for matters in a moment and it and show
the kind of thing that they do and what
they look like and then all the bloggers
then does is mark up their particular
chemical that they're dealing with with
a little sprinkling of rdfa so in this
case we've said we're talking about
something and we've said viagra has the
following cid identifier can't remember
what CID stands for chemical identifier
maybe I'm sure it wouldn't be so simple
but anyway that's the that's the value
of this identifier in it goes into the
mark-up here we've got a methane has the
following identifier and it's wrapped
around here and and there's the the
marker now obviously this could have
been wrapped around the word methane and
we could have put property because that
content equals that and that would have
generated the same metadata then what
the processor does is it consumes that
and then it runs the chemistry for
matter and what the chemistry for matter
has done here is a number of different
things first of all it's created a an
icon next to the anything that it finds
on the page from the CID vocabulary it
creates an icon next to it so you can
see there the 528 1023 right next to it
is an icon it's not my icon it's from
one of these chemistry sites not that I
could draw a better one but I'm just
saying that icon is also a tooltip and
within the tool tip is the shape of the
molecule which obviously doesn't mean a
great deal to me but to a chemist may do
what I've done just to illustrate the
difference is in the other chemical
identifiers I've add a link that goes
off to another website
and searches for information about that
particular chemical methane and tells
you more about it and then the other
thing that the formatter has done is
displayed these two messages on the side
they're kind of it's a growl inspired
message display system there and they
just simply clickable things so the key
thing here is that all the blogger has
had to do is put a little bit of rdfa
around some markup and then they've been
able to then indicate that this is not
just you know methane in the way that
somebody might talk about I don't know
cows or something like that in a blog
you can imagine a search on the word
methane in Google would yield all sorts
of things and unlikely to find this
article which might have a very very low
interest area threshold but by actually
searching perhaps for its actual
chemical identifier which may not
ordinarily appear in the page or some
other information which can be gleaned
from this metadata we're able to get
more precise terms more precise
understanding of the document and then
by then pushing that information back
out into the page you can see here the
blogger has enabled a kind of richer
user interface based on the information
that's in there so basically what
happens is the rdf a passer parses the
document creates an RDF triples store
and then searches within those triples
to find any for matters that might be
available it then runs the for matters
against the triple store which in turn
might do more queries on the data so
I'll give another example
so this example just somebody has loaded
a foaf and a calendar for matter and
then they've sprinkled through their
document the location of a meeting a
couple of people that are appearing at
the meeting and then when they run that
messages appear different messages
depending on the type of the item one's
an event these three of people different
mouse overs appearing depending on the
type again of the information
now what the what the processor is also
able to do and this is where it starts
to differ from something like you know
the kind of YouTube eBay Amazon
everybody does it where they say grab
this piece of script and embed it in
your blog and ebay will say grab this
piece of script or piece of markup and
this will embed something about the item
you've got for sale or YouTube will say
grab this piece of markup embed it and
it will show the video and of course
that's very specific it's it's kind of a
one one off thing you put it in the page
but then if you want to add another
video you've got to go and grab the code
again and it it kind of it hides the
relationship between the page and the
thing that it is you're trying to
display so this example here uses an
ebay for matter which again show that
the top loads the ebay for matter and
then all the author does in the blog is
just adds a little bit of rdfa that says
i have a bike for sale and indicates the
identifier on ebay of the item for sale
and that's it that's all they do now
what then happens the parser parses
grabs all the triples to begin with the
triples will just simply be the
identifier for eBay and all of the
information for the formatter but the
formatter itself contains further
information that says this is how you
can go and find more information about
this item for sale so that process then
gets run those triples are added into
the triple store and then we then run
our processes on those triples as well
so if we then run the actual thing
itself we can see about three or four
things have happened here the first the
simplest is that the a bike for sale has
had a CSS class added to it so you can
see there that it's got a gray
background with a white border we've
also added a tooltip which we saw a
moment ago and in the tooltip we've
added the bit of markup that eBay would
have told you to add in your blog now
you could say wall so so what's the
difference you know you've gone to all
this trouble of building this snack
the rdf a passive blah blah blah could
have just cut and pasted that object tag
you can see here that that four things
have happened on the basis of that ebay
item id in our blog whereas if I'd have
cut and paste the the script from ebay I
would have only got that one thing I
would have just simply directly got that
that piece of flash which shows the item
for sale so I said there's more things
so we've changed the CSS style we've
created a tooltip we've put the flash
video into the tooltip and then if i if
i refresh you'll see that we then also
get a message that appears temporarily
which says found ebay item about to
retrieve more information from ebay and
then this message here that says for
sale vintage 1986 1986 track bike that
information obviously came from ebay and
so what happened there is we picked up
the identifier we queried ebay and then
we put that information into the triple
store just as if the information had
been in the page itself that information
is then available to the stack and the
the messages the CSS formatting the
tooltips all of the different that we
could have gone off and got more
information so didn't occur to me until
yesterday actually that I could have
actually gone off to something like
dbpedia the interface to Wikipedia and I
could have grabbed some information
about this particular item in general
you know the general bike not that
particular bike for sale but that brand
or that model or you know is there
something special about it in the year
that it was made so I could have gone
off to Wikipedia and gradually bringing
in more and more information into the
page all of it keyed off this identifier
this ebay identified that the blogger
has or author has put into their page
the other thing here where it differs
from a kind of more standard template
approach is that if i just add more of
these items they just they just work i
find a said i have a bike for sale and i
also have a car for sale and put the
identifier around the car then again the
way that the process works the way that
the queer
these work within rdfa it would just
work I would get all of this just
happening more and more in fact you can
see that with if I pick this example
here this is an Amazon book example
where I'm using IDs to identify books
the formatter there is a book for matter
I go off and this time i get two
messages saying about to retrieve
information from amazon and now i've got
the information there about the two
books the book covers if i move my mouse
over there i get the tooltip and i get
the book cover and you know all of this
information having been retrieved the
class the CSS class added to the item in
the page all of that kind of happening
purely on the basis of adding that
identifier that one identifier similar
example Twitter slightly more complex
because foaf requires you to put a bit
more information in to identify a person
but assuming you wanted to use foaf
you'd say this person holds an account
online account it's a Twitter account
and that's their account name and so as
long as you put this little block of
markup into your page as many times as
you like you'll get I've configured it
to retrieve a couple of messages per
person and you'll see that just by
referring to those people in the page up
come it says found twitter account found
on twitter account and then goes off and
retrieves the information and puts it
into the page
so looking a bit more at these four
matters then the kind of structure of
them essentially they're based on
something that I because obviously when
I started work on this I wanted to try
as much as possible to use things that
other people had done so it's based
loosely on something that i came across
called Fresnel which is i think MIT
where they're basically using rdf to
define these kinds of rules so what I
did is I created rdfa documents which
contain these Fresnel rules and so the
rdf a parser when it when it refers to
the link when it refers to this external
for matter that is itself in rdfa is an
HTML document in rdfa i'll show you in a
moment the benefits of doing that when i
show a mocked-up blog which is using
blog pages to provide the for matters I
then added the idea of actions because
fresnel is all about formatting so it
says change the CSS class of this
particular information so that you can
highlight the fact that this is a person
or this is a book i added actions which
said go off and get more information
from a certain place and then they use
an rdf query language called Sparkle
which you may have come across I wanted
to see whether it is possible to define
the queries using javascript and that's
not very advanced at the moment but I've
got this idea of Jay Sparkle which is an
idea a way of writing queries against
your triple store using javascript so a
formatter can be in line with in the
document because it's just it's just the
triples all you're after is the triples
the fact that it's conveyed in HTML and
XHTML with rdfa is just a convenience
those four matters can be remote
locations or as i'll show the final
thing I'll shows they can also be on
your desktop so individuals could choose
their own for matters to display against
information that somebody else owns so I
could have a different chemistry for
matter to you I could have a different
calendar event format to you and all
this kind of thing so
so as you can see a formatter is just an
XHTML document with rdfa sprinkled
through it the most basic would just
simply say here's a formatter here are
the rules here is the thing I want to
apply the format against and here is the
in this particular case what I want to
do is apply a CSS class so the formatter
is based on sparkle but it's the kind of
Jason structure of sparkle and I say
select book where and then the pattern
is a set of triples now the interesting
thing here is that that where it says
select book that book property becomes a
JavaScript property that's now exposed
to me I get a list of items each with a
property book and the book will be the
ISBN number now I could have book comma
a comma B comma C I could have more it's
effectively dynamically creating JSON
objects and the JSON objects are based
on properties that are in the triple
store so it's quite a powerful technique
even within its own right I think this
the set user data property there is
effectively saying provide within the
query a pointer to the item within the
dawn that generated this information so
if you could actually format for example
the name of the book rather than just
the entire book because the triple that
generated that the rdfa that generated
the name or or for example if you had a
query that said find me everybody all
the people who have a friend you could
set user data on the friend and you
could form at the friend differently to
all other people so the idea of set user
data as you say give me the dorm entry
that generated this and then in this
particular case we're going to just
style that with that particular CSS
class now obviously we can go further
this this command here the Yale command
will display a message and in this case
it just says I'm about to go off to
Amazon to get more information
this one here pipes data this says will
now go and get more information about
about this and you can see there where
it says resource Bob book that's the
value that came from the query above and
so those properties are now being passed
into here so this is being run for each
item go off and get more information
from another resource in this case it's
a yahoo pipes service that's pulling
back information from amazon about the
book this is what to do with the
information when it comes back you can
see here all I'm doing is I'm just going
to add it back into the triple store so
my triple store is now growing it's as
if this information was in there from
the beginning and now I can do anything
I want with him and then once that data
has been loaded I have another of these
fresnel formats that's begins again this
time my query is bigger before I queried
and I said give me all of the
occurrences of type book in this page
now I can query against my triple store
and I can say give me all books that
have a title and a picture depiction is
the faux thing for an image and now I'm
able to query and find a picture and a
title because I'd retrieved them in the
prior step from amazon and then again i
can display a message but now the
message contains the title and the
thumbnail and all of the information
that I've just retrieved so
so that's kind of all of that they're
happening together there's the messages
saying go off to get more information
and these are now making use of the
retrieved information
so I said also that those some kind of
what I've done with it now I've got a
now here we go okay now here what I've
done is to show how you can sort of pull
these formats
so I'm going to show how you can pull
these formats from different places and
what I've set up here is a kind of test
blog which contains for matters and also
contains uses of those for matters so
here's a blog entry which contains a
formatter just like the one that I was
just showing it has the information
there about what to do what query to run
how to process the information if I then
load a kind of typical blog entry here
you can see the ebay is going off to
find the ebay information cool so just
clicked on the link again
and there you can see the mouse / has
been added to my blog entry and exactly
the same as before so the interesting
thing here though is that the formatter
that is being run it's the same format
or as the one I showed earlier but the
point is the formatter is in my blog the
the identifier that I've used in fact if
I edit this blog entry you can see right
at the top that I've said go off and use
this lib XH colon include is the kind of
identifiers that I the rdf a property
that says go and get a formatter well in
this particular example I've said we'll
go and get one of my own for matters go
and get the formatter on my own blog so
it's quite an easy way of maintaining
these things and you can imagine that'd
be very easy to share for matters around
and put them in locations that the
people could use on their own sites so
that's another use and then the final
example I'll show is where we run the
whole process in a sidebar now if we
look at the source here i'm looking at a
page now which doesn't have any
information about for matters so this is
the same amazon page I've got the IDF a
in there that somebody might have put in
like the chemistry bloggers might have
put chemistry information in I've got
the information about the book that i'm
recommending in this blog but there's no
other information in there you can see
that I haven't got the script tag in
there that loads my rdf a parser I
haven't got the identifiers in there
that says go and load the book for
matter I just purely got rdfa that some
generous soul has decided to add to
their document to provide this hook for
other people to use so this may have
come from some search results in the
page or it may have come from drupal
system saying you know just here's the
metadata it may have come from some
blogger just sort of saying well I'm
going to tag this up because I know it
will be useful to people and then what
happens over here is I have a sidebar
installed excuse the look of it but
sidebar installed which will now process
this information over here you can see
that it's using that user data part of
query remember I said give me the
information about where in the dorm you
got this information from so it's using
that over this side to actually augment
that and put in the mouse over and then
on the left hand side you can see that
it's added the same messages it's gone
off to Amazon its retrieved the
information which is displaying over
there you can imagine all sorts of other
things that you could you could do with
this so over there if I was a chemist I
could see you know particular
information about the chemical compounds
the molecules whatever that I mentioned
over here on the right hand side so
that's the kind of different levels
really the the possibility of for
matters that are out in the wild the
possibility of for matters that are
included within your document the
possibility of for matters that are just
another blog entry the entry itself is a
formatter because it's only HTML we want
the IDF a we're not bothered about the
actual document and then the possibility
of your own personal for matters that
you might have chosen to have a
formatter there that says add this to my
wish list that's there's nothing about
that in this page over here that's
purely a part of the functionality and
the for matters that you choose so
that's kind of it really that's some
rdfa and my particular interest as I say
the the user interfaces that can be
built with rdfa I think rdfa is about to
take off finding more and more people
referring to it I think the fact that
verticals particular interest areas like
chemistry could really get value from it
I think that the fact that search
engines could really help them get value
from it in a way that it's probably
difficult to do using traditional kind
of search engine techniques I think is
is quite exciting and then I think the
most important thing for me on the user
interface side is that we're talking
about here a hook on to which other
things can be added very very different
to the sort of cut and paste this into
your blog kind of approach where you're
asking people to sort of link to youtube
or whatever by taking
this bit of markup and dropping it in
the idea of a semantic hook onto which
you can then almost use semantic CSS
it's almost kind of that the fresnel
style for matters that I showed they're
using the semantic information to
display to interact to change the user
experience I think is incredibly
powerful and a very good use of rdfa so
got a little bit of time for questions I
think if anybody has any feel free
there's some links there as well on the
so if you want if you're interested in
more information about rdfa itself then
rdfa dot info is the is the main site
jumping-off point for anything to do
with rdfa implementations discussions
about the status of the documents the
w3c that kind of thing the code that
I've been showing here is all in Google
Code lib hyphen XH it's kind of a
broader project that I'm doing which
encompasses things like xforms
processors smile processors just a
general collection of XHTML
functionality within Ajax libraries and
then the the only reason I put y'all
there is also an open source project
it's the it's the messaging thing that
you saw on the side there that ok yeah
these are these kind of things are
widely adapted
the process well I think the I think
things like the yahoo search monkey
thing will help so they're effectively
saying if you put rdfa into your
document then we can enrich the the user
experience by playing it back out again
so I think that will help because it
will be worth worth while for people to
do it my particular area of interest is
the sort of browser extension that
sidebar that I showed although I ended
on that I was kind of that's where I'm
most excited so I think if we can
produce a set of tools that help people
do things more easily on the desktop
then I think people will also start
putting the metadata into their
documents so for example if if I'm
planning a holiday and this kind of
metadata is in the pages that I'm
browsing and I can just drag them and
then gradually build up my list of
locations over here I think that you
know if those tools are available
obviously it's a lot of good sites that
do that kind of thing online you know in
the site itself but it's it's it's
ultimately you know somebody else has
got your data and if you can start to
build these extensions locally and I
mean my yep so I think the I think that
those kinds of tools I also think there
is I keep using the example of the
chemists but you could pick hundreds of
examples of a vertical where they're
their needs are not the general powerful
search engine like Google so and I think
you know it's either do they build their
own search engine specifically you know
trolling certain blogs and all this kind
of thing or could they provide metadata
that helps the monolithic search engines
to give better results and I'm hoping
that that relationship will also help
rdfa take off
the chemistry I guess I don't know quite
how to answer that because the only
reason I don't quite know how to answer
is because chemists themselves have
actually come to rdfa so I don't know
which part of your question that is is
that did we sell it to them or did they
find it because obviously there are
people who blog in any industry in any
vertical there are people who want to
make their lives easier in any of these
things so for example I saw an article
recently in nature magazine where
they're saying right we want to add more
information to our pages to make them
more useful for say chemists what should
we do and they threw open the discussion
and straightaway people were in there
saying use rdfa use rdfa so yeah but
that first question obviously needs to
be asked but the fact is people are
asking that first question so how do we
make it more usable for people is kind
of an obvious question now so anybody
else any other questions
what kind of the traveling
well I've not tried anything to a
massive level of depth but a couple of
things on that first is that the the
format is run in you know they basically
spawn threads in so far as you can do
with JavaScript and part of this lib XH
project is to create JavaScript features
that can be swapped out if you have
something installed that that is better
so for example with Yao you can display
messages as you saw but if you have a
special component installed you can
actually display messages outside of the
browser similarly with the lib XH if you
have Google gears install which has
threading you know worker pool thing
then it will make use of that and
improve the performance and obviously
once you get into the sidebar then you
can do anything you like because you've
installed the sidebar so you may as well
install a C++ power so that's much
faster but certainly I haven't found any
problems with the page load and in fact
there are many many of these kind of
subsets of this where people are
building extensions that people can put
into their blogs and that which do this
kind of thing but they do it in a very
specific sector so there are ones where
all links will be augmented with a
little icon you move your mouse over the
icon you get a screenshot of the of the
site that the link is referring to well
they're doing pretty much the same thing
they're scanning the document trying to
find information but they're finding
very specific that it's they've invented
their own format so I think these things
already exist in some sense in the page
load cycle and what i'm doing here is
i'm generalizing that i'm saying well
let's find the information and you can
do anything you want now with the the
marker
yeah well that's my that's my next thing
because what i want to be able to do is
persist the data as you say but not just
when i go back there next time have that
data I want to if I go to a completely
different site have their data so for
example if the IDF a tells me that on
the page is a map I don't want to just
know that there's a map I want to go
over to my triple store that I've
persisted so I'm left is sidebar you
know in my mental model of this i want
the sidebar to kind of go off to the
triple store which is in Google gears
and then say well what other location
information have I got so I could add to
the map that's over on the right-hand
side information that's that Paige knows
nothing about so I could be planning a
trip and I could see where for example
friends of mine live nearby or who else
is going to be in the area coming from
the triple store even though the page
itself had no knowledge of him now the
current model is that I can do that
provided I sign up for trip it calm I
sign up this week to tripit calm
somebody else comes along and then you
know Doppler says oh we've added new
features and I'll god I really would
like the doppler features but trip it's
got all my data now and blah blah blah
so you can do those kinds of things to
some extent provided that you hand over
your information to a particular site
and you then use that sign what I'm
trying to do is say well a Maps a map
once I've got a map obviously the
website itself will sprinkle that
information will put its own map
information on because that's the reason
I went to that page but once you've got
the map why not add other location
information that I've got stored and so
yes you're exactly right the persistence
aspect of it is my kind of next next
phase of this and I find that really
exciting yeah so thank you very much
everybody thanks for time
