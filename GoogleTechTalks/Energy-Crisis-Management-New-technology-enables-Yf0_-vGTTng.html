international engineering
relations and I'm responsible for
setting up offices around the world for
Google engineering offices so I came
across this guy's a year ago while
attending an emerging technology forum
for Russian and Ukrainian startups and
we had this idea to bring them in here
and present it to you guys the
technologies that they're working on so
Jim Nicholson is an interim CEO he has
many years of experience in twenty plus
years of experience in ultracapacitors
industry or high-tech industry and most
recently in ultracapacitors and I think
last years he spent at maxvill
technologies and invalid amir and sir he
will be available for questions their
investors in the company so with this
I'm going to head it off the gym Thank
You Lydia will just turn this one off i
think you know he gave me my own well
good afternoon my name is Jim Nickerson
as Lydia mentioned I've been in the
technology industry for more than 20
years much of my career was here in the
valley i was in the semiconductor
industry working for national
semiconductor and XR and others but
about ten years ago i was introduced to
the technology called ultracapacitor i'm
not sure if you've been keeping up with
that this talk is described as energy
crisis management using a new technology
to enable some of the current
alternative energy options that are
being bandied about to call it a new
technology as a little bit of a misnomer
because the first ultracapacitor if you
go back to a radio shack self-help guide
that they published in 1967 they showed
how to build an ultracapacitor using
paper towels and lemon juice so the the
technology the idea of a double-layer
capacitor has been around a long time
it's just been trying to get that
technology to a point where it's
actually usable by other industries
other than people that rear a do Schaech
app publications
so the problem that the ultracapacitor
is trying to address is the fact that as
we have watched the global energy crisis
developed one of the things that's come
out of that is the idea that we need to
find more efficient ways to use the
energy that we have rather it be oil or
solar or wind power we need to be able
to most efficiently use that energy as
its generated so this technology of
ultracapacitors is designed to help
enable that type of technology by
providing a high-power burst capability
to provide fast charging and discharging
type technologies and then also to
enable peak load leveling one of the
biggest problems in the energy industry
is how do you generate power for example
solar power it's easy to get power
during the day but at night it's pretty
difficult so the ultracapacitor is a
technology that on a smaller scale and
even to some extent on that scale
enables you to balance your power and
energy so that you can deliver power at
times when it may not be most
efficiently available so if you look at
that the common technologies you'll see
conventional batteries in the big yellow
galaxy up there and you can see that
looking at that if the left-hand axis is
energy density the bottom axis is power
density so how much energy can you store
versus how much power can you deliver
conventional batteries reside up there
in that yellow galaxy fuel cells as
they're being developed are up even
further up in the left-hand corner a
conventional capacitor which discharges
very quickly can give you a lot of power
but it very quickly so it doesn't have
much energy storage capacity so the
ultracapacitor the red galaxy there lies
in the in the midst of all that as a
technology that will help you bridge
from one application to another many
applications use batteries many use
conventional capacitors
those are often times sized for the
opposite axis for example you may if you
have need a lot of energy capacity but
you have a capacitor type power delivery
requirement you may have to use too
large a capacitor for your application
just to hold the energy you need or you
may have to oversize your battery
because you need to deliver more power
than you want to so this is kind of the
universe that we're talking about
comparing them side by side I won't go
through all this in great detail but if
you look at a battery an ultracapacitor
and a capacitor you can see that there's
orders of magnitudes of difference in
the two columns some of the critical
ones are the cycle life where a battery
can be charged and recharged on the
order of thousands of times
ultracapacitors are in the hundreds of
thousands of times primarily because the
battery is a chemical device and then an
ultracapacitor is a mechanical device
it's just moving ions and pushing them
back and forth so there's no breakdown
of a chemical the efficiency of charging
and discharging in other words if you
charge it and discharge it how much
efficiency can you get in that cycle the
ultracapacitor and the standard
capacitor are much higher than what you
can get out of a battery now there are
some new battery technologies
lithium-ion technologies that are very
expensive that are pushing up the top
end of that eighty-five percent for
batteries but you still have to keep in
mind that most of these applications are
cost driven so you have to keep that in
mind the other thing is because of that
the mechanics of charging a battery
typically takes hours to charge where an
ultracapacitor takes seconds and a
capacitor you can do almost
instantaneously and another nice feature
for the ultracapacitors you can operate
at much lower temperatures so if you're
in a car is having a hard time starting
with a battery you could easily start it
with an ultracapacitor if you're living
in Minnesota this is a kind of a model
of how an ultracapacitor works it's much
like a battery you have a positive and
negative electrode you have charged ions
and a
in the electrolyte when you close the
switch they go to the opposite poles and
they're stored there the important part
is these this is the electrode the
important part is how much any of these
ions can use store in the electrode so
we're a battery might have a plate there
and the and the charge is stored on the
flat surface of a plate an
ultracapacitor has almost like foam or a
sponge so there's all sorts of nooks and
crannies so you can store much more you
can put many more ions in against the
electrode hence the higher ability to
store energy this is an equivalent
circuit and all that's meant to show you
is that in an ultracapacitor because
you've driven those ions into this
three-dimensional electrode it takes a
little bit to pull out of it so you have
some internal resistance to pulling that
out so you need to think of an
ultracapacitor as being capacitors and
resistors in series when you build an
ultracapacitor you have to current
collectors electrolyte your electrode is
your porous normally carbon type
material you see there is the yellow
circles and then the electrolyte is what
is immersing the whole thing there's a
separator between the two so the
separator is what's keeping your
positive and negative apart once you've
started charging it now the one of the
things that you have to keep in mind is
that this electrode material is very
dense and this is what's would normally
in a other industries we call the
starved cell in that there's so little
electrolyte in there that if you punch a
hole in it nothing will drip out it's so
starved so what are the major
applications for using an ultracapacitor
if you think of an applications use of
power many types of applications and
i'll use an old one but we are talking
today that it's a little out
moted because blackberry has gone well
beyond that but their original two-way
page or the motorola two-way pager you
would have a constant requirement for
power and then you press the button and
all of a sudden you get a burst of power
requirement to do a transmit and then it
wait for a little bit then you'd burst
again there are many types of
applications that you could apply to
this you could apply this to it a car
cars traveling along also you need to
accelerate you step on the gas and you
need a burst of power so this this is
just kind of a generic description of
what an application might look like and
normally that application has some
constant power supply a battery and
engine fuel cell just about anything
that's applying purposely a standard
level of power and you have to size the
power so that it's always above your
minimum requirement the bottom red line
there and you want to try to accommodate
your burst requirements so maybe in
reality you know eighty percent of the
bursts of power required in this
application might actually come in below
the black line but it's the occasional
one that goes above that is really going
to damage your energy supply so what the
ultracapacitor does when you put that
together with this system is the
ultracapacitor stands by and fills those
gaps whenever it's required now it may
not seem intuitive but if that read if
the black line is a battery a battery
has a resistance to delivering power so
you just can't say give me X number of
watts immediately because the battery
has resistance and it resists
discharging that power you've probably
seen that many types of applications the
ultracapacitor because it's resistance
is so much lower than a battery when put
in in parallel with the battery that
load sucks the energy out of the
ultracapacitor rather than the battery
so the battery goes along and doesn't
even know what happened because the
ultracapacitor took care of it and we'll
talk about that effect a little a little
later now there's the opposite side of
this spectrum
what if your power requirement is
constant what if you're a hospital what
if you're any type of computer system or
you know raid backup type system etc we
all know that the power company is not
very good at giving us very clean power
now on this scale these dips might be
milliseconds rather than seconds or
minutes or it could be a brownout type
of situation so in this case you you
sighs your your your application is
sized right at your constant power but
if the power drops off once again the
ultracapacitor will discharge to fill in
that sag in the available power so in
this this is a type of case where you
would have a power requirement and the
incoming power for some reason crackles
or dips or goes through some sort of
disruption and you can't afford to have
that happen so you have an
ultracapacitor in line with that power
and when it sees all the sudden that the
Power has gone away it discharges so it
fills those gaps so this type of
technology can then be applied to a wide
variety of applications it can be
applied to consumer electronics where
you have something like a digital camera
that when you flash when you take the
picture you have a surge of power
because it needs to write all those bits
all of a sudden normally it's just
sitting there keeping the display open
you you have applications like wind
power solar power and even standard
hydroelectric power plants or coal-fired
power plants where you need to
temporarily store energy in order to be
able to deliver it in a smooth way they
would like to be on the opposite end of
that last slide where they get paid more
for cleaner energy delivery so if they
have factories that have critical
processes in their path they want to
make sure that they deliver the highest
the cleanest power that they can without
any dips or jobs so they would like to
put ultracapacitors right outside their
door so that as their feeding power out
they can take care of those ups and
downs themselves they charge more for
cleaner power so for them it's an
economic incentive if we look at the
global market it's a growing the
technology has been around for a long
time but people have had a hard time
implementing it in a way that is
cost-effective and we'll let these
applications take good advantage of it
this year you'll see it basically this
kind of a breakdown between consumer
industrial and automotive or
transportation type applications and
we'll describe those a little better but
it's going to be growing significantly
and you'll see that the what's
forecasted to grow the most is the
automotive or transportation side with
the advent of electric vehicles hybrid
electric vehicles you know when I when I
got first got involved ten years ago
with ultracapacitors we were talking
about electric vehicles and how
ultracapacitors help them as we went
through the next five years and the
hybrid started becoming more of the what
the automotive world wanted to go to we
got more excited because hybrids use
ultracapacitors even better than
electric vehicles do so as the market
develops the only thing holding it back
is it too costly to implement on the
consumer electronic side we've talked
about some of these types of
applications and where the
ultracapacitor is really pumping power
into the application either to on a
small level balance the power
requirements do the do the power
balancing but one of the major things to
take note of here is that the
ultracapacitor because it can be cycled
so many times it has the ability to be
recharged almost it will so if you have
a burst power application that might be
sending a transmitted to image to a GSM
satellite for the Air Force has radio
emergency radios it send a one-second
burst
to their satellite every minute so if
you have a long one second bursts but
then it's quiet for 59 seconds if you
put a battery in next to it you you get
the ultracapacitor to provide that burst
and then the battery just kind of
trickle charges the ultracapacitor back
up to capacity over the next 59 seconds
it's ready to go and boom off you go the
battery never gets degraded because it's
being having those high power
requirements pressed on it so it's an
application that's as an example of how
the ultracapacitor put in parallel with
batteries even the little sea cell D
cell type batteries if there's a burst
requirement we've we've demonstrated on
cell phones and toys and and other
applications that you can extend the
life of the battery by up to four times
solely on the basis of the fact that the
battery is not seeing those high power
requirements and having to charge and
discharge I mean most all battery tech
chemistry's are going to degrade over
time and that's why you have limited
cycle life on a battery is because it's
constantly degrading that chemical
reaction this that's building the energy
that you're trying to discharge in the
form of power so on a smaller scale
there's many applications in the
consumer electronics world we talked
about industrial power management once
again this is a case where the the power
companies see a big advantage I've spent
several trips gone out into the fields
of Utah where you have power grids that
are stretching for miles and there's
nothing in between the two relay sites
for either power or telecommunication
sites and you get out there and there's
this there's this shed that's probably
twenty by twenty by ten feet tall and
it's full of lead acid batteries and
those batteries are sitting there so
that if there is a drop on the on the
power grid that could potentially start
cascading they need to hold it up as
long as they can normally so that they
can start a generator to start feeding
power back into the to the
rid so if the batteries if this stack of
lead acid batteries hundreds of let acid
batteries start leaking or they have
that bad batteries in the middle of the
stack or whatever the power companies
and the telecommunication companies
spend ungodly amounts of money with
people travel around in trucks doing
nothing but maintaining those stacks of
batteries and they're expensive and
they're ecologically hazardous having
all that lead out there and they leak
all the time in the case of the the
power grid what we did was we set up a
fuel cell next to an ultracapacitor put
it on the grid the we just took right
off of the power lines we just trickle
charged the ultracapacitor so that it
always maintained its full charge and
the total box of ultracapacitors is
about the size of this table here so we
had a box of ultracapacitors being
constantly held it at full charge just
by trickle charging off of the off the
power line put a fuel cell next to it
now the fuel cell because a fuel cell
generates power based on generally
pressure of hydrogen or whatever you're
using in this in the fuel cell if the
power goes away off the grid all of a
sudden there's no power available so the
batteries or the ultracapacitors would
have to be there to start the fuel cell
well the ultracapacitor is great for
delivering power for a couple of minutes
long enough to get the fuel cell
pressurized to the point where it's
delivering sufficient power that it can
run now you have a set here of both a
fuel cell and an ultracapacitor set that
needs basically no maintenance activity
because the few of the ultracapacitors
of charge and discharge and be fine for
you know a hundred years and hundreds of
thousands of cycles and the fuel cell is
pretty much inert until you fire it up
and start pressurizing the hydrogen so
of course after you do that you'd have
to go out and refill your hydrogen tank
but that's about it
and the other major application is
transportation we've kind of focused on
the automotive side of transportation
here but the the automotive world
includes things like forklifts and many
other trucks buses etc the ability of
the LG capacitor to provide the burst
power and do fast charging is really
critical to making an HEV hybrid
electric vehicle successful because a
hybrid electric vehicle needs you need
the in order to sell these things you
have to have some performance so you got
to sell it to people that know when they
step on the gas it's going to jump and
go forward but you also want to capture
the braking energy in a hybrid electric
vehicle or an electric vehicle your
wheels are electric motors driven by
electric motors so when you go to slow
down an electric vehicle you don't apply
brake pads and lose all that energy you
take you reverse the motor and you pull
energy out of the wheel so what you're
doing there is you're charging the
ultracapacitor so breaking of a hybrid
electric vehicle is charging the
ultracapacitor now if you've gotten down
to the point where you've actually
stopped which is always a good idea now
it's time to re-accelerate well you have
a fully charged ultracapacitor sitting
there with nothing to do but discharge
and give you as much power as you need
so we went up to Los Angeles and put a
300 volt ultracapacitor system on the
top of a city bus up in Los Angeles now
this was a diesel hybrid so it had a
diesel engine a small diesel engine and
electric motors in the wheels and
batteries we put ultracapacitors up on
the roof of this thing about 300 cells
that were size of australian beer cans
and that just doing that by feeding the
the power through the ultracapacitors we
were able to demonstrate that well
you've all seen a city bus come up to a
bus stop and then try to leave the first
thing you get is this big black smoke
cloud as the bus tries to get away from
the curve
well because the ultracapacitor was
there it just discharged the
ultracapacitor so the the diesel engine
didn't even have to rev up it just
stayed in idle the ultracapacitor
provided enough power to push the bus
away from the curb and get it up to
about 20 miles an hour at that point
that diesel engine just kind of came in
on a smooth accelerate and accelerated
and then took over driving the bus down
to the next bus stop where the
ultracapacitor would be recharged and
the whole cycle would repeat well the
the the the efficiency of capturing that
braking energy and a bus and feeding it
back into the drivetrain lowered the
emissions of that diesel hybrid which
already had a small diesel by sixty
percent so it had a dramatic effect on
how much fuel and how much emissions
were going through that diesel engine
now there's another part of the the
automotive world that seldom gets a
whole lot of attention from the
ultracapacitor guys but it's very
important most of the major automotive
companies are now looking at putting in
high voltage subsystems typically it's
42 volts and that's because in your car
you have a 12-volt battery or maybe a 16
depending on your car but you have a
12-volt battery and every time you roll
up your power window or do your power
locks or turn on your radio or do this
that or the other thing you are pulled
ragging down on that battery system so
the battery has got to deal with all of
those extraneous power requirements
going forward the ultracapacitor put in
series with a small battery 42 volt
battery allows you to reduce the current
runs you know you don't you can do it
with thinner cable and you can power all
the safety things independent of the car
battery so it becomes not only a more
efficient use of power and energy inside
the vehicle it also adds to the safety
because if you have an accident and you
disabled the battery you have backup
power normally located close to where
the thing is going to happen
you have your your window motor has the
ultracapacitor right there you know we
have we saw a demonstration at Ford one
time where recently somebody had driven
their car into a lake for some reason
and they couldn't get their power window
down because as soon as the front of the
car got in the water it started shorting
out their electrical system their power
window wouldn't go down but the
ultracapacitor sitting there right on
the path of the window motor doesn't
matter it immediately took the window
down there's in all the time I've spent
with the automotive companies there's
probably a hundred examples of how node
power can provide a big advantage to a
an automobile here's an example of how
the Honda electric vehicle uses an
ultracapacitor the motor power that you
see there you know that's that's the
motor running so those are the wheel
motors in some so your ultra capacitor
when you accelerate the vehicle because
here's power going up and here's the
acceleration curve so as your speed is
going up the ultra capacitor is
discharging to support the fuel cell as
it comes up to its its load and so the
two combined allow you to do a quick
acceleration and then you drive along
cruising along until you start to break
and at that point you start shutting
down your fuel cell you start your speed
starts dropping dramatically but your
ultracapacitor starts charging so now
your ultra capacitor is charging down in
this area because it got depleted during
this cycle it was back down to zero
power now it's going to recharge and be
back and ready to accelerate again so
I've talked to for about all these
different applications and you know why
aren't these things out there and
everything already they should be I mean
RadioShack showed us how to do it you
know 45 years ago so the problem is that
the issue become
how much is the cost of the delivered
power from a specific energy density now
as I said early on you can always
deliver power but from what energy
source so if you need to have really
high peaks of power and you can't live
without it you need to size your battery
large enough so that it will supply that
power peak on demand if you don't you
you can't get that power out of the
battery now the other issues of the
battery cycle life and everything and
how much that hurts the battery or
immaterial at this point what we need to
do is worry about is the capaz de costo
putting the capacitor in there enough to
offset the cost of the larger battery
that you had to put in their combined
with the weight that you're carrying the
efficiencies the miles per hour the
miles per gallon all the other economic
reasons why you would want to worry
about size weight and density also the
efficiency of the charge and discharge
cycle you know if you do it on how often
do you have to change your car battery
you know maybe not that frequently
anymore they've improved that technology
but you have to an ultracapacitor will
go for hundreds and hundreds of
thousands of cycles without being
changed so there's a lot of charge
discharge efficiency that's going to
benefit the application now it may not
be so obvious in a car but how often do
you change the batteries in your pagers
or other applications that are using
burst power I alluded earlier to the
temperature range ultracapacitors
because of their starved electrolyte
will operate down in the minus 55 level
even the military both in Russia and in
the United States has for several years
been looking at ultracapacitors testing
ultracapacitors as emergency start cold
weather starting so you just throw it
into the battery box of a diesel truck
and when you when it's too cold for the
battery to start the truck you just flip
over and start it with the
ultracapacitor and off you go by the
time the truck warms up battery warms up
everything's fine then you recharge the
ultracapacitor
total PSYC life and then safety safety
you know as you're pulling energy out of
a battery you're stressing it chemically
so it warms up you get very hot
batteries when you have a lot of power
requirements on them the ultracapacitor
will allow you to over to lower the
overall system temperature simply
because the the ultracapacitor generates
no heat when it's discharging so a PCT
the company that we're working with what
we have tried to do and what's been
developed by this team based in Kiev is
a new implementation of the
ultracapacitor technology where we can
achieve a higher power density the
ability to deliver those peak powers
based on modifying the current collector
that if you recall in that earlier
diagram we modify the current collector
in a way that reduces the resistance of
the current going through so it makes it
a much more efficient power delivering
device the same team is also devised a
nanoporous electrode which is a carbon
electrode that they can precisely
determine the size of the pores in there
make them fit the ions that are being
pushed in and out so they can optimize
the amount of energy that that electrode
can store so the tube together means
that you can deliver more power than
competing ultracapacitor technologies
and you can store more energy than
competing makassar technologies and then
again the low internal resistance helps
with keeping the overheating issue under
control if you look at ultracapacitors
that are being delivered around the
world there's two types of
ultracapacitors some are normally called
super capacitors and those are delivered
by companies like Panasonic a lot of the
Japanese consumer electronics companies
have small super capacitors now they are
very inefficient in the terms of their
power density they're very cheap to make
and very easy to make but they have no
power or energy density capability
speak up so that they they do work in
certain applications you'll find one and
everybody's BCR you know I remember when
I years not too long ago you know if you
had a brownout in your house you had to
go around and reset all your clocks we
set your VCR you know reset everything
that didn't have a battery backup in it
and now they put these little cheap
ultra super capacitors into a VCR so if
you have a glitch in power it'll ride
through that power glitch for 20 well as
many as 10 or 20 seconds but beyond that
it's depleted and you'll have to go
change you know fix the clock when the
power comes back but you can ride
through changing out the data reside I
know I'm always looking for
ultracapacitors I found when I installed
an automatic thermostat in my house that
had a couple batteries in it when it
gave me the low battery signal I pulled
the batteries out I was going to lose
all my programming but there was an
ultracapacitor in there and if it
weren't for the fact that i would
habitually drop the batteries and not
find the new ones fast enough i could
have changed the batteries without
losing the programming the the APC t
technology if you look at this the
ultracapacitor mass is on the left hand
and the power delivered to a load and
kilowatts is on the on the bottom axis
the APC T versus the current high power
ultracapacitors like those made by
Maxwell technologies the a PCT
prototypes deliver at the high end here
at about one quarter of the mass and in
the case of ultracapacitors one quarter
of the mass is one-quarter the size is
one quarter of the cost in very general
sense the further down you get the more
packaging becomes part of the issues so
you lose some of that advantage the
further down you get but on the high end
where you're looking at automotive and
industrial in particular that
significant difference translates into a
much better cost structure than is
currently available right now to get a
302 get a 1 kilowatt ultracapacitor on
the current
current marketplace that sales the price
is a little over three hundred dollars
and coming down slowly when I was at
Maxwell technologies six seven years ago
I was selling a 1 kilowatt device for
two thousand five hundred dollars size
of an Australian beer can now it's
gotten down to the three hundred dollar
range but you need about a hundred of
them to make a hybrid electric vehicle
work so a hundred times three hundred
dollars isn't very conducive to hybrid
electric vehicles if you come down and
look at this yellow yellow one that's
the APC t cost to manufacture the same
one kilowatt so you can see that we've
really broken under the fifty dollar per
1 kilowatt module range and have the
opportunity to keep going down so what
we're doing is making a major jump in
the cost structure of the technology
that we hope will allow all these
applications that are taking advantage
of new energy alternatives to be become
more successful and more efficient a PCT
the company that's doing it was a u.s.
registered company formed by a group of
Ukrainian scientists in Kiev over fifty
man years of experience I've worked with
parts of this team over the last ten
years it was the seed investment came
from tech invest a VC firm based in Kiev
and we're and we're working on how to
get this to market in the most effective
ways and we're looking at joining and
doing strategic partnerships with some
US and Asian based companies that are
into manufacturing batteries and
ultracapacitors and also developing our
own manufacturing capabilities both in
the Ukraine and in the US and some of
the testing that's been done dr. Andy
Berke out at UC Davis's is one of the
Guru's that I've known for 20 years that
does all the analysis and he's in fact
getting ready to do a presentation in
florida next month that will show a pc
tease technology compared against the
other competitors so that's our
presentation we're happy to take any
questions these are the two locations
and one in Virginia and the other the
main office in Ukraine I'm out of San
Diego and we're working with I'm working
with this team to see how we can develop
the US marketplace and get it rolling
we'd be happy to take any questions and
the team from a PCT is here to answer
technical questions and we're open to
any of your ideas or suggestions yeah
see ya I'm trying to get rid of a let
acid battery 10 and our 14 volts what
would be the size and cost of something
like that if I just went to all well the
first problem you're going to run into
is getting rid of it because it's got
lead and so yeah but you have to recycle
it I don't know that I can sighs the
ultra fest 10 amps 10 amp hours
you know I can't answer that question
off the top my head but I can we can why
don't you see me afterwards and we can
sit down with a pencil and pencil it out
inner thighs that I can get a handle on
ice the size of thoughts well a standard
one of the larger cells made by almost
all the manufacturers right now is a 20
roughly a 2500 farad ultracapacitor a
2500 fared ultracapacitor is roughly one
kilowatt of delivered power and it can
be delivered over a different lengths of
time if we go back to let me see if they
can go back to that
so on this slide what you see and I'll
let out of acid battery generally falls
within that battery complex the power
delivery is basically watts and the
energy is watt hours so the if you if
you were what we'd have to do is
calculate the white hours and wat and
the delivery capability and by going
through the math from your amps to
create the size that you would need yeah
pastors are they stand up to
Oh thing capacitors have been tested
pretty dramatically the because you're
really only moving ions back and forth
you don't have that chemical or any
chemical reaction going on so you really
don't have any internally generated heat
in an ultracapacitor now historically
the ultracapacitor is being made by
maxwell and others have used acetyl
nitrile as being the electrolyte in in
that cell and that include acetyl
nitrile includes now the word slips my
mind what's the poison a poisonous
substance so you don't want to get it on
you we always made the argument that the
way you would I can't remember the word
now the way you would clean up a spill
would be with carbon cloth and we had
the carbon cloth built into the whole
tree capacitor but the because it's a
starved cell there's no physical I mean
the only physical reaction to being
crushed would be the potential to leak
electrolyte there's because there's no
chemical reaction going on there's no
danger of explosion or anything like
that the failure mechanism for most
ultracapacitors that have been tested by
a variety of companies is that they
slowly leak you know they'll develop a
pinhole leak and they'll they'll get
salt forming on the outside of the cell
Honda when I was working with Maxwell we
had a joint development agreement with
honda the honda HEV and the Honda
electric vehicle or the and the Toyota
Prius are the major production vehicles
that have ultracapacitors at this point
and in testing they were driving nails
through the ultracapacitor cells just to
see what would happen so it is proved to
be a very safe technology in automotive
applications and and other smaller
applications yes
charge the we did some tests with Disney
because they wanted to put
ultracapacitors into their partner their
parking lot trans and determine that a
good ultracapacitor will hold its charge
above ninety percent for 72 hours or
longer they do tend to they will leak I
mean that those ions will slowly start
coming out of the electrode however you
can charge it back up almost
instantaneously so one of the
requirements or in most applications
you'll often see a recharging capability
fairly close I don't know if a PCT has
demonstrated any charge holding testing
recently but generally you can hold it
above ninety percent charge for at least
72 hours they'll fully discharge over
depending on the manufacturer several
weeks so it's not it's not an energy
storage device for long-term storage
the limiting factor on energy density is
how much of that ion can you put into
the electrode so it's become a real
science to determine if you picture the
electrode is being like a sponge the
electrolyte is flowing through here and
as you charge it those ions are working
their way into this sponge because they
need as much surface area as possible so
the energy density is the total surface
area that's available when you charge it
so as many ions as you can put up
against the the electrode if you imagine
a flat plate electrode you've got a flat
surface you in two dimensions you put as
many ions on there as you can with an
ultracapacitor electrode a
three-dimensional surface you cram as
many of them in there as you can you
have the problem that if it's if they
have to go in too far if they tunnel in
way in there then they're going to be
encountering and creating resistance in
getting out when you discharge it so you
have to balance the surfer total surface
of the electrode which is your energy
density factor by your desire to deliver
power which is the resistance to getting
them out of that so that's one of the
things that you do excuse me with
ultracapacitors is you balance what you
want in terms of energy density against
what you want to deliver is power so
it's and they've made some pretty good
strides over the last ten years I mean
it's gone from well a PCT is
demonstrated a dramatic new ability to
deliver power by having this nanoporous
electrode and this etched specialized
current collector that when combined
together both reduce the internal
resistance and provide more surface area
so you're in dramatically increasing
your energy density and lowering your
resistance at the same time
okay one of the things that the one
thing that an ultracapacitor will never
do is replace a battery that becomes a
matter of cost from a technology
standpoint it's been demonstrated over
and over again that you can reduce the
volume of battery by a factor of four in
some applications that i have high peak
power requirements but it costs you you
know ten times the cost of the batteries
so you could be replacing batteries for
you know 50 years before you pay back
the ultracapacitor so it ends up being a
cost issue you know the technology has
been there it's just a matter of can you
build it and have it reliably deliver
the power you need in that application
and also can you make it small enough
physically to fit that application so
all the all the applications and I you
know I come from a marketing background
so I've I look at the ultracapacitor as
being only a tool to solve an
application problem so if the
application can be solved with the
ultracapacitor if it took an
ultracapacitor as big as this table to
make a two-way pager work well and make
it so you never had to change the
alkaline battery in a two-way pager okay
that's the starting point now let's get
this ultra capacitor down in size by
improving the energy density and the
power delivery capability let's get that
ultracapacitor down in size and cost to
make it realistically go into that
two-way pager so much of that has been
done except for the size and cost aspect
you're right it's has another order of
magnitude to go and that's what a PCT is
trying to demonstrate now with its
prototypes is that they have made that
order magnitude jump almost an order of
magnitude jump 4x the power in a given
volume so the APC ultracapacitor is is
positioned to be one that could enable
all of the many of these applications
not because it's more powerful more
Dance has higher energy density but
because it's can do the same power
delivery in one quarter of the volume it
takes one quarter of the material it
takes roughly one quarter of the cost so
the the real application requirement has
been met with something that's one
quarter of the size and roughly one
quarter of the cost so it enables then
that application to go forward
automotive Apple electric vehicles as i
mentioned need about 300 volts worth of
cells ultracapacitors I actually never
made it into this presentation but I
ultracapacitors like a battery and then
it's pretty much limited at 2.7 volts
per cell or so so you need to put about
a hundred into a car to make it work so
right now the hybrid electric vehicle
wants that battery pack to be about one
cubic foot and it needs to cost less
than three hundred dollars right now
it's about three cubic feet and it costs
about twenty thousand dollars so we're
trying to get there yes what is your
first standard commercial product what
size how many farads is the cap
and how many of your so head on and
I have to let you answer that
what Jim was looking about this is
technology which is now cut seeking
personal to establish yet singular magic
has been so quick answer is the
following when the stage for building
the manufacturing plant but what the
stage is none of this company that it
has developed ap protected proprietary
technology and prototypes which would
test it and perform these results and
now we are talking about what is the
right business strategy to be because
there are different niches there are
very small medium-sized life
ultracapacitors and they have different
muscles and difficulties and different
markets and each of these niches means
different model of ultracapacitor
therefore your question it was not easy
to ask from let's say from from the
Tribune because it's necessarily to
calculate what is the real need to be
satisfied that is us the first volume
production Kutner the first let's say
manufacturing capacity that we are not
building it will be about safety
thousand units per year until it will be
ready till the end of spring next spring
next year why I'm asking higher
potential client what how many dollars
for water sent to the wat these costs
you know that's got to compete with
batteries where you always have the
option
at least in stationary applications of
just buying more batteries to meet your
power budget I would answer the
following if you have seen the already
existing market for ultracapacitors
which are very expensive it's already
about three hundred million dollars and
it's growing annually not less than
thirty percent during class three years
what we possess this technology which is
at least 10 times cheaper if you compare
costs what will be the market price when
I think about about but it's cheaper and
possess performance advantage compared
to already existing to the market
capacitors therefore it can compete with
for existing market as well it can
create the new demand from other
potential class which would buy it if it
will be not so expensive it is now is it
for a gym yes my statement well I was as
he asked that question I would it was
this was the one slide that we actually
took out this presentation because we
didn't think anybody would ask that
question so this is a slide that shows
the current ultracapacitors and a PCT
the left-hand axis is dollars per watt
hour and the bottom axis is dollars per
kilowatt so you've got energy and energy
and on the y and power on the X so the
dollars per watt hour are for the APC t
technology about 10 on the order of
twenty dollars per watt hour whereas the
there in the order of ten dollars per
kilowatt from a power standpoint versus
competing technologies if you just for
as an example go to the way right hand
side the most energy efficient
Standard Oil capacitor on the market
we're in the same power or energy level
wat dollars for watt hour is much higher
cost per watt hour so that's from our
standpoint from the AP CT standpoint
that's this is the money slide for us
this is it's not the technology but
that's the money slide I would I would
like in my name is Lydia maybe we did
I'm partner was taken West which has
invested into this project I would put
it in a very simple way we are not
competing with any kind of batteries at
all what batteries do they provide power
what a PCT what power cap does provide a
energy a PCT provides provides power so
it works together with battery it does
not compete with with battery there are
four batteries are better for storing
jewels okay ap city is great in
providing watts and they are not
competing with each other for your car
you you have a big battery like 10
pounds or even 20 pounds because you
need to this battery needs to provide
you with power it has a lot more energy
than your car requires but you need to
have such big battery because you need
to have large surface to make sure your
300 mps which are used by your starter
are in place if you have power capacitor
which is twice or even four times less
and size and the battery and the battery
which is 42 times less and size they
will fit together and they will work
like a like a power supply unit for the
car so we are not competing with
batteries we are talking different
languages for the same reason yeah we
appreciate your attention and will be
here
