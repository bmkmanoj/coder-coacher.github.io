technical writer here at Google I work
in enterprise so I write some of our
public facing documentation on google
apps and lately I've been writing on
Android and Chrome OS so but today I'm
going to be talking about my writing
outside of work and just give you a
little overview of the talk first i'm
going to talk give you a little bit of
background on Jorge Luis Borges the
Argentinian author that I wrote my book
on then I'm going to cover a little bit
about my research in the self-publishing
and also why I chose specifically to
self-publish as opposed to more
traditional means of publishing then I'm
going to talk a little bit about the
self publishing process how I actually
printed and made my book and that will
lead into a little bit of the print
verse ebook debate and then I'll give a
very short reading from my book and then
I'll have a QA so that's a little bit
for the structure of the talk so to give
you a little bit of background on Jorge
Luis portes that's the Argentinian
author pictured above in the very big
enlarge photo and that's me with Maria
kodama his widow so bore has lived from
eighteen ninety nine to nineteen eighty
six and he's considered the national
writer of Argentina he was the precursor
to the boom movement in Latin America
and he wrote a number of kind of
fantastic stories stories which
influenced a lot of writers who came
later and who wrote in the sort of
magical realist style and some call him
an early post modernist and sort of the
premise of my book is that or has wrote
fake book reviews of books that didn't
exist and so what I did is I took one of
these fake books mentioned in Pierre
Menard author the quijote and I actually
wrote this book and so that's why I have
this funny title for my book papers for
the suppression of reality because that
was the it was a French title that he
used in
in Pierre Menard author the Quixote and
so I call this the it's loosely
translated from the French in English so
that's a little bit of background so I'm
going to talk a little bit about how i
went from my 2007 trip to buenos aires
to my first book reading and sort of
what was the process in between so again
so as part of the research so here i am
in Port heza sly brary in Buenos Aires
he was the national librarian of
Argentina and so kind of the the
background is on 07 I went down to
Buenos Aires because I had studied boar
has in his writing for most of my
undergrad career at UC Berkeley and
while I was there there was people
didn't really know if Maria kodama or
his as widow was still alive when I went
around and asked and they said bore has
passed away 1986 so they didn't really
know if she was still alive but I ended
up meeting her at the jorge luis borges
International Foundation which was
actually a few blocks from where I was
staying so this is me in a completely
unstaged photo researching i frequented
a lot of the book shops talk with people
people had really fascinating stories
about their experiences with borquez and
because he passed away when I was two I
didn't really have the experience to
really meet and chat with him but it was
fascinating talking with people and 10
shires about their their memories and
stories of him so segwaying into
self-publishing so I looked into a lot
of different methods because in the past
I I interned and volunteered it
McSweeney's publishing in San Francisco
they're a small independent publisher
and they put out a lot of very unique
books I also worked at pearson Higher
Education which is the world's largest
textbook publisher so they're very
traditional publishing house but then I
research kind of non-traditional ways if
I didn't want to go with a
manhattan-based large publishing house
what what could I do so this
right here is the espresso Book Machine
which was actually here in the main
Google lobby where what you do is you
could find like an out of copyright book
on google books and you could just
essentially hit print and within five
minutes the completed book would fall
out of this this slot right here so it
is pretty incredible exhibit and then I
I met one of the inventors there and we
we talked quite a bit it was real
fascinating like talking about how we
develop this espresso Book Machine but
unfortunately the machine that was on
display in the lobby cost 150 thousand
dollars so it's quite an investment so
unless you're a very large institution
or maybe like Harvard bookstore you know
New York Public Library something like
that it was a little out of my range
supposedly like the the cheaper version
runs around 100 grand including the the
two printers that you need but it's
still a little outside of my budget I
was looking to I wanted to print a
thousand copies of my book for somewhere
between 2000 and 3000 dollars so okay so
going ahead so basically I chose not to
go the traditional publishing route and
I decided to self-publish and I
specifically wanted a hardcover like a I
mean a hard copy because I know and then
I'd get a you know ebook to complement
it the reason I chose to go with the
print book is because when i was working
at McSweeney's publishing some of the
editors sort of had a philosophy that
often the presentation of the book is
sometimes as important as the content
itself and i really wanted to get some
good layout in design in the book and I
had some other features that I thought
would kind of enhance the books such as
I created the world's largest and most
difficult jorge luis portes themed
crossword puzzle so this is in the back
of my book and for the e-book I you know
you can't include it but it doesn't
really have the same effect and actually
had the Googler Tyler hinman help me out
with this he laid out the grid needs the
the former national crossword puzzle
champion so I had a little bit of help
with that so so moving on so this right
here I decided that I wanted to use a
hundred percent cotton archival quality
paper paper that last for hundreds of
years so I ended up doing some paper
sourcing I found xpedx in berkeley had
some of the best rate also for very
special editions in my book I wanted to
do a reproduction of this 52 inch x 42
inch map of buenos aires which is
actually part of one of my stories and i
found to do a reproduction at that size
it costs quite a bit of money but it
just happened that a neighbor of mine
back in berkeley has a printer to do the
job and so I printed out some some
large-scale reproductions of this really
fantastic map basically this is just so
you can get an idea i ended up reducing
the map in half because it was a little
bit too big and unwieldy at the 52 inch
original size
so now moving on to printing the actual
book I needed to print 65,000 pages to
make the thousand copies of the book and
it turns out that my cousin in
Sacramento runs a print shop so he has
hundreds of laser printers and so this
is me I was very happy we finally
printed the first successful copy it
actually took a bit of trial and error
to get thee because it's a duplex
printing in booklet format so in order
to print it in the correct order often
page 1 was next to page 114 and it was a
bit complicated to get the printing down
just right but basically what what I'm
saying in this section is that you know
where there's a will there's a way that
if you have you just need to you know
pull together what resources you have
what ideas you have and you can you know
make your book a reality so I ran a good
portion of the manuscript just off of
regular laser printers so there's some
of the manuscript so this is my cousin
and actually printed all 65 thousand
pages on recycled toner so my cousin
he's pro at remanufacturing toner
cartridges so he gets all these
defective cartridges sent to his
warehouse and then he would actually
take two broken cartridges and he
diagnose what's wrong you know one was
missing mag roller or it you know the
the chip on it was broken and then he
would you know take the working parts
from one and then basically create a new
cartridge and so some copies of my book
they're actually printed on mickr
cartridges which which is this black
toner that has iron in it it's actually
magnetic toner and it's what you use to
print checks with because he'd been sent
these giant cartridges and he was able
to you know build a working cartridge
out of it and I was able to run maybe
like 10,000 pages off it
thats how is able to keep my my bottom
line very low okay and now moving on to
the actual book assembly process this is
a friend of mine Hillary she's at the
book cutting so I'll just walk you
through real quickly through the the
actual binding process so so cousin in
Sacramento is the print shop and then my
uncle in Berkeley is a bookbinder so I
was able to use his equipment in his
warehouse to basically go in with some
family and friends and to you know bind
and assemble these thousand copies so
basically the page was printed on eight
and a half by 11 paper but then to get
the final book this size we use this
paper cutter and it was like a
guillotine just sliced it in half and
then to get the cover he had this gold
foil printer which is pretty cool it yet
prints and foil there's my sister
helping with some folding there's my dad
so basically after you slice it in half
you need to assemble the pages into a
booklet this is the actual binding strip
machine right here and it does spine
printing and so yeah so basically so
here's the stacks of the the booklets
and then they just need the the binding
strip on it and the way it works with
this fastback machine is that this trip
has glue on it and this machine like
super heats the glue and you drop the
you know the loose pages in and then it
inserts the binding strip and it super
heats it and then binds it together and
it's a very secure bind so there's a
little shot and then it only takes maybe
like a minute or so for it to to seal
and then you put it on the back shelf to
select the glue cool so then here are
some of the completed books there's a
friend Ben
so basically I just assembled friends
and family and have them help me out oh
and this in the back this is my uncle
dick who's the blinding master sort of
interesting story is when I went to him
and I said you know Uncle Dick I you
know I'd like to make a thousand copies
of this book of short stories that I
wrote and he was like well do you want
to do you know perfect buying saddle
stitch side stitch hardcover softcover
you know he listed off like 15 different
binding styles and I said you know I
want just whatever is simple easy to do
and so he was a great help and then
there I am with the family and then this
photo is a little bit about sort of like
in the realm of self-publishing when
you're doing it all yourself I don't if
you notice but it I'm actually missing
the pee on the keyboard and then I
swapped it out the cue from this side
because in the in the last stages of
editing and revising my manuscript my
keyboard broke but I just had to keep
going and it's sort of a metaphor that
you know you're going to encounter a lot
of roadblocks in the process but you
just have to be innovative think of a
way you know what's the workaround how
can I keep going with this and so if you
look in the manuscript there's probably
very little usage of the letter Q
because I didn't have it on my keyboard
but I had to have the letter P because
it's it's in my in the title so so there
so that's a little a free presentation
on the actual physical making of the
book so next I want to talk a little bit
about you know why print verse ebook and
I don't view them as mutually exclusive
because I do have a version of the book
on Google ebooks I tried to put the book
exactly how I designed it using Adobe
InDesign on Google ebooks but I
encountered but a difficulty because
when you export from InDesign into the
ePub format
it puts it into this I know it's like
XHTML or HTML formatting which it has
all the text there but the layout is is
a little bit jumbled so just to give you
an example of kind of spread layout that
I used for my book which was hard to
convert into it ebook format I'll open
it up
so
so basically the way I laid out the book
is that I did two page spread so the way
it turns out is is like this this is
actually my mom's handwriting she's very
beautiful handwriting for the title and
when you just do a bra epub export it
essentially has this background image
which is the writing of the title papers
for the suppression of reality as a
separate image and then on the next page
it has the text but doing that overlay I
found you have to go in and basically
manually do every page and you have to
be you know know know a few things about
the formatting and that was and it was
kind of difficult for me to do also in
my book because it's fairly experimental
I have a number of fake advertisements
in it and so I have this you know fake
game called Michael Pollan or Michel
Foucault it's the game that's sweeping
the nation but doing this grid layout
you know when i export an epub it I know
basically the images were all over and
then the resizing i did in indesign
didn't really show up so what I decided
for the e-book is I just exported it as
a PDF and and I have it on the google
ebook store in that format and as for
Kindle I looked at you know I basically
I've signed up and I'm in the process of
getting it in kindle but I haven't
actually gone through all the steps to
do it i found that especially if you're
like a self-published author or if
you're going through independent
publisher if you don't really have the
tech resources to do all the formatting
right you'll just go with whatever is
kind of the easiest path and i think
that is one advantage for the google
ebook store is that you can just upload
a PDF and you don't have to necessarily
put the book and do a proprietary format
and then so let's say I'll just flip
through
but moving on I'm going to give a very
short reading from the book just give
you a little taste of what it's like so
again the book it's you know loosely
based on this fictitious book that or
has created in one of his book reviews
so I'll read just a couple few pages
from the beginning of one of the stories
and then I will open it up for questions
so this story it's called bore hesita
more phasis and it's a take-off on
Kafka's metamorphosis when Herbert Queen
woke up on October thirty-first 2006
from a night full of dreams of Giants
and tigers he found himself changed in
his bed into a 56 year old nearly blind
jorge luis borges he stared at the
nothingness of his walls until he
recalled how things should look and
imposed the images from his mind on his
surroundings he reached across his
crimson wool blankets from the Argentine
Andes to turn off his ipod alarm clock
atop a bookcase playing Wandy renzo
tango music sitting up he took in the
hundreds of vaguely luminous library
books lining his walls reminded himself
that he had to renew his foreheads
Carlisle into quincy books today herbert
stood up and walked to the sink in his
small college apartment feeling an
uncommon soreness and frailty throughout
his body his wilted image reflected ad
infinitum in the mirrors on opposing
sides of his perfectly square room Wow
my eyes are going out I really need to
up my contact prescription he thought to
himself after he put on his contacts and
saw a world of indistinct shadows
bending over the sink brushing his teeth
he was careful not to bump his head on
the corner of the freshly painted
medicine cabinet on the wall Herbert
quickly dressed into the Jorge Luis
Borges costume that he had been
preparing for weeks at the UC Berkeley
English undergraduate Association
Halloween party he lifted his backpack
packed with his presentation on rollin
Bart's the death of the
author for his honors english thesis
class Herbert was soon out the door
before he could read the quotation on
the back of his door which read I should
have known that every time I opened the
door of my room I am literally opening a
Pandora's box the perfunctory walk from
Berkeley's canterbury house two wheeler
hall was different today Herbert
couldn't quite put a finger on it but he
saw that it was overcast Herbert soon
got his bearings his bearings running
his hand over the sequin leaves of the
bush in front of his house he was in a
rush and had no time to question his
eyesight which seemed to further
deteriorate each second it was if the
depression that plagued his soul of fix
itself to his vision Herbert thought if
blind old boar has didn't need a walk
with a cane and memorize the streets of
Geneva I don't need a cane to walk a
mere block and a half to building i have
class in every day I must stop reading
so damn much let's see she I'll go up to
the page in the manuscript
he heard the 51 a bus pass on his left
he felt the solidity of the sidewalk
beneath his dress shoes in the clack of
his soles against the concrete stepping
to the left he gauged the drop to the
street and felt the softer asphalt
hearing the deeper tone of the tar and
rock he quickly crossed bancroft way and
managed to find his way to either Hall
by holding on to different students
elbows and asking them to guide him a
girl led him through lower sproul plaza
up the stairs to Ludwick's fountain past
the students on sproul plaza asking him
to sign up for calpirg in under seder
gate she left him at the steps of
wheeler Herbert saw the unmistakable
outline of wheeler hall making out the
arching glass windows in Roman columns
or at least he could in his mind Herbert
started forward alone and suddenly
slipped and fell hitting his head on the
warm granite steps at the southwest
corner of the building sets of arms
immediately helped lift him up but his
head was throbbing especially a part
which felt like an old wound third floor
wheeler was all Herbert answer to their
questions of his health Herbert was
summarily led up the stairs by a
courteous but insistent hand on his mid
back by the second floor he was out of
breath and had to stop for a moment to
regain his composure at the third floor
Herbert asked his guide if he was at
Wheeler room 330 she said yes and opened
the door for him Herbert entered a
different realm when he crossed the
doorway into the English department
lounge not only was it dark and filled
with dry ice fog for the Halloween party
but inside was different for reasons
that to this day remain unexplained so
I'm just reading a little bit from the
beginning the story continues for quite
a few pages and it goes into sort of the
interesting characters that he meets at
this Halloween party who also happened
to be dressed up like characters from
boar has is short stories so so with
that I'm open to taking any questions
you have on Borras or the self
publishing process and we have a
microphone right there
hi thank you for reading that was great
I have some questions first of all I'd
like to know when you published your
book and then secondly how you let
people know that it's out there I mean
it's one thing to you know put it on the
website for for downloading from from
google books but but how do you get
people to find it and how is your book
getting known yeah so so partly why went
the self-publishing route is because
well basically I'd written all these
stories as an undergrad and then I
really wanted to publish them but I
figured that the audience would be
fairly small but I knew that there are
you know thousand people out there
interested in Bor heads and Latin
American literature who'd be interested
in this topic so it took me just five
months to essentially do all the editing
design layout copy editing proofreading
and then printing and binding so I
started in august of 2010 and then by
basically new years just this last year
I had you know the thousand copies of
the book done had I gone with a larger
publisher it would have taken maybe 12
months to 18 months to get the book out
of the pipeline and I didn't want to
wait that amount of time and also I
wanted to have full control over kind of
like the design layout title the book
the cover and often if you go through a
larger publisher you don't necessarily
have that control so so essentially yeah
I did the self-publishing to kind of
speed up the timeline but then the
actual marketing brings in a whole new
picture because what I've been doing is
just focusing on you know each step of
the process and so for actual marketing
there there's a big book conference
going on in in New York which is all
about you know how to market you know
do-it-yourself books and kind of tactics
I've taken is I've selected advertising
and really key journals and publications
so I
advertisement in the May issue of the
believer magazine published by
McSweeney's and then I'll take out an ad
in the next issue of n plus 1 which is
this journal that as a readership I
think that will I know kind of like the
style of my book but basically I've been
just kind of used the network's I've
established just you know through email
list getting friends out to local
readings also going to local bookstores
and asking you know will you let me you
know do a reading but I haven't really
had a comprehensive you know marketing
plan or strategy I know basically some
tactics that they recommend to take you
know or you get a bunch of followers on
Twitter and then you tweet every now and
then and you keep them you know in the
loop another tactic is to have a blog
that you regularly update but basically
if I end up doing a second printing of
the book I would look to maybe go with a
larger publisher have like a literary
agent someone like that helping me with
this marking marketing segment but I'm
you know I've been keeping busy with the
writing I'm doing here for work and I
haven't had too much time to focus on
the activities outside but on the
weekends yeah I try and do book readings
go to events like i'll be at the monthly
rumpus in june on san francisco you know
reading there and we had to slowly
selling copies get my name out there
yeah yes
so I have a couple questions the first
one is you said you worked for a large
publisher large-scale publisher
McSweeney's the independent one and then
you did the self-publishing route so
what would you say like are the specific
differences between like editing design
and layout adding the little finishing
touches marketing you already talked a
little bit about all those different
things you know between the three tracks
and then the second one is my another
question about why specifically to
choose to go with InDesign maybe you're
familiar with la tech did you think
about those that type of option or other
options how did you decide which one to
pick yeah ok so so the reason I went
with InDesign is because I had some
experience working with it at
McSweeney's and I already had indesign
cs3 on my mac at home and so I just you
know kind of went with ax I heard that's
what people use but I looked into cork
and some other programs which I would
have had to have purchased to do it and
I even considered you know Microsoft
Word or Google Docs but it didn't really
have the the type of like margin control
and layout that that I wanted and then
the other portion of your question was
regarding yeah what was it regarding if
you're talking about the same question
it was about specifically about la tech
and if you considered using that because
I understand that's very good for doing
a for separating layout and design from
content creation and then being able to
have them maybe even give hand that off
to somebody else to do the design of the
actual layout so that was one that was
one thing and then the other thing was
having gone through the three different
streams independent publishing a small
publisher large publisher and particular
i'm interested in like your your
experience with editing like what kind
of support do you get in editing and
marketing in the other two different
tracks beside you know outside of
self-publishing i guess in
self-publishing you don't really get any
support right yeah yeah so
let's say so other routes for
self-publishing I I considered was
lulu.com which is one of those
do-it-yourself sites where you can
upload a PDF of your manuscript and then
you can print the book but to get a book
that I was looking for it would have
cost around seven dollars a copy and
doing it myself I was able to do it for
round two dollars fifty cents a copy
then I'm selling it for fourteen dollars
so had I gone through Lulu amazon.com
takes about around fifty percent of the
the cover price when you sell it so i
would have essentially been printing the
book for seven dollars and not only get
seven dollars out of the sale and so
that's why i steered away from lulu
although it's a great resource for
people who want to get like a memoir out
there or they just want to print you
know maybe 10 or 20 copies of their book
to distribute it among friends but just
for a thousand copies it was just too
expensive for me to go that route and so
then regarding the large publisher
independent publisher and
self-publishing yeah if you go with the
large publisher you get a lot more
support you get you know editing support
and you know design layout but I think
it comes at a cost in that I felt my
book it was very unique and it was hard
for me to describe I just had to make it
and then show it to other people because
trying to describe early on that I have
this giant crossword puzzle this giant
map which is part of the story these non
conventional advertisements for games
which may or may not exist people just
kind of looked at me funny and you know
it was just something I just had to go
through and and do it myself to put it
out there but for a second printing i
would consider going with the large
publishing house because then i would
get you know the marketing support
resources on have an agent who had set
up kind of a more traditional book tour
whereas right now I'm just kind of
calling up bookstores that I know
you know like there's one in Cambridge
Massachusetts called the Pierre Menard
gallery and the title my book is taken
from the portes story pierre menard
author the quijote so you know I've been
finding kind of pockets of people but
going to do it yourself route it's yeah
it's kind of a high-risk high-reward and
part of the reason why I did is I just
wanted to see you know what would I do
it and I felt having worked with with a
lot of great editors over the years I
learned a lot about the process and you
know I still reached out to them and I
had friends you know look over the
manuscript and many were kind to help
with sort of that proof reading copy
editing and then with the design I I
consulted with various people I I knew
but I ended up just kind of you know
just going ahead with it saying how it
turned out
see if I keep my questions organized so
you are on amazon I see so what was your
actual process for getting on amazon do
you just you printed them you sent them
a couple copies and you're using their
standard independent publisher route
yeah yes so I'm going through amazon
advantage and it's fairly slow to get
listed on there so basically you well I
went through the process where I got an
ISBN first through through valker rating
agency and through bal curve is B ends
and sets at ten okay it's around like
hundred and seventy five dollars for a
set of 10 Sita so you bought a full set
of ten ice bins yeah yeah and your bar
coated on the back yeah I guess I did
that and then I also got a library
congress catalog number and that was
actually pretty easy you just go on
library Congress site and then you say
you know I have this book this is the
estimated publication date and they
don't really even verify 22 well to see
like well is this a real book or is it a
fake book which mine kind of is but they
you know I still have it you know on the
book and then when you submit it to
Amazon they go off the ISBN and so yeah
yeah I have the ISBN number for it and
basically they request one copy and kind
of the way the agreement works it's done
consignment so you ship it out to them
and that costs like two dollars or you
know 250 and then cover prices 14 and
then they sell it and then they give you
about seven back yeah they're going to
take the like the fifty-five percent
commission something like that okay so
that's done through that yeah so so it's
nice that it's up there and it's getting
out but you know the profit margin is a
lot better if I go to a local bookshop
or if I you know just sell it on my own
at at events yeah yeah so did you you
used a lot of volunteering and you
basically did a friends and family kind
of model for the the labor on this yeah
right so did you look at simply did you
get quotes on simply jobbing this out to
a local Bay Area print shop I know you
did some custom stuff with the foil
cover the inserts but it seems to me
that for a thousand copy print
run there'd be plenty of print shops
maybe I mean you could get places in the
Midwest and then they'll just ups it did
you did you compare those prices yeah I
looked into certain print shops like
there's well there's OD printing in
Iceland and there's West can printing in
Canada which it's what mcsweeney's uses
for their kind of specialized books but
I didn't look too much at local well I
looked a bit at local coffee shops and
it was it was a bit prohibitive the you
know the amount but i decided i because
i had the resource for my cousin who
could essentially just print all the
pages on recycle toner that that was the
route i chose and also going around kind
of especially paper around the archival
quality paper it basically no one or
very few people print off of that okay
you know this type of you wanted certain
physical material control and avi and to
do it yourself I'm just you know for
most most folks don't want to deal with
right and sixty five thousand pages and
doing your own binding and gluing etc
right so i just wanted if you'd looked
at that or you know did you look at
amazon create space for example because
for a thousand copies black and white
it's pretty low but again they're not
going to let you insert full-color Maps
and sounds like you did that and so on
and no foil embossed covers yeah yeah
basically the premise i had was that I
felt the book was non-conventional and
so I wanted to take an actual like non
conventional style you know for how the
book looks and you know by doing the you
knows type of tape bind and in gold foil
print and yeah with the the map and
crossword puzzle insert yeah I felt it
kind of the the form of the book mirrors
the content so your cost for like what
two dollars a copy for that's from not
counting a labor which is really yeah
okay yeah but basically kind of the
message I want want to share is that
you know if you have an idea and I feel
that everyone has a certain story that
they have to tell and especially people
in the room probably have a really
specific area of expertise that you know
they know better than almost anyone else
and that you know to not let kind of the
you know that you need to get them in a
hat and based large publishing house to
endorse your work to be able to get it
out there but you can essentially just
export it in a PDF and then just get
ISBN and then put it on Google ebooks or
you can you know have it on kindle
another avenue which I've seen well some
of the print on demand services our
friends who put out books through those
and then when I got him it felt like
they had been like sent off to China and
then they were printed I don't know they
were like you knows running over and
edges were bleeding it didn't really
look like a lot of like care and time
was spent in you know physical copy of
the book and that if it's going to be
sloppy like that you might as well have
an electronic only version of it you
know where you can you know definitely
control that and have that clean and so
kind of the argument today is that if
you want to differentiate yourself you
know why should you buy the physical
copy and sort of the argument that I've
put in is that you know I have these
cool add-ons but also it's it's very
unique in that you know some of these
copies can actually be read by check
scanners because it's magnetic toner
also I individually numbered every copy
by hand and you know there's sort of
this kind of quirkiness to it that you
don't get in in any electronic edition
although the scalability for e-books it
you know far out passes this so yeah
are you able to get any bookstores like
I probably not like a big chain
bookstore but like independent
bookstores are they receptive to taking
some copies of your book and keeping
them on the shelves yeah yeah so so the
book it's being carried right now at
university press books in berkeley and
that's where I had my book release party
and then it's a dog eared books in the
Mission District it's at modern times
bookstore in the mission I have a Latino
libros her libros Latinos in Mission
District and it adobe books as well so
and can you talk about the process of
getting it into those bookstores what
kind of deal do they do they give you
like well how do you negotiate that I
didn't avek ate that whole thing so
basically you go in you dress nice you
know make sure you don't look like a bum
off the street you say hey you know I I
you know wrote this book and I went to
these sort of kind of quirky book shops
so they know like who jorge luis borges
is and I said you know I wrote this book
it's kind of fan fiction stories I did
related to portes and then you know if
they're doing crossword or something and
I'll break out the crossword puzzle and
melody like wow how did you have the 115
clue crossword puzzle that's a bit bit
over the top and then you just go in and
then they'll say yeah I'll take one or
two copies and then they'll do it like
6040 or often they'll just give you like
eight dollars right there so i get sixty
they get 40 yeah but it's not really
venture to really make big money out of
you know I'll probably end the year you
know breaking even you know for my
expenses but you know just something
just kind of get the books out in
circulation and part of it I think is
that especially if you're a first-time
author you need to be very realistic
about audience so when I was working at
you know Pearson especially people
thought that you know if your first-time
author automatically penguin or one of
its imprints would want to publish you
and you'd get reviewed in the New York
Times Book Review and things like that
but you
you to start out I think just from you
know grassroots kind of build your
community and be you know kind of honest
that you know the book you have it's not
going to be the next harry potter but
you you want to get it out to kind of a
small niche kind of committed group of
people and I feel using the internet and
for instance taking out an AdWords ad
for the keyword jorge luis borges so you
have you know this this show up or you
know there's a lot of tactics you can
take to you know really market yourself
in position yourself and yeah and so I
think next you know when i have time and
i'm in north beach I'll take some copies
to city lights books and you know
they'll probably take a couple and then
you know if it starts selling there then
yeah then they'll the last for some more
but yeah it's kind of what what you do
yeah thanks Matt for a really
interesting talk a couple questions uh
how did you decide on the font that you
picked here and the line spacing and
some of these more typographical
questions and I assume you wanted in
your effort to maintain control over the
look you insists on a certain font and
so forth so regarding the font I
actually have a note about the typeset
and I have this whole story of how
Garamond was brought from Scotland and
and all that but if you go flip through
I have a true note about the typeset and
basically what would it i right so
Garamond it was outright stolen from
mcsweeney's Publishing's typeface they
use Garamond three and you know i like
it it's actually what harry potter is
printed in but there's a lot of
variations of Garamond there's like
Adobe Garamond there's all these
different types and the you know
decision because it was you know just me
making it I wanted it to be kind of a
literary font and I leaned away from
Times New Roman because that's what I
did all
academic papers in then here at Google
we use a lot of like Ariel and these
really like hard-lined sans-serif fonts
and yeah basically I just looked at some
books I like from McSweeney's and I just
decided to go with the font very similar
to theirs your approach herbs also an
interesting story right so I'm wondering
if you've written a blog post or or some
have have written something detailing
just the the process of building this
book and I think you're you're exactly
right about you know making up a book
compelling to buy today and you know
this the e-book age basically so you've
created something very unique and
interesting and I think a lot of people
would want to kind of follow follow that
that path yeah so yeah on my blog I I
started a little series called memoirs
of the self-published and I have a kind
of the first post on it is sort of an
overview of like these five books on how
to do self-publishing that I read and I
kind of gave my analysis and thoughts on
how they're done but kind of an area i
was kind of uneasy about is yeah is well
at the book expo of america going on
right now so so there's a great like
series of talks on well for instance the
keynote address was why the DIY
revolution has made it the best time
ever to be a writer and there's a lot of
my great talks that they're putting on
but basically you have to spend the
conference admission and then pay
another $175 just to get in to all the
talks and i found that there are a lot
of great kind of resources out there for
the do-it-yourself author but a lot of
them there I felt they're just trying to
make money off you and so I was just
trying to keep you know my you know my
costs very low for you know how a little
over two grand can I
you know print a thousand books and yeah
that's just sort of the route I took and
I will be putting up more postings about
kind of the process i did for it may be
a little bit on layout design like how
you can do it yourself and then also
around you know the printing and binding
and what our alternatives out there to
the other do-it-yourself resources I
want to thank you guys for coming out
and also I have some copies of the book
available for sale if if you guys are
interested so thank you so much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
