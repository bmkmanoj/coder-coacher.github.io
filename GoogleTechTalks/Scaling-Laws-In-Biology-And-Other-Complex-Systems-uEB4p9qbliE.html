I'm really excited to be welcoming
Jeffrey West from the Santa Fe Institute
here to talk today
I think Jeffrey can probably tell you a
lot more about the Santa Fe Institute
than I can but I'll just say that one of
the hallmarks of the Santa Fe Institute
is that it's an incredibly
interdisciplinary place and the work
that Jeffrey's gonna be talking about
today really exemplifies that because he
brings together threads from physics
from biology and even from sociology
the work that Geoffrey's going to talk
about has been incredibly influential
he's gotten some great write-ups he was
one of times hundred most influential
people last year he's gotten write-ups
in the Harvard Business Review and lots
of other accolades for the work so I
want to let him tell you all about it so
here he is Jeff West absolute first at
Google in that I'm using 20th century
technology maybe not even 20th century
and apparently is that it so it may be a
little bit I'm not too sure how it's
actually gonna work I never used I have
used once one of these contraptions but
I prefer even the old-fashioned ones
that don't digital eyes anyway so let me
tell you what I'm gonna talk about it's
really an attempt to address the
question of are there fundamental laws
of biology that can be put in a
quantitative mathematical language so
that we can make biology into a science
that is a little bit more like physics
and chemistry where we can actually
analyze mathematically a given problem
and then from that make predictions and
then start to have a major conceptual
framework and of course in biology the
problem is that the system has distinct
from canonical physics kinds of
situations
involves huge numbers of agents at work
a highly complex phenomena self
self-organization emergent properties
coupon me
historical contingency and so forth and
so the problem is of a completely
different nature and maybe the best that
we can hope for is not that we have sort
of a Newton's laws of biology but that
we can have a version of it where
instead of being able to predict
everything precisely which is the vision
that physics has given to the world that
instead of that that maybe we can have a
science of biology
where at least the coarse-grained
behavior can be quantitatively predicted
so for example one prediction
quantitative prediction I can make which
I presume no one will disagree with is
that I can say looking across at this
biological gathering here human beings
that within a hundred years everybody in
this room will be dead now
I put that forth somewhat sarcastically
but indeed the question behind it is the
following is first of all to understand
aging the phenomena of aging and
secondly to understand the phenomenon of
death and not just mechanistically but
in terms of making a quantitative to
really understand where in the hell does
the number 100 years as a sort of order
of magnitude for a human lifespan come
from we believe everything is driven at
the molecular level where in the
molecular level in the genes in the
respiratory enzymes that provide your
energy where in those molecular scales
which are microscopic for crying out
loud sits a hundred years if this piece
of flesh happens to be a human being
happens to be me
whereas if this piece of
/ happened to be a mouse and the level
of which we're talking you cannot tell
the difference between a peace of mind
meet and the peace of mouse meet why
would it be that if it were mouse it
would have been dead
well I'm sixteen eighty sixty seven
sixty three years ago sixty four years
ago would have been dead so can we
really predict can we actually calculate
those kinds of numbers similarly can we
understand why it is that in several
more hours all of us will need to go to
bed and sleep why is it we need to sleep
and why is it that we need to sleep over
the order of eight hours and not one
hour or twenty three hours and why is it
again if we were a mouse we would have
to sleep instead of the conventional
eight hours of human being something
like fifteen hours and if the same
tissue happened to have been made into
an elephant it would only have to sleep
for three or four hours so that's the
kind of question I'm going to be talking
about and at the very end if I I hope to
leave myself time is to take the same
kind of ideas to questions of social
organizations like corporations
companies like Google or the one I will
actually focus on is cities can we and
in fact asking a sort of conceptual
question and then trying to address it
is can we think of a city can we think
of what San Jose here as just a good a
giant organism which has the same kinds
of properties as a biological organism
and very often we use both for companies
and for cities biological analogues we
talked about about metabolism of the
city we talked about the DNA of a
company and so on and so forth so that's
the kind of thing we're going to be
talking about and I hope this
contraction works so I can show you some
pictures if not I'll just keep talking
for the next 45 minutes I can do it
without visual aids but better Windham
so I don't really need to emphasize that
life is almost certainly the most
complex and diverse physical system
maybe in the universe and so that's what
really is the challenge is that now you
probably I suspect this isn't gonna work
but we'll see it well doesn't matter
it's good enough because what I'm
showing you here is you can see it's
some network but it's in fact the
metabolic chart you don't have to read
anything just have to get the idea that
it's a highly complex network and this
is a highly simplified version of it and
it is the pathways of interact chemical
interactions that give rise to the
production of ATP which is your currency
of energy another level of complexity I
oh you can't see that at all so I'm not
going to show it that's a picture of a
forest you look out anywhere around you
in biology you see highly complex
phenomena highly complex interactions
and one of the questions one would like
to understand is is there any structure
and organization that can be quantified
associated with them that those
phenomena so one of the things that is
provides a potential window on being
able to answer these questions is
provided by something called scaling
which is simply answering the question
how the various characteristics in this
particular case of organisms scale with
size so just take the example I talked
about mouse to elephant how the various
attributes of a mammal scale with size
and a pro right actually if you think in
terms of natural selection you would not
expect any great degree of correlation
between objects of different size
because they each organism and each
subsystem of the organism each organ
each cell
evolved in its own totally unique
environmental niche and so somehow that
when you put it all together to make a
mouse how would that be easily related
to when you put it all together to make
an elephant or a giraffe and so on and
the remarkable thing is that it now I
hope this works but if not I'll just say
it enough enough that you can get it
I hate PowerPoint is the part and I'll
tell you why at the end so but this is
good enough so what's plotted here is on
the y-axis metabolic rate
logarithmically so this is log of
metabolic rate and this is log of mass
for a bunch of mostly mammals there a
few birds on here and what you see on
this is a beautiful straight line
showing a very simple example of scaling
and it goes indeed this says Mouse and
at the top it says elephant and if it's
if it's a straight line on a log-log
plot it says this is a very simple power
law and the remarkable one of the
remarkable aspects of this is that the
slope of this is very close to 3/4 so
but I want to emphasize again that each
one of these organisms is unique evolved
uniquely and yet in terms of the maybe
the most complicated physical chemical
process possibly even in the universe
despite that they all line up in a very
simple fashion satisfying here it is
hopefully that you can read that this
very simple equation the metabolic rate
I call B is proportional to mass to the
3/4 power so buried in there is also
since it's it's scales with an exponent
less than 1 is an economy of scale
namely that if you if you naively if you
increase by a factor of if you increased
the size by a factor of 10,000
you would have expected that the
metabolic rate would increase by a
factor of 10,000 because you increased
number of cells by a factor of 10,000
but in fact the amount of energy needed
to sustain the system has only gone up
by a factor of 1,000 that's the 3/4 so
there's an extraordinary economy of
scale as you increase the size of
organisms now oh the other thing I
wanted to say actually just as an aside
as many people are not aware of this you
probably can't read it but the y-axis is
measured in watts and if you look where
you are across here you see you operate
at about a hundred watts you operate
just sitting here you use basically the
equivalent to a light bulb which is a
ruler an extraordinary statement about
the fantastic efficiency of your of
organisms and you can actually see that
we cut and by the following and
insolently a hundred watts in case you
don't realize is the two thousand food
calories per day written on the side of
your Kellogg's cornflakes that's what
100 watts is much better frankly if
people wrote down a hundred watts
because if you asked how much energy so
that's the amount of energy you require
in your sort of normal state and that's
the amount of energy you required when
you when we evolved before we socialized
that is as just organisms in in
equilibrium with every other organism
and each one of these animals found its
own equilibrium point according to this
law however if you ask now that we are
social animals and I'm going to come
back to this at the end we've interacted
and we now have a lifestyle which is
quite different than the natural state
so that we have electricity we have cars
we have heat we have buildings and so on
you can ask the question how much what
is our metabolic rate as social animals
so what is that number change from
what's how what is the number now the
number now if you live in the United
States is eleven thousand watts and you
can turn this around and ask how big a
mammal are each of us actually operating
at and it's bigger than the biggest
mammal that has ever existed on this
planet and they need a blue whale so
each of this is operating as if we're a
mammal man far larger than this room
obviously so it's sort of an
extraordinary statement of how we have
that the tremendous distortion that we
are causing in terms of our interaction
with other phenomena which is sort of
obvious but it's a nice quantitative
illustrative way of saying that so
that's sort of interesting of itself and
sort of remarkable but what's really
remarkable is if you look at any group
of animals any taxonomic group insects
fish crustacean birds whatever and you
do the same plots and because it's such
a the the visual as a so shitty I'm not
going to bother to show you they look
exactly the same they look exactly the
same with the same 3/4 power scaling in
the same way even so down to bacteria
that is I will just I'll flash this on
so you can see it that bottom one
bacteria same thing same slope and in
fact most recently with some colleagues
we extended this down within cells to
look at the scaling if you go down to
mitochondria and to the molecules of the
respiratory complex which produce your
ATP I mentioned earlier and if you look
at those you have and I think I did
bring a hard will try to first yes we
are and it's the same but line what is
on here these are bacteria this is a
mitochondrion and these are respiratory
enzymes and this is that same 3/4 line
and the scaling continues for 27 on the
orders of magnitude which is maybe the
most remarkable scaling law evenning so
that's interesting that it covers that
in terms of material
and recovers pretty much all the way
across life but you can go even further
and if you look at any physiological
variable anything anything you can think
of you can measure mundane things like
heart rates you can look at profound
things like your life span you can look
at details of diffusion rates across
surfaces a hundred of these I could if I
if I had a good visual projector and we
had the time I could spend the rest of
the afternoon showing you an enormous
plethora of such scaling laws and they
all have a similar kind of structure and
I don't know if this will come out well
no it won't so I'm going to leave that
but I will show you this one because
it's similar to it that one will show up
this is the radius of the aorta versus
body weight a very mundane thing it's
just the size of your the aorta and that
scales with a slope of 3/8 the one I was
going to show you there is heart rate
which decreases as mass to the 1/4 one
that is now I hope these show up yes
lifespan scales is mass to the 1/4 heart
rate which I tried to show you decreases
its mass to the 1/4 if I multiply them
together what do I get I get the total
number of heartbeats and a lifespan but
the master the one quarters cancel out
so what you discover from this is the
total number of heartbeat heartbeats in
a lifespan is an approximate invariant
so little things don't live very long
but have very fast heartbeats big things
live a long time and have short short
have slow heart heart rates but in such
a way that we all share roughly speaking
the same number of heartbeats namely
about one and a half billion and there's
nothing fundamental about hearts but
there is something fundamental about the
number of times the reaction takes place
producing ATP because that is true of
all one second of all aerobic
metabolism and that number is invariant
and I've written it down here and let me
answer the question please I interrupt
and let me come back to that more words
are standard uh if we have to be kicked
out of here by two o'clock so I'm gonna
be judicious in answering questions
that's I always get asked that question
and I'll tell you later
so you could not as I say the only I'll
just show you one other because it's a
slightly different nature and that is to
do with informational system and that's
genome length that's the length of G so
this is informational system this is
genome length versus mass for a bunch of
cells and there's a lot of variation but
this is a best fit and the best fit is
gives a slope of 1/4 so what you see
emerging from this is this universality
of these very simple power laws and
maybe most intriguingly
the emergence of the number four that
this 1/4 turns up ubiquitously across
almost any phenomenon you look at in
biology and part of this work originally
was to understand the origin of these
scaling laws and the where this number 4
comes from so I'm gonna tell you a
little bit about that without going into
the technical details let's see what
else do I want to tell you okay so to
summarize here we have the most complex
and diverse system possibly in the
universe yet when we look across it's
all of its characteristics they scale in
an extraordinary simple way and they
also have built into them the this idea
the economy of scale that you need less
power to supply to support big things
than you do small things per unit mass
same mass the same unit
of mass requires less power the bigger
you are so this work took place in
collaboration originally with a very
distinguished biologist named James
Brown and and someone that was then his
student where man named Brian engquist
who is himself is now a professor who's
become well-known in his own right and
the work was indeed trying to understand
the origin of these laws so I'm gonna
let me talk for a little bit about what
we did and some of this gets becomes
quite technical and I'm keeping this
talk at a sort of Scientific American
level I'm not going to talk about into
any technicalities anyone interested can
certainly come and talk to me afterwards
so the ideas that we developed were
based on the following the first is to
recognize that none of you know this
these cannot be accidents that you have
this extraordinary commonality across
all scales from the essentially from the
molecular all the way and I didn't show
you data but all the way to ecosystem
levels with the same kind of
characteristics so underlying this
presumably are a bunch of universal
constraints that are independent of the
specific system that you look at or the
specific so to speak engineering design
that has evolved whether they be mammals
insects or birds and so on so what we
focused on was the question that is true
is is a problem for any complex system
and that is if you have a complex system
which is comprised of a very large
number of individual agents and
individual customers so to speak how are
you going to keep everybody happy how
are you going to sustain all of them how
you're going to supply them how are you
going to deliver resources to them and
of course we know how natural selection
is dealt with that it has evolved a
bunch of hierarchical branching network
systems in order to take something
macroscopic
and deliver it down to some microscopic
level it's developed a hierarchy a
hierarchical kind of network system at
all scales at all levels whether it be
the ones that immediately come to mind
like one circuitry system or renal
system respiratory system neuro system
but all the way down to within cells or
even within mitochondria where you have
transport pathways that have these kinds
of properties so so the first thing that
we postulated was that at all scales
across all biological phenomena life is
sustained by hierarchical branching
network systems and what these laws are
reflecting are the generic mathematical
physical topological properties of these
networks that are universal that have
nothing to do with a specific design so
the ones that we postulated were the
following the first was that these
networks be space-filling that they go
everywhere that they every cell has for
example has to be fed so you have to
make sure that every capillary in the
circuitry system ends up close by cell
so I can feed a cell so and you can
extrapolate that to any other kind of
network so the first is space-filling
the second was the idea and in fact all
of these are really derived conceptually
from the natural selection the idea that
as you evolve different species with the
same design natural selection did not
reinvent the fundamental units that is
it didn't reinvent cells every time a
new organism a new species I should say
evolved from a different species that it
built on the same building blocks so we
postulate that the terminal units of
these networks are invariant do not
change for a given design so that for
example a mouse a human being
and a whale all share essentially
identical capillaries so that the size
and flow rate in a Capri whether it be a
whale or a mouse or human being are the
same in the same way that the electrical
outlets in this building are essentially
identical to the ones in my house in
your houses and people living in
Bangladesh Bombay or Birmingham we all
have essentially the same electrical
outlets we have the same water faucets
they may look slightly different but
they're all basically the same the same
we use the same PCs we even though the
networks may be completely different but
the the terminal unit is an invariant so
just as one does architectural II and in
engineering so natural selection has
done the same thing the last of the kind
of principles that we enunciated was the
following was that of the infinitude of
possible networks that could have
evolved to make the kinds of organisms
that we see around us that are
space-filling and have invariant
terminal units the ones that have
actually evolved the ones that have
actualized are ones that in some ways
have optimized the system so as an
example just to keep it simple the test
since we were talking about the
circulatory system and and I must tell
you I'm struggling here not to use this
Vladdy machines I'm going to keep
talking as long as I can without visual
aids is that let's talk about the
circulatory system which I've mentioned
a couple of times so that if I were to
the in terms of the circular II system
that we have and we I mean all mammals
all mammals we all share the same
circulatory system the circular e system
that has evolved is the one that has
minimized the amount of
energy that is required to pump blood
around the system that's the idea that
would be a manifestation of that
principle so that for example if I were
to make any change in our circulatory
system if I were to arbitrarily double
the length of the fourth artery my heart
would have to work harder but if I were
to have its length sort of increasing by
the hobbit' it would also have to work
harder so there's a minimization
principle and for those familiar and
come out of a physics background one
will recognize this as an extraordinary
powerful statement that can be used to
derive the equations of motion of the
complete network because what one does
is one writes down the dynamics of flow
in the circuitry case our fluid of blood
through the entire system calculates how
much energy is being dissipated how much
work the heart has to do and minimize it
with respect to any change in the system
so any change of any length any change
of any radius any change of branching
ratio any variable that occurs in the
problem and this is basically the
methodology is for those familiar is one
of classical field theory upon which all
physics is is built and the equations
that you get are called the classical
Euler Lagrange equations and in this way
one can solve for the complete dynamics
of a circuitry system of an arbitrary
circulatory system and we have done that
and I'll tell you without showing you
any of the equations I will tell you
what the result of that calculation is
but let me say that what this allows for
example is if you perversely wanted to
know what the radius length pulse rate
blood flow rate was in the ninth branch
of a hippopotamuses circuitry system
there is a formula
has been derived that you put in numbers
and you get the right answer for the
average hippopotamus for that so you can
do that for any of these things even so
down to if you want to know how much of
the pulse is left in your capillary you
know when you prick yourself it just
dribbles out it's obviously not beating
but in fact there's a little residue of
the pause from your heart you can
calculate that in this theory it turns
out to be 0.1% of the wave is left
actually but you can calculate great
detail this in this system so you can
so one byproduct of this is that you
have a complete description for the
average so to speak idealized circuitry
system now what does this got to do with
these scaling laws so the idea is the
following that first of all in terms of
metabolic rate the what is your
metabolic rate well it's the amount of
oxygen really that is being consumed in
order to fuel metabolism in fact that's
the way it is technically measured and
your blood the whole point of blood of
course is to have oxygen dissolved in it
and deliver it to yourselves so that a
proxy for metabolic rate is in fact the
blood flow rate through the aorta coming
out of your heart whenever it is here
coming down here that's a proxy for
metabolic rate it could be used as a
measure of metabolic rate so the volume
flow rate in your circulatory system is
a proxy for the for metabolic rate and
this theory allows one to calculate it
in terms of some fundamental parameters
and the theory also allows you in terms
of minimizing the amount of energy your
heart has to do to determine how this
changes when I change the whole scale of
the system meaning how do I change when
I if I were to double the whole size the
whole mass of the system it tells me how
the system responds and it the way it
technically
works is that the minimization actually
tells you that the volume of blood in
the network scales linearly with mass
that's what the theory predicts and
indeed is true empirically and that
helps you to relate what goes on in one
animal to another animal and out of that
pops this 3/4 law now and and all the
and in fact many other things it tells
you or the scaling the complete scaling
of the network and many other phenomena
which I will talk about in one moment
now let me just say a few words about
the physics of the circulatory system
and what the what the theory tells us
and what happens inside you where as you
breathe and you push blood around so
when your heart beats it sends a wave
down through the aorta and your aorta is
big enough has evolved to be big enough
so that viscous forces dissipated forces
play almost no role so the wave that
comes out is roughly speaking a nice
sinusoidal wave that comes out down
through the aorta it then meets a branch
point so some goes down one tube some
goes down another tube of course if it's
an arbitrary network some also bounces
back from the branch point so and the
theory really tells you of course that's
a very bad thing if you had that at
every punch point because you'll be
pumping against yourself and you can
solve the equations for what is the
minimum amount of energy your heart has
to do and what it amounts to is of
course that you have no reflections sort
of obvious and that is called for those
familiar with it impedance matching and
that's exactly the same way of course
electricity is sent across the country
in order to minimize losses when in
terms of transmission and you have
evolved to do exactly the same thing in
terms of your network and you can ask
what is the constraint that that leads
to and that constraint leads to
something called area preserving
branching where the cross sectional area
of a parent branch is the sum of the
cross-sections of the daughter branches
which is indeed if you do the
measurements that's indeed true so and
and if so when you put that into the
minimization equations that plays a
crucial role in getting to this 3/4 and
I'll return to that again in one moment
but as the as as you go down through the
network of course tubes get narrower and
narrower and ultimately become so narrow
that blood starts to I mean sorry the
flow starts to be dissipated and the
wave starts to be dissipated due to
viscosity and that means that the whole
structure of your blood flow is
continuously changing from the aorta all
the way down through the capillaries in
such a way that the blood almost stops
at the capillaries so that you can get
efficient diffusion to cells and the
theory tells you exactly how that works
but there's a very interesting
consequence from that and that is the
following that you can imagine that the
shrinking down the size of the animal
shrinking down the aorta in a predictive
way where there oughta becomes so small
itself that it can no longer support a
pulse wave ok the dissipated forces are
so strong that when the heart pumps the
wave is immediately damped in the otter
and so you would have in that case have
an animal with a beating heart but no
pulse and in that instance you have a
highly inefficient system because
in that system you have dissipation of
energy due to viscous forces in every
single branch of the network whereas in
you in US where you have this impedance
matching almost no work is being done in
pushing the blood down through the major
part of your arteries and that gives
rise to a tremendous efficient our
tremendous efficiency and indeed if you
recalculate the metabolic rate it turns
out that it's no longer this 3/4 power
it's it goes approximately linearly with
mass and so there is no economy of scale
associated with it not surprisingly and
indeed this allows one to derive an
equation for the smallest mammal namely
the mammal that is the smallest is the
one that can least support can support
at least some wave and some impedance
matching at least the first couple of
branches and if you do the calculation
you discover then indeed the smallest
mammal should be of the order of one
gram which is what it is so there's lots
of things like that that one can predict
upon me and so what I'd like to do now
is tell you a couple of other things
about that theory and talk in particular
about growth I want to talk about growth
and I'm going to finish up by using that
as a segue into talking about social
organisations but you won't see this but
I just flashed this on as a table of a
whole bunch of things there's tables and
tables or things that you could predict
in this theory for all sorts of curious
things like oxygen affinity of the blood
the the the total resistance of the
network and so on and so forth all of
which you can measured and which I agree
with the theory and one can do this not
just for the circuit resistor in the
respiratory system one can do it for
trees and plants that's very important
because plants do not have a pulsatile
flow yet the same principle
applied it's got a completely different
design completely different mechanical
design it's a bunch of fiber bundles
rather than bunch of tubes and that the
calculation is completely different the
whole setup of the problem is different
but it's based on the same principles
and it gives the same kind of excellent
agreement with data so I want to talk
just briefly we talk for talking about
growth about one interesting prediction
and that is the following if you first
of all if you ask where where does this
greater efficiency come from in the in
the in the calculation what it comes
from is that the bigger the network
turns up the smaller the resistance
because what what the theory shows is
that even though you have the resistance
goes up as you make a bigger network the
number of outlets increases faster than
the increase in that resistance so that
the total resistance goes down and it
goes down in a very interesting way it
goes down in a way that the theory
predicts that blood pressure should be
an invariant so the blood pressure of a
shrew the sits on the palm of my hand
should be the same as the blood pressure
of a whale that's bigger than this room
which is indeed the case but the the the
point of the efficiency remember was so
it comes out of the dynamics of the
network one of its predictions is that
the metabolic rate she goes master the
three quarters which as I said before
earlier is reflective of an economy of
scale and the economy of scale can be
parameterize by thinking of the
metabolic rate per cell per unit mass
which if it goes
if the metabolic rate goes as mass of
the three quarters the cellular
metabolic rate must decrease as mass to
the 1/4 again so which is surprising
because cells are the same across all
mammals and yet in vivo
they're behaving differently in a small
organism than in a large one and from
this theoretical viewpoint it's because
of the hegemony of the network so that
gives rise to a very interesting
prediction that if I remove the network
cells that were behaving differently in
a mouse than in an elephant should now
behave the same so I removed the network
they all behaved the same so I hope you
can see this so here's a picture of the
metabolic rate of a cell versus the mass
of the host and here's where what the
prediction is in vivo this is mass to
the minus 1/4 is the prediction in vitro
when you remove them and cultivate them
and this is a completely quantitative
theory it tells you you can't read it
there what value this should come to and
what the slope of this is and so on and
so forth and I will just flash on data
which you probably can't see but to show
you there it is there's the data and
this you can't see these are a bunch of
points in vivo and this is the data in
vitro and you can see it's in reasonably
good agreement with the with the
prediction now let me talk a little bit
about growth because growth is a scaling
phenomenon and how does it occur how do
you understand it in this theory well
you understand it in terms of the
following that the network is there to
deliver resources to cells and what
happens to those resources and this is
true of any organization some goes
towards maintenance and some goes
towards productions of new cells you
stop growth so you can write that down
you can write that equation down and
maintenance incidentally also includes
not just maintaining what is there but
replacing cells that die I don't know if
this will come out as a nigger there we
are so what does that say I've boiled it
down to its simplest possible form the
incoming metabolic rate divides itself
into
maintenance the number of cells that are
there times the metabolic rate of each
cell plus the energy needed to create a
cell times the rate of which you create
them now the number of cells is just
linearly related to the total mass
number of cells is proportional to the
total of mass so you can rewrite this is
a very simple differential equation for
the mass the total mass of the organism
as a function of time and I don't there
it is there it's a very simple equation
and that's that equation can be solved
analytically and from that one can one
derives a very nice sigmoid occur for
growth and I don't know if you'll see
this either but I'm gonna flash on a
bunch of data this is a hand towel I
think that's a goofy that's a goofy and
that is a guinea pig so various animals
I could have chosen lots of others and
there's a bunch of data on this and
these lines are the absolute predictions
of the theory based on Universal
parameters like the average mass of a
cell the average energy needed to create
a cell and so on and one can rewrite
this in a very beautiful way actually
where do I have it here one can
re-express this in a very beautiful way
and it's sad that you can't see it all
but by what this is what the theory
tells you to do and I'm gonna read it
because you can't see it that on the
y-axis here is plotted the mass at age T
relative to the mature mass plotted
along the x axis is this Byzantine
variable T is age M is mature mass as a
parameter Universal parameter determined
by the theory turns a fundamental
biological constants and there's a small
correction here due to the birth mass
but this is what the theory says it says
that if
you plot data this way everybody grows
in the same way no matter whether
they're an insect a fish a human being
or whatever you name it a crustacean
anything and this is the data taken from
a myriad different organisms and
regardless of the theory it's an
extraordinary way of seeing the
wonderful unity of life we all grow in
the same way and one can do this similar
kind of analysis for other kinds of
phenomena like mortality and like
evolution even evolution itself and see
that if you rescale everything everybody
is evolving at the same rate everybody's
growing at the same rate and so on and
in the last few minutes I didn't leave
myself time let me just say one thing
about growth I just want to add one
other thing actually about growth one of
the interesting offshoots of that is not
just understanding growth itself but to
ask questions that are really
interesting and challenging about things
like growth of cancer growth through
cancer is of course very important
problem but it also is very challenging
to analyze because it's the interface of
two networks how does a something
growing on a host actually develop
relative to taking resources from the
host and asking questions like what is
the difference between growing a tumor
inside you and growing a fetus inside
you what wise one has what distinguishes
something healthy from something that is
presumably unhealthy and one can then
start to address those kinds of
questions
and I don't have time to go into them
what I'm going to do in the remaining
five minutes maybe is I would like to
talk very quickly about extending this
idea to social organizations so we have
a theory in biology and I've barely
scratched the surface in showing you
that can understand a very kind of
phenomena in a quantitative way based on
this idea
properties of networks but the window
onto it were these scaling laws and the
question is can one take the same
paradigm and apply them in social
organizations and the this is very
recent work and the answer is yes and
the question to be asked is in what
sense are social organizations the same
as and different from biological
organizations and the the data that we
focused on was data for cities because
dating data for corporations was
extraordinarily difficult and very
costly
whereas data for cities is just to a
large extent open and available and I
this collaboration the previous
carburation was with physicists and
chemists biochemists and so on this
collaboration was with also some other
physicists mathematicians but
anthropologists economists urban
geographers and the like and one of the
major tasks was to ask the question are
there scaling laws of cities what a
scaling laws tell you what did what did
we learn in biology just superficially
without knowing the theory what we
learnt is that an elephant is in fact a
blown up gorilla which is a blown up
human being which is a blown up mouse to
all intents and purposes they may look
very different but we are in fact non
linearly scaled up versions of one
another in terms of their internal
organization and dynamics and the
question is is there something similar
about cities is New York just a scaled
up San Jose which is a scaled up Santa
Fe even though they look completely
different
may not be but that the data will tell
unfortunately I won't be able to show
you the much of the data but I'm gonna
tell you the answer I will show you one
just to give you a sense of doesn't
matter what I'm plotting for the moment
I'm gonna come back to this but just to
give you a sense of the kinds of data
I'll tell you what is plotted there in a
moment but to show you that yes for all
we looked at a myriad variables
from infrastructural things like number
of gas stations surfaces of roads total
length of electrical cables etc etc
infrastructural things then we looked at
a bunch of now infrastructural things
are like biology they're like the
networks I talked about and indeed they
express an economy of scale you need
less roads per capita in a bigger city
less gas stations per capita but then we
looked at social phenomena which are
unique to organization such as this that
is the fact that people interact and the
10,000 years ago human beings brought
some new dynamic to the planet maybe
even to the universe by forming
communities and so what did we look at
we looked at things like wages we looked
at things like number of patents
produced we looked at things like number
of colleges number of hospitals number
of doctors number of police number of
crimes number of diseases all of these
phenomena and we discovered that yes
indeed they scale and this is one of
them this happens to be wages and this
happens to be number of super creators
people like you it's a sociology term
but number of these and what we
discovered was that unlike anything in
biology these do not scale with
sublinear like 3/4 exponent less than 1
they scale with super linear exponents
exponents that are greater than 1 and
what is remarkable is that all of the
exponents for all of these phenomena
whether they be police taxes wages
number of patents number of crimes
number of diseases all scale in the same
way mainly all with a universal exponent
around 1.15 that somehow all of these
social phenomena many of which one
thinks of as independent or scale in a
very similar way that is you have more
the bigger you are you have more wages
per capita but your
have more crime per capita but in a
systematic way and we looked at cities
across the United States across Europe
across China and it's the same
everywhere
it's sort of extraordinary now one of
the things that comes out of this can I
take a couple of minutes or should I
we're gonna be murdered am I gonna be
murdered maybe I should stop so let me
just say I'll say just one word and then
stop and that is what we asked from this
was to first of all what is the theory
behind it and the the major thing that
we have done is asked what are the
consequence of this and the two major
consequences and I'm just going to sum
it up in the last sentence are one that
inevitably the bigger you are unlike
biology the bigger you are the slower
the pace of life your heart rate
decreases your life span is longer and
so on in social organizations the bigger
you are cities in particular the faster
life is in a predictable way including
even things like the speed at which you
walk which I would show you data and
then ask this question of growth how do
we get around the fact that we have
sigmoidal growth but stops which you
cannot have in a social our whole system
is based on continuous growth and it
turns out if super linear behavior you
have open growth however what it tells
you is that inevitably you can only go
on growing forever if you continue to
innovate you have to continuously change
the parameters of the equations to give
those super linear scalings and you have
to innovate in a regular way which is
good because that's what we believe but
the thing that was astonishing was that
it's not actually regular you inevitably
in a predictable way have to innovate in
an accelerating fashion that is the time
between major innovations has to get
shorter and shorter and shorter and
undoubtedly that if that is true
for organizations it brings up social
organizations it brings up the question
of sustainability and somehow buried in
that which is part of our next work is
to take this to companies understand
companies and to ask therefore can we
understand why it is that there's a
lifespan of a company and what does a
company mean and why it is that there
isn't a Pan Am and a TWA and in 50 years
there may not be an eBay and a Google
and 2r I understand that and there may
be something else may replace it maybe
not and what is the dynamic if you need
to do it so anyway I'm sorry sorry
probably Falcon is fair</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
