action-packed set of lightning talks
again each one's 15 minutes including
time for questions so it's really up to
the speakers to determine how many
questions I'd like to get first speaker
up here is going to be Eduardo Bravo
from google talking about building
scalable mobile test infrastructure for
Google+ mobile and so you're starting to
see a bit more on the application side
so with that Eduardo thank you thank you
hi everyone and Eduardo I work at Google
and as you guys probably figured out
already I happen to work to for the
Google+ mobile app and today I want to
talk to you about what we've been doing
for the last year and a half I want to
tell you about the testing for structure
we have set up in place for the Google+
mobile apps and I want to show you the
experience and the problems we have
faced when we're doing this I know
mobile testing is still very painful I
mean we saw the matrix the test matrix
right we know how painful this is but I
think after you're gonna have we're in a
point where we're comfortable with what
we have don't get me wrong there's still
a lot of things to do there are still
things we haven't figured out but we're
in a good state compared 1010 ago so but
first first things first what was our
motivation to heavily invest in mobile
test infrastructure well you know g plus
we were late into the game we need to
catch up right we need a very aggressive
development schedule we know manual
testing one scale to the demands of the
class based development we have and of
our release process so it was a
no-brainer we need to do this we
strongly believe in preventing box
running them finding we are obsessive
about pre-commit we tried as to pack as
more most tests as possible we can we
cannot do all of our tests because we
have some very slow tests but as much as
possible we try to clean it
to keep our build clean make sure we
don't introduce unwanted box so we
really take pre-commit seriously and
finally which is my favorite point which
is flaky tests the team's feels very
strongly about this flaky test our words
and having no test at all I'll let me
explain why you see we have Joe it's 5pm
he's a little bit more he already
finished the work had to do that there
you're like well I don't have enough
time to wear a new future but maybe I
would worry test why not right let's
give it a shot so he goes there jumps
into Android what's his test submitted
paths pre-commit he's very happy right
it's a good day of work you write a
killer feature and you write a killer
test tell me later we get the email hey
the test is failing and he looks at his
steps right he's like oh look at that i
just find the first book with my test
she'll be very good at this as he's
trying to figure out what's going on and
where is the failure he realizes that
the bill turns great so a test is like
this happens three or four times and
after a while nobody cares anymore the
bills halt is polluted whenever there is
a failure most likely people will think
is one of the flaky tests so that's why
the google plus mobile we strongly
believe it were a flake we rather have
no test and flaky tests and to make this
we will even having a romantic
environment if we cannot provide an
inverted aromatic environment for our
test we rather not right so why do we
need to test when it has android win to
test iOS and of course we need to talk
we need to test the google backend
server and the android app and the iOS
app have a similar release cycle so in
that sense not too bad they rule back in
it's a different story it's more
aggressive very fast but still we need
to make everything play nicely so let's
take a look at how our test
infrastructure looks like
for Android we care about faster JUnit
test we use robolectric you guys heard
about it yesterday and just to give you
a quick refresher it allows us to the
compo the dependency that the JUnit
tests have on the android emulator this
for the Google+ app is critical the
whole place is huge so compelling itself
is that expensive operation then we need
to proguard it to make sure we don't
pass it dial back lyrics that some AP
levels have and finally we need to
install it which takes around 20 seconds
so all this adds up luckily robolectric
comes to rescue and we are we can avoid
all that we can compile fast and run the
test even faster faster development
happier deaths crap your depth more
likely to write tests then our second
study for testing in android is our UI
aromatic test we use robot you or let me
rephrase that go bottom which you guys
can figure out where the name came from
and which is basically our
implementation based on rowbottom for
the UI test framework we're considering
of moving to espresso which you guys are
going to hear layer about it and let me
show you how this UI stack looks so if
you can see the normal flow that's how
it looks then that's how a normal test
will look we have we're on all our test
UI tests on emulators we install the apk
we trigger our tests we connect to the
back end and there is login server right
what sproul endure is all those
dependencies that we have on external
services the more dependencies we have
the flake and where tests are going to
be and we don't want them it's very hard
to work with flaky tests hence what we
do is we start in memory google+ fake
backend server inside android emulator
we point the apt against it in fact that
never knows he's talking to a fake and
this fake server is able to provide free
can data we can control these data
therefore our tests are deterministic
and we have called all the dependencies
we have on external services which don't
really matter for the UI participe as
well as we don't have to deal with the
identification problems that will have
with the whole flow finally our third
strategy is used monkey test if you guys
are not familiar with monkey test they
come with the Android SDK they are very
easy to set up they are very effective
these are the only test we run on real
devices they catch a lot of box and if
you guys are not running this test you
should really consider doing it they are
the best bang for the buck now how do we
do it in iOS well for our unit test we
use a unit test case sweet based on GTM
sense test case this comes bond a bundle
with the Google tool box for Mac so any
one of you guys can use it it has worked
very well for us and for our meta Qi
test we skiff we use to use UI Automator
but it didn't it was flaky it felt
unnatural for our depth so we decided to
move to give which is developed by
square so kudos to square team for doing
this it has proved way more stable that
were you I automated test and also the
way it works in process makes our test
less flaky and on top of that as i said
we care about our matic aromaticity the
way we do it here which is a little bit
different from the Android world instead
of having to start a fake server what we
do is we use free sling a feature and
what it let us do is a drop time we can
be able to feed freaking responses to
the iOS app that way we can control the
set of data we're feeling to each test
to each run and everything is traumatic
there are no external external
dependencies outside of the iphone
simulator this has very effective the
lives actually really liked this
approach and it has been much more
stable that our
all the UI Automator set up now my
favorite part we have Tessa mobile
clients right but we also need to test
the back end they all have different
release cycles and we want to make sure
that yes more labs on break but also
that the back and don't break more laps
so we have to test strategies here first
we have end-to-end testing 100 where we
start an emulator we start the Google+
app and we start the whole stack of
Google+ back in service we provide fake
data because we want the data to
deterministic each test gets the same
data and our chest exercise the whole
server stack the test we have here the
there are just a few then handful of
them as much as we would like to have
more this test seem tend to take longer
so they're harder to enforce you in a
pyramid but so they are good to have you
really want to have some true end-to-end
tests used to make sure nothing goes
terribly wrong when the backend servers
pushes and the second ones which are my
favorite ones which are they replayed
tests which are very very simple but
they have proved to be very very
effective how they work is they simulate
mobile clients request to the server and
when the clients expect this cert
accordin response back so let me show
you with the diagram so if you remember
from previous slides that's a normal
flow and with the replay test what we do
is we chop away the android layer we
have a set of government requests that
we know our clients generate our model x
generate we start our back-end server
again providing fake data and as we're
sending a request we're asserting a wet
shirt that the respond corresponds to
the golden response if if it corresponds
to it this means that the 71 break them
of our clients because we know that when
we tested that that response- all our
clients work correctly we have some
smart d thing because there are things
that changes with requests like
timestamps and things like that so we
make sure that doesn't cost flaking it
but
this setup has been very very good to a
Google+ up in fact we have this is the
one that has catch the much of the much
box and yes we have all this running at
every commit I'm sorry for the image i
was i hope i was i could find a better
one I'm not really good at it obviously
the Barack Obama one was much better
than mine but I'm not very good at this
type of things so I'm trying to say it
is we have three test strategies on
Android we have two for iOS and we have
24 hour back ends and we guarantee that
those tests are run at every commit most
of them are also wrote on pre commits
which is what we really care about too
and finally I want to share about some
of the lessons we have learned during
this process first since the beginning
care about making the mobile
infrastructure is scalable and easy to
use don't keep depths a reason not to
write tests the easier it is to write
tests where you provide the right
environment it will be more likely to
write more tests second mobile testing
needs to prevent box not affect
productivity if you are spending too
much time fixing a test that affects
productivity there is something rooms
some work either on the test here on the
environment you don't want to stop
development Ryu strangles whenever
possible yes where Google and we like to
do things our own way sometimes but
there are times also that is also good
to use and some of the frame with
animation like robolectric ache if a
Google toolbox for Mac are all available
everyone can use them they work very
well for us whenever you can reuse and
finally let me reiterate on this you
keep test aromatic make sure you provide
the right environment so people don't
have to be worried about it and if you
cannot provide don't write a test it's
not worth it it's going to be more
painful later thank you
yeah nice job girl very nice thank you
it always reminds you of how we build
software Google we have what's working
but is deprecated and what's new but not
yet working so he found a nice happy
medium by by finding something that work
so with that we have time for one quick
question so we'll go off to the right
here are the end-to-end tests flaky and
if not how do you keep them from being
flaky we tried the entrance are not
flaky droid test we're still dealing
with it we think Express is going to be
the solution for it for the end-to-end
testing like the replay test I'll show
you the stats we get a flakiness is
point to pers 0.2 which is really really
good for a type of test that it's
exercising almost a full Google+ stack
99% plus pass rate is pretty phenomenal
so thank you Thank You authoritah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
