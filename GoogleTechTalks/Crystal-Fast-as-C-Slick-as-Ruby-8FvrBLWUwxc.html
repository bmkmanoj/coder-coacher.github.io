my name is Ryan and summer in India and
I'm certainly the lid on this so TR
anything I guess I work at a month and
for the couple of years moving a little
pink result I don't know if and besides
the Flyers as working out in the walls
if you know the exam which or if you
have read something at all oh no the
main sections a couple turn right
absolutely
we're gonna have to use yeah we are not
the famous but we're getting there both
Brody M so as background and this this
is a language made almost one crutch for
all by ourselves there are some building
blocks like LLVM where we are every base
so it's not as we do all the ten of the
compiler all the little thing of the
compiler but over LLVM everything is
built by by oracle comes by a community
that is the proper to grow their clothes
for my english i'm not the native
English speaker so I can use a resume
Spanish so math oh we usually use
different coding java or ebook net and
many years ago we used to Ruby I was
really a an exciting moment it was fun
for us it was just along that we love a
lot fresh air with God when coding
really fast it was a great community and
much more open than the other languages
with a really great experience for us
but and cold by the we were happy but
the computer doesn't pay we're not that
happier because really saying for joy of
the developers not so much joy a little
bit
though it's getting faster and faster by
underlying mechanism of how to reward if
a dynamic language is really dynamic and
there are a lot of things to be done
during runtime penalizing the
performance of your your product so we
like the syntax not that much there the
younger the whole thing for for the
computer although personally recommend
is really great so we want that come
from this language and usually combine
language are more efficient because they
generate native code there's not so much
so much things to do on brand by its
edge it will not compile language are
usually more efficient that but
interpreter language and trick
let's go again this is a thing here
where I were make we wait for the front
and now we talk about what the use of
the next generation you I don't in our
three in the display display our team
double-click and available here we don't
is telescreens it can be more about
working in tight with as are these on
the motivational customs here with using
dart into the using javascript there is
having the container issue with while
healing freestyle is officially movie
yeah yeah in some in some aspects we're
like going back in history a couple of
years ago and say we want like some
safety net when when we are programming
we love joy but give me something I I
try to catch a love affair for example
by using pipe checking like nobody wants
to do type annotations but if you have a
checking you will love it because it's a
secure thing to cover the compiler will
tell you know you're making things from
ever you're going from here so these are
like kind of the inspector will have the
same size we want to be more performance
to be to each event
laboratory so we have a green a greener
language defending expending less energy
in runtime and try to capture or as soon
as possible so we want to merge that in
this kind of language so as I said we
like Ruby maybe I don't know if you are
used to Ruby maybe you're modding Python
or but if you know Ruby what we get with
other questions specific yes yeah
similarly it says like a you need to to
agree on which is the key word to define
the metals on the glasses are more or
less and if it is in the station or and
the seminar intended as an Python or you
have an unexpected endless ruby hand but
so you can define classes and methods
basically going to stuff and for example
this business nipple it's almost a ruby
code it is an entirely Ruby because of
one type and a potential annotation the
main parameter should be string but it
feels like rubies you're not declaring
variables you're just using it you have
a a medium for instant variables with
your time because a construct your name
tisha lies it feels like we have string
interpolation you have a a nice set of
features and although here we see a type
annotation actually it's only one and
there could be like four because the
instance variable they glow the G
variable the return type there are other
types going around how the only animated
line for affirmative to combine with I
will show later they're like why
okay we need to annotate the dice but is
how how how does it feel plate and for
forests of the sizes it means that
running the compiler without actually
executing the code if we make silly
mistakes by cutting a string and nucular
injurer teacher we we got some
we have some nice compiler errors in
form like no overload allowed for that
in that particular line and that is it
before executing the goal because which
we don't defend electrolyzed is compiled
back it if I mean curated or something
some clear just put it put it forward
they go check ourselves on this page I
mean if you use rounded corners then
yeah and it means are the other
parameters needs to be the same type of
the containing class okay so another
culture is because it's declaring in the
in the class in the framework okay it's
just a way to refer to the current type
is a position as the string where she
means this and now is because the syntax
declaration may be to avoid things in
the server and just replace but but
strings but in the summer library when
you open the class string if you respect
refer to self and not ending the
intellect achill scope if the class okay
but it's then you are in the metal this
is the object itself difference so it's
just a shirt off for the electrical
definition of the um and by native code
generation we output assembly code thank
you by using at the end there is no
beautiful machine under the hood you
just go very metal to the target into
the specific processor and consuming
less less memory so there are a lot of
tools to the use with all minor is ugly
tools but maybe you're interested in
that story or not I usually a bit more
abstract than the expert spectra my my
personal way today but you can you can
see the assembly and it's similar to
whether a C code compiled by with LOD n
system but when is pretty similar you
will see the cause and
all those weird things going there in
the ethical you can even join us some
free stuff precipice but so we wanted
that and the community substituted to
get bigger there are some community
members that's like benchmark a lot so
they start coding the same the same base
running different languages this is a
copy is one of the contributors outside
mana so there are 3-3 benchmark I want
to show you one is a brain wipe it and
it's like interpreting reading an
interpreter of the language of brain for
language secretive and Allah has similar
performance although there a lot of
different syntax between each other and
ruby which is similar to crystalline the
joy of the programmer has a way other
performance here another it's for
example arrangement that the magic
multiplication here again he go on
crystal are pretty similar within each
other and ruby is outperformed by the
others although then memory here is
pretty similar within the the four
languages and then we saw another
example with a lot of memory number ik
numerical computation I'm not sure what
the deal is but this event package it is
and here crystal perform
snidely say seeing a lot of God like
cuts in there in the time item and we
are not able to show Ruby because she
running I will aggravate it but this I
know we wasn't make it there in the
integer I don't remember when say the
actual region but so an in-memory well
please stable to perform better in this
case but you see this the performances
that we really has it's pretty nice so
that's not what we currently have but we
recording have been developing for the
last more of more or less five years
we reach the seventh house thousand
lisen on github there we want more and
on the repositories that where it is the
compiler on the terminal library you can
data the main languages it is brittle so
the compiler is written critical itself
which is pretty high for a language we
repeat itself so that means it's ready
to struggle so actually if you want to
learn Kristen you can start reading
about the compiler and contributing
their orders to I find the standard
library and you never need to go to
other language to make performance like
a performance implementation of an array
or a hash it's all aimed to be
implemented increase that itself and
then and all young handles a lot of
optimization for sure
but that's the idea don't don't need to
leave the language to make some some
performance for example in Ruby the the
internal start incremented is T for
performance so if you mean to
let's like take equality comparison
between strings you jump to another
language implement will be it's
understandable it's necessary but it's
kind of measure if it's going to be a
choke and at the same time it is pretty
performance so oh yeah
so I wanted to go through a point 101 of
the language so you can see some
differences differences from others
there are one or two particular like
novel first week we can start with a
description as being an object-oriented
programming language is everything is an
object and we gather to just two main
groups body types and reference types
that similar single network valid eyes
are started in the in the pair
so there are passed by value when you
are using arguments impression basic
school new and
charge different kind of number of
different position similar between a
fancy and there are other value types
which are true status and pointers
double sour like fixes length array that
the compiler can check the length so you
have like some safety when accessing the
indexes there and you can find your own
striking at simply and then you have the
reference types which are allocated in
the hit and are managed by the garbage
collector currently we use one but but
might change in the future we just need
a garbage collector is doing the work
well enough most of your type will be
referenced eyes for sure when you call
your your own classes you there will be
references but you can choose to
destruct in order to for performance
reasons relative to for example if you
are coding a color or point class you
might have a point through just because
the Google - it will just read less less
the garbage collection a calculator but
then one of the types that is not seen
enough in a lot of languages are Union
type Union types are one of the
cornerstone cornerstones of the language
because it allows the filling of a
dynamic language without daylight for
example we can have an array of mixes
type or actually of a single type a
union so there's a kind of a tricky word
they are so we can have an array with
interest integers or strings and when
you upset one when you difference one
one of the images there you will get an
integer or or strange you don't know
which one around at compile time so you
will need to handle both cases from from
there
um for example another example is when
you want to find the charger industry
the result might be an integer or a nil
if there is a charger in the present um
so yes that's that vice means the Union
sighs yeah and if we go to the memory
representation of the Union usually when
when you want to you need to package a
for example if it's a union between
Google and integer we will need to store
the value and attack discrimination just
know which kind of value is personal on
that variable but sometimes we can do
better by for example if it is a
reference type and the value is
represented by a pointer to the memory
you can use a null pointer to conceal so
here in the middle in memory there is no
difference between three for example or
between other mainstream languages but
the thing is that Neil is not a string
or in the type system so you have a dual
stream you can have a new string on a
stream now you have your you control
without null pointer exception because
Neil are not are not it's not a valid
value of every single type does imply
some decision in the library and how to
handle those Anil Abuk the content view
you might have an ill indeed of 1
billion so you need to overcome that
nothing but essentially the compiler
will trace all those possible new values
explicitly I was 40 to catch them
avoiding MS exceptions easy code with
with those safety net and if you could
use them but in memory representation is
something there is no penalty penalty at
all it's all handled in compiling and so
if they compile success it will equal
run without the difference in random S&amp;amp;T
for example
what else going no I don't like have you
written down the Tyson script I wrote an
item for us yeah yeah is it coming
meeting on your head not entirely but we
will see some of the examples of that
but it's all written crystal so it's
like but it's very simple you have this
G advice and you've got five imprints
yes and the hard thing to do the
language with a critical project yes
there is no global type inference
actually there are some but it is
intermediate between global and Google
Play it is let me go to the Sun but then
they would unless you're gone into the
races and try to get the I want to go in
designing the algorithm one of the main
the main out our crystal is this Ari
he goes with us like crazy fun so it's
hard to to follow his code sometimes in
a in the time of his producing but we
the meaning of design how the algorithm
works which they were done in the team
so we can all the big picture there um
if you have a if you have string or no
voices yes can you still a comment
addresses films without which is
possibly a thing for now as long as Mia
response that dr. lily is just one more
value this is like a given value of
github if you call a method over a union
as long as all the possible members of
the Union response to that metal
everything would work fine if not the
compiled with Dell well you are like not
handle this case so you will need to
explicit make a decision how to handle
that you can make like a like a it means
don't do nothing and if it is a strange
list and that will end up with a nil if
we original value was until like maybe
Mona's in Cusco ll just be you
was enough propagating the new values
and if it was a change it will have very
operation so you will end up with a
result of liberation or a nail if the
source within you
their art and idioms on that but it's
not cooking the comes in the gunfire but
on the summer library so it's more a
design decision of the community can see
how to handle that you have contrived
case statement entrench ok guys so you
can take a string business otherwise we
still do this yeah yeah do you need to
have this into value you can buddy if
the idea is like if on runtime it will
end up working because all the days all
the case all the cases of the Union or
handles just do the work video is that
the compiler should be like an assistant
for for the programmer and will do a lot
of words so that the for the compiler
spree kind of lease because it will do
all the math - ok yeah they did come
work or no I don't know if you work on
that let's do a compiler error it really
has some nice features for making DSL
those are based on unlock some time so
you can write a message that will yield
some execution of a code that will be
given by your blog so this example is
something that will run 10 times
depending on the implementation handling
allowing to pass blocks to a metal
mining current performance penalty but
in crystal we don't want this so we
basically do some designing when blocks
are involved so you can have a great
expressiveness and good support of
yourself and at the same time so don't
compromise the performance we talk this
is staying aligned on an for usually
when you start like doing more advanced
things with the language you start
needing a way to have anonymous function
or pointer to function or some sort of
go back to be stored a basically cricket
hat is being enough already
it has a
prov support so you have an animal
function you will say what is the
argument you don't need to say what's
the result type is because because it
will be first you can call it and procs
can even move to closure that means that
people have stayed between the lexical
scope of the of the code so you can have
a point function changing the country to
write the state where is what we find
with some vendors and constraint
patterns usually when you start seeing
closures with you you start figuring
some of the of the corner cases of
progress shows nothing too important of
ethical nationally language is just that
we have support for and being started
since we have typed at compile time we
can do method overloading
during compile time so we can define
overloads and those who will come pitch
speak with pasted on on the types of the
arguments on the numbers of the
arguments or even the name of the
arguments because we have a name a
keyword for for some method so we can
call them on the left something crystal
basic operation with overloading and it
will work and the compiler will choose
at compile time only one which is the
appropriate overload to to be run but
for example in GUI or usually the thing
happening happening javascript if you
want to have some sort of overload you
need to handle that on run time on every
single call so you are complementing the
performance they are because you are not
able to say ok yeah this call is for
this over so this whole is for this
other overload beside that the method
looks weird you are missing the overload
on the demand and the semantics of the
men of the metal if you do that um so
you you have over looks like legacy here
you can find many many methods and
on the number argument of Cuba against
that the type inference so that was when
basic structure of the language how how
the business of the grammar mixed
together and in order to to be able to
code it in a fun way or in a joy a
similar program any variable for
programmers that's in in Ruby you are
able to to bond
I'm afraid anybody will at all because
it's totally dynamic and you just need
to create when you instantiate a new a
new instance of a class was you need to
mention the class there or if not make
something much even there you come
positive variables waving arc but since
we don't want to want to do a lot of
high penetration explicit dimensional
measurement types we need some sort of
inference or the compiler to start
writing that as if we will have in doing
it so for the stratified inference the
bases will be to describe the literal
with of literals for all those type and
even a regular expression also that's
that they see a literally salt already a
member of a type and that is well known
so we have those those rules in the
compiler that's pretty basic every time
you see an expression that is a little
on you cook you can already type it
nothing nothing but then for example for
viable for local variables of metal
metal it's time you have an assignment
if you read the code but call you you
expect that that variable is able to
store the value represented by the run
hand side so just try to type the
expression the right hand side and you
expect you bind
value you make an expectation with a
sort of binding you bind the variable
age choose the type of expression of the
one so that's like a it's an expectation
that is propagate propagated across all
the statements of the program so now if
we assign the variable a to b we are
expecting that the B will hold the type
of the expression of the variable a so
we are started making bindings between
expressions between the notes of the of
the abstract syntax tree of the language
and those those binding will will result
on the on the judgment of which is the
type that each variable should hold if
there are multiple execution paths of
the code we might live to different
expectation for example on one side we
might have a variable is integer onion
on our side it could be a string so at
the end of the we in the midpoint of the
program its abstract as well it might be
a u it will be a union book because it's
either an integer or a string nothing
else it means it will be one of those so
unions here's our artists core because
it allows you to don't don't care about
if it is the same type in both branches
it would probably be if you are
programming with a in a clean way
usually this variable is used for only
one thing but sometimes but it was
change across the time so you it's
pretty handy to have this in an how to
make this way you don't need to
explicitly I want a to be a union
between now it would be a union so in
the example means that since a is a
union when assigning an integer it will
be it will do that tacking sort for that
I would say okay it's the integer and
the value or it is means
a stream and the value of the stream
since this word for like all assignments
of a like if you had a first assignment
of a that dominated this that was in the
yes I'm going to string was still up it
yeah yeah there are some analysis
whether it's something called a single
that assignment basically it handles
sums in some sort of order of the
assignment so you can forget what you
said before you have a new information
there yes there is no constraint about
which which assignment with you you have
some special cases but it's basically it
will work as you expect then is that the
compiler do this do that much like just
get give me there so what if you had if
you had a equals 42 and then like not an
understatement or anything immediately
after that a so hello yeah this type of
a would still be in 32 or stream so now
I will be doing okay
I think the very end it will be training
before it so there will be different a
actually for the compiler because a
little pro so in okay okay um yes
so as even is that a literal terms of
time if you have a very little
flexibility to can you say X plus equal
one so that work will give you could be
could one and two is good it will be
that class between close on integer so
related post operation yeah yeah uw6
left to em i QX of one this area yeah it
will be a not overload and how does it
handle now it probably do the conversion
and then at night operation so but that
might hang from the on the library um
come on my Abbott says that programmers
go spend a lot of time prepare
accidentally having creating Union ties
to and they just made some minor typo
and that they hire it says you've got in
plus and dream something 16 plus Anil
and it just because they they make a
living state with an emphasis that might
happen depending on on their service
program something does like that might
happen Union doesn't doesn't occur that
matter it's not more than one or two and
sometimes if you are
for example you are coding a lot like
you know that the result needs to be a
stroke you might do the addition of I
expect us to be afloat and they compare
with highlights
well you can practice not afloat so you
are able to have some sort of discussion
with the compiler if you don't express
anything the compiler will do as much as
it can to make it work even in creating
a lot of of Union Square but usually
that's not a lot of the cases like when
visions something that works for the
high person of the cases although you
can feel some weird cases that's not
what what happened and we have come back
and forth on some ideas on how I do
inferential work I can tell you the
hitter episode is later budget so you
have the technical and or method called
square it happens is that first you type
the argument and then you search for all
the overloads available so that metal
bank on those arguments and when you
find one you basically do an in
sensation of step methods for that
particular argument combination and you
do the process using the context of a of
the types of the arguments so in this
case you will know that X should be an
each other because we returned
everything trigger and if you call with
another Robo mode you will have a again
another leasing Association and in
interest rates can be added that send up
in in a string so this is kind of T
templates if you would like to see what
it's like every method is like a
template and it will be instantiated
when it's being called absence perfect
admin has double quotes in it yes the
first ever would not be valid for mixes
it will not compile but would you just
not find a rebel it would be an error
but if it is if I add a class double
quotes at the end of I plus B plus
double quotes
the first one it won't compile because
yoga notice that one but the body
doesn't compile because it would be
trying to other
integer on a string and it will say
they're not in metal itself and ii feel
it was right but you could have another
word for adverb balance over yeah yeah
if i have two variables daily they're
bold of type int or string yes and I
call X equal dad he's made only what
happens I should get a compiler error
yeah you know you will pick up get that
in your head they might be correlated
because it's either both of our
strengths or both are in but the
compiler doesn't know that correlation
and if I had something where it should
you know through an h1 parameter that's
your motivation one string one is 11
into our strength they figured out which
one to call it at one guy and yes in
compiled time it will gather it will
check if they're not metal overload for
all the destinations with fruitcake I
mean really I'm with winter yet remember
yeah that is basically called and multi
dispatch so it's available now when we
just nothing mentions I think let's go
move it is but so you'll die ugly coding
Ruby it's just generated by crystals in
those cases for every for your educated
nurses yeah if you have Union yes but
this right now that's how it's working
again for a performance reason we we
think that it's better to under
differently that's not such a mess for
now that is how it is been working for
physics are complicated example here we
have a material
function we are calling it and we want
to type it so the first step is into
integration that is over an integer and
since we want to know the the return
type of that of metal the the only
segment is the conditional so the return
type of the function is the return type
of the conditioner and that's a union
between the two branches of the subway
on one side we have the the asterisk and
under on the other side with
the literal but we won't see that for
the moment if we go on the left-hand
side we have another call
actually we have we need to we have a
call and we need to resolve the argument
let's let's drop me that I mean sugar -
an integer let's do an interior so that
leads to to a call of factorial with an
integer and the other argument is an is
the end another integer and if we wanted
to trace type that recursive call we
could end up in this in this same
process because we don't know exactly
the type of of factorial but what we do
is to bind the result of this recursive
in implication to the thing that we are
trying to resolve this so there are this
kind of graph will be done by the
compiler so actually when we created
this graph initially the fact the return
type of material was unknown so now we
have unknown in the in the left hand
side of the graph going around and but
we have a so we didn't get any any new
information from from the left but from
the right is we have a literal one that
gets injected in the in the Union so
it's a union between something that is
unknown and an integer so that will be
at least an integer so which we said
okay the Union is an integer for now so
the the the first the top factorial is
not it supposed to be an integer for now
and that's called plug it in to the
bottom part so now we can resolve that
is that the multiplication between an
integer and an integer that's like an
integer so now we have the union between
two integers and let's do another
integer and that finally leads to a
fixed point on this algorithm it will it
could happen that it will get another
type of
Union so the Union will be updated at
work force between an imager and
something else and that process will
keep continue running until you have a
picture point it will serve it and you
will be permanent yes at least no ether
mate because there are some some bumps
in the tech system so you can have
infinite size that's that's how it is
because it's a it's like it's only going
up with the unions and you have finest
amount of typography it will end
eventually and unless you allow infinite
type in there for the same source code
or a business and in the indicators you
need to handle in this the normal status
event you can't call a weird case
probably in the near future that 138 but
that's probably not a problem you're
interested in coding um so yeah but and
in our example for example this case
when we index the variables and we have
a anneal or ring if we try to access the
Charter that index it slips to a
compiler error because there is no
overload for nil because it could be a
null pointer exception in most of the
other program so what you need to do for
example is okay if I have an integer or
anything that is not nil it will be
sculpted in the scope of the conditional
the variable IDs it will be assuming to
be a minister so you have a kind of some
kind of refinement but for system s the
type of that variable because because of
the HS you can even do some checks
easily by type or by K and you can do
boolean operator or they are son to
compile your handle stack so you can cut
a and B are integers and both will be
integer and that works
um-um for for classes for example and
you need to you need to be able to is
reminding the type of instance variables
in the
by the class code that means for example
from from this method you can create
like a quick question previous one
yes sorry certain such one before he
said gives index
I mean in this block to just dominated
by the nominal condition yes you know
this connect is only type incurring to
do to assign the index is not block what
with that work inside a initial data it
will be another reliable after you
mentioned that
so the exhaustive index equals no and
then time to index inside there for
click nominal a so now that's okay like
this and you variable inside the book
yeah I already a height and I want to
comment on and see like program
languages it exits nail then get some
value come on
and if you see here you actually
assigning to variable has only one pipe
which is nil and give it to resize it
yeah let's rewind it will be I like a
new variable hidden outside the scope
use the effects finally will create an
Union big of physics inside a what could
happen into the condition doesn't mess
okay or it's only variable to the
restriction of the title yeah they live
is it you know if you know you're
checking that it's not meal so you are
able to call some overload without
caring about the previous game we have
an integer or a nil but we only have
accessing
characters by index to the same variable
but it's just those it does
multi-service yeah
I'm regarding classes for example here
instead of you don't need to declare
explicitly all the instance variables
but for in the ended example from the
argument name that is restricted to be
applied or string it knows that the
interval of the name should be a string
goes well so this did work by my day by
this I think are installed on the
classes and another runs only will be to
explicitly call in some variables let's
sort of work for documentation purposes
also and as you want to when you're
discuss design
you want to criticize the instance
variables but it's not always necessary
so we see that we have a instance
variable from from the argument or
explicit typing or you can even have
like assignment from literals or a miss
example is a generic class you can
create a new n and the compiler know
that as values should be an array of T
and that works like mr. convention that
if you apply new to a class which will
return something of that type if not you
are probably screwed
so this this examples work and this is
for example a generator so we have
generators as well with type type are
miniature see what you could expect will
be do the minute I post a general
aesthetic of this dynamic so you don't
care about that but in Greathouse is a
static type unit okay so we have a nice
intact we have a right compiler with a
low simple type inference that allow us
to not care about some bureaucracy aside
but in order to be able to cure to
perform good we need I was a good sport
of concurrency and indeed we base our
work on Allen and angle so we basically
have the same sort of mechanism we have
some lightweight process that abstract
the threads of the operating system and
you can work without using mu techs or
other I think mechanism because you have
like these fibers or routine that when
you started the the main prom still
executing until it performs an and slow
i/o award locking operations like a web
request or something and when that
happens you will be scheduling shows
that
a flow operation end and schedule we'll
we'll pick up the next available fiber
to execute between that and the
communication mechanism that is channels
again similar can go an hour the main
thing is that you can cause things
linearly without callback hell I think
like when you end up elevation you need
to have a callback for success or
failure you can call linearly you you
make a request and you have the variable
that we want having the the result of
that ripple even if it does end up doing
a test ending you to work for the to a
little pool of fevers until until that
it is completed so astounding that is
exactly where here that started this
process and what's your sweat we have
select here we have two left and the
work that is some time mouth also
support so you can call it without the
having timeouts think I think that's
already rich matter but although it was
in a branch somewhere England oh yeah
you you have that those mechanism
currently chrysalis single thread we
don't have person yet that's one of the
goals for the upcoming map so all the
performer all the benchmarks before
wasn't a single thread and there are a
lot of spam benchmark going around on
notebook and it's single dress we
believe I owe empower or not even fire
operations now even though I operation
but is a conquering comic-con currently
use your schedule that the reason when
the race ends it will be available for
for bringing us the results those like
heightened in that you can have most so
file operations however you want actual
transient competition but yes so there's
only one in one has pronounced finale
yeah the idea is to reach an early level
process with Eric yeah yeah you can
afford it and make another communication
mechanism right now
that is like doing you mind doing that
work manually is to to have a person in
building in the language it will
probably more similar than nothing go
then for example if Danny black because
I will feel more about going on the
directional unlit for now but we are
still researching and learning from from
other languages and another aspect
crystal handled
I think this is almost all of the rest
of it of the 101 of the krita is meta
programming where we has a great support
for meta programming sometimes it is to
avoid boilerplate things that we pay to
do it once and again so for example if
we have this code which defines the same
method a method of scissors we can call
we can use macros which is like a subset
of the language defined like a new
method that the the result of that
method is code that would be like inline
it in the definition so the person can
be coded as calling the macro better
with others mdh so that will expand to
the Bali scope and you can do a lot of
things with this method have that curly
braces impact almost template or all
template do now the thing that is a
little bit different from C macros for
example base because they are not
similar features there are nicer
actually then the matters receives a
representation of the of the expression
of AFA basic tricks so and you can
access that information so you can
receive a blog and get the expression of
the dog and I don't know shuffle around
the the instructions does not recommend
it but or even surround that with we are
paying for expected for change that code
the code that is output by the matter is
the one that is unlike to say the
previous code doesn't need to compile
this list records with without which
conducts more like it let's all look for
a posh work
or you can receive and Tim wall and
convert it to an identifier or to a
training and so if you can define the
methods or do something very random
actually in the previous example
algorithm age are like our parcel method
calls or variables but then I are not
using us as method just another term to
be AC basic record if you want to do
advanced yet if you want just to
interpolate things that you are
receiving you don't need to care about
but there are some reason Tatian about
what a macro can be suppose an argument
because it needs to be modest one is a
quick effect and can you evaluate
expression to crystal giving this
language there is a subset of crystal of
this interpreted during math yeah can
you require specific codes for the
macaron yes and you can even have a
support for typing some introspection
during compile time so for example all
all the trucks are when you call a new
truck you will have a new equality of
erase a operator based on the on all the
members on all the field that is nothing
to compile button on the library with
all macro mechanic so if that does call
it the in Solaris let's put in it so I I
like that I have a stirrup and I already
have a lot of operation and you can go
even crazy and run an external process
to generate code come on somehow the
there is a module called EPR this is
like an Bevis crystal it's a template
that will allow you to out generate at
the string representation for example
for HTML view or whatever it's pretty
neat and it's compiled so you have a
compile and check of the views a key is
to have in t-shirt in this net body
greater then the Sun memory is pretty
big there are support of a lot of things
that you want to do for either
online tools server HTTP Cayenne and we
have an FTP server there is an STD -
server made for Samanas as a separate
chart bigger package that you can
consume and your database driver let's
write directly on socket
pretty-pretty of Isis so without
actually native dependency we just write
implement the protocol the my sequel or
or total public protocol over the socket
and the design of the i/o is stream
arranges I can see so you you can raise
unrighteous and string so I'm to
decrease there is a lot of focus on
decreasing the memory consumption so
with when party not generating JSON
there the API is designed for that for
streaming all the results all along and
we have support for for interacting with
see use declare binding to see increase
on itself and you are able to call that
those functions or even the Clark trip
without leaving the language and LLVM
will hand the crystal to LOM will handle
the all the going back and forth and you
have support for for coalesce for
companies see you can turn this to
crystalline and receiver and bind to UI
libraries if you want there are some
some already go in there so basically my
syntax is but inside for Ruby at all VM
a great thing to the compiler
we're in spreads on a lot of languages
we hope to inspire all over other one
for sure the migration to the compiler
to do as much work as possible
currently there are when the commit is
pretty good you can join many is and
there are meetups there's a great
support not always is the sibling - of
response to that there are already great
contributors there we have external
contributors are not members of - that
are committer seeming increase already
we focus on having night documentation
we caraga
that they're already like one 1,500
packages already we are sponsored by
whoever wants to give up money even if
it's one dollar per month we have 80
sponsors from one to hundred of the
little bit that's it
on the next month or during during 2017
our goals are to have no deterrent to
encourage the windows support and
polishing the language features to reach
100 so we are we don't want to have
breaking changes but so those those are
the main goals although we are they will
be able to develop in our area for sure
yeah so that's the that is the feature
the near future of crystal there are
great tools there's ratings being done
and as soon as that we get more feedback
we are there are more chances to change
things when we reach 100 we want to be
able to not break in things backwards
question for you yeah sure what programs
you want to write like this language um
what kind of every language has yes at
all since the Bologna set out for what
usually is an intentional goal is to
build from a niche which he/she finds
them um we like it's a general foreign
languages so it is not that we end or
something religious if ik it in the
grant site it's really good for writing
a common mental for example or handling
short life a short request for
professors like mud run processing it's
really great for that there is no big
framework lining ways that you can come
in say yeah let's go in crystal pls
where application because there is a lot
of gecko system just needs to evolve but
there since the singularity would rule
these are many people that want to push
it that way because it's a community
is suffering from performance and
shifting to this relation will be that
hard
click opportunity of the cinta although
it isn't new languages there's no
guarantee we don't enter the a subset of
crystal of approving or we don't end to
compile laureate oh it's just inspiring
think that so there are they are
suitable for web a coroner will say that
for background processing should be
fully great or handling ATI site if you
want to handle a lot of frequency with
well performance that's good going home
when I'm with you I maybe it's not the
best thing to do right now you don't
have a lot of food chain available you
can do it because it's just a process
you will live they say to tell you you
just ship the binaries today to the
server you use might might even mmm
assets in the binary and it's just an
executive that will fit into the core of
the go up uncommon lentils are critical
because for example you don't need to
know all the package jump artifice it's
just a basic already compiled the tool
and it will run really fast
so those I think the strands are we use
it nowadays for for some balls like
black box or programming some smaller
application and there are some some
person seated some some projects already
in production for some people's and in
the game industry or in the assembly in
place for railways or during immigrants
and for some my program the author of
psyche with a package for second
processor a processing in fully it
metaphor the radio of Prasad an acoustic
neuroma transferring again three days in
Vedic hold and with a razor phone so
that I think if you have an IP your
favorite key library does you come in
use it in years because you don't want
the Odin see you can have a fresh air in
crystalline
by data I'm good and they're even close
that will call all the bindings to see
automatically departing the key header
hi giving in to the hospital migrated
from review now without a wicking of the
diaper differences between their two
languages but we don't then to be great
the code I love the next one sorry
delivery with the dramatic shake
stickers or becoming take one of these
if you want to thank you um sorry come
again
career religion Julia not personally
about Ariane one that we are to my
elbows of crystal they they they said I
guess there are some similar there's
benefit you have our expertly we want
those people to a lot of similarities
yes everybody is trying to reach the new
mainstream language and I think there
are a lot of really so they're shifting
back to static type languages or with
one that's security right again from
stickers and you can make acquittal here
cut it and thank you for message other
you can join the many websites an email
