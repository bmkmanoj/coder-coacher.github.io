keynote speaker second keynote speaker
for the conference first one today we
have nirajan it's going to talk about
the developer experience at Google and
I'll hand it over to him interesting
fact nirajan actually interviewed me
when I was applying at Google so don't
fact don't make don't that let that bad
decision factor into your your
evaluation of this is keynote but take
it away hi how's everybody doing you all
had enough caffeine to last through the
day making sure please give a round of
applause to all the organizers I think
they've done a fantastic job with all
the logistics and security so my name is
new engine I work at Google on developer
products particularly I work on
something many of you might have heard
of it's called firebase if we launch it
as a mobile developer platform a few
months ago at Google i/o I specifically
focus on a lot of tools or
infrastructure that are geared towards
app quality and the thesis of my talk
here my keynote here today is how we've
actually demonstrated that by investing
in developer experience you can have a
positive impact on app quality and
quality of your software and code base
in general I'm going to speak mostly
about mobile but a lot of the things and
the lessons that we've learned are
fairly generic and you could potentially
apply them to other areas as well I
think towards the end of last keynote
yesterday by muncie you probably saw
some of the challenges with the wide
variety of Android devices and the large
diversity in devices that's actually
making a challenging to be a mobile app
developer out people out here who
actually built and tested mobile apps
can feel that pain pretty well so it
it's cases like these we're investing in
developer experience really matters and
hopefully I can convince you of that as
we proceed what that's me and it's my
name so first of all let's just take a
moment to recap how we got here software
development in general is being
democratized there are far more and
people writing software today than there
were just five years ago just take a
look around yourself just take a look
around this room right like there's
people from all walks of life from many
countries we had a great diversity
scholarship program which allowed a lot
of participants to fly out here which is
awesome and that trend is actually
apparent as you sort of look at apps and
as you look at people who are building
software across the earth and it's it's
gotten that way for a bug for multiple
reasons number one there has been a
phenomenal shift and growth in computing
if you actually look at the previous
generations dominant computing platform
pcs it took them about two decades to
get to half a billion users it took
mobile phones less than four years or
five years to get to a billion devices
and that growth continues today like by
now there's about three to four times as
many mobile phones as there are pcs this
probably is not news to most of the
people out here most of you have
actually seen this graph before in some
shape or form but the reason why I'm
actually here talking about this graph
is because there's just a profound shift
that's happening in terms of the growth
of the growth of mobile apps and it's
not showing any signs of slowing down
you you can go to countries today where
you can buy a pretty good mobile phone
for less than a hundred dollars and it
actually is a pretty good device you can
get most of your things done on that and
that is being the only computing
experience that almost a billion people
have had that there are people who've
never ever used pcs don't have email
addresses but the only thing that
they've had is a mobile phone and that's
actually a big factor in why there are
more app developers because there's
actually more people using computing
devices
not just that but we as an industry have
also done a pretty good job of lowering
the bar for what it takes to become a
software developer so if you if you
consider a few things you know number
one education we it back when I was
studying computer science you pretty
much had to have a four-year degree or
an equivalent to do have a meaningful
career in computers and most of the
interesting course material was actually
taught only in colleges and universities
you could get some technical education
here and there but it wasn't really well
fleshed out if you look at things today
things like Udacity things like Coursera
the OpenCourseWare that you can have
available from MIT there's a bunch of
things available from Stanford you can
get most of the great content available
to you for free or at very low cost just
for us in Google we've actually
partnered with a bunch of training
institutes in India to go to have a lot
of developers go through a android
nanodegree in partnership with Udacity
and a few other companies in India and
we've seen a lot of great success and
it's what this means is like more and
more developers are actually coming out
and building great apps and have been
trained to be mobile app developers not
just that but the tools of trade are now
free or really cheap how many of you
have worked with visual studio before in
in the past quite a few right you
probably remember you have to pay
hundreds of dollars to actually get a
license for visual studio probably
cheaper if you're a student or something
and if you actually have to deploy your
apps deploy any services you had to
probably build your own services and
data centers and if you if you need any
other custom software you actually have
to pay more for it now if you look at
things like Xcode or Android studio
they're basically free or they cost less
than twenty dollars or something like
that and that's actually profoundly
important because it actually enables
more people people to tinker around with
software and they actually can they
don't need to invest a lot of money in
just like trying to prototype their
ideas and that's awesome not just that
but
there's a lot of great frameworks and
building blocks that apps used to to
build to build great experiences and
those are basically available for free
right now you can go all the way from
cloud services where Amazon Web Services
and Google Cloud and Microsoft Azure and
all these other things you can you can
basically launch a free service today
and as long as your traffic doesn't
exceed a certain amount of volume so you
get like world-class data center and
server support for free you can build
almost half of your app for free there's
like amazing app development frameworks
like react native or firebase or fabric
by Twitter and a few more and you get a
lot of the things that you would have
needed to do to build an app basically
built out for free and that's spurring
more and more app development as we go
forward in general I think with mobile
open source has also truly come into its
own and has really hit a good level of
maturity if you if you look at github
today it's a very very vibrant ecosystem
people are forking repositories all the
time people are sharing things at a far
greater pace than they were sharing
before and that's actually led to more
innovations in soft and more people
creating good experiences just to quote
an example Google released a machine
learning library called tensorflow about
a year ago on github and in just a year
it's been forked more than any other
library out there and this is something
which is like cutting edge neural
networks machine learning image
processing those kind of things and it's
now being used pretty widely all over
the world so naturally as you have
better tools and free or cheap
infrastructure and open source and great
education and things like that you see
that a number of apps is actually going
quite high up there are way more apps
being created today then there were a
few years ago it's it's it's important
to note that the iPhone was launched
about eight to nine years ago and less
than seven years ago there was no apps
there was no no such thing as mobile
apps
from that point until today we have
close to a few million mobile apps so
just think about the explosion that has
happened right in terms of how many apps
are out there so things so far seem
great right why am I here talking about
problems and we'll get to that in a bit
not just that there are now multiple
companies have build successful
businesses and they started only as
mobile apps like the the the the
companies that you see behind me all of
them actually began as mobile apps and
they're probably still just mobile apps
like I don't think you've used any of
them as anything other than am over
there for the most part if you just take
the valuations of these companies I
think most of them are still private if
you just take the valuations of these
companies and you add them up they would
be in the top 50 in terms of GDP by
revenue of countries right like so think
about just how big and phenomenal this
thing has been from a revenue growth
perspective when you have that much
money flowing through your apps and
through your services quality suddenly
starts becoming really important because
any loss in revenue is any loss any loss
in usability or stability means a drop
in revenue and which means people get
very very unhappy really quickly so as
these industries are matured use now
start to see people paying more
attention to quality and testing and all
those kind of things on mobile app
software so we did an analysis earlier
this year we took we took a bunch of
reviews and data and crashes that were
being sent to the google play store we
waited a bit of sentiment analysis by
actually parsing the review text and we
we also looked at some historical trends
and data for crashes as well as why
people rate things a certain way so the
the the pie chart that you see behind me
is actually the the one star like is the
reasons for why people give one star
rating to apps on the Play Store and the
overwhelming reason for why people get
such low ratings for their apps is
actually stability issues somebody saw
crash like you try
to use a nap it crashed you got angry
you left a one-star review and you know
you try to express your frustration that
way for people here who are actually
working in software engineering and who
are practitioners of software
engineering and testing and such the
answer is pretty obvious to you right
like the reason by somebody crashes
because data didn't test properly but
even and most of the app developers also
kind of probably know it but yet you
have so many apps out there we which
actually have this like proliferation of
crashes and stability issues and such
like that even if you look at mobile
apps in general occur in the apple app
store or the Android Play Store you see
like this a small number of really great
apps but then there's this long tail of
apps that basically get downloaded maybe
10 15 20 times and nobody else uses them
afterwards right like so it's a clear
sign that the quality tapers off really
quickly and we aren't really doing a
good job of helping bring up the level
of that quality one of the reasons why
it's so hard and I think you probably
saw one of the charts in manassas
keynote yesterday is there's this
compounded complexity when it comes to
mobile app software just thinking about
mobile apps you actually have about two
to three thousand different device
manufacturers and different hardware
units and hardware form factors and such
if you kind of take the summation of all
the versions of iOS Android and a few
other operating system you get about a
hundred different OS variants you need
to test on at any given point of time
there are anywhere between 700 to 800
global carriers that people actually
connect to the internet on not to
mention different cloud providers
different network topologies and things
like that so if you actually want to
really do a good job of testing across
all of these like you are looking at a
insanely high number of permutations and
combinations that you actually have to
work with and as a result it actually
becomes a big daunting challenge for you
to build a really high quality app
especially if you're like a two or three
persons startup and you're just getting
off the ground and you now have to like
think about this entire giant complex
matrix it's probably easy for companies
like you know Google
where we have a lot of Engineers
invested in solving these problems or
you know other companies like Facebook
or even like banks and other things but
imagine if you are just an up-and-coming
company you know you're a few students
in India or Indonesia or somewhere and
you have a great idea and you're trying
to get it out and now suddenly you have
to deal with this giant set of
permutations and combinations that you
have to tioga so what we found is if the
reason why actually people get into
these problems is because while we have
done a really good job of making it easy
for people to write great apps we are
not quite there yet as an industry when
it comes to helping people test apps
better and I think be if you look at the
the user experience of our testing tools
if you look at it developer experience
of how what it takes to write apps and
build well tested software there's a lot
of rough edges and we're actually we
need to do a better job of addressing
that collectively as a group so I'm
going to try and talk about a few
examples of what we've done at Google to
sort of address these things the thing
that I'm going to talk about are
actually products that you can go and
use today and we have more announcements
to come in the upcoming months as well
so this is by no means a complete list
there is a huge universe similar to the
one that I'm going to talk about that
that gets used internally at Google as
well and it's a continuously evolving
space there's also a lot of great
innovations and solutions that happen
outside we were in other companies as
well and but a I'm going to try and talk
about things that I'm more familiar with
myself that I personally work on in a
hope that I we can actually inspire you
and help you so we going back to this
whole permutations and combinations of
devices and and you know complexity with
all the hardware fragmentation as well
as all the topology another things so
we've we realized that we want to help
all of our app developers make make a
living we want to help them build better
software we want their apps to not crash
and we realize how hard it is like we
actually did a lot of user studies and
we even have our own examples internally
where people just want to test their app
on a bunch of devices and they don't
really care about like buying devices
and setting them up and maintaining them
nobody has it time to do that like
especially if you're a small team like
it takes a lot of your time just to do
that what people want is a simple easy
to use cloud service if you're if you're
not really doing maintenance of your own
data centers and your own services and
back ends and things like that then you
probably shouldn't need to do it for
your mobile apps as well so earlier this
year we announced something called as a
firebase test lab and we've been working
on it for a few years we also acquired a
company called a purify along the way
and they join forces with us and so
we've launched a service which is about
a few thousand devices in our data
centers and you as an app developer can
actually rent them and you can run your
tests on them we've we've paid a lot of
attention to user experience here and we
try really hard to meet you the app
developer wherever you are if you use a
if you use Android studio to build your
Android apps you actually have the
functionality and plugins baked into
Android studio so you can actually while
you're writing your tests you can
actually just run them on our lab and
get results back right away we have a
good command line library where you can
actually use it for your own local runs
and local debugging where it will
automatically take your test ship it to
our lab run then bring back results to
you we also have plugins that work with
all the popular continuous integration
systems like Jenkins and Travis so that
companies who want to set up their own
continuous integration can do that and
we actually do have paying customers
like American expression others who are
actually doing that
supposed to be an animation there but
anyway imagine that there's an animation
of a robot I think the site got kind of
messed up so what we realized quickly
was there's still a gap in maturity when
it comes to testing most of the like
simply providing a lab is not enough
because it assumes that app developers
have actually done their job of writing
tests and they've actually done a job of
like thinking about testing to begin
with but most companies and apps are
actually just starting up and they don't
really have the ability to you know
ordinarily have the time really to
actually go in and do testing ahead of
time so the people want something
quickly then people want to get a quick
view of quality of it app so what we did
was we actually took the concept of
monkey runners which was with which is
like a random key press on your app and
we turned it into a more predictable
sort of crawling mechanism so we built
this robot which actually crawls your
app automatically and we it goes through
all the UI's in your app it has a bunch
of intelligence baked in and it can do
things like it knows when it's seeing a
ok or cancel button or it knows things
like you are about to encounter a login
screen so it can kind of try to bypass
that but the goal is we want to try an
exercise as much of a wrap as possible
in the hopes of getting it to crash so
most of the device specific bugs that
happen or actually crashes anyway so we
try to sort of give you that data as
quickly as possible without requiring
much effort from you so it's a very
simple one-click thing for app
developers you go to firebase or google
com you upload an apk and in a few
minutes you get a a good analysis done
over a wide variety of devices that that
will tell you where your app has been
crashing or performing badly or things
like that
we quickly realized that once app
developers actually start writing tests
start using a robot and it's not finding
crashes they are like that's great like
I known of Maya precious now and i would
like to prevent it going forward I want
to do a better job of not having my app
crash going forward so they want to
write tests but it's kind of a daunting
thing and they did don't quite know how
to get started there's already great
documentation out there like
stackoverflow is really helpful the
espresso community is pretty vibrant and
so other communities as well but so like
if if you just want something quickly
done you just don't have the time to
invest a few hours or a few days sort of
setting things up and studying things
etcetera so what we did was the
partnered really closely with the
Android studio team and we launched
something called as the espresso test
recorder it's actually available today
in Android studio so if you download the
Android studio you can actually try it
today on your phone on your laptop the
way it works is you you simply take your
Android phone you hook it up to Android
studio and you do a bunch of actions and
will generate espresso test code for you
that's it like you don't have to you
don't have to set up frameworks it's all
baked in and these are actually working
functional tests and it's since it's
just as press or test code you can
actually do your own assertions you can
you can change things you can you can
add more you can add more assertions you
can modify test you can copy that test
and write like 10 different as it's all
up to you which is given with working
test code and this has actually been a
big hit with app developers we've had
we've had a lot of tests and great
feedback already and it only kind of was
big now became generally a variable a
month or so ago so the uptake has been
pretty exciting so we've we've had about
a million plus tests already written and
run on the firebase test lab which I am
really happy about this is a quote from
gedcom one of her large partners we
actually had them present with us at one
conferences in Berlin last week and
they've basically got rid of their own
lab and they are just now using firebase
test lab and I think that's it's good to
see positive feedback from our customers
and getting good validation for the work
that we've been doing here so what we
realize that was it's great like we
actually got people to care a bit more
about testing we've given them tools
we've tried to be in their workflows
we've tried to help them sort of along a
path like we've tried to build a
well-lit guided path for them to do
testing for their apps but it's still
not enough like we've we people still
don't really discover firebase as much
like they don't really think of it when
they want to sort of think about testing
it's it's still it's still not in the in
people's workflow as much so one of the
things that we are trying we've been
trying to do is actually really help app
developers get ahead of this testing
curve as much as possible so we also
worked really closely with the Google
Play team so one of the things that
every app developer does is they
actually want to once they write their
app and once they think it's good enough
they want to publish their app because
that's the only way they're going to get
their friends and family to play with it
first and hopefully the word of mouth
will get out and the rap will become
popular and they'll be billionaires in a
few years but but you first need to
publish your app and since we have a
very sort of centralized mechanism for
doing that we actually work with the
place for a team where while you're
publishing your app you can just check a
box saying that I would like a free
robot run no no action required nothing
extra that you need to do and actually
give you that for free and what we do is
we give you something called as a
pre-launch report where you as an app
developer even if you don't know
anything about testing you can still
publish your app and you and when you
publish should have to the alpha or beta
channel in a few hours you'll actually
get a pretty detailed report at in a few
minutes we'll get a pretty detailed
report about what's happening with our
app so and we actually run it on a wide
range of devices
of Android phones so that we know that
these devices cover like most of the
crashes and most of the other kind of
issues so we know that by just running
through that your app will actually have
been tested without you having to do
much so we give you information about
crashes so we will tell you which
devices are your app is crashing one vs
which devices it's not well of course
give you stack traces and logs of
whatever we have on our devices so that
you can debug those crashes a lot of the
device specific bugs also happen because
of internationalization and they happen
because of screen densities and layouts
and things like that so we'll we'll also
try and give you a auto-generated list
of screenshots where you can actually
find layout issues this is actually a
real example where because of German
Italian translations the app was really
not working they had a bunch of texts
hidden and the developers were able to
actually catch it and fix it and this
happened only on galaxy note devices for
some reason we also do a deep security
scan of your app so malware on mobile
apps is a pervasive problem mostly
because oftentimes app developers use
libraries that were built by other folks
and those libraries might not be the
most trustworthy one so accidentally you
might be incorporating malware into your
apps without you wanting to do that so
we actually do we use the same security
analysis that Google uses for its own
platforms and we do that for your apps
on the Play Store and we'll actually
flag you a bunch of security issues
whether you're whether you are doing
things in an unsafe way or whether you
are using things that are that have
known malware signatures will actually
flag you and we'll let you know about
that as quickly as possible so it's
we've had pretty good success with just
this right like so the whole reason why
we want to do this is because we want to
really bring up the the quality and the
stability of the entire ecosystem the
that's why we're investing so much money
and time and effort into this and the
early results are very promising
in just about six months since we
launched we've actually seen twenty
percent fewer crashes for apps that
actually use the player on support so if
if we take if it we can if it ate two
apps one of them doesn't use the
pre-launch report the other one does the
ones who do see twenty percent less
crashes it's it's still a bit of a
confirmation bias right now because the
apps would tend to do it also once would
do really care a bit more about testing
but over time we are seeing these
numbers stabilized so hopefully these
patterns will hold the the other stat
which was really promising and
encouraging for us is and this is how we
actually know that app developers are
really taking advantage of the play
pre-launch report is if you had a
release and you release it to the alpha
or beta Channel and you we sent you an
email saying that hey look you guys had
crashes and your apps not performing
well on these devices we see that sixty
percent of those crashes are actually
fixed in the subsequent release by the
developer so you really something to the
alpha beta channel you get a report and
you have you fixed it before it's widely
available to everyone out there that's
the exact desired outcome that we want
and I think our goal is to try and push
that number as high as possible as
opposed two hundred percent hopefully as
possible so so far we've seen great
uptake here and really happy about that
I want to switch gears just a little bit
to crash reporting I know it's not
exactly in the realm of testing per se
but we think that by working closely
with app developers and by engaging them
through the entire apps lifecycle we can
actually have a positive impact on
software quality and equality and we are
firm believers in helping app developers
closing the loop so our goal is to make
sure that these things work seamlessly
as much as possible so we took the same
the same principles of simplicity and
user experience and we brought them to
crash reporting as well because face it
even if you've done a good job of
testing and you've used the test lab to
its full potential and you've written
test there's probably going to be some
arcane issues that you're going to only
find because you didn't think of the
immortan you couldn't anticipate the
environment changes so we
as a part of the firebase SDK we
actually include crash reporting our
goal is to give you not just data but we
want to give you data that you can
actually take action on and help fix
bugs as quickly as possible and then
hopefully you'll use our test lab to
actually write this and not have those
bugs in the future so it's a very easy
setup you integrate our SDK you do a
one-line initialization and that's it
you're done you're you once you release
your app you're going to start seeing
crashes right away and that's great
because people want data as quickly as
possible they don't want really want to
do complicated setups for simple
something simple as simple as crash
reporting this works across both Android
and iOS so we're kind of trying to
engage all app developers here we've
used google's proprietary algorithms and
expertise in trying to figure out which
two crashes are similar and we actually
use that same technique to cluster
crashes and crashed it and make it
available to app developers so we even
though the stack traces might be
slightly different but they are the same
root cause you find them in the same
cluster suit you don't have to waste
time going through like 5 stack traces
and realize that oh wait they were
basically the same issue which we try to
do that for you as much as possible
we've been using these this
infrastructure internally for quite a
few years and I'm really happy that we
were able to bring it out to the wider
developer community as well we've we've
been measured pretty heavily in user
experience we try to keep the UI as
clean and as simple as possible again
developer experience really matters
nobody really gets out of bed wanting to
look at their crashes but at least when
they're looking at it they should not
you know it should they should have a
good experience and it should be easy to
use etc we we try to also highlight the
the big picture of what the what's
causing the crashes and where exactly
these crashes are happening so we'll try
and isolate by phone versions will try
and isolate by operating system versions
environment issues just so that you can
you can quickly get to the root causes
as much as possible not only that we've
actually and this is where one of our
innovation Scylla comes into for is we
actually work really closely with usage
analytics so that you can actually get
some repro steps leading up to a crash
because how many of you have debug the
crash report before but you didn't know
how it actually got there few few hands
okay it's it's really painful I mean
really sometimes you don't know what the
user actually did so what we've done is
every time you actually see a crash we
also take the entire buffer of what the
user had done in terms of the analytics
because people who use Google Analytics
also use the firebase SDK as well so we
can actually lock those same events with
the crash so you actually know what
actions the user had taken leading up to
a crash so we know the open door certain
activity they swipe somewhere they they
clicked on some elements and we can plus
store that data along with your crash
reports so you can reproduce and deep of
these things better again as I mentioned
we try and really bring out as many
environment variables as we can so that
you know if there's if there are any
particular correlations you need to take
take particular things into account does
this crash happen only when i'm charging
versus when I'm not charging because it
happened on Wi-Fi or does it happen in
mobile networks like giving you that
data really helps you fix these crashes
really quickly and by default we can we
have a pretty powerful crash locking
mechanism but we also have custom
logging so you as an app developer can
log additional things along with your
crashes so that you have more
breadcrumbs and data to play with while
you're debugging crashes just another
screenshot of our logs I'm just not
going to talk more about that this is
one thing that I'm that I would really
want to emphasize on so what you see
behind me is actually a graph of usage
analytics like how much money your app
has made over the past few weeks etc but
what we've done is we've actually
married the crash data to your
data so people here who've been testing
and you filed a bug because you saw
crash and how hard was it to convince
your PM that this was actually a bad bug
that they should fix like because is it
should be should be a p2 should be a p3
should be a p1 like what should it be
and many people have this experience
where they don't just don't know the
impact of a crash like is it something
that it's a crash but nobody really
cares about it or it's a crash that's
going to cause a rapid decline in your
app usage and your retention and those
kind of things so by by trying to
highlight that data by trying to get the
data out there to app developers we we
think we can help them prioritize bugs
better so that they know which crisis
they should be focusing on because they
know which crashes are now causing big
drop in engagement big drop and
retention it's a app installs etc and we
have all that data that we can neatly
tie a story around it so they can focus
on solving the most bad crashes first
and then sort of go down the stack
here's an example that people actually
use something like that where where the
value of closing the loop is really
important it's you're an app developer
you're like you're the the people who
spend money in your app are your life
stream basically they if you if you lose
them you're going to lose revenue and
you're going to go out of business
really quickly and for folks like that
they they now have the ability where you
see a crash you know which users saw
crash you can actually fix the crash and
then sort of send them a notification
and a credit based on the fact that you
were able to fix the crash and because
it's all sort of built around usage
analytics framework you're all working
with the same it's the same data sets
you don't have to go and sort of do
custom analysis it just baked in there
for you and you can actually work with
those audiences and those filters that
are automatically created for you so the
by making it really easy to close the
loop you can actually you can actually
have a big impact there so want to spend
a few minutes talking about a bit more
forward-looking things we're sore
we see the trends heading forward and
how collectively as a community we can
work on this so number one I want to
talk a little bit about machine learning
we we are right now living in a golden
age of machine learning it's it's
progressing so quickly and so rapidly
that it's things that seemed impossible
a few months ago are just very easy
today like a year ago nobody thought
that computers could beat a human at a
game of Go which is like an ancient
Chinese game but yet we were able to do
that a few months ago and the the power
of like image classification and image
learning and things like that has
significantly progress in the last year
and as more and more of these things are
open source and available on cloud and
other things these are just going to
progress at an even more exponential
clip so my challenge to you as a
community is how can we actually harness
the power of machine learning and bring
it to the testing and software quality
like how are we effectively teaching
machines to detect things that are
undesirable behavior so if how are we
teaching machines to actually spot
mistakes in your code or in your the way
you're developing software can we
effectively use these machines to build
assistance for you who are watching you
from behind your back they're your
paragraphs there you're there your code
review bodies there you're there your
testers and you can how are we actually
sort of building this building this
power into our development workflows I I
can guarantee you that the solution
that's going to win in in this
particular field is going to be the one
that actually gets the user experience
just right because there's a there's a
lot of interesting papers and algorithms
and sort of approaches out there but in
order to really make a difference here
that these your experience is going to
be critical as well so how well you
actually blend all that power into your
workflows and how you sort of seamlessly
advance at forward is going to be
actually critical to solve these things
I also think that we don't really
exploit and invest more of our compilers
and tool chains we have really great
ways of you know optimizing gaps and
building and deploying things but as a
software testing industry or as a
software engineering practitioners we
don't really harness their power as much
as we could I think there's a ton of
innovation that we could be doing in
terms of static analysis dynamic
analysis code generation code
optimization and more and we like I
would really like to see the community
rise up to these kind of challenges
going forward so you probably if you
weren't sleeping through the
presentation you probably remember this
graph before that I talked about at the
beginning of the slide the reason why I
bring this up again is look at the
difference in slope mobile caught
everybody by surprise including us at
Google even though we only one of the
most widely used operating systems in
the world it caught us all by surprise
and the the growth has just been
staggering an exponential it it's it's
now that we're sort of trying to wrap
her head around the explosion of mobile
and trying to as a testing industry
we're trying to sort of come close to
fixing some of these problems they're
not quite done yet it's gonna take a few
more years to get there but it the last
few years have been fairly painful for
those of you have worked on mobile so I
don't have a crystal ball right like I
don't know what the next big thing is
going to be I don't know if it's going
to be augmented reality or virtual
reality or is it going to be assistance
or is it going to be just a I in general
or is it remain self-driving cars or is
going to be variables or internet of
things or things i don't even know about
right but i can guarantee you that the
next slope is going to be even more
sharper than this in terms of the the
way it will get adopted just because a
larger share of humanity is now primed
for adopting new platforms so when let's
not repeat the mistakes or the things
that waited on
for whatever comes next and that's what
I have thank you excellent Thank You
nirajan and thank you for leaving plenty
of time for questions because we've got
a lot of them which I have here yes test
lab run tests on real device or
simulator both you can choose either it
it costs about five dollars to rent a
device for an hour to run your test it
costs about a dollar to rent a virtual
device or an emulator for your test so
we support both good to hear are you
also working on something which helps
test and end client server test apps are
there any frameworks to do so that's a
great question we did think about it
quite a bit in terms of our roadmap and
other things and unfortunately that's
one of those things where these are so
heavily dependent on the topology and
the software architecture that a
particular app is going to use so it's
really hard to generalize the solution
for for folks but we are looking into it
and any questions in the room so if we
have raised hands get to you right after
i read this question what about tools
for iOS apps what most app developers
have to sport Android and iOS we have
heard this feedback loud and clear and
all I'll say is stay tuned yeah so we
actually use it play publisher API to
upload our APK since store and we notice
that with that we don't get the
pre-launch check is there a reason that
yeah we're working on it now so we
because of reasons that have to do deal
with liars we require you to check a box
right now but we are working on it yes
reasons because of lawyers explains many
many things
and at any time raise your hand if you
have question in the room what initial
setup do you recommend for a small
startup that needs to start introducing
automation into a project well that's a
fairly broad question if it's just list
them all yeah every time you need so I
mean the I would really and those of you
here that we will have heard me rant
about this sorry you have to bear you
have to hear this rent again number one
if you can unit test unit tested like
that's the in terms of the return on
investment in terms of the amount of
value you are going to get in return for
the time you spent it it's it beats
anything else hands down even today like
the state of unit testing when mobile is
nowhere as good as I would like it to be
doesn't matter if it's inside we were
outside google so if you were an app
developer and if you had to spend time I
would say if if all you did was just
unit tested really well and if you wrote
really well tested code with let good
unit test and you used some form of a
the robot or a monkey run or to sort of
get some device coverage you are
probably going to get a decent amount of
coverage for a very cheap amount of
investment so that that would be my
recommendation very good does the lab
also test for geo specific scenarios for
eg is there a way to run only on devices
and networks in India or Mexico another
piece of feedback that we've heard loud
and clear so let's say stay tuned that
seems to be a theme that a speaker
yesterday mentioned his team discovered
differences between emulator and real
device test does firebase test lab run
on emulators I think we already answered
that how does pre-launch testing work is
it automatic monkey testing or does it
include some manual testing results how
did you detect localization problem so
it's it's on automatic there's no manual
element involved here we call your app
and we'll analyze the data
in terms of localization problems we
it's right now we just give you all the
screenshots on it's the onus is on you
the apt available to actually find those
issues per se but we are working on
automating that away as much as possible
as well we have some great screen
dipping infrastructure within Google
that we are trying to bring it out as a
part of the test lamp ism ok can you
exclude certain pass like the robot
takes like making real purchases not yet
but we're working on it so the wave we
are letting app developers do that is by
actually providing us accounts that
don't lead to any disastrous effect in
your system so it could be a test
account it actually doesn't like even if
you purchase the purchase doesn't go
through but we are working on letting
you isolate parts of the crawl tree
better so think of it like a robots.txt
file for your app robots in other words
stay tuned is it if you just answer
those questions that we had not this one
can you talk about efforts to bring test
labs to classrooms so you can use test
lab for free today if you can get
something like five hours of testing
every day for free and it's open to all
of you if you are in classrooms if you
are a student you can just go to fire
based or google com and you can actually
start using it for free today so and
it's it's built in as a part of Android
studio which is also free all the
material is published on the Android
developer website on on Google's of the
website and we are we are working on
bringing some of the content over into
Coursera and other thing and Udacity
another things that I talked about
earlier so the tools already available
for you for free for you to use today
but we'll be trying we'll be trying to
bring some of the educational content
and packaging it in a more classroom
friendly bezel but no that's a great
feedback thank you any other questions
in the room oh come on
here in the meantime maybe you can
answer firebase or sauce labs which
which is better no comments and you say
that you will dump the buffer when we
stop emitting the crash data right yeah
so how you deal with the privacy did oh
sure you consider about that yeah no
that's a great question so we do a few
things so number one we don't have
access to the data it's you the app
developer it's your data so in a certain
sense it's also your responsibility to
make sure that you are not accidentally
logging things that include personally
identifiable information having said
that we try and take as much care as
possible to actually scrub out things
that we think might be offending so we
have things that we have a system that
look for patterns around credit-card
number social-security numbers driver's
license numbers email addresses phone
numbers etc and we'll try and like scrub
them out of the logs as much as possible
so as a result but we can't really
guarantee hundred percent coverage there
so which is why we also like the app
developers themselves need to be
involved in this process okay can
firebase figure out the memory leak on
the background of the UI test in Android
studio we currently have to find out the
leak by process ID so right now you can
get a bunch of performance data when you
run our tests on the firebase test lab
or even when you run them through the
Play stores be launched report we don't
quite yet identify memory leaks per se
but as standard refrain like we will
look into it into our roadmap it's
definitely one of those areas where we
want to continue innovating going
forward
will you ever allow plugins I don't know
what that means sorry you can send me an
email with more details I can answer
that offline for you I don't sorry I
don't know what plugins that you're
referring to hear my name is the droid
Chan so I had a question for firebase
you have tools for like localization and
geo with consideration for language and
then also or like bandwidth changing or
you know issues with variances and
bandwidth networking considerations so
are you is a question around libraries
that you use during developing while
developing apps where's your question
more for a fact like the tools you guys
have for firebase for alergias and
localization for going to do different
you know regions and languages we so but
I asking it as a person who's authoring
test as a person who's building apps or
wool both for testing and then for
development we have an app that's you
know looking for North America and
English and we're adding Spanish and
room to other gos you know what kind of
tools there's like desire base have some
tools currently no okay we we don't so
we do we do things like its most of the
firebase infrastructure is fairly local
agnostic you generally don't be the
depth the tools themselves are localized
in all the languages and available in
multiple different languages and locales
but we don't do anything specifically to
actually support that in most cases
those are actually handled by your
operating system libraries anyway on
Android you have your layouts that
really mostly handle that and on iOS you
have your resource files into that
anyway so we generally don't have a
common solution there yet
the ever-present plea to improve the
android emulator so i want to give a
huge round of kudos to the Android team
if you if you look at the emulator or
the past year it has actually improved
significantly and the Android team is
investing a ton of resources in doing
that so yes it's definitely happening
it's already improved quite a lot and
it's going to improve a lot more if you
have specific feedback about the
emulator please come talk to me after
this i'm happy to channel it to the
Android team but I know they're working
on it feverishly like this is one of the
top priorities can we get the pre-launch
report for every version submitted to
the Play Store so we can't go back in
history and give you that for all the
older version just because we have to
seek your consent before doing that you
know liars get in the way but you can
get it for all future versions so how
about stress testing let me guess stay
tuned wait so it's actually you can do
that today you it's you it's on you to
write those tests to actually do stress
testing I mean we you can you can write
tests and that run for an hour and
stress out a bunch of things in your app
and get all the data back you can do it
today but we don't brought anything
specific you have to do you have to
write those tests available today very
good the difference is from crashlytics
so first of all I'm a big fan of
rational textear an amazing team they
they really they've really innovated
very heavily in the in the sphere of
developer experience and I must give
them all the props and credits the the
fundamental difference I think that I
see is like we are very well integrated
into the firebase suite of things so if
you are an app that actually is using
firebase for other things such as using
back end as a service or using our
notification services or are
app distribution mechanisms or analytics
then you probably want to use firebase
analytics crusher Dex is pretty powerful
too I I do think that our clustering is
probably slightly better but they they
have amazing tools or experience their
set of experience is also really good so
it's yeah i mean you if you're using
firebase and using firebase crash makes
more sense but we have a lot of people
who also continue to use crushed attic
side by side and that's that's fine
minus I guess skipping one staying with
crash reporting about crittercism a same
thing I think the crashlytics right now
has a far higher market share than
criticism but I mean yeah you it's it's
a crash reporting service you should use
one that makes most sense for you from
your developer workflow how much do you
care about being able to tie crash data
to analytics data and to other things
and if you're if you want that then use
firebase if you want the other features
use criticism really like it's there
mostly at feature parity in terms of
just the bare bones crash features like
you get a crash you get the crash get
sent up it gets clustered analyzed for
you so the basic features are the same
and I didn't mean to skip the one that
was before that one so if there's a way
to get it back or if somebody wants to
ask it in the room that was it here okay
can we find out the list of tests being
run in pre-launch tests are all selected
for all types of atoms so we don't
actually run like there's no list of
tests that we run right like there's a
we crawl your app and we'll try to
uncover things along the way our our
crawler doesn't really know anything
about your app so we don't really have
like a peek and set of tests that you
want to run on your app and then we try
to report data around crashes security
issues layout issues etc so you can
definitely see it's all absolute the
same treatment really so what platforms
are supported and how it's avoid false
positive
so I'm assuming this refers to the test
lab crawlers this particular question so
it supports Android versions going back
a few releases up until kitkat I believe
maybe even a couple releases below that
we support different form factors we
support different OS variants hardware
manufacturers etcetera in terms of
avoiding false positives really if if we
see a crash we report that crash so it's
there's like de jujuy in case of crashes
especially there is no false positives
generally like we know it you kind of
crash because we see the crash I who's
gone from blah blah car I had a question
about the crawler again damn crawler how
well does it perform on different kinds
of apps such as games that have no real
menus and social game mark oh sorry the
games has been a very challenging so I
Raymond to interrupt 11 games has been a
very challenging thing for us mostly
because the crawler has no way of
knowing the gameplay mechanics so we are
we are trying to figure out how we can
work with game developers here so a lot
of game developers actually have demo
molds or sort of like pre-canned modes
that you can pull through games that
they use for testing the graphics or the
physics engines or things like that so
if we so we need to make sure that our
crawlers can be fine-tuned towards that
a bit more but it's it's a pretty hard
problem its work in progress like we
don't have anything to announce a
immediately on that but that's a great
question we it's this this it's pretty
hard to come up with an answer for that
one thanks and the second part was can
it be made more a bit more intelligent
by just seating it or allowing app
developers to seed it with some actions
that are coming from real users or from
themselves yeah so we are working on
that yes thanks
performance and security so I think
answered the performance question
earlier it's up to you you can always
write a test that stresses the action
multiple times on your app and get
performance data for your app in terms
of security we we can give you you get
of the security report through the robot
run right now and the pre-launch report
but if you can always do more security
test if you really want within your app
it's you have the power of writing
espresso or robot IAM or UI Automator
tests and doing that yourself as well
software development being more
accessible free education tools blocks
what is your perspective on the impact
on quality software so testing for
accessibility I suppose yeah I think in
general I think be we've the quality
hasn't really kept pace with the growth
and that's that's pretty evident and I
think you saw the stats earlier in my
slides today where we actually did an
analysis of the one star review apps
work on star reviews and it was really
eye-opening related data analysis where
the long tail actually has like pretty
high amount of crashes and generally
quality and stability issues so yes it's
a problem and hopefully we presented a
couple of our efforts that are helping
solve this but we are no way close to
done like I think it's a long road ahead
for all of us about xamarin do we work
with that so it's you can you can
definitely deploy the apps that have
been built using xamarin on the test lab
also I think xamarin now has their own
test lab I believe if i'm not mistaken
they were acquired by microsoft and they
have their own test lab or maybe i'm
missing things but they also have
something within
developer environment as well but you
can like if you have an Android app that
was built easy example and you can
actually run it on for a business entity
hi Kayden from busy busy and mobile apps
that usually deal with persistent
storage have to test data migrations on
on updates and I was wondering if the
pre-launch report tests from the
previous version to the latest version
being installed on top of that or if
it's just fresh install that's that's a
great question it unfortunately because
of security reasons we have to do a
fresh install so what we do is after
every test run we actually wipe the
device clean very install the OS image
bring the device back to a previously
known good state and then you it's a
fresh install it's the security
challenges make it really hard to deal
with that a bit more but we are hoping
cases like those you can actually do it
through your own custom tests where you
could actually install one version and
then another version by writing custom
tests
everything firebase will ever allow us
to run unit tests on real devices
similar to how you can run JavaScript
and tests in browsers so I just do a
little it big here in technically unit
tests you should not really be carrying
too much about devices unit tests are
just testing a small piece of code in
isolation on Android if I'm a big fan of
robolectric you should just use
robolectric as much as possible it's
amazing it's the best thing ever so
having said that you can run any tests
on our test device like we support J
unit we support espresso hundred things
so yeah you could have a jail at unit is
running on real devices today about all
made it accessibility testing it's
definitely in a roadmap these we in the
pre-launch report we want to sort of try
and highlight some of the things as well
so stay tuned I guess you have any data
correlating the quality of developers
very experienced to the quality of
applications built unfortunately Lord we
have the correlation on the other side
where by by engaging with developers as
much as possible in their workflows and
by really improving the experience we
see a positive impact on quality but we
don't have data that goes the other way
at the moment do you need to provide
credentials to access the app to test no
you don't need to but if you can then
your app we can do more with your app
about penetration testing we don't do a
whole lot of penetration testing we do a
whole bunch of basic security crawls
looking for things like you're using
HTTP stack that we know has bugs in it
or you're doing data marshalling in an
unsafe way that we can detect by looking
at your apps signatures etc but beyond
that we don't a lot of the other penned
penetration testing actually requires
manual intervention and input and we are
hoping that over time we can
use machine learning and things to help
with that like last question or you
could have put a timer I keep coming in
here you're stimulating even more quiet
but yeah we'll take will take say two
more when espresso will be more flexible
to write tests to switch and get full
access of the device and it's
pre-installed apps that's a great
question I I know the espresso team is
working on it and it's on the road map I
just don't know where they are with
respect to the release time lines but
it's something definitely that day
espresso team is working on pretty
heavily all right and finally if my app
requires interaction with other nearby
devices with the same app installed can
I use this framework to test my watch
app unfortunately or not ample
unfortunately not yet just because when
you have about a few hundred devices
shoved into a same rack we have extreme
amount of challenges with Wi-Fi
interference with other sort of
isolating radio signals etc so adding
bluetooth to that mix for example would
make things super hard for us so at this
point unfortunately we we don't have a
good hardware solution for you to do
that yet okay excellent yes I think I
was there was there one more in the car
right one more in room question are you
leveraging a webdriver for your UI
interaction or a proprietary approach so
we use espresso basically for all our UI
interaction for native apps we don't
really use web driver and distress is
open source and it uses the basically
the open API with an android for
accessibility API on Android for travel
tours in the UI so we use open source
technology Thank You nirajan for taking
the onslaught of questions thank you
