continue essentially and talk by
excellent talk by Mohan and exploring
quantum effects in photosynthetic
complexes in particular I'm going to in
this talk this discuss hard an interplay
between quantum coherence and
environmental fluctuations can lead to
optimal and robust energy trans where
within light harvesting complexes this
work is done in collaboration with i
reza shah bonnie Seth Lloyd and Hirsch
rabbits so one of the major challenges
that we are facing today in designing
efficient solar cells and also sensors
is to to be able to manipulate and
control excitation energy transport in
disordered materials and this is
especially a major obstacle to design
materials with lowering diffusion
lengths
typically the diffusion lengths in
disordered materials are about 10
nanometer and so this has led to serious
complications in designing photovoltaic
cells to create this kind of a mix blend
of donor and acceptors and to have a
like an average distance of about 10
nanometer so that the exciton which is
the electron hole created after light is
being absorbed by a molecule and to to
transfer to like electron acceptor and
charge separation happens so this is a a
major problem because collecting this
electron through this percolating
networks are very inefficient so if we
had methods to enhance exciting
diffusion length
we could actually go back to simpler
design structure for photovoltaic cells
like a bilayer structure and consider an
electron donor with enough volume to to
absorb light and being able to transfer
all this excitation to an electron
acceptor and so we are not dealing with
this complication of electron collection
but this has been done in nature for a
long time you know so you can consider
this photosynthesis which is the source
of my energy in earth as a major R&amp;amp;D
nanotechnology R&amp;amp;D operations for 4
billion years and so it's assumed
usually that the output of this
operation should be pretty efficient but
the question is that is that really the
case and in order to explore this
hypothesis we should probably test one
prototype so in this talk I'm going to
concentrate on final materials on
protein complex in green sulfur bacteria
which Mohan talked in detail about it
so I'm going to skip lots of more
introductory concepts on going to have
more technical details of how the energy
transport happens what are the
environmental interactions and
addressing the question is this protein
complex ezal optimal and robust with
respect to variation in these parameters
both internal and external parameters
and also one more important question is
that how likely to to to to end up in
this particular geometry is there
anything particular about the disc
herbivory complexes that make them so
efficient or they are just trivial you
know random structure that are operating
because of certain chemical separation
going
to discuss this in detail so green super
bacteria lives at the bottom of pounds
and ocean in the conditions that are
virtually no lights they can capture one
photon every also and there's so you
assume that there should be pretty
efficient and this one module also
protein is connecting internal of this
bacteria to reaction center essentially
it's like a channel dividing the energy
guiding the energy from this antenna
complex to reaction center and but you
have to note that there as Mohan talked
earlier there are many different variety
of these light harvesting complexes and
they they have different geometries for
example this is the light harvesting
complexes of purple back green purple
bacteria and you see that these systems
have seemed a certain symmetry the light
absorbed by this light harvesting
complexes too and being transferred to
allege one and then reaction center is
here that the energy is stored in a
biochemical for energy and as you
probably all know in last few years
there have been a variety of
experimental demonstration of existence
of quantum coherence in this light
harvesting complexes this has started by
a flaming group on a thermal protein and
purple bacteria conjugated polymers by
grease cause group yum Mercer using a
different technique that to the
electronic spectroscopy and more
recently also but Greg is cause at room
temperature for marine allergies and
again on FMO by Greg Engel group at room
temperature the observe oscillating
beating of cross peaks in a 2d
electronica spectroscopy the
demonstrates quantum coherence in
excitonic basis for these light
harvesting complexes so one might ask
why quantum coherence could even exist
in this kind of warm and wet environment
this was typically considered you know
most of physicists dismissed any
potential role of coherence because of
simple argument like that that this is
just too hard too wet just cannot happen
and beyond explaining that we have to
explain it or address this question of
is there any role for quantum dynamical
effects is there this is the focus of my
talk is that is there like I mean
interplay with the environment that
actually is important here not that
merely coherent effects and this is the
I'm going to discuss and tell you that
there we believe that there is actually
a very helpful collaboration between
environment and quantum coherence that
leads to optimization of these
photosynthetic complexes but other more
interesting question is that or that
like these quantum effects could be
there and help the energy transfer
efficiency of the thermal protein for
example but do they have any
evolutionary role do they you know have
a like a biological impact at the higher
level we don't know that and can we make
new predictions by including these
quantum effects that are not possible
using just simple classical dynamics for
excitation transport and also
applications for designing artificial
exact technique devices for a variety of
different purposes of absorption and
transport storage and sensing so as
Mohan mentioned one of the first ideas
that came out of the Greg angle
paper in 2007 was that there are certain
form of quantum computation
are happening in in this final materials
from protein it was speculated that
there is a connection with grower search
algorithm or quantum walk we explore
these possibilities we immediately
noticed that there is no there's not
nothing anything too close to a global
search algorithm in these systems
essentially if you avoid the free
Hamiltonian of this phenomena from
protein the energy the overlap of
excitation energy state with the
trapping side is never exceed like 40%
but if this was supposed to be as
something closer like a continuous time
evolution of of the form of a grower you
should expect that that certain time you
have a major overlap with the target
zone which is that essentially that the
state you are searching for but that's
not the case here at least not in the
context of a unitary evolution oven and
also the connection with quantum works
as Mohan mentioned and this is the work
done by Stefan and in Brigitta really
well it's group that there is not any
speed-up in the context of quantum box
so it's there is no that's not the right
measure to look at the potential
contribution of control interference
effects so it doesn't matter for this
system how fast they get like the
excitation gets to reaction or Center
it's like it's matter that's not really
leads to the efficiency of these devices
as I discuss but I think still the
quantum white picture is a good picture
because you can think about just look at
these dendrimers that these are
artificial system that you can multi
branching polymers that they have like a
similarity with this kind of binary tree
structures well study in quantum
information science and in this binary
tree structure you can write a diffusion
equation describing a classical random
walk of hopping for example yeah an
excitation can hop to out the root of
this binary tree and this transition
matrix is described by the connectivity
of this graph you can in
analogy define like a continued some
quantum work just this is you can write
this for any quantum system in which the
hilbert space have a special structure
so you can talk about continuous LAN
controller essentially what it means
that the elements of Hamiltonian in the
hilbert space that they have a special
structure denote your transition matrix
and this is like a quantum walk of
probability amplitude but these systems
are really interacting with environments
so they're confused on quantum works are
not good descriptions and essentially
it's not clear you have to have a good
measure of what how to actually quantify
if if if there is a quantum work and how
does it contribute to the dynamics in
order to do that let's just go on a step
back just look at their thermal complex
as you seen earlier in the historic that
these are like connecting this antenna
chromosome to reaction center that this
is like a primary constant consists of
three monomer and there's a protein
scaffold and in in in the there are
seven bacterial cofee that are actually
doing this energy transfer they
operating as energy transfer channel
there are two different bases that is
discussed in this community there is a
side base which denotes a special
coordinate of bacteria chlorophyll and
there is a exciton base which is the
basis that diagonalize the free
Hamiltonian of this system essentially
what it means that these states are
delocalized over an extended a special
structure over multi chromophore that is
two or more and they're using through
the electronic spectroscopy this these
pathways have been studied there are two
main pathways of excitation starting at
site 1 or 6 these are close to antenna
and so and they end up outside 3 &amp;amp; 4
which of course we are
Center and but in order to really
explore this you need to start from like
a more formal mathematical formalism and
this is a Frankel exciton Hamiltonian
this is that you can write for any multi
chromophoric system this denote that
side energies at site M and this is
creation and annihilation operator of an
excitation at that particular site at
this VM and denote the coupling between
two chromophores and this system
interacts with the Chairman photon bars
and radiation field in general to a good
accuracy you can ignore up diagonal
couplings and consider only slight
fluctuations due to interaction with the
phone numbers and radiation beam can
lead to a transition between different
excite and multiple different excitation
manifold and in order to study these
systems you have to write essentially
the unitary evolution of the entire
system taking trace of our environmental
degrees of freedom then you end up with
like so-called master equations this is
very well known form of studying this
system is to express the time variation
of the density operator which contains
our knowledge about the system as
different operations these are this
denotes the unitary evolution of system
under the influence of priam each one
and this is lamb shift which is
essentially related to reorganization
energy of this system and these are the
due to non unitary evolution due to
interaction with the phonon bath and
radiation field and this is related to
how much the coherence you have this is
essentially the coherence rate these
coefficients and these operators are
just nothing but
utter product of a projection
essentially you can consider two
exciting bases or a jump between
different excitation excitation bases
and this the coherence rate is just free
transform or best correlation function
and can be expressed linearly as
spectral density and in this relation
which n is bosonic distribution function
at temperature T it you can consider
ohmic a spectral density and which will
be the cutoff frequency and the spectral
density becomes linearly related to
reorganization energy so we studied this
system using a quantum trajectory
picture and you can arrive if you do the
math you arrive at this equation what it
means this is a non unitary damping
evolution because this Hamiltonian is
not hermitian so this is like a damping
evolution and these are the jump in a
fixed excitation manifold between
different signs and this is very
important I want to emphasize this that
this is essentially what I'm talking
about in in the bone Markov
approximation as interplay between
quantum coherence and environment
because as you might remember in the
Hamiltonian itself these jumps are not
really there the term O'Fallon bath does
not lead to any jumps between different
sites just fluctuating each side energy
so it's not contributing to the
transport itself but if you look at
these terms these these are related this
actually creates jump between different
sites and they they happen to be there
because of environmental interaction and
free Hamiltonian so if you do not have
the coherent coupling between these
thing the phonon bias interaction
doesn't lead to that job these terms
create jumps between different
excitation manifold these are separated
by more than a thousand vape number and
that time a scale of these jumps are on
the order of one nanosecond compared to
energy transfer time of one picosecond
so you can ignore this this jumps in
this description and just simulate these
first two term and this is more detail
expression for this non non hermitian
term of the coherence and you can
understand this as a quantum walk in
living space and writing this transition
matrix in this form as a function of
this non hermitian hamiltonian and and
this quantum jump so it's possible to
understand this in a context of quantum
work but it doesn't really matter that
that that's just an interpretation of
the dynamics you need to have a like a
measure to quantify the performance of
this photosynthetic complexes so what we
used was to look at the success
probability of the excitation being
trapped at a target site with different
rate kg and this is a this week you know
defined this as the energy transfer
efficiency which is generally less than
one because due to interaction with the
environment we can also have the loss of
excitation due to electron hole
recombination so what we did was to
explore this energy transfer efficiency
as real we looked at the different very
numbers for reorganization energy and so
this this just denotes the interaction
of the system with environment it's the
more the the largest reorganization
energy there you have much stronger in
the environment and you see that energy
transfer efficiency enhances by 15 or
about 30 percent from like in this
particular initialization from 70% to
99% if you enhance there we are
energy so here environment is actually
helping you in this case to have a
larger efficiency of course because this
is a perturbative method you cannot
really go and explore reorganization
energy larger than about 30 paper
because the site energies are about 300
wave number so this is like about 1/10
so perturbative approximation is a still
valid but there is no way to explore
beyond that and we want to to see if
this is really an optimal point but in
this model we couldn't do it because
it's just model would collapse and you
see that the transport trying of the
excitation to the reaction center
reduces by a 1 order of magnitude which
is related to energy transfer efficiency
definition and it doesn't contain any
more information so in order to see how
this energy transfer what are the
mechanism for environment assisted
transport it's better to look at these
two different scenario
it's either you have funnelling which
the interaction with the environment in
in this exciton basis helping you to to
relax to the ground state which is close
to the energy at site 3 but also it
helps you this is the phenomenon like a
tunneling in quantum mechanical effects
that helps you to overcome a potential
barrier but in essentially in increasing
the spectral density overlap between two
chromophores we also studied a binary
tree structure in a like pewdie phasing
model this is like having considering
just white nodes which is killing the
off diagonal elements of density
operator and you see that in presence of
disorder without the noise the energy
transfer efficiency drops significantly
but with no it has a enhanced efficiency
for this structure as well we use this
purely phasing model for FMO the reason
we did that is that in this thing you
can
explore all variety of the environmental
strengths of in this purely facing model
and so we we finally observe this
optimal energy transport in this model
although this is not a adequate model to
describe the environment in this system
but this was good enough for us to
demonstrate that as there is a just in
office there is a certain amount of
environmental interaction that could be
just the right one so if it's it's not
there at the quantum there is a
destructive contribute to appearance
effects leading to localization which is
like under so localization for large
system but at very high deaconess limit
you have this quantum Zeno effect which
is you the efficiency drop to
essentially this zero but there is an
optimal regime here and the estimated
value for FMO is just sitting in that
optimal regime but still you know this
wasn't convincing because the model is
not describing the actual non
perturbative normal Cobian path of these
photosynthetic complexes the reason is
that this is a very interesting feature
of this light harvesting complexes is
that the magnitude of the diagonal of
diagonal and system base interaction
essentially the trapping everything sits
close to 100 Dave number so the time
scale of these things are very similar
and that makes it very hard to study the
system so this is the major challenge to
simulate this system efficiently because
most of the techniques that develop to
study these complex open quantum systems
are do not work here and but there are
more fundamental question is this like
you can ask why why there should be this
kind of why these photosynthetic
complexes operate at this regime that
there is like this convergence of
Transco is this have anything to do with
optimality of this system or the
robustness of these complexes and what
is the likelihood of just being at that
regime so in order to address this
question you really have
to develop more advanced techniques to
simulate this is really top area to work
with it's like essentially sailing in
really a stormy conditioned environment
has lots of unusual characteristic it
has memory and it so it can interact
with a system and put like essentially
giving back some of the coherence is
that already up you know absorb and so
informally you can rewrite the evolution
of the system as this propagator this is
an interaction picture and this is like
a super operator due to system base
interaction and this just denotes the
time ordering so because of non
Markovian effects you have to keep track
of the time ordering and there is a
famous theorem that says that this multi
order correlation function if this is
expanding this exponential function you
have you deal with this higher order
correlation bass collation function and
you can write this as a different
combination of two order correlation
function this is true only for bosonic
basses or with Gaussian properties which
which is good because the most fun on
account of photonic environment for this
system have that feature and so if you
like schematically if you do the maths
like you end up with a master equation
this is there are many different methods
actually I should mention here that to
study this is known as hierarchy
equation approach tree study this system
in this realistic environment and this
is developed originally by Kobo China
morrow and recently completed by
ishizaki Fleming and there is also other
technique known by polar on
transformation time local master
equation by Jiang but here I'm gonna
explore a interesting feature of the
pioneering work of John choco at about
13 years ago on essentially at
approximate techniques to simulate this
system we have a different derivations
of this master equation which leads
allows you to estimate how much error
you have by
using a simpler model essentially you
end up with a pair of coupled master
equation which is the contributing terms
due to Kohana evolution recombination
and trapping and this is like a
schematically demonstrating bass
response operator and mathematically you
can express it in this form this is a
non elite revolution due to loss and
trapping and this is like a response of
the bass with the system this is like a
in context of quantum competing we we
know this as like a error operator on in
acting on the system I have that kind of
background so this is the way I look at
it so considering although we know that
this is not being a complete quantum
remedy in that sense but there is a
quantum interference effects that
happens which is leading to an optimal
regime due to interaction with
environment so it's it's not helping in
that transferring like a first passage
time as Stefan and Mohan show but it
helps to have a higher energy transfer
efficiency but here we want to study
this in this kind of mode appropriate
model to describe the this system in the
actual setting they are operating in the
biological environment so and here the
action of this environment the memory
effects it can be represented by this
this is just nothing but the just action
of these errors you can consent the
arrows acting on the density operator in
interaction picture weighted by vast
correlation function and this is a bit
more technical and I apologize for
general audience but this is a I want to
talk in detail to say what are the
complications of really simulating this
system and so that's a bad correlation
function have this imaginary real part
and dirt with different spectral density
that you can use that are related to
this reorganization energy through a
Lorentzian function or exponential decay
so in order to study this system so the
the whole point was that if we wanted to
study this optimality of the system we
had to see me
the system for over a wide range of
parameters and using a hierarchy
equation approach which is the chair of
benchmark for simulating this system you
have to solve 50000 differential
equations to for FMO complex at
reasonable temperature to simulate this
this is what is done by ishizaki Fleming
at UC Berkeley and published last year
showing Coenen oscillation of excitation
up to trim' a scale of close to 400 600
femtosecond which is relevant the time
scale of trapping is 1 picosecond so
this is the time scale of this system so
we using using only this pair of the
coupled differential equation we
actually can reproduce these results
within good accuracy and seeing these
oscillations but this is much faster
simulation and this allows us to explore
a whole variety of the parameter range
for this system this shows energy
transfer efficiency as a function of
past cutoff frequency and reorganization
energy so this axis is this the strength
of environment and here is the normal
non Markovian effect so this is the
inverse of this past cutoff frequencies
the coherence of the coherence time
scale of the environment so here this
can be measured used as a quantifier for
normal community of this system and so
the closer you are here it's more normal
Co you see that these are the estimated
value for anonymity or some protein that
are sitting at a really optimal point
which is pretty robust with variation in
either of these two parameters and you
see that for very large reorganization
energy energy transfer efficiency drops
significantly when it's non Markovian
but in the resonable
reorganization energy has close to
natural setting for
materials on protein it's these normal
Cobian effects is essentially helping a
bit but the system is robust with this
kind of normal Cobian effect you can
explore the robustness by mentioning the
second order derivative and seeing that
it has really a flat structure and this
shows this this is like a lateral point
of these plots showing this optimal
environment as a transport at this
reorganization energy of the close to 20
wave number and so we studied this
system as in various temperatures as
well and you see that this is actually
very intuitive it at the very very large
reorganization energy so very strong
environment and at very high temperature
you expect that energy transfer
efficiency drops and that's what happens
but at the values of environment for FMO
and room temperature it's sitting at the
optimal robots point again and so this
is a significant point you know that it
seems that the parameter of this
environmental in reorganization and
memory and temperature and all these
relevant parameters to be just at the
right regime for the FMO but one caveat
in using energy transfer efficiency to
quantify this system is the the fact
that this hasn't been measured
experimentally and we estimated about 1
picosecond timescale based on that
especial separation and so we considered
this as a free parameter to explore
energy transfer efficiency this is a
very interesting because you see at this
regime if the trapping is much faster
this is like 1 picosecond and so if that
trapping is very slow the excitation
just sitting there until it disappeared
dissipate to environment and that makes
sense but here you see that even if the
trapping is very fast also you expect
that the you know energy transfer
efficiency becomes more efficient but
it's not the case it becomes less
efficient so there is an optimal regime
here that doesn't make sense at the
beginning but you know I can't give you
a classical example suppose there is a
gas chamber and someone's the centers to
death like sitting in that like you know
this is and there's like the gas act and
within time a scale of a minute and
there is a revolving door that rotates
in a resonable time a scale if this time
scale is very slow like all on the order
of all for one retention it doesn't
really matter if the doors is actually
rotating it's very unlikely that the
person can escape from the gas chamber
but if that blower is rotating at the
right speed you know on the order of
like a 30 seconds or something it's very
likely that the person can escape but if
the door is rotating really fast
like you know thirty rotation in a
second there's no way that it's very
unlikely that the person can escape so
it's like this is the case you know it's
like Zeno effect it's just observing it
too much you know as the excitation
cannot move essentially localize and
just dissipates the environment but
there are other things that are not very
well understood so we consider that
they're a bit as a pre parameter is that
the location of trapping is also it's
assumed to be the reaction center close
to site three and four but that's not
really known for sure
we considered it's like to simulate the
system based on different trapping site
just rotating essentially the surfer
moving in that geometry and observe
first of all we observe this environment
as just a transport no matter where
reaction is but it's interesting that
the it happens that the side three and
four which are believed to be close
reaction center or actually provides the
most optimal energy transfer efficiency
and also there is like a whole
discussion about the role of initial
states that if there is a coherence
initial States or incoherent because the
the solar light is not coherent the
experiments don't with
here instead of light lasers and things
like that so we just consider to
consider the effect of initial States
just randomly sampling over 10,000
different initial States considering all
different coherence fully classical
mixture of statistical mixture States
and considering worst case and best case
scenario you see that at really large
reorganization energy when the
environment is very strong
there is a huge dependence on initial
States so the system is not robust but
it happens that exactly at the value of
the reorganization energy or 35 wave
number for FMO this is very small
dependence to initial stage initial
States about like a few percent in
changes in efficiency which was
surprising also the effect of
correlation in the bath so there have
been a lot of discussion is that the
best essentially this protein scaffold
is like oscillating in a fashion that
creates correlated fluctuation and that
helps there this this complexes to
operate efficiently you see here that at
the regime of large reorganization
energy this is the case and the
coalition of in the bath defined here in
this quality bass coalition function by
this exponential function this is the
distance between two site and an M and
this is a correlation length and showing
an exponential decay based on the
separation between two chromophores you
see that if you have like a higher
correlation you have a better efficiency
but at the regime that families actually
operating it doesn't really much matter
so this is also a boss to correlation
environmental fluctuations but one of
the things after studying this system in
this all parameter regime there was one
thing that bothered me in particular and
and my colleagues and that maybe this is
not a big deal maybe this is just
everything we see is that there is a
convergence of
about 1 picosecond for like the strength
of hamiltonian system harm eternal free
amateur and system bass amateur
entrapping but there is a major 3 order
of magnitude time is clear separation
between everything that we know with
that with the loss dissipation which is
1 nanosecond and so it doesn't matter
how actually you go there is just your
excitation it has so long lifetime that
moves around enough to be trapped and so
it's not a big deal in any structure so
this based on this argument you expect
that any structure pretty much gives you
a very good efficiency within that
parameter regime and so we we consider
this like explore this over 7
chromophores in random orientation
interacting through dipole-dipole
interaction with the distances being
bounded between 5 to 50 angstrom that
the approximation is valid and sampling
over 100,000 different random
configurations what we observed was that
and using these known parameters for FMO
in environment which is 35 wave number
50 web number 4 bath correlation time
scale and trapping one because you can
and lost 1 nanosecond you see that
essentially 60% of the these random
configurations are like less than 10
percent efficient and the the one that
are over 50 percent efficient are like
10 percent of them and just only one
percent efficient as like more than 95
percent and close to FMO it's like 1 in
10,000 configuration can be that
efficient so this is shows that this
geometry is kind of rare but it's not
that rare that it's so it's kind of you
know the one person is actually not that
bad as well it shows that there is
certain robustness to to this variation
so it's not like you know because if it
was one
million you expect a small changes in a
structure of a firm or significantly
catastrophic the reduced energy transfer
efficiency so that that's not good for a
like a system that operates in in in a
ward drive essentially they needed
environmental which is complete on
control so after this is study we showed
using a variety of different techniques
that have far more dynamics we could
actually simulate this in intermediate
and normal Cobian and non perturbative
regime yeah so I should mention that the
model dis approximated model that we
developed based on Jericho work is that
we quantify the errors and they also
really blow up in the regime of
really highest rank reorganization and
and a really low
bask frequency cutoff so these are
really only appropriate models for
intermediate regime but it happens that
we are lucky here and the biologically
relevant regime is the intermediate so
we showed environment assisted quantum
transport in a variety of setting and
always the parameters we realized was in
the area that was pretty robust and also
we explored that a structure the role of
geometry of planning materials and
protein and see that this is a rare
geometry no other the questions that
everybody's interested now or how we can
actually use this quantum coherence of
effects to engineer novel materials that
all perform classical operating devices
for sensing and light harvesting
artificial light harvesting complexes
for and in context of photovoltaic cells
and other potential devices that you
know I could image that we cannot even
think about today
so the the this is the I would like to
acknowledge the sponsors financial
funding from and sake and DARPA Nene and
yeah that's it thank you for your
attention
can you come to speak
have a technical question so for the non
Markovian case you use this method by
cow and you compare it for with the egk
the full hierarchical solution
you got good agreement this is across a
temperature range was it's just at
higher temperature because at low
temperature you you start having so many
equations it becomes almost impossible
to solve
so actually yeah it's it's not easy to
simulate the low temperature using
hierarchical approach because there so I
did not mention this explicitly so the
problem with hierarchy equation
approaches is that the complexity of
cars simulation with a gross factorial
it's worse than exponential with respect
to a high reorganization energy load
essentially past frequency cutoff when
it's very highly normal core and at the
regime of low temperature and also with
the size of system it just this is grows
exponentially at at best and so it's
just not possible to explore this at
very low temperature so you compare at
high temperature yeah high temperature
which was like you know that the most
relevant temperature for this system was
what like they're not really operating
at low temperature anyway thank you
thanks any other question
yes yeah
on the temperature scale I mean how
sensitive is it to temperature so human
how sensitive is so this is the plot
with respect to temperature so it
depends on the reorganization energy
that's the reason we use 3d plots
because if you fix the reorganization
you observe something for that
particular value it doesn't mean much
about the different organizational
energy so first of all I should tell you
that that really this model beyond this
kind of reorganization energy is
collapsing so you have to do like a
brute force hierarchy equation approach
so we cannot say much about really large
reorganization energy but this is the
border that you can explore this using
this efficient simulation method and it
shows that it's in so in AD if you
increase the temperature the energy
transfer efficiency drops significantly
at the for large reorganization energy
but the whole point is that for this
kind of around you know between 0 to up
to 100 reorganization energy it shows
that it's that it's system and a kind of
robust with respect to temperature and
so this is what we observed using even a
limb blood master question I like mark 1
mark of technique but so it's
interesting that for this reorganization
energy it looks like that it's robust
with respect to variation in temperature
so it's not you see there based on this
definition of energy transfer efficiency
but you know we have to be careful about
that too it depends what you really look
for you know what what is the actual
your function that you'll consider as a
measure of the efficiency but I think
this is what we used actually widely
being used by other groups that was
originally was used by klaus schulze and
in a context of energy transfer
efficiency of these complexes in using a
diffusion master equation though but so
and also being used for other system
people in
quantum information science to to
quantify the energy transfer like at
transport efficiency in binary tree
structures by edifice group so it's not
like yeah that just know our definitions
other people using it and it looks that
it just saw that the the big you know if
I wanna summarize they're talking one
line that's saying what what is
significant here is that it appears so
there was a conjecture by anger slamming
in their 2007 paper that there is a
constructive contributor appearance
happens to be important to have this an
efficiency of this system but although
they expected a that about search or
other things that you know might not be
relevant in in in a context of quantum
computing but I think that that
conjecture was right in the sense that
quantum key interference effects are
relevant but in a sense that when you
consider environmental interactions
there is a really optimal regime that
both quantum coherence and environmental
interaction help to essentially
collaborating to have these high
efficiencies and it's not correct you
look at that in the context of first
passage time as Mohan mentioned in
that's not the right picture it does not
provide an SP though but it looks that
within that definition is very robust
with temperature too</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
