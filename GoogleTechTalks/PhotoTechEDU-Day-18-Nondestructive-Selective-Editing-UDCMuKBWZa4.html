photo tech day number 18 today we're
very happy to have two speakers with us
we'll start with the Jewish Stein Miller
of digital Outback photo and follow up
with Fabio riccardi of light craft and
their topics are all integrated and
they've got a great presentation for you
wait take it away thank you yeah I will
introduce myself during the presentation
may be Fabio says the shot you want to
say something now about your person what
you're doing CTO and founder of like
crafts I will have my little
presentation after us so you hear about
me a little bit later steady enough from
the mountains we it's up to you ok the
talk is as I say a bunch of buzzwords
non-destructive selectively lon linear
and Nan modal editing of photographs so
of course you know these are just buzz
words and I hope at least I make a point
that the future of editing is a lot
around these topics solve them but for
that we have to understand what what it
means to what all these buzzwords mean
just briefly the Brogue program it is
global or local editing that's kind of
the key the just a brief overview about
the general editing workflow why is
selective editing needed it is not
obvious for many many people they think
they can get along with just pushing
about a couple of sliders and they think
they get their memory back what why they
shot an image then I talked a little bit
how to realize these selective editing
then I talked briefly about what is
non-destructive editing means it's then
at that point may be quite easy to
understand and i just touched non-modal
and nonlinear it is kind of a
the extension on it so just introduce my
person I'm the editor and owner of
digital object photo and recently also
out back print these are websites which
are dedicated to fine art photography
one is more on the photographic camera
sight tool side the other side is more
on the printer side the reason I split
it was because I want to talk also about
very easy tarik things on the printing
pay site and this is not for everyone we
get about 6 million visitors per year
the main business is selling electronic
books which are right about digital
workflow from raw to print there are
also a couple of printed books now out
which I authored but the main thing is
my electronic book I books i think i can
claim that i probably wrote the first
dedicated raw book in the world ever i
think so and at least i didn't find one
before was a PDF in 2002 or not 2003 i
think i wrote no 2000 tools for sure ok
so to understand selective we need to
understand global global means it is the
whole area of the image is treated equal
classic tools for global operations are
levels and curves which treat every
pixel the same if it has a certain pixel
value it will be treated the same
wherever it is that may sound ok to you
we will explain why it is not quite as
obvious as it looks a selective is just
the opposite which means you decide by
certain means which areas of the image
are corrected and this is done in most
cases by some sort of masking how this
mask are created I will scratch that a
little bit so
let's start with a with their
demonstration because that's probably
how to escape yes okay because that
shows most easily why there may be a
need for selective editing this is a
shot we did in Utah it is kind of the
pale grass and you have the red rocks in
the background so I don't want to go to
light zone in all the steps I just want
to show what i did in principle on that
image and where I think selective
editing made a huge difference on it so
what you do always in editing is you use
some global Corrections like this one
here let me zoom a little bit down
and this is the first time i use a mask
on that image because what what happens
is the grass needs to stay soft because
it has a soft pale structure on the
other end the red rocks are on the
distance they are in the haze so they
need different treatment than the grass
there's no way to treat the grass with
the same means as a red rocks and just
give you an idea that you just see I
think even on this screen you can see
that it's a huge difference so what is
actually done here it is not just a mask
which has a sharp edge it is a mask with
their fizzes it with a gradient where it
has a feather area where it gets from
non-effective to effective so gradually
get there and this may be a little bit
small feathering area but just giving
the idea the same is then used for
treating the saturation all of the rocks
a little bit that's subtle you may
hardly see it but it gives you the idea
that you may want to boost up the
saturation of red rocks because in our
memories red rocks are red yeah but but
the pale grass if I boost up the
saturation on the pale grass I I may get
the color which I don't want so I want
to treat it differently you know the
rest is then some additional operations
this is just to give you an idea where
there is no way to treat about you know
there's always a way but it would come
down to some sort of selective editing
to treat the grass and the red rocks in
a different way and honestly if you it's
kind of an unfair comparison now but if
you go back to what where we started to
this it gives you the idea how you can
put emphasis on some area of the image
using selective technique in a very
simple way this is trivial
and you know just get back to this one
area here I if I want to have the
feather area bigger actually you know
you know I lose something so i have to
widen it it is done in minutes to change
the feather area so that's the soft
transition so that your eyes don't see
that there is actually a mask effective
feel free to ask question so this was
kind of the introduction to I first had
a slide on it that you know doesn't it's
probably better shown in a sample why
you want selective editing and I had
last year and our summit in page at
least three times the experience that
someone said I wanted simple and I could
not agree more with that person that
simple meant for him I don't want
selective editing and it took me about
five minutes in all cases to make a
point that they wanted selective editing
because they couldn't reach what they
actually wanted out of the image no
sorry so this is just summarizing what
the normal editing process all involves
there are many many steps and this is
not by no means complete the first is
normally the raw processing level then
you work on a global level the tonality
on a global level the colors on a global
level you deal with noise removal
sharpening you need deal with lands and
perspective Corrections you remove dust
and blemishes you use more advanced
controls which are adaptive like shadow
highlight all the light zone tone mapper
but then the kind of most of the cases
the last step you go into selectively
you say what did I am am I missing on
that image what is not what is wrong
about this image if I think of
presenting it what where is the story in
that image and that's very often related
that I you want to tell something with
that image and if you don't work on some
areas of that image and improve them you
don't tell the story and the last one is
selective color Corrections okay one
reason and that's a very important very
very selective yes if you did the the in
famous coke bottle in the landscape
which can give you a discussion on the
internet for years whether it's legal
it's a photograph you know Steven
Johnson I think he was last week here he
would say then you are a manipulator I
wouldn't care to remove a coke bottle in
a blink from something so yeah
everything which is not just global
treating everything as is but but this
gets now more into compositing of images
and that's not what I mean I mean more
than I get to that soon in the sense of
dodge and burn of selective enhancing
images and in in some way of course the
coke bottle in the landscape is
enhancing the image if it distracts you
so the first most important thing is
that your eyes work selectively you are
not like a camera looking at the scene
and say okay capture it thats dark thats
dark i treat everything the same the
camera is just saying how many photons
reach me at that pixel your eyes look at
things and go into it they zoom into it
they they look different and we come to
that in a minute but then there are
things like flaws the haze i mentioned
in that image the corners could be soft
focused so you want the corners a little
bit more sharpen than the center is
already something selected
you have uneven light unfortunate nearly
always uneven you have different colored
bands balances in an image I show later
the sample where I use it artistically
to to do different white balancing on
different areas of the image it nearly
every scene you ever see in nature has
different white points there's the Sun
there's a sky you have most of the time
always two light sources and they have
completely different white balance and
one thing is the blue shadows your eyes
don't see that much blue shadows but the
camera sees like hell so you want to get
close what the eye sees the IC is a
little bit bluish shirt than the rest
but the camera sees it really blue yeah
and I see many prints which where they
have plain blue and the shadows I don't
think I remember it that way or you want
to show one example of that you want to
draw attention to an image element the
key thing it's and that's where I
actually met lights on at some point is
it is the old classic concept of dodge
and burn dodge and burn is you brighten
or darken areas and in an image this is
done I don't know way over 100 years
yeah it's a classic technique every
classic black-and-white photography uses
dodge and burn you can say selective
editing is dodge and burn now in the
digital domain you can do more things
but you know the doctrine burn also
included that they change the colors of
the projector of the printer for certain
areas to get more contrast whatever so
this is an old technique and this is
actually where where say your eye looks
selective the two rolls of dots are
exactly the same on right and left
but if you have a bright dot in a dark
background it look so much brighter then
on a white background and the opposite
is true for the dark dots this is how
your eyes look so if it's not fool it's
hard to believe that this dot has
exactly the same brightness at this one
and this looks so much brighter than
this but it's exactly the same and this
we have to account for so that's why you
have to work in the shadows different
than in the highlights and if you do it
just globally the curve would change
both dots this one and this one in
exactly the same manner but for the eyes
it would do harm because it would over
stress this one makes it too harsh and
this one too soft this is I I never sure
whether really this slide is appreciated
but you know in editing we talk about
shadows the funny thing is that we don't
talk about shadows we talk about dark
pixels and that's why I like this photo
because the interesting thing is this is
shadow and these are dark pixels
actually interesting the dark pixels are
darker than the shadows in terms of
pixel values so if you want to open the
shadows you definitely not want to
brighten these black numbers because
they are black by nature and they are in
bright Sun they are not in any shadow
they just have a low value of brightness
and here we have a real shadow and and
if you look into this image you will
look at it I don't know what I did with
it but you would see also the blueness
in the shadows I probably removed it to
a certain degree so that's important to
know our eyes really treat shadows
differently than highlight they actually
adjust to it they ignore the blue cars
and say it's not really that blue
yeah so you're you you don't see it yeah
ok the next sample I I wanted to do in a
light zone is just to show you how a
small image element
I hide the mask it didn't in this image
i'm not really sure I because this is
not my image I got it at the last time
it was a real world in real-time
decision editing you let's go a little
bit bigger if the problem with the image
and it's maybe a little bit hard to see
on the screen is that this little Bush
stuff it is kind of diffused it's kind
of gets doesn't lack it lacks some sort
of focus so what I did is actually
docking it a little bit and the
interesting thing is when you would see
it printed we would never believe it was
not that that way before yeah so it I
it's a little bit difficult on the
screen if you would see it on this
screen and on the print it's a world of
difference in a subtle way you know it's
not that's what selective editing is
about you know you see and then I
actually did the opposite I took a
smaller circle you see these are now the
masks really to use operations again
with a soft feathering area so what you
do is sometimes dark in the center can
help sometimes that the corner can help
it's a classic way to draw the attention
to the center of an image so you can
play with elements in the image where
you want attention which has nothing to
do with an image floor or something like
that it is something what you want to
tell the story and it tells sometimes
very different stories if for example if
you realize you look at the image you
wander with your eyes everywhere think
of giving it a focus by darkening
getting more a different color more
saturation or whatever to in selective
area of the image
so what was it so how do we create a
selective area we can create it by
geometric shapes that we can select by
tonal range we could select by color
range we could paint masks what is this
you or we can you have some agris make
way is it this one yep okay okay so but
now now the question how do we organize
that if we do selective editing we we
cannot just have a bunch of sliders
sitting around we have to organize it in
a way that we say okay this works on
that area this works on another area so
the classic model and I think it has
proven to be very valid is kind of the
layer model or you could also say it's
an operation stack layer and each of
these layers has associated mask with it
blending modes the it's just a side note
the Photoshop layer mode model is mainly
a pixel-based layer which has the
advantage has a very fine granularity
but it has a big disadvantage it is
opaque in a way that if you want to
change one of these layers all on top
are ruined and you cannot change just
one layer and hope the rest is done
there are exceptions which is called
adjustment layers but so they are
destructive the light zone layer model
is more operation layer model which says
you have an operation which has what
they call regions but it's essentially a
mask attached and they are all
functional all the time there's no such
things like freezing it into pixels it's
all from Barton bottom to top what I
showed is always done in real time from
bottom to top through the layers model
they have geometric mask with feser
ranges which I showed and all operations
are non-destructive I spend one more
slide later or non-destructive
non-destructive means the underlying
image is not changed there is not
nothing like in between pixels there's
nothing burned into the original image
it's just a bunch of operations which
are on top of it if this is Morris I
know but I couldn't resist to say that
when you work in many editing programs
in today's raw converters especially you
have many many sliders let's assume you
want to come back and we'll find out
what you did you actually have to
reverse engineer what you change and
what was the default because it's just a
bunch of sliders in a layer model you
document what you do if there is no
layer you didn't do it that's very easy
and in the end its equivalent because
the layer model you do something and
it's non-destructive if you have
non-destructive layers so I think these
documenting what you do is a very
important aspect because you want to
understand what all right we already did
to the image and what you might may want
to change
this is now the last sample image which
shows a little bit larger
so here's for example a good example
this little corner here would complete
is completely distracting the image it's
a very little thing yeah but it is it is
a major issue for this image you see I
just changed let me switch off the masks
but you see just get the idea that this
is destructive in terms of to our eyes
because your attention would always go
to this white little thing which is kind
of irrelevant for the image you just
toned it down a little bit burned it and
you got the solution the other things is
what i did and i know i show mask is i
did white balance for the shadow areas
differently than for the highlight areas
so I gone through that for example look
at this bright in the middle the bright
in the middle was again one of these
things which were overly bright it took
too much attention yeah and of course we
are here at a point where it's a matter
of taste it is nothing absolute it's an
artistic decision what you want to do
with it but you want to decide how much
the the center is distracting from the
image and then we did white balance on
the inner side of it and some final
sharpening its unfortunately we don't
have much more time oh that's
interesting itunes decline yeah okay
it's fabulous computer so i understand
do it so now yeah
yes that's more the implementation it's
also probably because they do some
tricky cash guys we have 15 megabytes
and then you end up in a few hundred
megabytes of PSD file in light zone we
only save the virtual layer so the
operations that are in in that layer so
it's a piece of XML of a few bites so it
doesn't take any space on the hard drive
of course in memory you will have to
know we have to catch the layers and you
know do things that make the thing
appear fast so we use very effectively
the memoir inside your machine so use
all of it but you know at a it did the
layer the question asked was auntie
layers in Photoshop quite memory heavy
or actually they are memory and disk
heavy because it's a pixel and there's
no way to go around up you you cannot
describe all the pixels in the image by
an algorithm that's hot probably you can
yeah so it is true that it is very
expensive so when I work in Photoshop on
one of these images I start at three
hundred megabyte that's kind of when I
wake up with layers and you easily get
with stitched images 2 gigabyte and wait
so it is a but it said you know it it's
one way to deal with this problem I just
want to show what what it means a nan
modal nan modal means you can jump from
one operational one layer to the other
without a dialogue open the dialogue do
something close it wait you wait here
too because it has to do things you know
it does a new sharpening
on something yeah but you can
immediately go there you can immediately
switch layers you get different results
in some cases not in all cases so
non-motor means it is helps you in the
flow of editing images it is not in your
way you know the software principle
modal dialogues are the death of
interactivity just period and they make
all sense and preferences or something
like that but during a workflow they are
in your way yeah and nonlinear means you
can change things rearrange things and
jump wherever you want so if your eye is
say you I want to change the white
balance you go to the white balance
layer yeah and change it without said
opening a dialogue doing something it is
in your way to explore that image it
works fine but it is you you have two
more pre think what you want to do and
then do it here you explore what you
want to do and might find things you
never thought of you wanted to do
corrections i find myself doing mostly
time are things like nice girls two
things which involve coming in to say
you you you do most of the time deal
with lance ghosting you know it has a
dust tool but thats there why doesn't it
work oh I am I can show you Prince and
30 inch wide with about fifty sixty dust
spots and it's pretty good so I bet you
know that gets into an argument I be
honest and it's but lens ghosting you
know I took 35,000 Roth I since 2000 i
think i did correct one lens coasting
because i don't get it because I avoid
it to start with it doesn't mean it make
doesn't make sense and the is also not
the point that I say this kind of
editing is for everything on the planet
I didn't say that yeah
I leave if you want the non destructive
path I created tiff file going to
photoshop and do whatever it would be
needed to do that no not really not
really not ready for exam you can also
do the following you first corrected and
then go into light zone from tiff it is
the same possibility it's just you
cannot have everything that I understand
it's true that I use tools when they
they fit for example in the moment when
I want to do the lens distortion I may
use a tool and do it in photoshop and
then go to light zone afterward you it's
still you you can benefit from it and
it's you know it's it's still fine if
you prepare it to a certain level and
then do perfection so else doing that we
buy this I just
the collectors like what they do they
know something wrong with the invention
of the fixes and pins and then I want to
fix my global Corrections again then to
work clothes just does work together
very well in fact if you don't have more
problems than just working photoshop so
I don't see that point you just have one
level of working with things if you have
that you know your lens ghosting which
is kind of the butt but I think just may
stop that and because that's it in a
matter of taste and I there is it you
cannot argue on that really there's
nothing like the perfect tool that we
know that so just briefly
non-destructive editing so you have
actually you start with an image and you
have a bunch of operations benefits
space you can make changes later once
you have to nail it to the pixel level
image you have to redo whatever you did
afterwards why is not all editing
non-destructive computing limitations
not all operations are easy to map into
this model yeah that's for sure yeah but
they are also the annoying operations in
other editing programs where you have to
wait it is non-destructive editing the
future yes very clearly light zone took
it one step further than before they
were actually what was it life picture
there was actually one application in
the ancient history of photo editing in
the beginning of the 90s which had kind
of an operation stack but it was because
of the computing power was so low that
people did all the editing at the low
res image and then waited to do it on
the full-size image it's kind of the
same idea but it is now in the
interactive visual editing domain my
prediction is in two years if your raw
converter doesn't
do selective editing it won't be really
hit on the market yeah just I come to
you in a minute challenges you know no
surprise computing speed you have to do
in real time or kind of real-time a
expensive operation that's already today
if if people work on raw converter let's
assume you come to a rock converter
developer and say you have the genius
wet world best algorithm it just takes
five minutes to execute he doesn't even
look at you because he knows his users
will kill him because they say oh this
so slow of course if it would be really
the world best they would do a later and
wait five minutes yeah but you cannot
enter cooperate in something very
expensive operation that just doesn't
fly it is you have to stay compatible
with older controls so what about this
deck reading it in ten years integration
without the application and that's what
you got into and there's no standard
tools or standard on how layers are
described so sorry you
future and that is that in 3d modeling
this same transformation occurred
probably around five years ago or they
basically like 3dsmax revolutionize
things by having a stack of operations
that occur on your objects so I think
it's probably the likely thing it will
be with you yeah the question was you
know we thought it was more a comment
was that in 3d editing this move was
done about five years ago so the idea is
as old as anything you know people
probably knew in the 18th that they
wanted to do it but that didn't have the
computers they didn't have the model
that I didn't have the user interface
they didn't have anything to do it yes
so I'm kind of surprised honestly that
white zone is the first to go that step
yeah but this also shows it's not just
trivial it's not just ok let's start and
do it yes the thing is this damn stupid
machine has to work pretty fast to do it
yeah but that's kind of what I what I
see integration without the application
yeah so it's all yours are actually the
Fabio Lione sure the questions before my
yeah so why he is setting up so if there
are other questions okay pine movie
okay so my talk comes after we wasted a
very good job you know illustrating
white lights on is good and everything
so I will you know shorten up my thing
and try to stay to a few points who is
fabulous is me you know i have a backrub
CTO and founder of like crafts which is
the company does light zone I have a
background in electrical engineering
particle physics worked at CERN when we
invented the web down there and computer
science I work on particle detectors in
my life large-scale disability real-time
systems and lots of signal processing
this is my second startup I sold another
company to be a systems p ago and while
i was working there you know you go from
us both start up to a large corporation
and city exciting everybody's got an
opinion what you have to do so you don't
get to do anything anymore and i got
into photography i found it like crafts
in 2004 it's based in palo alto it's
probably founded it's a small company
for the moment but we're gonna grow
bigger than google very soon let's easy
right you just get a good idea what is
light zone item is advanced photo
editing made simple so you know there
are professionals like over that use it
in in a professional way but the idea is
that you know anybody should be able to
retouch images in a decent way when i
got into photography and you know i'm a
fairly advanced computer user and i
found that retouch you might give images
in photoshop sucks it sucks not because
photoshop is a bad abrogation you think
like that it's just is 20 years old and
it thinks about images in a way that i
don't want to think about images and
we'll get into this light zone tries to
put together a new approach for a new
market defining what photography
actually is in modern times and see what
are the key elements that photographers
want to be able to deal with digital
photography is very new after all
digital for sadistically didn't exist
before can introduce the
the cannon River so it was a few hundred
thousand people around the world
shooting you know big beasts cameras
that were totally impractical and hugely
expensive when can I introduce the rebel
in 2003 where everybody's got digital
camera this really sophisticated and
good is you know the better than what
field you used to do before it is
largely burgeoning market so there has
been the last two or three years lots of
hubbub of your app or without your
Lightroom and Photoshop and isn't dead
but if you make the RIT medics Photoshop
only covers probably four percent of the
dsl user market the Photoshop is a user
base of about six million customers in
total of these you know the number of
digital photo efforts are a minority
because most of the people are actually
doing you know the real thing that
Photoshop can do which is graphic artist
work so most people that take images
with digital cameras nowadays either
didn't retouched images already use the
crop software comes with their camp most
photographers cannot read the history
I've been to lots of photography
workshop where you know there is this
guy that takes you on top of us emiti
into the beautiful pictures and you've
got this ladies both their nikon d200
has a histogram on the back and she's
looking at the histogram like this and
then she goes like that and she cannot
make any sense of it it's a mathematical
representation on your image what is it
did light with light zone I try to put
together a visual approach to digital
photography where images are not treated
as a pocket of numbers who images where
pixels have got nothing to do a follower
pictures are an accident of the
implementation of the factory of a
computer it treats images with dots okay
it's like you're going after every
single grain of film it's not just done
photography is a way of thinking and
feeling about the images you're creating
as always been showing us and you know
photography tools must talk about
photography not about pixels not about
some numerical representation of this
picture on our range from 0 to 255 on
some arbitrary scale and why do we r
attached images and what always been
showing us is that there is a big
discrepancy between the eye and the
camera the eye
and the camera see very differently di
performs local adaptation of the image
so you know the order your your photo
sensors on the retina will talk to each
other and try to figure out what the
next one is doing and and and adapt to
to the senior thing was what the i wants
to do is to compress the huge dynamic
range desk out of the word outside there
and put in some format it's easy to
manipulate for the brain so you reduce
the count the global contrast range you
enhance the local contrast you have seen
the little image that over showed before
with the dots on a bone white and dark
background that's what the brain does is
tracks information other things the
camera instead and so the eye works in a
logarithmic scale where you know the big
differences are compressed and it does
you know logo levitation the cover
instead works in a linear scale no
adaptation whatsoever so you get the
stark images they're black and white and
the ISIS we I didn't see that so you
want to recreate the impression that you
had when you actually look that
different film actually works better
than digital cameras because film is is
a is an analog process inside there so
it works like you know tube amplifiers
so whenever you are clipping if you are
an audiophile you know with transistors
they go like that because it Clips the
sound wave with tubes you have a soft
clipping and in film the highlights of
your image are softly compressed instead
with digital camera where you click you
go beyond what the the CCD could do and
it's gone would be great if somebody
invents a camera that can drain stuff
out of the highlights as they're
produced so basically we want to
recreate the original user experience
and we want to go beyond the original
visual experience by interpreting what
we saw so putting the accent on pieces
of the images that are interesting for
us in light zone over didn't show you
but the framework for thinking about
your images is 50 years old so we use
the ansel adams own system as a
framework for thinking about what you
have inside there the the danger zone
system it's a framework where you can
talk about the visual elements in
image in terms of different zones and
different light bodies and you can think
about how you want to rearrange these
different visual elements directly in a
visual language I don't want to go into
the details of why we do that in lights
on it will take too long but the point
is that there is a way of interacting
and talking about images differently
than just talking about pixel values so
what we do we take a scene like this one
we break it down into different zones
and with a tool like the dome up we can
identify your friends to the light on
the river here and then find a slider
that corresponds to the lighter the
river which is the slider that turns the
divine to yellow and you bring it up or
bring it down so we're very simple
operations you can you know completely
reorganize the light in your image in a
logical and you know photographic way
well it changes the contrast curve of
deeva so you can stretch logo at so you
take the tonal range and you either
compresses threats just move it up move
it down so you won't you do what you
want so this is the way let me give you
a short time about that he so debate the
question the question is about how does
it really work what does it actually do
let me give you an idea of what it
actually does let's take this image
so this image I was taking like I don't
remember if it's sunset or don't the
older all the valley is very dark the
sky is very bright I try to keep the
entire dynamic range of the image so if
I don't want to blow out the sky
basically the rest comes out dark so
what what what you want to do is to
somehow enhance the brightest a
brightness of the part of the image and
then work on the detail that you've got
inside image the zone map is the tool
that we use to rearrange the zones what
you can do you can explore it image by
moving the cursor over the dorm upper
for instance you want to open up the
shadows you find the part of the shadows
you select it you bring it up this
changes globally the image okay and
changes the shadows in your image now
you know you want to change the light on
the river you find where the river is
you bring it up and you see that all the
parts of the image they've got that
value of lightness come up pretty much
like that so it's very easy to identify
which part of the tonal range you want
to use and change and do it directly
visually you see that here there is not
an Instagram there is no numerical
representation everything is burned down
by your eyes once you get accustomed to
these kind of tools your eyes in your
brain to the all the work and you dare
to think about numerical values when you
have to think about numerical values
that is something this wraps your
thought process continuously and you go
back and forth into you know something
that distracts you from your feelings if
you if you want
it works like curves so beyond the drone
system what you want to do is Yan the
i.d first you have systematically have
to bridge the gap between world to your
ISO and then what the camera see and
then you want to work your image and
retouch it and add your artistic
interpretation to it so instead of doing
all the bodywork of your brain by hand
you can have better tools so in light
zone where at all is called the tone
mapper the tone mapper works if you want
like shadows highlights in Photoshop but
it actually works so if you try to work
with shadows highlight you'll get family
so-and-so result because your griddle
said they use inside there and not you
know very sophisticated in light zone we
put together a torn-up where it's really
powerful and the dome upper reconstructs
what your I actually sees in real life
so it interprets the image finds out
where the shadow areas are bring cups
result while keeping down the highlights
and it is sophisticated masking
techniques inside and you can you know
change the highlights the shadows and
local local contrast in verifying detail
and then on top of it you start adding
artistic interpretation so now I want to
you know put the accent on the river and
I just work on the tonal range of the
river or or on the tonal range of the
mountain so you can adjust know the
detail of the work so you can go very
quickly from an image that was you know
like forget it to an image the starts to
look like something so the future is in
automating as much as possible you know
all the bait the basic difference
between what the ISO and what the camera
sees and then give freedom to artistic
that prediction for the photographer
so what we would the technique we use
you know its tone mapping at the base
for the geeks but what really is imagery
lighting you can take you know images
when there is no light you have you go
to a workshop with your photographers
you have to wake up at five o'clock in
the morning and by eight ER done because
that's where the light is then nothing
happens for the rest of the day and then
at 5pm you go somewhere now by eight you
want to take some pictures because there
is light again well if you can relight
your image if you can change the nature
of the image in your delivered nature of
the light in your image you can take
images all the time even when there is
no light and you can be you know an
artist photographer or you can just take
family snapshots I have a few images of
my son this is a fashion show that was a
guide for kiefel children I go there
with my expensive gum and I take this
kind of crap so you know you want to be
able to make some sense out of it so how
did I see this thing at the time I saw
it like this we're on this screen it the
contrast is exaggerated but you see that
there is a way of going from what the
camera sees to what the ice is basically
in with one single slide takes too long
to explain right now but what it does it
it really mimics what the Ida's we put
the camera that the image in a
representation is close to head to the
eye it understands the differences
within different tonal elements and
grouping of elements in the image and
and basically reconstructs the light on
the image you can completely change the
nature of the light you can go to from
soft light our slides you know the
organized you know the way the sound
worked up day
you know the hgr well the high dynamic
range world is this whole realm of what
is called tone mappers and this is not
called tome ever incidentally this is
how you map the light of an image in in
case of hgr from a huge range of light
into a manageable light which could be
printed you know printed you get maybe a
ratio of one to two hundred fifty if you
have on glossy paper in math you may get
12 50 as a dynamic range and the tone
mappers we will see over the next years
many of them there are already probably
very sophisticated is amiss you probably
need a Cray to run overnight to get
something done this is done in real time
so this is where many people work on how
we map what we see to walk the cat of
what the camera sees to what we see well
what I do I'm not gonna tell you because
you know I sell it I think I mean
working a lot of this thing what what's
really complicated actually is making it
fast how do I do it this quick because
you know other people can do things
similar like that but you know it takes
a long time this is interactive autonomy
so my dog finishes here if you guys have
questions this pro be a good time
so question or do we get me thrown out
yeah at the end you know the visual
system is part of our it's not part of
the thinking part of the brain so it's a
physical experience so if you say four
percent of DSLR users use Photoshop I'd
be amazed if you forgot % its own system
sure so what is the motivation to those
results but the job system first of all
you know the old days the integration so
only the zone system is some some
esoteric technology that could be even
more complicated Photoshop to grasp this
is true if you go in the zone system of
the darkroom I stuff I did but the zone
system is just a way of talking about
your images so if you have to think
about a view I a UI that allows you to
manipulate the letter your image well
there are people there have been
thinking about okay how do I talk about
managed so this is just a language and
you don't have to go into the details
and the complex's on system normally
people just you know see the dome upper
in front of them and start changing it
that's it you know yeah when dick asked
me about the talk I want to talk about
selective editing how many people do
selective editing it's probably one
tenth of a percent that they may need to
be educated when I started writing using
raw it was a tiny group you could really
number them on the planet today New York
Times writes about raw raw is like you
know the hip thing to do for me it's
already the past you know I get the next
step which means go beyond that raw is
done it's it's just there and you use it
yeah but it is an educating process and
the educating process needs to start and
it starts here today so that's the point
but I agree there's a lot to do but
people have to see what they miss if
they don't
ever see that you know I agree with them
why bother yeah you can expect many of
these things that now you can do it
softer and you do it as post-processing
probably the camera will do in the next
four or five years okay thank you very
much
