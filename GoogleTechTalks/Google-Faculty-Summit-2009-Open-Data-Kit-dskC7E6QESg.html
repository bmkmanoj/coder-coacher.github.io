faculty member in CSE at UW and this was
my sabbatical year here at Google and
actually at the Google Seattle office
but working closely with folks both on
the google com side and the google.org
side of course the work i'm going to
describe here on open data kit is due to
all those people at the bottom I'm the
one who have probably had the least to
do with getting this done but you know
my just to give you a sense my
background I i come from the ubiquitous
computing community and my emphasis has
been on the hardware side of that
community the embedded systems that that
make for ubiquitous systems and what I
wanted to do on my sabbatical was create
a flexible open-source data collection
tool that we were targeting a community
health workers people who go around to
deliver health care to people in
underserved regions and I wanted to also
get involved with Google because this is
the kind of thing that only can have
impact if you do it at a reasonable
scale and it's hard for a university to
get involved in projects of that scale
without the kind of support you can get
from an organization like Google so
that's why I wanted to be here and then
as a side benefit I also wanted to learn
about Google technologies such as
Android and App Engine bring those back
to my activities at the University in
ubiquitous computing where these
technologies can make a big impact so
that was what I was after let me tell
you a little bit about community health
workers they they're the people who
bring health care to people who can't
get to it themselves and most of these
are most of these workers are usually
hired by governments or NGOs working in
various countries also even in the
United States we have a lot of community
health workers who serve poor
communities the homeless and groups such
as those they are the really the first
line of defense in ongoing health care
and they provide regular home visits in
in the villages where people
if they know their community their the
eyes and ears for the health system in a
lot of these countries to see what's
going on they also provide education for
best practices how to properly install
mosquito nets how to do bill appropriate
latrines cooking practices and so on and
the current methods they use for doing a
lot of their work is based on paper
these are some examples of the kind of
paper forms that these folks deal with
we've literally seen trailers full of
these forms sitting waiting for data
entry so there's many many months before
this data actually gets into a usable
state and they also don't do a very good
job of using historical data to help
them figure out what might be going on
like you saw in the flu trend stuff so
our goal was to basically build a mobile
system that would allow them to collect
data get it to a database quickly and
start seeing what's really happening
putting in those buttons for those
various diseases basically so we wanted
to have the CHW have a phone that could
do the that could help them with the
home care make sure they went through
the protocols and checklists and the
appropriate order help them create new
outreach programs help with outbreak
detection and just general improved
healthcare surveillance of the
population at the same time we also
wanted to standardize how the data was
collected provide better supervision of
their activities this is a human
resource issue with a lot of these
groups as the community health workers
tend to be very undertrained very mobile
workers that come and go from different
organizations and so we wanted to do a
better job of supervising them and
helping them do the they're they're
questioning appropriately so what we
built was this thing called open data
kit which is a whole suite of tools
centered around the android client and
an app engine back end that collects the
data and I'll tell you a little bit more
about that but basically it's a set of
forms that appears on the screen of the
phone the forms are actually quite
flexible they allow all kinds of data
types including GPS coordinates
photographs video we also integrate with
the barcode application on the android
so you can read barcodes and do
inventory kind of things patient
identification and so on and all that
all that data goes into a an app engine
back end that can then present a Google
spreadsheet that lets you look through
all that data or visualize it in
different ways put it on maps and so on
we are currently involved in two
deployments 1 in Uganda and one in Kenya
with two different groups and I'll tell
you a little bit more about those in a
second that's our website all the code
that we've generated is open source and
it's freely available for download so so
the to the to the two deployments I
wanted to mention the one on the left is
a earlier one from about a year ago sort
of the first version of this that we
were trying out and that was done in
Tanzania with a childhood illness
protocol so this is so how do you triage
kids that come screaming into a clinic
with their parents usually their mother
and you have to figure out whether they
really need to see the doctor or not and
the reason you want to filter that is
because there's only one doctor and
there's a lot of screaming kids and you
got to figure out which ones really need
the extra help so there's a wh 0
protocol basically a flow chart of what
questions to ask and what measurements
to take and that takes you to a
conclusion about what to do the problem
was is that this is a paper chart and a
lot of the workers that were doing this
triage we're not following the chart
because it looks like you're trying to
go through a manual while you have a
screaming kid in the office with you and
you know parents don't react well to
that it's like what do you what do you
do
you know take care of my child and
you're using this paper manual and then
they would get lost in the flowchart and
you know to go to page 19 if yes page 27
if no then I figure out how did I get
here and you know have to retrace their
steps so that was a bit of a problem and
they weren't adhering to the protocol so
what we did is basically put a form on a
device on a mobile device that had the
same exact flowchart but now the person
this is now the social effect of this
the the worker doing this now has this
fancy device that they're using and the
parent is all impressed it's still a
paper flowchart it's not any different
but the the one difference is though
that two things one actually is that
they can see how they got to where they
are basically what we did on the screen
is leave the answers from the previous
questions so that you can see sort of
how you arrived at this next question it
wasn't just you know I'm on page 19 how
did I get here and then the second thing
is that the data was already entered and
it could go into the clinic's records
right away so you didn't have to do a
separate data collection step and fig or
a note-taking step associated with that
so the adherence went way up because of
this you know from something like sixty
percent to ninety percent in doing that
so we got better conclusions about what
to do with the child the one on the
right is one that we're involved with
right now and this is now going to go to
300 community health workers in in
western and southwestern Kenya and it's
for an HIV monitoring project where
community health workers are going out
to known HIV patients who are taking
medication and they're finding out how
their compliance is and taking the
medication what side effects they're
having whether they need to get referred
back to a clinic for adjustment to that
medication or follow-up visits with a
physician and there's a interesting
aspect of that to also connect to a
database of medical records to help them
track trends in the disease and how the
drugs are reacting among the population
that they're trying to treat all the
work that we've done has been really
leveraging open Stan
the forms that we use for example or a
thing called xforms that was designed by
the w3c and this allows us to run the
same form on many platforms not just
Android so in fact you saw two there on
the previous slide one was a PDA device
and one was the Android using a you know
standard client-server api's allows us
to use different servers on the back end
and make that flexible because sometimes
of course governments have reasons why
they don't want their data going into a
cloud that they don't know where it is
they like to keep some of their data
more local and the Android platform
being open source and leading to many
different implementations you know
you're going to get a g1 after you fill
out the survey but there's phone android
phones coming from Samsung and many
other providers as besides HTC that
builds the g1 so that'll provide some
flexibility and we've connected to
another organization called datadyne
that puts out a data collection tool
called epi surveyor on really cheap
phones so they don't do pictures they
don't do GPS they don't do all that
fancy stuff but there are times when you
want to have cheaper platforms for many
people to use and so we now can cross
our forms and cross our servers so our
data can go to their back-end their
their data can come to our back-end and
we can build up a mixed system very
easily so right now we're involved in
expanding our range of deployments we
have an SMS app evaluation that brings
up a survey after you use an SMS service
for doing things like a local search for
example related to agriculture health
and whether questions we have one with a
the School of Veterinary Medicine at the
University of London deforestation
monitoring and this is an interesting
project that the Geo team here at Google
is involved with and there was actually
a workshop just two days ago I don't
have some of the data that came from
that but they had 40 people from around
the world who are interested in the
deforestation issues and what they're
doing is in
satellite imagery that's looking down
and detecting changes with on the ground
validation of what those changes might
represent and what we did with that
group just two days ago was given them
all in android phone and sent them out
on the grounds of the campus of the
Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation and
they all went out in and Matt trees so
they took pictures of trees answered a
set of questions about the condition of
the tree and this in the environment
around it and while they were doing that
that information was flowing right back
into their conference room and into a
Google map that showed all that data on
the screen so when they got back and
reconvened all their pictures were
already on the screen and all indexable
via the map so there was a picture of
the campus and a little marker for each
of the things that they took a picture
of so that work we just had the we just
got word that the Brazilian delegation
that was here to look at that just
cancel the contract that they were about
to sign to get somebody to build them
such a data collection system and are
going to be using ours so that was a
nice thing now if I could only get that
money to UW that that's and then the
last thing is a different kind of
project altogether related to business
search and this is the problem where you
in countries with without well organized
yellow pages and you got to figure out
how to tell people about business
services that are available and we're
working with a Google Group in India
that's going to be sending out people to
take pictures interviews GPS coordinates
of businesses so that they can be
provided as search results so you can
actually see the shopkeeper on the
screen and telling about the kind of
services they provide and decide whether
you want to use them so that's a very
nice new kind of search capability I
wanted to just give you a sense for the
data kit is not just a form system on
the phone that's the top tool to collect
tool but then there's the back end on
the server that we call aggregate
there's a submit tool that does smart
transfer of the data using a variety of
transport protocols that
what's available and what's been
historically available for that device a
tool called manage that lets us remotely
manage the phones and decide what forms
they should have on them what databases
they should have on them and transfer
those files automatically in the
background so that the user doesn't have
to worry about keeping up with that so
we can literally have a green light that
every phone is up to date a red light
when phones aren't up to when haven't
been contacted and yellow for transfers
in progress we also have a task
management system so we can hand out
tasks you know here's what you should go
do and the people you should go visit
we're trying to we're working actively
right now at connecting forms to
existing databases so we can pull
previous medical records and bring them
into the form as well so we can say you
know take this person's blood pressure
and if it's less than before or more
than before do different things the
forms by the way have all kinds of logic
available to them and so on so that we
can do different questions their set of
visualization tools as supervisory
functions day planner for the community
health workers so they can figure out
where to go and then an SMS community
notification system as well that can
transfer the information to people in
the community so you know in conclusion
you know I really I think we kind of set
out with a set of goals that we really
feel that we're achieving very quickly
and now we're seeing actually a user
community building around this open data
kit and lots of people starting to use
it just on their own without us holding
their hands and we have a whole bunch of
next steps that this platform is now
going to provide a springboard for some
much more interesting research
activities around that yeah question I
don't abide by the microphone rule
that's really any case I had a question
so if you thought also about connecting
devices to the mobile device so you know
blood pressure monitors or there are a
lot of open standards that are absurd in
that regard in fact that's the last
bullet there is what we're trying to do
is actually use the
as the centerpiece of building up a set
of medical instruments you know the the
ODA scopes to look in the ear smart
stethoscopes that can actually help
under train people take good heartbeat
recordings that can be added to the
medical record and actually provide
historical background for example for a
physician to look at later maybe years
later to be able to see how someone
might have changed the the current
android doesn't allow you to connect the
new USB device to it so we have that
limitation but that'll be coming with
one of the later releases so we'll be
able to connect other devices to it as
well and other electronic devices but
right now what we're doing is trying to
exploit the microphone and camera as
much as possible for doing this and
there's quite a bit you can do with with
those those devices alone yeah I'll
repeat your question I can hear you fine
just the ability to prompt someone to
enter the value from there you know CVS
purchase blood glucose or blood pressure
measure right know that that's
absolutely right and I think but there
are some interesting applications for
example the the cells go project that UC
Berkeley which is just adding some extra
optics to the camera basically turning
it into a microphone to a microscope
sorry microscope and be able to what
they do right now is just let you see
that image on the screen but you can
actually do things like account cells in
a blood smear now what would be really
interesting to try to do that
automatically so that you can do it
quickly and you don't have to have
somebody well-trained to do that and you
can use an under train population that
we often have to use in these cases
because we just don't have the we just
don't have the people with the extensive
training that might be required here I
mean these are literally people get like
two days you know here's what to go view
get out there and do it and they're
actually prescribing drugs to people
yeah
yeah that's all he'll microphone is
coming you hinted that you could run the
things for offline them and I'll start
wondering what sort of the limitations
of how far how long can you run mollify
how many patients can you see before you
basically right yeah so the phone is
actually not in use for all that long so
we don't do things like actually track
every you know track the location of the
health workers they move every second of
the day we just we just take a GPS
reading when they're at someone's home
right now I've seen it but yeah you're
storing the data oh they're taking to
her data and storing at me yeah and how
long can they be out to feel before they
run out of memory no and got a long long
time we're not even close to getting any
limits even taking lots of pictures and
so on you know there's an eight gigabyte
SD card in the phone you can take a lot
of pictures and eight gigabytes about
the problem that you've handed a very
valuable phone to somebody know that
yeah that's an interesting point that's
come out in that it's a fancy that a new
phone right and in fact we've done
things like you know so yeah the theft
issue has arisen but you know when
you're sending people out there carrying
a lot of medications with them they have
a lot of other things that are valuable
that are in terms of costs are about the
same as the phone so it's not add order
of magnitude difference or anything like
that but yet it has come up as like oh
you know people are looking at my phone
a lot another thing that always comes up
is people say like you know you have
unsophisticated users right and what do
you know they're not going to be able to
deal with this complicated phone and
that's that's turned out to be a total
red herring we've given the phone and
actually had eliminated a whole bunch of
apps so we didn't confuse people and
everything they were reinstated within
seconds because they got to get to their
YouTube videos and things like that
right so yeah no problem people figured
it out pretty fast the thing that they
don't like is the qwerty keyboard a lot
of the people we were dealing with
like well you know who was who decided
for the order of these letters cuz I
can't you just put a phone keypad on
this thing and they released in
alphabetical order you know so they
really like just the 10 buttons you know
yeah common medications in case you
could remotely diagnose some of these
people are already handing out
medication oh the ROK yeah and the
locking isn't the issue really it's an
equal chance of mistakes too right ya
know but it's really just figuring out
the right thing to do in a lot of cases
and each organization we deal with has a
very different model for how to do that
so that's that's something we've left
off a little bit you know this is just
too much variation for we haven't seen a
way to make that one particular model
that could work for a general everyone
involved okay I think we'll stop here
right thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
