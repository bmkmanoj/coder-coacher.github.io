seventh grade at the San Francisco 49ers
Academy I live with my grandparents and
my auntie in East Palo Alto I think my
grandma would say that she likes it the
citizen school teaches me the same
lessons she tries to teach me every day
she knows I'm going to a place raha fun
work on school and be safe I feel safe
where I live but there's a lot of scary
places in epa there's a lot more
violence in gang action here than other
places citizen school doesn't just give
me something to do it helps me get
focused it's a program that shows kids
the ropes and helps us learn about what
we can achieve it helps us get
disciplined and motivated for high
school and college in citizen schools
also get to meet new people and really
get to know them we have family
Pollock's where we get to see where
everyone else is from what their
families are like all kinds of food they
eat it's a place where everyone feels
safe it's like coming home to a
different family I am motivated I am
citizen schools
good evening everyone I'm Carolina Massa
Cary Michelle's grandmother on behalf of
my family we want to thank city schools
and all the people who have helped me
sharing her success 49ers Academy thanks
to citizen schools we have being able to
see a change in Mitchell Sally two
towers education her grades verify that
with your encouragement she has become a
young girl with confidence with your
help and support we have changed her
future have dreams are now within reach
Mitchell is becoming the person she has
always dreamed to be I am support I am
citizen schools i am alex ramirez and i
am in the sixth grade kid in middle
school when i get older i want to be
independent I want to go where I want to
go I need a car right in my bank of
American car by apprenticeship I learn
how to start saving money I asked my mom
to open me a saving account for me did
you know you can save twenty percent on
insurance if you get a CBC and school at
citizen schools our to take I don't have
to take notes study set goals aim high
make the grade I can do that but me I'm
thinking bigger I'm going to be
self-employed entrepreneurs I want to be
a graphic designer I can do that I
always had dreams now I have plans I'm
confident I am citizen schools
he can do that we can do that together
my name is Sandra portado and I'm the
Community School Coordinator kennedy
middle school community schools are
about bringing kids families school
staff and service providers together
with one goal improving the lives of
children we collaborate because we want
to create a community because we want to
create a place where kids can succeed
and the citizen school program is a
great program for that reinforcing
learning by communicating with teachers
reinventing learning by involving the
community in this process the citizens
school community is vibrant and bringing
them to Kennedy was one of the best
decisions we have ever made I'm
collaborating I'm citizen schools
my name is Blanca Montes I'm in the
sixth grade and McKinley institute of
technology in redwood city and i have a
lot to say you probably goes from my
essence that English is not my first
language my my family and I moved to
redwood city from Mexico more into a new
country made it difficult for me to
share my ideas but citizen schools help
me change that there I felt comfortable
to practice my English I have a lot to
say and team leaders and citizens
teachers encouraged me to say every day
at citizen schools i transformed from an
English language learner to an English
public speaker and not only did I
improve my second language I also i also
learned to speak through film theatre
and dance i have a lot to say and
because of citizen schools i can say in
many many ways i am communicating i am
citizen schools
I've definitely learned the kids have a
lot to say especially Victor teasing um
I just a time my name is Doug banks I
work here at Google as a programmer I've
taught three apprenticeships for citizen
schools the first two were in
programming and after that I just wanted
to get away from it so the last one was
an improv comedy and I got involved in
citizen schools because I really like
the idea of it I can teach whatever I
want I can make a personal connection
with the kids it's great just to walk
away from my desk in the middle of the
day and be able to you know connect with
people and do something fun and
different I'd also like how it connects
the you know two different aspects of
the community you've got this company
with all these great resources and all
these you know motivated people and then
you've got the kids who are so open and
teachable and so excited about learning
it's just great to watch the connection
happen and also for me it's kind of
personal I live about 10 blocks from the
school where I'm tutoring these kids so
these are kids in my community that I'm
passing on the street all the time so
and I also enjoyed just getting to take
part in Google's effort in general to
give back to the community so uh I am
connected I am citizen schools
I am Anjali lopez and I am an eighth
grader at campbell middle school before
i go in citizen schools i spent a lot of
time just hanging out ever since my mom
passed away and my sister has been
taking care of me but I'm 13 now it's
not like I need a babysitter I'm pretty
grown up so I spent a lot of time just
hanging out with friends when i first
started citizen schools i thought it was
a punishment coming but it ended up
being a positive experience the best
part was my leadership class we call it
eighth grade break here we learned about
high schools summer programs and
colleges and how to get in and how to
pay for it we learned about speaking to
I used to only talk to friends or family
but now I speak up in class and ask
questions and talk to adults and
teachers and even give speeches at
really big events I learned to be
confident and I learned to be a role
model for younger kids like my sister is
for me I thought I was pretty grown up
but it turns out i had some more growing
today i am growing I am citizen schools
we are citizen school
you take kids
we're starting we're starting another
program this this fall and nazanin who
is a citizen schools director in redwood
city and marin who is one of the citizen
school teachers who works at the kids
every day they'll basically walk you
through the program and and basically
then you could if you're interested you
can email us and you know and we'd love
to talk to you more thank you know how
again like now have said my name is
nazneen Holly Nagi I'm the campus
director at Redwood City MIT campus
campus meaning we have an after-school
program and it's at many different
schools in California this year we have
six schools in California too or one in
San Jose one in campbell to in redwood
city into in daly city and we're school
based so the students that work with us
in our after-school program only come
from the school that we are based at so
when I say campus director at MIT that's
that's what I'm talking about so before
I get started I want to introduce some
of the citizens school staff that are
here today so first is Marin Wong she is
one of the teachers within our
after-school program and she's going to
be speaking to you a little bit later
about the specifics around how to
volunteer here at Google over here is
Vince gay he is our talent manager he
helps us find volunteers and find staff
for all of the campuses in California
and then Michelle joy she is visiting
from our national headquarters in Boston
and you'll learn a little bit about how
he got started from there okay thank you
um so um no sway before we go into the
citizen schools model what it looks like
I wanted to give you a little bit of
context to what citizen schools is
Michelle is from our headquarters in
Boston because that's where we began 12
years ago an after-school program with
two people who just saw a need within
this with a need for the students to
help with their academic achievement in
the Boston Public School system at that
point it was found that
five percent of eighth graders were not
proficient in basic math and language
skills so these two people to citizens
didn't have anything to do with school
decide that they wanted to help and do
something so they volunteered they found
a school said can we volunteer and work
with these kids and they taught
journalism and they taught first day it
seemed to be a success they really
enjoyed it then they decided you know
more people can do this there's a lot of
citizens out there there's a lot of
people who care about who care about
kids who want to work with youth but
they're not the teachers that are
directly impacting the daily education
of students so they started citizen
school so it's called citizen schools
because it's schools based on citizens
people who are outside of the school
system normally coming in and creating a
learning environment for students
outside of school so you can go so after
twelve years we've done a lot of
research and a lot of studying on how
people learn and how how we should
structure the learning environment for
our students after school to be very
intentional so there's this learning
triangle that citizen schools didn't
make up this is something that's in at
the education research field and what it
is saying is this triangle represents a
hundred percent of learning retained by
people in general the bottom part of the
pyramid represents twenty percent so
saying that twenty percent of what um if
somebody he is just hearing information
they'll retain twenty percent of that
information if somebody is seeing
information along with hearing
information that they're going to retain
forty percent beyond that then there's
if you hear see and discuss so
afterwards if we had like a discussion
session about everything you heard today
you would retain about sixty percent of
the information and then you go to doing
actually using the information in
something to perform a project may be of
some sort you would retain eighty
percent of that information and then the
top of the triangle is teaching if you
can teach the information that you have
received then you are probably going to
retain a hundred percent of the
infirmary
that you have received this is the crux
of what citizen schools is based on is
that teaching the doing and the teaching
this is something we try to do with our
students every single day and which is
also why we bring in citizen teachers to
come in and do that because you're going
to bring in the real life experience
from what you do either as a hobby or in
your job and you're using that
information on a daily basis in a
productive way and bringing that to the
students you're helping them do and then
we're going to talk about how you can
help them teach at the end thank you so
this is what we're going to go over so
first we heard of the stories from
citizen schools we did our welcome
introduction we're going to talk about
the challenge in California that our
after-school program hopes to meet the
mission of citizen schools a little bit
of what our program looks like every day
for our students and then the
apprenticeship model is where you as
volunteers would fit into that then what
apprenticeships that Google look like
because that is very specific here and
then how to get involved with us and
then we have a couple of people who have
been citizen teachers with Google before
that are going to speak to you about
their experience and then we'll be here
for questions and after yes sorry pa on
the slide but what sounds like you got
NE pas oh we actually are only there on
fridays just a welcome I lived closer oh
yeah so we have a Friday
okay um so in California why citizen
schools came to California one of the
reasons was also I mean this is a
nationwide thing but we found in
California that at least half of the
eighth graders in California were also
performing below basic level of English
and math which is something you probably
hear everyday in the news a different
states all over the country but more
than a half half of our eighth graders
that's a lot of people that aren't going
to be able to succeed in high school
therefore probably are going to be able
to succeed further than that so it was a
great need that we wanted to come out
here and fill and and help solve the
problem so our mission from our
organization overall is to educate to
educate youth and to strengthen our
communities and in doing that educating
youth is like I said we're trying to
help our students become successful
academically to be able to be on a
pathway where they can succeed outside
of school or they have options to go to
secondary education where they can
pursue professions such as yours and a
corporation as engineers scientists
teachers lawyers and then the
strengthening communities part is one if
we have educated citizenry that will be
more participatory within their
community they'll have more value to add
to their community and to bringing
citizens volunteers connecting to the
schools and to the youth that you may
not already be connecting with is
another way that we hope to strengthen
communities so we believe that out of
school time represents the untapped
opportunity to make this happen there's
another study done on that out of all of
the hours that students are actually
awake and that could be doing they could
be using their time in some way they're
only in school for twenty percent of
that time so there's eighty percent of
the time that they of their time that
they could be doing something they could
be learning intentionally and they're
not so that's
more than more than the majority of
their time and so that's the
out-of-school time that we're trying to
tap and say this is the place where we
can really enhance the learning and the
lives of our students so overall what
we're trying to do in California is one
mobilize thousands of volunteers like
yourselves to engage the youth in in
learning and connecting with other
adults and three preparing our youth to
succeed academically as well as whatever
their aspirations might be for their
future so this is just a quick look of
our national network like I said we
started in Boston and we've expanded to
a number of cities states across the
country so you can see we have East Palo
Alto Campbell San Jose redwood city and
daly city in California and we're hoping
to expand to Oakland San Mateo and
possibly LA so why this is important to
you is because one I want you guys to
realize that this is bigger than you as
volunteers and to the more we can engage
volunteers and community members the
more our program can grow which means
the more we can impact students the more
students will be able to impact in the
end and that's really what we want to do
we want to be able to offer the
opportunities that we have to as many
students as possible um actually go
ahead and skip this leg so an
apprenticeship what is an apprenticeship
what's something that we're going to be
asking you to possibly volunteer to do
is to work with our students on a weekly
basis towards oh wow and what that Wow
is is a product performance or
presentation that's what you want to end
with remember that learning triangle
with the do and the teach so in order to
have that do we need something for the
students to work towards so what we're
working towards is a project project
that's a product something tangible for
example making bookshelves
or performance we've had plays so
putting on a play or a presentation
which is a lot of what happens here at
Google we've had different on the
different apprenticeships present on how
to make a robot how to design a website
how to fly a plane and within that with
what you want to achieve within that
what we're hoping for is that these vows
will represent four things not that they
should represent all four but it's a
hope so the first is to demonstrate
mastery the idea is that we want our
students to feel confident that they've
learned something and that they were
successful in their learning with you
over ten weeks so thinking about
something that you can teach in ten
weeks that students can feel that
they've mastered they've been successful
and the idea behind that is if they can
feel successful in something that
they've learned and they've been able to
present to a bigger audience they're
going to feel confident to take a risk
to learn and to strive to be more
successful in school the second is
community value something that can add
benefit to others outside of this
outside of the students and yourself
just that group that you've been working
with and again that has to do with like
our strength in our communities part of
our mission we want students to see
service and giving back to their
community and being an active part of
their community as something they should
value and that they should strive for so
if that's included in what they're
working for they can feel proud of that
at the end and then something real again
it's about the learning triangle not
doing in teaching and if what they're
doing and teaching is real if it's um
they're taking information for example
on i'm going to use victor over here he
did an aviation apprenticeship and they
actually got to use the information that
they were learning on aviation software
and sit in a plane and and go over the
controls and have to basically share
with Victor what he has been teaching
them through software that made a real
experience for them so that they used
this the abstract information that they
got from a computer and they put it in a
real
this last is the authentic audience and
that's a really easy thing for us to do
here at Google the authentic audience is
giving our students someone else besides
their parents and their teachers to
present to saying that what they've
worked on over the last 10 weeks has
greater value than them just going
through the process to learn something
but it is something to be proud of and
is something to be shared so having that
authentic audience makes it a more proud
'full and celebratory moment for our
students and at Google for example when
we have engineers who are walking around
and looking at these presentations that
students have worked on for maybe the
Python programming that Doug banks refer
to there's people there that actually
know what that is and they can ask
intelligent questions from our students
and then our students have the
opportunity to use that knowledge that
they've learned in 10 weeks with a Doug
and share it with those people that are
asking those questions whereas some of
their parents who might not know what
Python programming is wouldn't be able
to ask those intelligent questions in
their their students wouldn't be able to
to use the information in that way thank
you so this is just an example of some
other apprenticeships that we've had
across the network so you can see we've
worked with a number of corporations as
well as a number of small of individuals
so with google we've built robots we've
worked with fidelity to give financial
advice we've had people write plays do
cooking apprenticeships create films and
we've worked with law firms to do mock
trials and then this is just a couple of
quotes from past citizen teachers about
their experience around volunteering and
working with our students um and meron
can't just read one of those out loud
yeah just choose one
I think the middle one that said being a
citizen teacher brought into my horizons
and gave me a chance to meet great
people kind of sums up everything that
volunteers get out of the program pretty
well so I just want to share this with
you so you you're not just hearing stuff
from our side these are what other
citizen teachers have said in the past
across the network and then this slide
is talking about the support and the
training that you would have as a
citizen teacher so we're asking people
who haven't necessarily had the
experience of working with kids or with
teaching so what we as citizens schools
the staff are there to do is to support
you in that endeavor we want to make
sure that the experiences on as positive
and fun for you as it should be for the
kids as well so we have a support system
and a training pathway in place so if
you decide after today we were talked to
nahar I about volunteering you're going
to have a individual apprenticeship
development and which is where you're
going to meet with the citizen school
staff that are going to come here and
work with you and you're going to work
through the plans and what you're going
to do for ten weeks and learn all
everything you need to know about
apprenticeships apprenticeship logistics
this apprenticeships the big picture
you've sort of our getting today as an
orientation and then this third is a
campus orientation and apprenticeship
fair so that's an opportunity for you to
be at the school and get to know the
school that our students are out every
day and then the apprenticeship fair is
where our students actually choose
amongst all the apprenticeships that are
offered at a school site which of the
ones that they would like to participate
in so for example at our school we have
seven apprenticeships on Tuesdays and
Wednesdays so our students there's a
fair for a sort of science fair style
and it's your chance to have a look a
commercial about your apprenticeships
and basically sell your cell your
apprenticeship for 10 minutes at the end
of that the students get to choose like
one through seven which is the one that
they would like to
most in and the idea that is that when
they come to you they chose you they're
really interested in the topic that you
want to teach so you have students that
are there because they want to be there
and then this is a summary of what the
citizen teacher commitment is so what is
expected as a citizen teacher so you're
going to have your training which is
about two hours long you're going to
meet with your team leader to talk to go
over specific logistics which would take
about an hour send me your
apprenticeship fair the campus
orientation it's about two hours your
apprenticeship apprenticeship sessions
here at Google are 60 minutes and it's
for 11 weeks though you will have weekly
communication with your team leader so
that someone like Marin who actually
works with the students on a daily basis
they will be in the classroom with you
and they will be supporting you helping
you get to know the students what the
students need at any time help you with
logistics resources on a weekly basis
and then at the end is our wow event and
then that varies depending on what
you're doing um if it's here at Google
it'll most likely be the last week of
December of our program but you'll know
about that when it comes so overall the
semester from now until the end of
December it's about a 30-30 our
commitment um so actually you can skip
this because I pretty much went over
that um okay so this is about what
apprenticeships actually look like here
at Google and I'm going to pass it over
to Marin to get into those details okay
hi I'm Erin again um so what it looks
like for us here at Google is we're
going to load all the kids onto a bus
and we're going to bring them over on
Wednesdays and we're going to be here
from about 4 to 5 10 and then volunteers
take small groups of kids to some space
in google and you work on a project so
overall we're going to have 24 students
on that bus coming over there would be
two team leaders such as myself and
somebody else and
then we'll be working with somewhere
between four to 15 of you we're going to
we're aiming to have somewhere between
two to four apprenticeships with five to
twelve apprentices or students in each
group and you can either teach an
apprenticeship by yourself or you can
teach it in a team which makes it easier
with your schedules I know everyone's
really busy here and we come to you
which is the great part about working at
Google and working with our kids and I
just like to say um this isn't on the
slide but it's so great that we're able
to do this with the kids because you
guys hands down have the most popular
apprenticeships every year on our campus
the kids automatically want to go to
Google I didn't get to come last
semester so already coming back I'm
excited that I'm here and like for the
kids this place is like Disneyland and
they walk around and their eyes get
enormous and they're just totally
overwhelmed by all the things that you
have around you every day so it's a
really cool opportunity for them to be
able to experience something they never
would be able to see except for this
program so hope you all are excited
about that okay so um our goal at
citizen schools is to support our
volunteers as much as we can because we
know that you are putting in a lot of
your own time at this we're trying to
make this as easy as possible for you so
you would be right here citizen teacher
or citizen teachers are Google liaison
is Neha so you'll be communicating with
her about setting up room space and
things like that you'll also be talking
weekly to your team leader so that would
either be me or another one of our staff
members and won't be assigned to
volunteers and every week usually
through email will communicate and check
in with you about how things went last
week what you're planning to do the
following week if we have any
recommendations about particular kids
and how they're working if there are
standardized testing going on the kids
are going to be a little wacky and the
following week we'll let you know and
kind of give you a heads up and then
also of course you'll be talking every
week with your apprentices the students
in your group and then above that more
indirectly our campus director so
Nazneen will be kind of overseeing
everything and then at the very top
citizen schools headquarters in boston
is also involved in the whole process
okay so as
said before we have sites in San Jose
Campbell redwood city and daly city and
this is just to kind of put everything
in perspective that we're just a really
small part of the overall picture of
what's going on here in california so
we're serving 450 students overall even
though only 24 of those students will be
here you're part of something that's a
lot bigger okay so here's how you can
get involved if you're all pumped about
doing this um big and bold on the top is
being a citizen teacher so volunteer
that hour every week to come meet those
kids and teach them something that you
know and that you love to do you can
also just spread the word about citizen
school so let friends here at Google now
let your family know let your neighbor
know anybody you know at all we love to
have volunteers come and help with our
kids in addition to doing
apprenticeships there are a lot of other
opportunities for people to get involved
in our program for example we have an
hour or an hour and a half of homework
time every every week at our campus if
you're interested in becoming a tutor we
can always use more help there every
week we go on explorations so we take
field trips on to the community to
museums or universities and it's always
great to have chaperones and volunteers
to come with the kids on those days in
the spring here at Google we actually
have a big citizen schools event called
the WoW affair so if you're interested
in getting involved in that we have
information that you can ask us about at
the end and then our wow event which
will be in December even if you're not
teaching it's great to have an audience
of course though if you could come
support the kids in that way that would
be great too okay so now that you are
all excited and know what you can do
this is how you can actually get
involved you can either email nejo who
is our google liaison about getting
involved if you want to host an
exploration if you wanted to be the
focus of one of our field trips you can
contact nazneen and her contact
information is up there you can also
just find out what's going on if you
sign up for one of our newsletters and
Vince he's back in the back there is the
go-to guy for finding out all sorts of
different opportunities
that we have okay so um picture how do
you feel about talking yeah okay victor
is this fabulous fabulous citizen
teacher that we have here at Google
who's taught to apprenticeships um with
aviation which is amazing for our kids
because they would never ever get to do
aviation outside of something like this
so he's just going to say a few words
about his experience yeah so I taught
the aviation apprenticeship for two
semesters I was never very good at
dealing with kids they're tough to
control and sugar and all that but I
found that that's equally offset by the
by the kids who by the end of the
semester you see that they can actually
do something that you've taught them and
occasionally I get you no one really
sharp student that'll even surprise you
you know I I really wasn't expecting
this so that's neat to see my
apprenticeship we cover various aspects
of aviation and by the end they are
there wow is a demonstration of ability
on the simulator to depart from Palo
Alto and they went navigated their the
way themselves to Monterey did it very
well so the time commitment is not as
bad as it sounds the one hour a week is
easy to waste anywhere in a week so
typically you teach something that you
know so well that there's very little
preparation time involved you know in in
my case aviation I've been flying for
three years now and so when I when I
teach a lesson it's it's not really a
problem as far as prep work too much
beforehand and again the what what you
get out of it at the end what they can
do is it's pretty cool any questions
ticular about aviation or CT schools
ever one semester I would encourage
anyone to give it a shot or you can pair
up with people so yeah oh so they're
like 14 so there around the time when
yeah high school is that high school ok
bills I guess they're right there to
where sometimes it's hard to keep them
calm but you can still get things
through to them by the kids in a session
you watch all the same grade are they
different great they're all about the
same age I don't know for almost a trade
yeah it when you teach it would you can
imagine it would be like any any class
you'll have a couple students you know
that are really sharp and then some that
just zone out and it's hard to get
through but more or less they're all the
same age and so forth I so I taught
between three and four people three and
four kids three or four kids but that's
entirely up to you know how much you
feel you can deal with at Google I think
most people don't take more than six
kids I guess
I guess he just did it here so they
never actually sat in a plane we did do
a wine field trip to the airport where
they got to sit inside in the real
control yeah yeah and and that was neat
so they slide one of these was the
slides that they can read all the
instruments and they know what all the
controls you so when we took a field
trip to the airport they could do that
again as well and they write a nice low
no that would be nice to do I guess we
haven't figured out the paperwork for
that yeah I was wondering but yeah it's
it's not a problem except for that so
hopefully that can be done sometime
meaning else can do it again huh are you
gonna keep going uh yeah yeah for this
upcoming semester and you will do it as
well oh well I'm anything so you pick
something that you know very well and
you like to teach
okay I guess I'll introduce myself i'm
jess i did an apprenticeship last
quarter with two friends Natalie and
Steve who couldn't make it today and we
actually talked cooking and we did it in
pacific cafe and the chef's were an
amazing amazing help so basically we
work to the kids it was called Iron Chef
so they got to choose their own
ingredients on the first day that they
wanted to work with and then we created
recipes based off of those ingredients
the second day and then each subsequent
class we would teach one of their dishes
and so what that would mean is we would
go in teach them a couple of steps like
okay this is how you chop an onion this
is how you use a knife safely make sure
you watch our hands those kind of basic
things and then the rest was really
hands-on just you know giving them tips
as they were cutting chopping frying etc
and the chef's were amazing again they
basically we gave them the list of
ingredients we wanted beforehand they
would come with a tray with everything
already chopped up and then a separate
onion that we could practice on so it
was it was tons of fun and we had seven
children to begin with and we ended up
with six at the end which was we could
have probably handled more between the
three of us and I i definitely recommend
working with somebody else if you can
because it turned out you know i would
have to travel a week and so we had a
couple i had couple of other people that
could fill in if I wasn't there which
was nice and this quarter I plan to
teach another one but this time probably
in cartoons and drawing with a couple of
the webmasters so if you have any
questions please feel free to shoot and
if somebody wants to teach a cooking one
this corner I will be happy to introduce
you to one of the chefs so
um I would really recommend talking to
them if you have any questions because
I'd say their apprenticeships were
really really popular last year and I
know that at least one apprentice and
both of theirs told me afterwards that
they're definitely going to sign up for
the same apprenticeship this semester we
usually don't let them do the same one
twice but they were very passionate
about wanting to do the same one again
so they did a great job they'd be a good
resource um so we're gonna open up for
questions if you have any questions for
us we can answer those now employees
volunteer as well as place I would
assume everyone can yeah every everyone
can volunteer did you have a question
are there any conference that you found
just do talk very well sort of asset
topic are there any times it didn't work
I don't think that's know if you we can
take any topic and make it interesting
there's one in Boston that they did
about safety in the workplace and I wish
sounds so boring but the kids loved it
and they went around their school like
pointed out all the potential safety
hazards and got really into it you can
take anything and make it interesting
did you want to add something have a
comment on that bow
so we did our wows in red with both both
here at Google and in redwood city and I
just want to comment on one particular
apprenticeship that was there which was
the goldman sachs folks who taught
investment banking and like the concept
of investment banking that's fine you
can teach the kids that but I just don't
think it was very sensitive to the
population that they were talking to so
they were talking the examples they were
giving were for example you know our
salaries or sixty thousand dollars a
year and we'd like to try to save two
million dollars to donate to charity by
the end of X number of years which I
didn't think was you know great thing to
do considering the population and their
audience um so just keep that in mind
when you're designing these guys then
realty what kind of a kind of kids you
get the program's I mean did they come
from pretty stable families or um so yes
you people what kind of kids we have in
the program I'd say it's a really really
broad range we are in the school because
citizen schools tends to choose schools
that need help that are that are
underperforming but I'd say there's a
broad range of parents that are super
involved and that aren't as involved and
kids that are just wildly outgoing and
ones that are really shy some students
are totally succeeding academically and
others are not at all so it's a really
wide range to have anything to add
special
I guess the best way is like we would
just you know whatever volunteers we get
we'll just brainstorm like meat for an
hour one day and just brainstorm and if
you find somebody who has similar
interest and we'll just team team them
up because I think it's a pretty good
idea given our busy schedules like if
you have to take off 111 Wednesday
evening you can't come then your team
mate can do it and oftentimes even if
you are alone then merin or not tzaneen
can take up that session I mean any
citizen school teacher can take up that
session and keep the kids busy so I also
wanted to add that it doesn't have to be
something that you're very very good at
like it could just be your hobby you
know something that you wanted to
explore but haven't gotten a chance and
you want to share with your kids because
you would also be exploring and learning
in the process so it really the time
commitment really is not that much it's
like an hour is not you know that hard
to spare during you know one day a week
so and you know it's it's a rare
opportunity because you don't have to
leave the campus you don't have to leave
Google clucks at all you know kids come
to you so there's really no reason to
not you know get involved so and
definitely you'll feel awesome after
after kids actually present what you've
taught them they look up to you as if
you know you know the answers to
everything it's an awesome feeling so
I'm I'm gay there's a sign-up sheet not
really a sign up well you know to keep
you guys posted about it I just want to
get the list of people who are
interested in this program also I don't
have to spam everybody well let me set
up limited set of people we'd have a
training session coming up at Google
where it will be around like an hour
hour and a half where we could all sit
together and brainstorm what our
interests are and
and take it from there and after that
which is there's one more thing at
citizen school where you actually
display your apprenticeships that's also
about just an hour in the evening one
evening and then after that you just
stay at Google and start teaching so
awesome i'm going to thank mariner
nazanin for coming and taking the time
to come here definitely yeah so actually
I was just about to say so next steps
right now if um up if if you want to
volunteer at a to teach an
apprenticeship here at Google I'm you
can talk to naha and marin and they can
give you specifics you could exchange
specific contact information and all the
next steps for google if you are not
sure but maybe you want to volunteer
maybe once for an exploration or just
visit you can come talk to me and if
you're interested in looking at any
other school like you said you lived
next to East Palo Alto and that might be
something you're stood in connecting
with the kids there um you can talk to
Vince gay okay
but specific idea which a lot of
volunteers fee until you show up because
he's a pretty good at coming up with
something that hello you can work
through make it important
okay so thank you
