one working on the go team outside of
the u.s. I've been working on the go
team for quite a while actually 2011 so
today I wanna one of the may have done
multiple things like the the subtests
and all the kind of stuff that I want to
talk on the X tax repo mostly today and
how it came about and what the
philosophies behind it and all that
stuff so a little bit of history so I
started on this quite long ago 2011
working on it's 50% so it's going slowly
I'm doing everything mostly everything
myself so Rob asked me to basically work
on something that is to really rethink
the way localization and i18n is done to
not really look at I I see you too much
at the implementations and to see since
we have a new language if we can do
things differently
also the api's weren't very go like so
can we do things you know in a better
way or easy way it's quite a complex
matter so there's other there's other
reasons though so why write things from
scratch so point number one is basically
you know that already says it so go has
a very high cost for bridging with C
which is kind of important with this I
18 and stuff so - really - to use you
know like Paul's - I see use is kind of
costly and also for deployment and all
that software running it on App Engine
is kind of you know sort of one won't
work so another thing is we really
wanted to have like this go likes API
and also the world has kind of been
changing around so if you look at all
come back to it but if you look at go
applications are mostly servers so you
want to handle things are slightly
differently different requirements and
also most of the i18n and and
localization api's were getting a little
bit outdated there's a lot of new data a
lot of you knowledge lot of you tools
and possibilities and the api's just
can't really deal with it very well so
we have to see if we can you know like
do something better but since I couldn't
really copy it from anywhere there's a
little bit tricky
take some time so what is different well
first of all like at the very basic like
go uses a utf-8 a lot of other languages
uses use like utf-16 so also the strings
are quite simple a little bit back to
see so the strings don't necessarily
need to be normalized there's no
metadata to keep track of whether
something is normalized or not so you
might think this is a problem and one
thing that people have objected to a lot
with utf-8 is the lack of REM Max's so
let's look at that for a moment so if
you look at this example here so I have
a string with two emoji flags Korean and
an American flag and I skipped like four
bytes so like one rule
what does anybody have any idea what
this will print by any chance
okay it is the Russian flag there you go
it's the Russian flag so what's
happening so the basically what happens
is a Unicode flag is actually two 32-bit
code points or well not 32-bit but two
four bytes code points and so they're
represented at with with two code points
each one code point for each of the
letters in the country code so basically
I'm only skipping the carrier so the
next one will be ru which will serve
Russia there's no distinction between
the start or and nth code points so like
there you have it so this has some
implications so so suppose I have an
infinite sequence of Unicode flags
I might have to backtrack infinitely to
see the start of a glyph even right so
this is new with emoji Flags a pretty
bad property of Unicode now but so be it
the points in the larger point here is
in general this is an extreme example
but it's you know it can give tons of
examples text is inherently sequential
so the
the goal to do you know to do anything
to get random access for code points
what Python does is a complete waste of
time right like it's just overhead and
it really doesn't help you actually can
hurt you a lot suppose if you have a ski
only and then you add like one emoji in
Python all of a sudden your text will
become four times the size
so another thing like being server
centric so so normally if you have an
you know in the old way when you had
desktops or even like with mobile apps
you have one application you have one
locale that the user uses you loads of
data for that locale and you know
everybody's happy so on servers it
doesn't quite work that way basically
you're switching serving different users
all the time so basically you need to
have all the locales handy right so ICU
has been mostly designed for this first
use case and really optimized for death
so you know with go we started to look
like what can we do if you optimize for
the second use case so another thing
that is very go specific aesthetically
link binaries so here again so we
already have to sort of link everything
in anyway if you want to have secondly
statically linked binaries so basically
the whole goal here has been - okay can
we have any structure sharing can we
pack things differently knowing that we
need to include everything anyway can we
do smart things like if you don't use a
certain table or part of a table gets
dropped by linker automatically like a
lot of that is going on sometimes
influences API design and in general
like you know how do you optimize for
this so that's that's in one of the you
know nature designs so another very cute
one is streaming so I want to be able to
run like a go server and let's say a
hundred megabytes of memory and dealing
with gigabyte size file so that should
all work is we have all these nice
readers of writers that we just stream
everything so one problem though is that
normalization so I don't know if you're
familiar with normalization but a
Unicode string can resend be represented
in many different ways and they're like
logically the same string so in order to
deal with that you have to normalize so
normalized section ends
algorithm requires linear space so that
means that if you run this as a
streaming algorithm in a buffer with the
traditional algorithms you might blow up
the server if you send the wrong string
so that's not good
so for a go we implemented an order and
algorithm it's as I know the first
implementation out there it's slightly
different semantics and original unicode
strings but the Unicode standard does
allow for it
they say the disadvantage of it is you
cannot make it secure but they're wrong
you actually can make it secure this
secure implementation so and you know
blowing up servers is not secure so what
you want so as far as I know this is
still the only implementation so don't
want to focus on this too much at this
point of time but go like API so this is
sort of how it will look like to do
encodings or normalizations it's if you
compare it to some of the other guys
quite simple so another thing that was
completely rethought is language
identification so you know most people
just take the first two letters of a bcp
47 tag or however they want to call it
and then you know compare it to what
other language do I have to mention and
then be happy except that this skips
over a lot of lot of different things so
so most of the implementations out there
aren't quite that good internally within
Google we had a pretty nice one which
the go implementation is based on but
improved and this is not being exported
into the Java implementation I still
think the go on is better it's it's you
know where we're sort of converging on
it I'm debating with Mark Davis all the
time like you know how we should do this
but so go is in in other words it's
leading with this whole language
matching thing so to give you some
examples that is not not trivial so if
somebody asks for swiss-german
specifically language koji is w you be
very fine to Serfdom german if a german
ask for german and you serve them swiss
german they will not be quite as happy
so the official language code for men
are in a c MN but everybody uses CH you
kind of have to know that Croatian
matches s are Latin although it's I
think
they might've remove
and Golden Portuguese is closer to
European Portuguese and Brazilian
Portuguese so like all these kind of
things you have to know this is all
baked in like if you just use the
language matter nobody you know you
don't have to worry about the stuffs all
taken care of it's actually much more
complicated than this but I won't bother
you with it so now this is a little bit
the interesting thing like a little bit
the latest development if you will so
live localization API is basically
replacing or translating strings within
your application
let's say so so what's the problem there
so even if you look at a lot of the file
format for translations they're very
sort of English centric if you will
right they they only lie allow
pluralization and maybe only one in a
string which is the common case but
still writes but for French had already
breaks down so here we have an example
so in English this is you know person
went to work in French this basically
means you know you know you don't only
need plural for this you actually I mean
you also need a gender for this so off
the lists for example so so in get text
your salt basically so what else so
basically I see you as a solution for
this it's an extension I think it was
developed within Google so the problem
here so so here it works right like at
the bottom line you have the ICU
representation for the French
translation there's two problems for
this so you kind of want the for English
the programmer to to encode this as well
so you basically force the programmer to
become a linguist that they have to sort
of know like which things to pass and
you force a linguist to become a
developer so this also has its drawbacks
it's actually a much nicer formalism
that you might think it's it's very
compact I'll give them that but it's not
it's it's not you know like it's it's a
little bit complicated so the point what
I wanted to do in go so this is still
very premature but the whole the whole
design of the go framework is that
to make it as easy as possible for for
the linguists to to add whatever
attributes they need to add but also to
allow tooling to make it the the
translator simple right so it's all
assumes that I can programmatically
expand all these different like like
sentences and you know derive basically
which which verbs I need to you know I
can replace which works to compact the
translations as much as possible I have
a linguistics background as well so that
helps here a little bit but this is very
futuristic all but I can see that you
know years down the line you can make
much better translation tools so this
has been enzyme designed with that in
mind based way
so how would it look like and go for
example so like here you at the bottom
you see a possible translation where you
can say well I want to use so I know I
have to use this French verb here and it
depends on you know like the the
linguistic features of group so it knows
it needs plurals that can derive the
fluorophore that can derive the the
gender for it so this seems like a
little bit too magical but in the NGO
framework it's actually has been
designed this way so if you pass the
list it will know okay it has a
cardinality if the elements in the list
have genders that know what it means to
derive the linguistic gender gender from
a list which is different for each
language but a data all exist and see
all they are it's just you know most
frameworks just don't use it yet but the
data is available here's another example
doesn't really matter on the left hand
you have an ICU string for a very
complicated example where I do think in
this case a programmer should probably
program it instead of having any
translation strings but on the right you
see how this can be encoded today in in
go codes actually so this is again like
if you have some framework that's you
know can figure out what to do you can
actually program it on the go code and
the go code is actually shorter than the
ICU string which is also kind of
interesting so I see you actually allows
you to do a lots however it is still not
powerful enough so this is not a problem
so this is
so if you look at for example spelling
out number so writing three s the word
three instead of the number three
so in English you can do that in two
different ways you can look at the
Cardon cardinal numbers or ordinal
numbers and so so Cardinals just one and
ordinal is first right so if you look at
it and this is like nicely defined as a
bunch of our BNF rules for you know one
category for each or one list for each
so if you look at polish though like
just at cardinality this is the number
of rules right like each of them has
this whole expansions so in yellow you
can hardly read it but it's all the
linguistic properties that it might
depend on so you know it can be genitive
personal days of active elements or
whatever instrumental located so all
these different properties depends on
the context of the sentence right so
basically somehow the link the
translator will need to say you know
like okay this is this is a this number
that you're rendering here needs to be
you know is it's it's accurate if within
this context so as I said the framework
has been designed in a way so that you
could use like grammars or whatever to
drive this automatically and then inject
it right which in ICU is a little bit
more more tricky but you could do that
kind of stuff so maybe we can automate
this in the future but anyway it's it is
possible to pass this kind of stuff
along so an another key feature in doing
this is that if you substitute numbers
instead of formatting your number in
some number formatter and then
substituting it in the string you
specify what is the type of numbers that
scientific engineering is it's a ordinal
whatever and then you substitute it and
then the decision on how to render it is
dependent on the context which it
substituted in the very last moment
right so in practice it turns out that
choosing your format strength depends on
the number yes but how to format a
number depends on the format string that
you choose so it's actually cyclic the
dependency which drove me nuts for a
very long time so couldn't break out of
the loop so this is some of the design
characteristic
yeah so basically I think I discussed
most of this it's not that interesting
let me just skip this I also discussed
this already so I want to go down to the
demo so I'm going over this a little bit
fast so late decision I already
mentioned this so if you look at the
current status of packages this is it so
if you look at the internationalization
part so preparing your and tooling
around your application for you know
like like allowing multiple languages
it's pretty far along for the actual
pipeline of you know feeding your
messages into a pipeline getting it back
that's under active development right
now so dates are not implemented it's
working on it
so the numbers are just implemented so
you know gender is designed almost there
by tie is like this close to being done
but I don't think anybody will ever need
it's beyond what we have now so I'm just
really reluctant to implement it
segmentation is a big thing in the buts
so I'm trying to see if the Unicode guys
can release the data at a low level
instead of this super high level which
would make life a lot easier so a little
demo of what is possible today is gonna
work now let me see yes so I have this
little server here which basically
prints the number of days till Christmas
very simple go server so I have here
maybe I should make a little bit bigger
huh and so I've here like you know
compute the number of days I have some
options there so here's the little you
know like HTML template and then very
simply like I create the sentence that I
will substitute in the template and then
I will run that so let's see what it
does right now so here we go you get
this
so let's go to a browser okay so we have
this there's 25 days till Christmas so
just to show you this if you have a
really large number it looks like this
so not nothing too fancy right so so
let's try to let's try to localize this
now or so the first thing I will need to
do is as I said I will need to do a
language metric so the basic pipeline
here is to say I need to do some
instrumentation anyway so so I'll just
implement it right now and after I've
done that I used the nice go
instrumentation like guru and types
analysis and all that stuff to then
figure out what needs to be changed
based on what I've just done so let's
let's see how that looks so so basically
I need to create a message printer it's
new printer it's called this is so what
does it want it want a language tag
because I need to specify the language
so usually what we do is we say we get
accept language so this is a normal
thing to do but really I want to be able
to - I'm not actually going to use that
so so basically let's say I want to have
- Lang here that they're just gonna pass
on the line and then there's this little
thing this is not checked in yet but you
know it's very handy
so and then it complains that this is
not use yet but that's the point so
basically the idea is that wherever I'm
using format strings and it will this is
not implemented but the idea is that it
will use this data flow to get also
constant strings that can possibly be
passed through this you know printer
name but right now wherever it uses from
it and and you know where where's the
printer in scope I will now localize
this automatically so one thing you
should know there if you look at format
printf here as uses a style of you know
creating sentences which is really not
conducive for localization so to
interleave strengths with substitute you
know arguments this is not really how
you should do it so let's see how this
is solve so we'll stop the little
program then we do go rewrites and not
go of course let's go text yes that does
something so I'll just change it in
place yes so it gives us a little error
that P was declared and not used that is
correct
we just happily ignore that and then if
we now look at the dips here so we can
see my changes and then here it replaced
the formats sprint with a piece friends
F so you really should use the f4 for
local is localizing strings and it
actually rewrote it to use substitution
arguments and then put all the arguments
at the end right so this is all done
automatically so let's let's see what
happens now so if you run it now
so nothing much changed but maybe what
if we use the thousands oh right so now
there's a comb all of a sudden so even
though we haven't provided any
translations that already does the you
know proper formatting of numbers based
on the language so we got that for free
at least but that's not enough so now
now what I want to do is I want to
extract the strings so there's not many
there we go so I want to extract the
strings and I'm also telling I want to
localize for English German Dutch and
Bengali just because my knowledge is
more interesting so I generated a bunch
of files to save some some effort I will
copy some of the you know translated
ones locally am I doing that correctly
wasted demo right yes I think so so
let's just see how they look like so I
have some messages here so this is this
is the basic one that's being generated
it has the original placeholders you can
see that basically it replaces so for
the translators this is the string the
translators will see so to replace this
all the printf substitutions with you
know these these nicer little elements
so it derives the names from the
variable names the type names there's
all these kind of jurist exterminate so
right now the key is the it's the
message what you can also do so most
frameworks say you can just use a you
know some nice or some code it's string
with a number here you can actually
refer to a constant and it will use the
constant identifier right so at the
language level as the key so it also
rewrites the substitutions to use like
like explicit argument
all kinds of stuff so that even if you
reorder it it can be substituted back
nicely so if you see some of the
translation files so here I have one in
Dutch in English okay Bengali so Muslim
are one sentence so let's see what this
does so I first need to as we want this
static binary I'll generate a catalog
this works and then and then like run
this thing again so let's see what this
does so so I know if an exclamation mark
so that changed but basically if I now
say I want my lang I want the Dutch
language all sudden I get it in Dutch
numbers are differently formatted if I
want to get it in Bengali it looks like
this with these illegible like mangani
numbers and look at the comma setting
they have these locks things right so
they go by a hundred thousand set of a
million very interesting and then the
English one is also kind of interesting
so if I now go back so let's do the more
this is today so but what for example if
we are one day away ah then it does this
so those of us the whole plural thing so
the encoding for debts you can see right
here right it's so this is basically
just adjacent format it's pretty generic
this is not meant to be the files that
you actually use for translations so the
ideas that you have encoders that write
2x live pio files get text or you know
whatever l 20 m and converted back but
this is sort of the inter lingua that's
go uses with all the you know like
low-level information so so what I want
to do right now is to build this whole
pipelining infrastructure library that
any of the tools that are already out
there can use
or other tools I'll trade a simple toy
to myself right so that people can start
localizing more effectively so let's go
back to this thingy really only have
some references so that's it pretty much
are there any questions yes no you don't
and actually right now they're generated
so most of the applications of multiple
steps right for generation extraction of
whatever so the rewrite is a one-time
thing right you don't usually do that
but what I basically want to get at the
stuff one command which is just Buddha's
ago generated in your main file right
and then it does both the extraction and
the integration whatever so leaving the
intermediate extraction files wouldn't
be generated right only the things that
need to be sent to the translator
whatever whatever that is yes so the
problem is you have multiple attempts of
this mozilla as a new standard or as
fluent and you have this l 20 and
language which is quite nice it's pretty
elaborate
they even solve the passing the the
higher linguistic properties like down
right the problem there is again that
it's a very complicated formalism right
so what you really want is something
that that really dumps it down right or
at least have a have a tool that can
sort of manage that complexity HIDA to
the translator so it's really something
you need to design with in unison with
tools and formalisms but so there are
formulas UM's that support all this
right but then you have to find
translators that can work with it but
yeah I mean one if you can wait right
like one thing you could do is you could
say okay I have you know I know I need
to expand to all these you know
different different senses these are all
the variants possible so let's have two
of them translated get them back try to
generate all of them and have them
translators correct them again right so
that's one thing if the tools don't
support it right like the expansion in
comparison that's one thing you could do
for example for other languages yeah
yeah I understand that so yeah I've been
asked to sort of back port for example
to normalization algorithm back into the
unicode standards I just said just put a
link to the library right and go but
like it's a yeah I don't know like if so
I'm doing all these packages myself
right like the entire Suites basically
like 50 50 percent of my time also while
doing also other things like like you
know whatever other go stuff so it is
going pretty slowly so the advantage of
doing it all you can actually see the
connection between everything right and
try to design something in unison so
there's an advantage to doing it but I
just don't have bent with anymore to
like write too much of this up right in
official documents but so what does work
though is like for example the language
matching I'm really iterating with Mark
Davis one of the main unicode guys right
so to sort of come to a you know middle
way between the job and the go
implementation so yeah so that happens
any other questions all right thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
