hello hi welcome to a tech talk by Kevin
Kelly this this uh talk is going to be
available on Google video and so ask
that you hold questions that are
proprietary at all to Google until the
end of the talk so Kevin Kelly is well
known around the world as the editor in
chief of the whole earth review and is
the author of the book out of control
the new biology of machines social
systems and the economic world today mr.
Kelly shares his ideas on the future of
science and the scientific method he's
come to the right place because Google
has an important role to play in the
future of science join me with a warm
welcome for mr. kevin kelly thank you
it's a real pleasure being here in
addition to being editor and publisher
of a obscure magazine called the whole
earth review I was also one of the
cofounders of Wired magazine and for the
five or ten years that Wired was the
center of the universe it really felt
great and being here at Google feels
like that again it feels like I'm at the
center of the universe again and I use
that in a kind of metaphorical way but
also in a very real sense i define the
center of the universe as that place
whether it's the least resistance to new
ideas and I feel that in some ways this
is the center of the universe and it's a
real privilege to be talking at a place
where there's probably the least
resistance to new great ideas and what I
want to spend a few minutes this
afternoon talking about is something
that I think is very important but gets
very little attention and that is is the
nature of the scientific method and I'll
start there and I'll kind of end up at
some cosmic level I hope you kind of go
on for the journey I think that it may
have some bearing to what you're doing
in the long term so in addition to also
running the
co-founding Wired magazine and being
editor for many years I also AM in one
of the small group of people who have
been pioneering long-term thinking we
have foundation called the long now
foundation among other things we're
trying to build a clock that ticks for
10,000 years and the idea that clock is
to serve as an icon and encouragement to
think long term so what I'm trying to do
a little bit in this talk is also take a
very long term of view of things rather
than just thinking of the last five
years the next five years I'm trying to
stretch our perspective and go back a
thousand years and maybe look forward to
50 years it's kind of a symmetrical but
it's the best I can do in terms of the
future so what's interesting about
science is that science is the only
thing that generates news science is
really the only news if you pick up a
paper most of the stuff that's happening
is not really news it's just kind of a
repetition a little bit of a recycling
but science is is the thing that
generates real news what's interesting
about the news that generates is that
their office often novel and when we
tend to think of the long-term history
of say scientific method of science we
tend to think of the inventions that
science generates and as an exercise we
sent a questionnaire around to a bunch
of scientists around the world and said
what's the most important scientific
inventions in the last thousand years or
the last 2,000 years and you come up
with a list and you can make your own
list but some of the nominations for the
most important scientific inventions are
the most important inventions over the
last couple thousand years was oops
incoming how does this work here it was
hey
the hay was actually the most important
this was actually Freeman Tyson's idea
where that actually encouraged
cultivation of domesticated animals
which led to protein which leads to
longer lifespan etc civilization so
that's one another one is on antibiotics
that was a really interesting and great
important invention in the history of
the world paper who could argue against
paper and of course it's ancillary in
the technology printing that was
obviously a very important thing the
rudder allowed navigation of the world
and a sense of the whole world encourage
trade so so that was also very important
and electricity obviously another very
interesting thing once we harnessed the
electrons all kinds of other great and
wonderful things happened now what's
important about that is that these are
you can make your own list and that
these are different inventions but I'm
actually not really concerned about that
because science makes news but we very
rarely look at science itself the method
that which these things come about and
that's what I'm really trying to do and
so if you actually suggest to someone
that the method that we know of as
science today is still changing and that
in fact the method of the scientific
method may in fact be very different 50
years man that is today this is the kind
of reaction you normally get because
when we talk about the long-term trend
of the scientific method I find that
people are very puzzled this is sort of
like science changing the science will
be different in 50 years the scientific
method and I think it will and so what I
want to do is kind of take a quick tour
through the evolution of the scientific
method in the past and interesting when
I went to to to look at this I found
that basically there was there was there
is no literature on this there is no
there's no
about the history of scientific method
and for something so fundamental you
would you would expect that but there
isn't so I sort of cobbled these
together and I'm going to go through
very quickly just to give you a sense of
sort of some of the things that I think
are important and one of the patterns
that you'll see I hope is that this is a
lot about information we have the idea
of indexing and cataloging books have
been around for a long time and then you
have this idea of indexing or cow
logging information so or you have a
book that is the index to the other
books and so they actually some of the
great inventions in the history of
scientific method work was the idea of
alphabetical index was idea of having an
index in a book was the idea of having a
catalog to all the books in your library
then there was the collaborative
encyclopedia where you had more than one
author more than one expert coming
together sharing information and in such
a way that it was all catalog and
indexed there was later on several
hundred years later there was the first
laboratories where they began to do
experiments actually trying to observe
and measure and record those
observations we had the invention of
observational tools like the telescope
in the microscope which greatly enlarged
the scientific method because I love
with some other people believe that the
tools of science actually move science
more than any other discoveries of
science that in fact the way in which
you have progress is by the creation and
progressive improvement of tools then we
had this is Elliot of order we have the
controlled experiment which was Francis
Bacon's idea that one needed to have
controls to do an experiment they have
controls there was a society of experts
that began to share the information and
the observations that were making so
began to actually have kind of a peerage
and then there was
oops we got cut off I have problem here
this is a Bolton's idea of that in order
to do that the real science require that
you be able to repeat an experiment that
someone else should also be able to do
it at the same time that you are peer
review where they began to actually send
out their observations and have them
peered reviewed bought by people who
knew about it and could either give them
a credibility or verification and then
this is Newton's hypothesis prediction
which actually he was making a
prediction making up offices about
something and making a prediction of you
should find data at some point
falsifiable testability poppers idea
that what really counts in terms of a
prediction is whether it can be
falsified that that's the sort of
criteria by would you judge a hypothesis
then Fisher in the random I design he
was involved with statistical analysis
bringing statistics into the design of
an experiment the placebo somebody
actually had invent that that was not an
obvious an idea it took many years it
was actually fairly late in coming 1937
before their first placebo experiment
was done and computer simulations I'll
talk a little bit more about that began
very early almost as soon as computers
were invented they began to do
simulations and then the double-blind
refinement where you actually have both
the observer and the patient not know
about the experiment and finally I think
a very landmark moment was where science
began to study itself where the
scientific method became is subject
worthy of the scientific approach so
what's one of the things is interesting
about this is I began to think about
what about China now the thing about
China is
that it did not discover science but if
you take a list of all the technological
inventions that China made it's
phenomenal and actually very unknown in
this culture most of the technologies
that China discovered they discovered
not just a few years before the West but
often on average maybe 500 years to a
thousand years before the West
discovered it was very independent and
yet they did not originate science and
what was missing well firstly give me
here are some examples of the things
that actually were discovered in China
paper printed gunpowder compass the
rudder the stirrup broke crops iron plow
wheelbarrow cast iron vaccinations the
chain drive suspension bridge they were
using petroleum and natural gas as fuel
again thousands at least hundreds of
years before the West came to this and
actually going back to to Francis Bacon
Francis Bacon when he began the
scientific method said believed that
that for inventions had more impact on
science at his time this is around the
1600s than anything else he said more
these for inventions which were paper
printing gunpowder and the compass he
said transformed our world far more than
any religious belief far more than any
political or war whirring conquering
nation that that those for inventions
which he said whose origins are unknown
where the transforming powers in his
world and he died before he discovered
that all four of those inventions came
from China now so widened to Chinese
invent science and there is actually no
easy answer this a man and Joseph
nederland divided divided devoted his
entire life to trying to answer this
question and it's now called Annie bloom
question which is how could science
technology which was so far advanced in
China for so long
how come China did not actually go all
continue going that way and actually
come up with a scientific method and the
answer is as I said are very complicated
there's there's numbers of strands to it
part of it has to do with an inability
to separate political and inquiry the
religious and inquiry and a sense of
maybe valuing other things besides a
quest for truth as as a proper form of
Investigation all those kinds of rap
together to lead to what happened was
was that there was one discovery that
China didn't make and that discovery was
this the scientific method of discovery
so it was just you can go a long way
with creating novelties actually having
progress by developing new ideas without
the scientific method but the scientific
method is the best way to do discovery
and once you make that discovery you're
off on a different course so I tend to
think of science as a structure of
information that allows discovery as in
fact as a structure of discovery and
this is just a kind of a mapping of a
citation indexing this is a mapping of
what they used to call in library
science citation indexing which we would
now think of as almost as a type of page
ranking of scientific discovery so they
would look at the whole of all the
citations that were referenced in the
footnotes of the paper and if you
extract out a map of those backward
links you would get something like a
clustering of those journals or those
individuals who were cited the most
basically that were linked to the most
and this work was done by Eugene
Garfield in the 40 50 s in Philadelphia
and it was somewhat the inspiration that
Larry and Sergey looked at for their
page rank and if you take this structure
of
discovery just as an example and think
about it as a way of structuring
knowledge and information as a way of
knowing that that's the view that want
to bring into what science is it's a way
of knowing more importantly it's
actually a way that we change how we
know and I think I hope to end up with
return to that idea that in fact it's
not just the process of discovery it's
the process of how we change how we
discover because there is a second order
it's a second order Delta in science
it's not just studying things learning
new things it's changing how we learn
new things it's learning how we learn
new it has that recursive sense in it
and that think that's really crucial
because is that recursive pneus that
actually gives us generative power
almost all the things that we find
interesting in the world have a sort of
paradoxical recursive nature at the
bottom they are self organizing their
self referential you come right down to
it they make this sort of paradoxical
pointing back to themselves so the
question is what's the next 150 years of
science I mean what is it really right
what is it really what people really
want to know is what are we going to
have flying cars right now they don't
interested in the science and
information they wouldn't know when
we're going to flying cars when are we
getting robots that talk back to us that
can tell us they're smarter than we are
and when we're going to have virtual
reality and and things where we can just
interface by thinking or by gesturing
well I'm not going to tell you about
those because I don't know and my point
is that those are just individual
novelties those are just examples like
the Chinese of just making new things
like hey or penicillin they aren't
really about the structure of how we
discover things are so what I want to
try and talk about
some speculations on the ways in which
the scientific method itself may change
and rap not so much the particular ideas
or inventions that it might throw up so
the first set well first i'm suggesting
that science will actually change more
in the next 50 years and it has in the
past 400 years if we know anything about
the kinds of trends and curves that we
see that the actual structure of the
scientific method will change more the
next 50 years in last 400 years and if
you believe that then you have to go
along with me in trying to think about
ways in which that might happen and i
think and basically this will be the
context of what i'm trying to suggest is
that most of this would be in the realm
in which you all work which is it in the
structuring of information and knowledge
that's what this is going to be about so
i might say that google is about
changing the structure of the scientific
method in the next 50 years so too one
thing that we know about is going to be
a bio century and here let me explain
what I mean by that right now biology
this year as the most funding the most
scientists is generating the most
results that are published it has the
most economic value it's the most
ethically important or relevant in terms
of the kinds of questions that it
generates and it is the most to learn
let me explain that last one a little
bit the living world the biological
world basically has had four billion
years of learning every day there's
information being generated by
biological systems that's being recorded
in genomes of these organisms throughout
the world not just the single ones of
course but even individual is is its in
its being embedded into the very
ecological systems that we have is a
vast
amount of knowledge and information if
you compare that to physics physics it's
the same is pretty universal there are
deep mysteries about the physics and
understanding of what's underneath the
hood in our universe but the amount of
information in physics is actually very
small the amount of information that's
embedded in biology is huge and that's
one of the reasons why this is at its
point right now where it's become the
biggest science that we have and will
continue to be at least for the next 50
years there is so much to learn it's so
deep it's so structured it's so complex
and so the biggest mother lode of
information and data in the next 50
years in science in terms of
understanding it is in biology third
computers are leaving the third way of
science and I'll take a few minutes to
tell you what i mean by the third way
traditional understanding of science was
there has two parts there was a Baathist
and measurement observation and theory
those two went hand in hand and you kind
of try to keep them in balance you might
have a weird idea and you go out looking
for data that was okay or you might
start with the data and try to come up
with a theory but the two of them
together we're kind of like the the two
feet of science and this is how the
understanding of science work that you
needed to have theories that would
predict makeup offices that predict data
that you would find and you would had to
have theories that were based in some
ways that would explain the data that
you had and you try to let neither one
outrun the other but you had a kind of a
two-faced aspect of science that
required both so in the measurement side
what's happened is is that nothing
really nothing that I can think of
nothing that anyone else didn't think of
is growing faster on this plant and
information it is the fastest growing
entity on this planet how very in whom
you're familiar with
did a study of how much information in
the world and he and peter calculated
that it was growing at sixty-six percent
a year physical production there may be
Spice the ipod's may grow at the rate of
two hundred percent for a couple of
years but if we talk about anything on
the terms of a decade or longer there is
nothing that we're making that's
anywhere near the growth rate of
information so information right now is
the largest growing thing on this planet
and if you take a chart of the kind of
data volume over time in the beginning
most of the most of the advances were
coming through increased precision and
then after a while we had increase in
the spectrum in which we could measure
things who you know we had in the
beginning just what we could see then
there were things that we could see
through a microscope or telescope then
we increase the sources we could measure
things through a thermometer we can
measure other things that we couldn't
see and then over time we hit durations
in which we can measure them all the
time for instance we can measure them
longer periods of time constantly day
and night for years and what's happening
now I think is that of course we're
adding these technological senses around
the world so we're basically generating
huge huge volumes of information all the
time in real time constantly every realm
everywhere around the earth so I call
this silly onyx Zilly onyx is the the
field and what you're dealing with it
zillions of things once you get into
zillions a lot of the tools that we have
break down and we're trying to invent
ways in which to deal with Z lien and
science of course is generating zillions
of bits of data these are just some
actually at this point kind of old
amounts but deal terabytes petabytes
exabytes we're headed there very fast
zilli onic bites at some point or other
on the other hand of hypothesis have how
we learn
the things one of the things that's
happening right now is in right now this
is done kind of with human minds very
very handcrafted but in fact we now have
ways to do a one type of science is
called multiple hypotheses instead of
trying to go through I have a cup
hospice about what may happen I'll try
that out try some things it doesn't work
okay I'll make another one is that you
actually make multiple simultaneous
apophysis in which you try to apply data
so hypothesis becomes something that is
becoming kind of mass phenomena rather
than just a single little thing you
handcraft and there are ways in which
you can actually try and manage multiple
hypotheses as a way to deal with
scientific discovery another way is
combinatorial search sweep and this is
what Stephen Wolfram did which is okay
the way you explore something is will
generate every possible variation of it
and we'll explore through that space and
by exploring that space of possibility
we'll know something about what that
thing is so he takes cas cellular
automata and they'll make every possible
CA and make the whole space of CA and go
through that trying to discern the
characteristics of the behavior of a CA
by exploring that possibility space well
we can do the same thing with other
things like with combinational libraries
exhaustive search they're using it in
biology right now they'll make every
possible variation of a protein will
make every possible variation of a
ceramic or chemical compound you just
explore the possibility space again
using robots to make up them's to test
them this is something that was not
possible before but we're basically
exploring this possibility space of
hypothesis by doing it exhaustively Inc
incumbent oriole exponential expansion
so chemistry compounds synthesis methods
you you make something new you make
every possible way of making it new and
you're you also generate hypotheses in
the same way every possible hypothesis
that could apply to the
those are the two standard pillars of
science observation hypothesis theory
but there is a third one and that's what
I want to talk about the third one is a
simulation or synthesis of those two you
synthesize something i call it nerd
culture and i did a little piece in
science magazine talking about that the
usual division of cultures that CP snow
talked about the two cultures humanists
and Humanities on one side and the
scientists on the other side this
humanists would explore the human
condition by creating a by kind of a pro
being an expression by I guess you might
say it examining the human condition and
and the scientists would do the same
thing by by measuring or probing the
third way of knowledge is the nerd way
and the nerd way is it you make
something so the way you study democracy
is not by getting in reading a lot of
books about it or by trying to measure
it the way you study democracy is you
make an artificial one you make your
virtual democracy the way you study your
mind is not to contemplate it to examine
it from all sides or to try and measure
little data points in the brain cell the
way you make the way you study mind is
you make an artificial mind that is the
nerd way is a way of doing things is
studying things and discover things by
creating them with simulations has a
little bit of that in it it generates a
lot of data here's a gamma baver
assimilation I mean this is huge
spinning off huge amounts of data and so
what what this suggests to us is that in
the data volume that most of the data in
the coming years is going to be
generated by our simulations of things
that's actually simulating in the things
that we make is actually going to
generate more than a natural world that
their efforts in science the science
itself will be generating more data than
the natural world measurement
do and so this these three I think
science now has a triad it's now a
tripod of three things it's data
measurement and simulation and those
three things together are becoming the
kind of core of all Sciences so you have
data which is being fed into the
simulation and assimilations creating
new data itself and then you have the
simulation which also is kind of a
theory basically assimilation is a
theory that's active it's an interactive
theory and so theory and simulations
become something that feed upon each
other and of course hypothesis and data
measurements insane and I think that in
this intersection of those three is what
I call deep science this is this new
science that it has increased data and
we can see this happening in different
three different or eight hearsay complex
adaptive science where you have
continuous real-time measurement which
is also being simulated in real time
feeding back to the real-time
measurements the simulation itself
creating a continuous search in real
time for hypothesis which is going on
and then pop this is of course guiding
the creation and measurement of data we
can imagine the same thing happening in
say Health Sciences we have a person who
is generating you have sensors in that
person then they're generating in real
time all kinds of information which is
being simulated in real time and that
simulation is course itself is feeding
into the hypothesis and so the three of
them working together becomes this new
science of simulation hypothesis and
measurement and of course we can imagine
it happening say in the ecological
natural world where we're looking at the
real data from nature we're simulating
at the same time in real time we're
generating real-time hypothesis which
are again guiding our measurements and
our simulations this is deep science so
this is the third way of science where
the computer
becomes very involved in our method of
discovery it's the third way of science
or not I mean it's scary because it has
computers at the center and we're always
careful about that so the last thing I
want to talk about science is that it
actually will be creating a new way of
knowing wiki science is one possibility
the editors of nature told me that
they're expecting to get the first
thousand author paper this summer okay
so that's it that's a traditional
science we can imagine wiki science
where there is an ongoing document an
ongoing scientific journal article
that's never done is constantly being
updated it has thousands of contributors
around the world it's open-ended and
it's constantly in flux that's the
nature of adaptive knowledge another
suggestion is compiled negative results
right now negative results are thrown
away from the most part there is one
obscure journal that actually has just
started to try and report negative
results but ignore results can be far
more informative than the positive
results did normal either throw it away
they're not revealed and there's
actually move right now to require in
medical studies that acquire that the
negative results be reported and the way
they're doing that is you're saying that
you can't you can't they won't the
generals will not publish this the the
medical article of your final results
unless you register with them to
indicate that you've done the early
negative results so they're hinging the
final results of your study being
published on the fact that you actually
are going to catalogue and report your
negative results
may our computer proofs is another
example in which this is the packing
packing camp off business i think it was
Kepler did it suggested at first it was
not proof until recently and it required
an AI helped to actually make the
mathematical proof and we're going to
see more and more of that as well and
triple blind emergent trials this is the
idea that you can actually do scientific
studies ad hoc by taking real-time data
imagine if you have a large population
of people you have 24-hour sensory
information from their body temperature
all kinds of things and you basically
extract out of that large amount of data
afterwards you sort out the controls
afterwards so that neither the observer
nor the researcher nor the scientist
actually is aware that there's a
experiment going on experiment happens
after the fact by taking large numbers
of variables and extracting out the ones
that you want to use and consider as
controls then so finally distribute
experiments is another example study at
home other examples where we we're
taking very small amounts of information
and measurements distributed over time
not centralized and using those
measurements to actually correlate and
aggregate them and that's another way
and then the final way is the return of
the subjective and this has to do with
Sciences long-term trend in terms of
becoming objective and refusing to
consider the subjective when we get down
to fundamental questions like the origin
of the universe things like this and
quantum mechanics we begin to find that
in fact you cannot easily remove the
observer and that you actually have to
account for the observer as part of the
experiment and we don't have very good
tools for for dealing with that right
now and so what we're going to do in the
next 50 years has also learn how to
tolerate and manage the subjective in
science so those are some speculations
on the next 50 years of science but I'd
like to end my talk with just one last
thing which is what I think science
means I think science actually creates a
new level of meaning and one of the
interesting things about emergent
systems is that they're actually what's
happening is that a new level of meaning
comes out of the small parts that were
at the lower level and so if you go back
to my diagram of the scientific
clustering of information and citations
we can also imagine this web of the
internet which is one of the more
current versions of the traffic on the
Internet the different countries are
different colors I think North America
is blue but this is a recursive map this
is a map where things are touching back
to itself this is a structure of
information we can imagine each of those
nodes on there as being different
species we can match them being
different technologies we can imagine
them being different methods of
Investigation different styles of
discovery and we can also imagine this
as one machine and so what I'm
suggesting is is that we have science
right now the way we're hooking up stuff
is that it's actually one very large
machine and I decided to actually treat
this as one machine so i said if this
was really one machine what would it
look like I'm sorry for this bad
formatting but it has a billion pc chips
this machine is right now standing 1
million emails per second 1 million IM
messages per second date terabytes per
second of traffic 65 billion phone calls
it's a huge machine and in fact if you
were to spec this machine out and try to
sell on amazon is the processor is God
billion chips it's got one megahertz
email I got one megahertz web search 10
kilohertz
is it messaging and 1 kilohertz SMS
that's a very big machine it's a very
very powerful machine and this is quite
the aggregate of all the all the chips
and all the machines in all the world
we've created one large machine bus
speed of 10 terabytes ran with tuna
terabytes storage exabytes because these
are all going off the edge just as we
speak but the idea is is that is that
that is the machine that we're now
programming for we're not programming
for your laptop or not programming for
your cell phone we're programming for
this machine that is the thing that
we're doing and the other thing about
this is that if you take a biological
view it's very close to the complexity
of a human mind a human brain i should
say it's got a quintillion triste
transistors and if you take all the
transistors and all the pcs in the world
there's somewhere quit chilean of them
operating right now they're all live
it's got it you know I got one trillion
on the web the web has one trillion
synapses 1,000,000,000,000 links 20
pedda hurts synapse firings that's the
speed it has a hundred billion clicks
per day so it's a very large brain so we
are this machine because if we add them
to that web machine our own brains it
was we sit behind it as we guide the
clicks and as we interface if you add
the collective intelligence of the 1
billion people online right now it's a
very large machine it's a very smart
machine ok and so one of the questions
that people have is well what are we
going to you know we got take off is
there a singularity about to happen and
I think that I think there is but i
think it's not in the way that Greg
Kurzweil and other people would believe
in a sense that there's going to be a
rapture or people left behind I really
like this is one of my favorite new
yorker cartoon sucessor the following
paradigm shifts occurred while you were
out
I don't think that happens where we kind
of we will notice things in fact I think
what's happening is that it will go
through this without really noticing it
in this same way hey did anyone knows
we're using language there was never
that conversation but people never SAT
around a campfire and said hey you know
actually we're talking talking yeah no
no you that language obviously was a
singularity but we pass through it
without really noticing and I think the
same thing is going to happen with this
process so we're it's what is giving us
what technology gives us is
possibilities people often say
technology and creates as many problems
as a solvent actually i think it is true
but each of those problems is actually a
possibility and what it gives us is
possibilities so differences diversity
options these are the things that
technology creates and it's a great
bargain all of us will always go for
that so each of these nodes in this
network is actually possibilities this
is a possibility space and that's what
technology is creating it's an infinite
game and the idea is to keep the game
going so if you can imagine for a moment
then go being born before the technology
of oil paints was invented or Mozart
being born before the piano was invented
or maybe Hitchcock being born before the
technology of the film was have ended so
there are people alive today who's
technology has not yet been invented
who's who's perfect means for their
great genius has not yet been invented
and I think we have a moral obligation
to actually create those possibilities
so that everybody in the world has a
potential to really really use what
they've been born with and so that those
possibilities that quest for the
possibilities is really what technology
is about and I think that's why we're
here and why what you're doing at Google
is so great because we're trying to play
the infinite game thank
so I'll take questions if people have
them waiting back
that doesn't bother me situated but I
think
colleges
separate science
like that do you
I don't distinguish as much as I
probably should but as I did suggest
earlier I think science is changed much
more by its tools than anything else and
so the tool part of science is as
important as anything and is definitely
part of the scientific method so we can
change science by creating tools that
either measure or a science becomes more
and more information driven the tools of
information become as important as
anything else and so that's why a search
engine I would make on that list of some
of the most important scientific method
inventions in the point that some of the
most important methods invention of
scientific method is the search engine
because it's a tool and it is so
technology but it's actually not as
divorce as just other strategies so I
think there is a difference but not as
much as some people think yeah
right
later partisan
part of the door
so let me repeat the question for those
in the back the question was well
science is very important but scientists
themselves are not rewarded usually as
much as say other people who may be
involved in technology for instance yeah
I think that's I think that's bad I mean
I think would be better if we reward
them more and I think some of the move
towards in universities to have
scientists partake in their inventions
through patent arrangements is one way
in which society has been trying to
reward scientists but I think in general
they aren't is rewarded my wife is a
scientist she works at genatech she's a
scientist there so I know that
scientists like teachers don't get the
same reward as they should and i also
say are often really badly portrayed in
movies I mean I just infuriates me to
see someone wearing a white lab coat and
being crazy like you know I began this
in terms of back to the future so so
yeah scientists don't get the respect
they should and I don't know if there's
a mechanism to remedy that other than
you know a scientists tonight so I right
here
is there an asymptotes to the
is there an asymptote to the amount of
information humans can reach actually
this is another little talk but I
believe that what science really
generates is not knowledge but in
ignorance a really good question a
really good question is a question that
would generate more questions than it
answers okay so every time every time we
have a really good answer it will
generate two or three more questions and
I think of those questions as
possibilities and so in a certain sense
while the amount of information is being
increased our ignorance is actually
increasing faster we have far more
ignorance now than we did 400 years ago
we have fought we have far more
questions we have for more things we
want to know about and we realize we
don't know about than we did and so in a
certain says what science is actually
trying to do is expand the frontier
space I often think of it like friction
you know while the the new economy was
supposed to increase decrease friction
so we have a frictionless economy it did
that but at the same time at the
frontier at the edges it was increasing
friction it was increasingly unknown and
so we actually are expanding the unknown
faster than we are answering it and I
think that is why that's that's because
those unknowns are all possibilities
those that those are things that we are
close enough they're adjacent the
adjacent possible is what Stuart Kaufman
calls it we now are close enough to see
that we don't know that and that
actually is expanding faster than what
we know so well I don't think there's a
NASA to come on that because each one of
those unknowns is more information so
it's infinite
Oh individually yes but but we're beyond
that I'm none of us at the time when any
individual knew everything that was long
gone this is you know this that big ball
that big machine collectively as
understanding things are and that as
that happens we will know as individuals
percentage-wise relatively less every
year less of all this known yeah right
yes
so the question is is that if
opportunities are expanding could we not
say that the opportunity costs also
expand and maybe even faster yes I think
it they do and when here's what here's
what I think one of the remedies is is
that we basically want AI we want we
want many many minds we want every
possible type of intelligence we want
more things seizing those opportunities
and so the cost will increase but part
of what the economy does is it always
drive things down at the center so you
have a core where the opportunity cars
are less where friction is less and at
the edges is which is our spar expanding
there's always friction and ignorance
and profit if you can figure that out
profit is related to friction okay
there's no profit at the frictionless
center is only profit in ignorance right
because you have information that no one
else has at the center where there's
friction listen everything is known
there's no profit because everybody
knows everything so so that that
expansion is always happening at the
edges where there is high opportunity
cost high friction high ignorance and
high profit
well I guess I've to answer two
varieties questions that's great thank
you for having me it's really been a
real pleasure thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
