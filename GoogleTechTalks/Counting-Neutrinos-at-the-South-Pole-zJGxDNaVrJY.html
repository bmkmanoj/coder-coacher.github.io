a talk on honey neutrinos at the South
Pole I was actually at PyCon and was it
may yeah I was it may and Keith gave
this talk there at PyCon and I'm i think
neutrino detection just physics in
general is pretty cool and but he was a
pike on giving a talk and what's
interesting is like not only is it like
at the hole physics aspect where you
detect neutrinos but also there's this
whole software aspect a lot of the
control code is written in Python as
well I guess that's why you got invited
for pike on and and so it's pretty cool
talk lots of good pictures and things
like that so I'll leave it off to you
guys to start up thanks for thanks for
coming hi so I'm mausoleum and I'm the
physicist in our to tag team some in
charge of the nerdy T part of a talk do
we have a little thing or just switch
here it's good so before I start let me
just talk about this first picture it's
an aerial of the South Pole actually
ripe you know at the 90 degrees south
and what you see in the middle is what's
called a drill come the big machinery
used to make the polls which Keith will
talk about in the is for our detector
it's mostly flat and and high over there
and fill describe more so we went all
the way there to build a neutrino
detector which is called ice cube and
and the first few minutes I'll spend
trying to explain the motivation for us
going that far to detect an elementary
particle so one of the main questions
that ice cube tries to address is what
are they what is the origin of the
cosmic rays so cosmic rays are actually
Oh big boot is you would all the time
hitting the earth from all directions
but their origin where they're actually
previews is still an open question there
are lots of theories but but no final
clues yet so they were discovered in
1912 as essentially the detectors are on
the ground and then from a in the
atmosphere and what we do know is what
they're made out of at least when
they're hitting the earth it's a whole
bunch of mostly protons and a smaller
nuclei gamma rays essentially photons
and electrons on and what's striking
about these cosmic rays is that span a
very large energy range that there is
all the way from you know meb mega
electron volt energies which is you know
small energies for for particles all the
way to these 10 to 20 electron volts
that that energy ten to the twenty
electron volts is equivalent to a tennis
ball going fast in what's striking is
that that amount of energy is coming in
a single particle so so the big question
is there what what they are out in outer
space that can accelerate a protein to
that that amount of energy so for these
cosmic rays we know that that some of
them has to be have to be produced in
the Sun there is also a pretty good
hypothesis that in supernova explosions
when they start collapses there is shock
waves and I can accelerate particles to
very high energies as well these things
says I've been speaking for 25 minutes
I'm sorry sorry of that so but as I said
the origin of these especially the
highest-energy cosmic rays is still
unknown in the in the in it's a mystery
that hopefully the neutrino observation
of the sky it can help answer now I'll
say a word as to how that happens but
before let me describe a little bit of
what the neutrino itself is so the the
neutrino is an elementary particle much
like the electron or quarks there was
originally in feared not not discovered
experimental II there was a process
called beta decay in which a proton and
electron come out and there was some
icing energy some experimenters could
not see the balance of the energy so so
the gentleman over here Wolfram poly in
1930 hypothesized that there was a
particle that was carrying away the
energy that was that was not observed in
the experiment so these neutrinos have
no charge unlike the electron so they
are neutral they have very tiny math and
they're going essentially we go through
kilometers or actually light-years of
material without interacting for the
most part just to even example billions
of them are actually going through every
person you know every centimeter square
all the time and to give you an idea how
often they actually do interact the
first professor I had an astrophysics a
gave this this numeron umber that that
about one neutrino / 70 years interact
in our body so there's a whole bunch of
them most of them just go through and
one of them instead of years will
interact and if you claim that's the
cause of death so there are lots of them
they rarely interact so what's the
challenge for the experimenter is making
detectors that are big enough and
sensitive enough that can see one of
these particles so big enough because
the fluxes are big but the interaction
probabilities are very small so
typically what's done and Keith will
show more and I'll say some is you use a
very large body of transparent material
a water or ice ice is the case of in the
case of ice cube for their detection now
why why try even look at the sky and
look for neutrinos well we have already
observed cosmic rays and and these
slides these flight tries to explain
that imagine do we have a pointer
actually I'm still kind of
no no it's okay this is another point
too right so imagine the object on the
on the far up left being a very distant
galaxy with some process inside that can
accelerate particles what typically is
accelerating these inside is a disease
charged particles because they are easy
to accelerate with electric fields and
magnetic fields you can push a particle
around so typically what you get is a
protons going from these objects the
protons however when they travel from a
far distance galaxy two hours they
undergo magnetic deflection so when they
get to earth they don't point back to
where they actually originated so they
essentially get isotope eyes and you
cannot tell what object nice guy made it
on the other hand protons if they
interact we can produce photons we call
them gamma rays when they're high energy
or neutrinos photons are good and that's
how we actually look at most of the sky
we look at photons of low and high
energy to get images and that's what we
get the most of information we know the
universe nowadays the disadvantage of
photons is if when you're looking at
very high energy such as in these
objects the photons don't travel
cosmological distances so you can learn
about the the vicinity of the of the
universe and not far away unlike
neutrinos neutrinos come out of the
source and they travel essentially nice
straight line and basically nothing
stops them not even the detector
unfortunately that's why you need these
large large detectors in with a little
bit of luck you catch a few so
essentially what we're trying to learn
is how these objects work and and if we
learn about where the neutrinos come
from that will point us to where these
cosmic rays of very high energies come
from because they are produced
essentially in the same location by the
way your most invited and welcome to
interrupt when something is not clear
just each in question
so here i have a few pictures all from
essentially photons that have been made
of the the you know objects in the
universe it's kind of a collage and you
cannot see very well maybe you see it
better on the on the on that monitor a
objects that are extragalactic sometimes
it could be like a big galaxy with a
huge massive hole in the middle black
holes are in the middle that accelerates
particles or objects that are more
nearby in our galaxy in which either you
have a large magnetic field or a fast
rotating start that can that can produce
acceleration of protons and does a
production of neutrinos so these this is
a collage to even idea the kind of
objects that when we look at the sky in
the neutrino sky we're hoping to see
neutrinos from these sources of which we
know something by having looked at the
photons that these sources in it and
just to give you a more specific example
is is here's an active galactic nuclei
which as I said is a the center of our
galaxy and there's a supermassive black
hole and that's all the way at the the
left top left of the picture and then it
produces jets where material gets
accelerated and where protons are
presumed to achieve these very large
energies that are cosmic rays are
measured to get at so they're very
bright there it can be very very far
away in are those those are some of the
best candidates for being producers of
neutrinos that were after so this is
kind of like the cosmic rays side of the
thing which is a question that it's a
long-standing astrophysics question
there is one another wrinkle of what
this neutrino detector can do which is
related to dark matter some of you may
have heard about dark matter that matter
is is essentially thought to be twenty
three percent of the mass of the
universe in a particle that we don't
know what it is so we're pretty ignorant
it's actual nature of the party well we
know it's there because of its
gravitational force so another thing
that a neutrino detector can do and
we're pursuing is trying to detect these
dark matter particles in some models
these dark matter particles would
accumulate in big objects such as the
Sun and then they would find a dark
matter particle with another dark matter
particle will annihilate and produce as
a byproduct entry nose so what we're
doing is looking to see in the direction
of the Sun where there are neutrinos
coming from the center of the Sun and so
of very high energy and so maybe a hint
that actually there is dark matter being
accumulated in there and then we will
give us hints out the nature of the dark
matter particle so going back to a what
you need to detect these these neutrino
particles so what you need is a as I
said because they interact very weakly
you need a very large volume of a
transparent medium a transparent why
because the neutrino comes in and it's
neutral does nothing but when it hits
and a nucleus of the material it will
produce a charged particle as a result
and when the charged particle travels
fast through a transparent medium will
make a little bit of light and is that a
little bit of light that we're trying to
detect with called Cherenkov light and
that's why what you are after is a large
transparent medium the other thing that
you need for a neutrino detectors to
work is good shielding against charge
cosmic rays neutrinos events are always
going to be very few who are the reasons
that I mentioned before so you need to
hide essentially from all the charged
particles that are hitting the earth all
the time so typically that forces you to
be one two three miles underground
actually the more the better to stay
away from from events that are not what
you're interested in so the typical
examples of what's used is a water deep
water preferably
and in the case of deep water you have
you can just go to the ocean to run an
experiment a deep lake such as the by
colic lake and the ex-soviet Union or
ice which is what I skew our experiment
uses so this is a slide that kind of
describes what happens to a new tree non
how we actually detected so imagine
these neutrino which is the particle
coming from the bottom right of your
screen coming through the earth
traversing all of the material of the
earth without having done anything and
with a little bit of luck interacting
near what's in the main side of the
picture near your detector so when that
interaction happens in one third of the
cases you get a particle called a new
one which is the charged particle that
travels long distances and as it travels
it makes that a little bit of light
which is shown is it blew over there I'm
colorblind but blue as the blue shade
over there and what you see as they as
the round objects in there and keep will
describe more our optical sensors that
are just trying to capture the little
bit of light and the time at which it
arrived their time you need to be able
to reconstruct a line out of those
points over of light arrival and when
you get a line you can then point back
to see what source in the sky that could
have originated at make sense so in the
actual implementation this is what the
IceCube neutrino detector looks at the
South Pole this is to get you an idea of
the dimensions they height actually let
me go it consists of 8 E string so each
line that goes vertically from the
surface at the South Pole to one and a
half miles deep they are instrumented in
the last one kilometer the where you see
the darker heavier lines yes
yes actually yeah so cheap is holding
until past is actually a bundle of 15
cables each of them leaves four of these
optical modules that are put a distance
there's 17 meters apart each and each
one can tell when a photon arrived to it
with nano second position okay so we
send that information through the same
cable so as I was saying so the meat of
these experiment is is under the ice and
very pure clean eyes very transparent
without any very little radioactivity in
the material and it uses essentially all
all the region from the surface to the
first modules that are in the eyes as a
shield from these cosmic rays that all
the time eating the earth so you go that
deep to stay away and the little dots at
the surface that you see are a cosmic
parish our detectors something that
actually tries to capture it caused me
great showers that come from the top
that sometimes I'll correlated with the
events that were interested that go deep
inside the ice so all together says is
about 80 strings of detectors that there
is going to be a total of five thousand
of these photo sensors deployed when
we're done were about to first and
here's the sequence of the deployment
first we deployed years back in 2004 one
string that's their the dot that you see
there then we deployed a few more this
goes slowly and Keith will show how it's
a big logistic feat to get the strings
deployed two kilometers deep at the
South Pole very remote location and
there right now where this light is
slightly elevated it now where we have
59 of these 80 strings already deployed
on taking data
so how much time have we I don't know we
goes on okay I think I'll yeah more or
less so this is an example of an event
on this is actually cosmic event thing
painted CS yes sorry maybe I was making
an effort to hear myself that's good can
you hear me great thank you that's gonna
be more comfortable too so what you see
here is actually a real event in which
you see first in time the top being hit
that's a cosmic ray shower that is
hitting a very big cosmic rush hour that
is hitting and each of the dots is in
detector element that that's all light
and then with a little bit of delay you
see how that cosmic rays shower made a
whole bunch of particles means in this
case that are flowing down and you can
see how you can reconstruct the
direction so these are cosmic rays which
are not interested for interesting for
us and not very interesting what we're
actually interesting is the few events
that actually will go from the bottom up
because that means that they actually
had to go through the entire Earth and
therefore by force they have to be
neutrinos and they cannot be any other
particle then controvers the other
oddity that you may observe is half the
way through the eyes right there there
is a place where the light seems less
dense and that's because there is a dust
layer the ice is less clean down there
and that forces you essentially we get
less counts so the other main motivation
for looking at neutrinos a looking at
the sky for neutrinos is essentially
opening a window where what you haven't
seen before and this is the table that
shows that all the way to Galileo x 400
years ago you know the telescope was was
first used for navigation or actually
developed for navigation but the
discoveries of the strongly started
there with the moons of Jupiter and the
same thing happens many times you know
the Hubble telescope trying to look at
Naval II and then discovering
essentially you're confirming or helping
to confirm the expanding universe
and all the way down you know two more
recently using gamma rays where we need
were what you used to monitor some you
know nuclear bomb being exploded in
Soviet Union and the ended of observing
gamma ray bursts which are a very
interesting Astrophysical even so
essentially when neutrinos were
essentially opening a window in looking
at the sky in a different way that was
not available before yes the actually
the gamma ray field has developed a lot
what's mark there is kind of the first
time that a particular wavelength made
kind of the first physics news the the
field that is most active right now
besides neutrinos which still haven't we
haven't seen any source you know outside
of our galaxy and we're looking but
gamma rays astronomy is the kind of the
most intense field and there is lots of
discoveries me being made all the time
there is a there was a launch of a
satellite just a year ago that produced
a bunch of new sources of gamma rays so
it's a very very active field of
research so at this point probably too
late I'm hanging these over to p4 for
the second part of the talk thanks Ezra
I'm gonna try to talk to you more about
the actual construction of the detector
both some of the hardware and the
software then we have and I'm going to
start with the I'll start with a digital
optical module don't turn this up a
little bit torrent link am I good ok so
the this is really the the heart of the
detector is the digital optical the DOM
and it's basically constructed of two
pieces at the bottom is a
photomultiplier tube we have an example
of one right there you can come up and
pick it up out of the dog bowl when you
want and take a look at it at the bottom
is a photomultiplier tube at the top is
some electronics that can digitize that
signal and then put time stamp on it and
send it up up the cable to where our
counting-house is let's see at the top
of the dom is some custom firmware that
was you know that was built by
and thick almost entirely that was the
main contribution of the Berkeley Lab of
the institution that we're at I'm not a
hardware person per se but this is
there's lots of interesting stuff on
there so but it's I think in particular
it has a pretty accurate clock on it
which is really necessary for us to in
order to do that time time stamping so
that we can get an accurate
reconstruction yeah yeah quite a bit
actually yeah because it needs to it
this this the environment that this
lives in is pretty hostile it's like
anywhere from like 30 to 50 to 60 below
0 we do a lot of testing we actually
have freezers where we you know where we
build you put put these things together
or pieces of them together and then do
cycling on you know freeze them down to
50 below zero and bring them back up
continually running them looking for
failures to make sure that they don't
that they'll survive that's a good
question it's pretty low it's like one
or two percent one percent of doms that
have that well clearly once we drop them
into the ice they're there I think
somebody calculated for like another
what 70,000 years of which point they'll
fall off the edge of the continent so
we're not you can't go retrieve it or
fix it so they need to be they need to
be right and i think one percent success
rate is actually pretty good that's
that's one percent of doms that have
just become completely unresponsive
there's a few special needs Dom's if you
hell that needs special calibrations to
you know compensate for particular
failures or odd behaviors but there's
there's a ton of stories about like the
gel that the photo the folder
photomultiplier tube sits on the bottom
of this thing and has there's this clear
gel and apparently the first set of gels
that we got got cloudy when it got cold
and so we had to there's a thousand
stories about this stuff but no not the
environment that these guys living is
extremely harsh and we're going to do a
lot of testing to make sure that it's a
rabbit yeah um I think most of I think
most of it was just making sure from the
manufacturers that they would say yes
this this is going to work at 50 below
zero or 40 below zero and then we would
test to make sure that it actually did I
think that's the best about all that I
know of in terms of yeah yeah but no
that's it was it's definitely a big
concern here's a photo of a Dom being
deployed actually I'm just going to you
guys can look at this as a photo of on
the left there is an actual hole that
has been drilled and that's the cable
with a Dom attached to it down to just
barely sit at the bottom it's it's a
helped work a couple of deployments
Dom's where we actually attach these
guys onto the strings and then deploy
them down and looking down a hole that
is two and a half kilometers deep and
there's extremely cold air blowing up is
pretty pretty awe-inspiring I don't
think it's it's not quite big enough to
fall down but that certainly goes
through your head as you're looking at
it and then on the right is an example
of the ice top tank so that's kind of
the surface detector there's two dommes
in each of those tanks and there's two
tanks on top of each string so and
that's used like Azrael described for
either a detector in its own right or
also for vetoes if for noise that comes
from the surface when we're really
looking for things coming up here you'll
probably recognize they I think there's
a sketchpad animation of a Dom in the
string of this is working right yeah so
this is kind of a visualization of what
the detector looks like that's one Dom
there's all the strings that would be
the full detector or about halfway built
with it here come the I stop tanks which
are just little circles in this
animation and then you can see there's
our counting-house basically a data
center if you will
that sits on top of the ice those two
silos where all the cables from all the
strings come up so like the biggest
racks what do they call them cable trays
we were seeing if so well I don't know
maybe you guys being with YouTube and
Google you've seen bigger ones but so
that's a little animation for you here's
some other photos there's the
counting-house on the surface these
numbers might be a little bit out of
date because 17 racks of computers set
60 kilowatts the power consumption down
at the South Pole is a big concern
because it all ultimately comes from
burning jet fuel because it's the only
power source down at the South Pole
which and that has to be flown in which
means it's very expensive so there were
a fair number of engineering decisions
based on you know like cycles per gallon
of jet fuel or operations per gallon to
jet fuel if you will so that's where all
of our data collection our DAC software
runs down there which I'll get into a
little more details in a second so one
of the things that's interesting and
special it's certainly being a software
person is that you know mine my
introduction to the project was that Ice
Cube was a software projects you know
for Azrael it's a physics experiment for
me with a software project and then when
I actually went down to the South Pole
to help install and configure some of
our software it became blatantly obvious
that ice cube is a drilling project and
in and of itself the drill is a pretty
impressive feat of Engineering basically
to drill these holes two and a half
kilometers deep down into ice they use
compressed hot water and that the first
phase of it is using what they call a
fern drill that's the picture there on
the lower right that basically melts the
first think it's like 40 meters 40 or 50
meters of what it's not ice it's what
skiers we might call packed powder but
it's not a like a compressor drill
wouldn't work it would just it would
just spatter and wouldn't drill a hole
so this thing basically drops and melts
its way down and then after that goes
the first phase it then does the actual
drill and you can see that on the right
there this case driller is attaching the
drone on the upper right there is the
drill house
there's a there's a picture later of
what we call the the drill camp which is
where all of that water is the ice is
melted it's heated up it's compressed so
that it's high pressure superheated
water here's another obviously we like
sketchpad sketchup i think it's called
here's another animation so that's the
firm drug going kind of melting its way
down they pull it back up they reattach
the real drill if you will and then that
goes down and basically blasts its way
out so there's no real navigation
basically we know we're going to get a
straight hole because it's so heavy it
will just drop there are some I think
some sensors in there to make sure that
it is going but it's not turning or
curving so there's a big school behind
it which is a pretty impressive thing to
see up close so okay so let's see they
were getting into some of the software
aspects of it so there are tremendous
number of software projects around ice
cube I'm primarily involved with the
data acquisition part so but there's
kind of break that down there is the a
nice embedded that's the Dom application
that's the software that actually runs
on the Dom there's there's the ice to
surface communication we actually wrote
our Linux driver we've got some custom
hardware in the machines that these guys
are actually plugged into and then
there's a gate acquisition software
these all run on you know a standard
commercial off-the-shelf hardware but
you know Dell's or HP's if we go back
and forth as to which ones we end up
using their it runs linux it's
unfortunately at the moment it's a
pretty old version and we're trying to
push to get that upgraded but that takes
a little bit of work so and then as the
data acquisition data acquisition system
we've got super nova and grb triggers in
there after the data acquisition part
then this is processing and filtering
and there's the transmission back up to
the north over satellite links
verification and there's also an
experiment controller that kind of sits
on top of the data acquisition layer
that's how we actually drive the
detector these days
and here's kind of a low level I thought
I skipped this light that oh well I'll
talk about it this is a look at the low
level interacting with the Dom itself we
can actually log into one of these guys
and control them specifically it's not
something to do on a regular basis but
it's good for diagnostics and
installation yeah um no it's running its
own we basically wrote our own firmware
there's an fpga and there and other
other you know cpu it's actually running
our own firm or there's several
different layers of it I can't speak
that authoritative look about it but
it's not it's I think we originally
looked at some different embedded
operating systems but for reasons that
I'm not aware of they were they were we
just opted to go with our own so it's a
good question it was it was one of the
things that we looked into him early on
so yeah you can see we're just like you
know catting proc files and running
special programs to interact with the
Dom at a lower level so the data
acquisition system is a lamb I'm gonna
be more familiar with basically it's a
set of Java components that are that are
basically controlled using Python
software so we basically have one
component roughly one component /
machine that are the basic inter
connection in communications through
standard protocols within those things
we're using tcp/ip this is all
communication that happens in the data
center between the different components
and then on top of that is ice cube
alive which is his Java Python
communication between the Python code
and the Java code we use xml RPC for
that i'll go into more detail in that
diagram in a second but it kind of shows
you that off of the ice we have the doms
that are down if you look at the string
hubs those machines that sit on top of
each there's one string hub machined per
string and that basically collects data
from each string and then there's one
hub I don't think it's quite true
there's a couple of hubs / there's a hub
/ set of I stop nodes and that pulls up
data from the I stop
those guys feed their data into a series
of triggers those which look for
interesting events from that data and
then that gets fed into a global trigger
that looks for a trigger across the two
different detectors the I stopped and
the anais detector and then I get sent
to the own event builder which does all
the work have actually collecting the
events and assembling into something
that can be looked at the Python demons
by the way go ahead and stop me if I'm
talking too fast or you have questions
I'll do my best to fake an answer so the
Python that we have sitting on top we
broken it up into two real separate
systems there is a command and control
server that directly controls the Java
components so when I mentioned the I
stop trigger and a nice trigger and the
strain hubs those are the Java
components the event builder and so
these guys are run are controlled by
these Python components as a CNC server
that kind of starts starts them all up
as a DAC run that starts start to rent
that initiate to run tells them to start
what kind of configuration to you is how
long to run for and monitors the the
running of the components I think we're
doing a tower runs now so basically runs
48 hours stops and then starts another
run Ice Cube alive is another it's kind
of the experiment control interface the
public interface there's let's see
there's a couple guys it was a
command-line interface as a web line web
lines web interface do it so and it has
I think I've got a page coming up not
the next one but in a little bit i'll
show you more about this but yeah
it's the so the way they're actually
works it gets pulled pol so it's
basically collecting data constantly and
when the string hub says that the string
hub would basically reaches down and
pulls up the data from each dom and it's
doing that on a continual basis
basically we're pulling up everything
that we can get from it and then it gets
sent through the triggers through the
through the triggering algorithms in
order to decide whether or not that is
an event that's interesting so we have
different triggering algorithms to that
we would run on different runs to in
order to decide what it is that we're
looking for so right so yeah I haven't
talked about that it's that's actually a
really fascinating thing to really
quickly go through it each of them have
their own clock and as you know clocks
drift and over the course of just a run
and data collection in between the
communication of requesting data and
polling data all the communication stops
we send out a time calibration signal
that basically is we basically know the
length of the string we know the speed
of light you know the speed of the
signal so it gets sent down and gets
sent back up and through some algorithms
that I admit I don't fully comprehend
time calibration offset for each DOM is
then calculated and stored so that later
perhaps months or years later when you
need to reconstruct or do when you need
to reconstruct what actually happened
you can then say this Dom's this time
saw this at this Dawn's time its offset
is this so you can then basically
reconstruct kind of a global detector
time in or that is going to be I think
they make claims of up to within like
five or even for nanoseconds which is
which is which is which is a pretty
impressive tolerance which is what
is needed in order to be able to
accurately reconstruct you know what
happened where so there's a fair amount
of in order for all that worked as a
fair amount of geometry knowledge that
needs to be known about where these were
the different Dom's are because the ice
does kind of move over time and when you
deploy a string you need to figure out
where it is so there's a head in
missions but there's also flashers the
boards have little flashes will they
will admit light so we were run flasher
runs where one DOM is flashing or a set
of dimes are flashing and then we look
to see how the other dumb see that and
it's through that that we can then
figure out where everything is and how
often do we do in like once a month now
don't we we do like flasher ones once a
month in order to calibrate in order to
know what the geometry is of the
detector which is important for lots of
different reasons once your deep down in
the ice I think the the the it's pretty
constant I don't think that does the
temperature change much over the season
but we're generally keeping the doms on
we were yeah they're on all the time so
yeah I kind of already talked through
the what this flight has breaking down
the string hubs those string hubs as I
stop hubs they read from their
perspective strings and they pass it on
to the trigger trigger users of a series
of algorithms and stores the time
interval time intervals which then gets
sent to the event build or the input
event builder then reaches back into the
hubs and pulls the actual data so that
kind of minimizes the amount of data
that has to get moved around within that
network that runs in there and also
reduces the load on the trigger machines
and the event builder machines which has
in the past been a problem
okay this is actually hopefully I got
this right I went through this this
morning actually try to get a sense of
the different rates so these are actual
numbers from runs that happened I think
yesterday the day before so the I
stopped hubs they're seeing about 315
hits per second which stayed this is
that's one to one particular i stopped
hub string have is about seven hundred
hits per second which when you combine
them together 40,000 for the string hubs
in 2600 for the not a stop hubs that
that's what the ice that's what the
respect respective triggers see from
there subsets they then send requests on
of the global trigger and then so the
global trigger then sends those requests
on to the event builder the global
trigger itself is running trigger
Alatorre those to decide what out of the
whole detector he wants to see he says
he sends these requests this is just the
time intervals of things that appear
interesting based on the results of the
trigger algorithms and then the event
builder then reaches back he's actually
reaches back both to the string have any
eyes topcoats I just don't have that
other line in here and then he sends the
actual read out requests back to the
event builder he then assembles the
events and then and we're seeing about
that's what about 18,000 limits per
second 80 didn't miss it it's about
2,000 okay so this must have been a low
on or I only only look at one string and
one hug because they didn't have enough
time to put all those numbers together
but that's just good that kind of gives
you an idea as to the flow of data that
goes through these different components
so look we jump forward jump and okay I
hit the wrong button bear with me as I
as I get back to I hit a button you get
in a preview of all the of all the good
stuff that's coming up obviously we have
a lot of photos see us I blew it ok wait
there i am now i'm going wrong by
apologize with this there's
and let's see so processing a filtering
yeah after the data acquisition we go to
what we call PMF and that basically does
another layer of processing and
filtering and then sends it up over the
satellite links sends that data up over
satellite links to the north were yep
more analysis and algorithms are run on
it and then eventually physicist publish
papers which is really the end goal but
wait I'm not supposed to say it here's I
here's an actual here's an actual
screenshot of ice cube live this is our
kind of experiment control you'll
probably notice that as researchers read
always we don't have the money to hire
fancy UI interface people so we end up
with interfaces like this but it's
functional and it works and you can I
think you can barely make out there that
we have a ninety-eight percent almost
ninety nine percent up time pretending
is pretty good you can click through on
all those different those the each line
that represents a different run that's
gone on so this is kind of something we
look at to make sure the detector is
still running so fewer is kind of a
laundry list of different technologies
that we're using linux redhat and
there's a little bit of a bun too I
don't think is any a bunch you down at
the data center but I think a fair
amount of our development is usually
done a bunt too let's see we're using
Python there's actually some perl code a
couple of people who like to program a
pearl and we try to give him a bad time
but and they try to give us a bedtime it
that's the way it goes got java there's
also GCC and c c c++ that's i think i
know a lot of the analysis code is
written in c++ the firmware obviously is
written in c my seek we're using my
sequel mediawiki django wheezing mantis
and subversion for bug tracking and
version control we were in the past
using jboss which ended up working out
to be just too overweight we are using
jboss is a in the data center for kind
of managing all the components but we
eventually tossed that out
Postgres database down there which
coming to us down at the same time we
talked i'm jake loss who realized it was
just a little bit more heavy weight a
little more resources than we had to
devote to it so i'm going to try and the
time remaining to just kind of burn
through some of pictures about what it's
like to travel to and work at the south
pole so hopefully this is more than I
can depart so one of the things that's
interesting about the south pole is that
it's actually a high-altitude
environment it's natural elevation is
about 9,000 feet but because you're at
the Europe you're in the middle of a
continent that's almost entirely covered
with ice the error as I've been
explained to me actually slides off the
continent so it's thinner there then it
would be at 9,000 feet say here so the
altitude that you experience the
physiological altitude is more like 10
and sometimes 11 and it can vary day to
day based on the weather so that's one
of the first things I mean obviously
when you go to you know if the plane to
foresee notices it's extremely cold like
20 or 30 degrees below zero depending
what part of the country are from you
may have actually experienced that
yourself but and that can be you can
deal with that you put on more clothes
altitude takes a couple of days but one
of the other things that took a lot
longer to deal with this is extremely
dry there I'm not someone who wears
lotion hand lotion or has dry skin but
my mail my knuckles were cracking and
headaches not just from the altitude but
being dehydrated you have to drink water
constantly it makes you seriously
reconsider a coffee or alcohol
consumption you do because the hell
dehydrate you as well let's see what are
some of the other interesting facts it's
yeah like 30 below in the summertime and
get to be 80 and 100 below in the
wintertime fortunately i'm not there in
the winter summer populations about 200
maybe 300 people or winter overs people
who stay there over the wintertime about
45 maybe 50 yeah yeah well researchers
and support staff people who work there
too you know like the drillers and stuff
yeah so um yeah the nearest being at the
bottom of the planet there's only
there's only one day per year the Sun
comes up once the Sun sets for once so
if you're there in the wintertime it's
night almost the whole time if you're
there in the summertime so I'm just
circles over your head just I thought
pretty cool some people think it's kind
of disorienting I actually enjoyed it
it's almost nothing else that lives
there there's no like bugs or insects or
anything in the nearest city is 840
miles away so you need to be prepared
but to get there hears them well Google
Earth application you first fly to new
zealand and you're there and for me
there in the summertime this is photo I
took a while to close they gave me about
40 pounds worth of clothes that you have
to try on because you want to make sure
it fits in the middle of summer time in
New Zealand but it's important to do
that so then at then from New Zealand
you fly even further south to McMurdo
Station which is on the coast of
Antarctica and if you're lucky you get
to fly in one of these which is a c-17
which is a jet which will get you there
in about five hours four or five hours
as opposed to a c-130 which takes about
eight hours so this is a view inside one
of those c-17s that's actually one of
our cable spools that's one of the
cables if you passed around so it comes
on a whole spool and you can see there's
some pretty comfortable seating there
fair amount of space personally I would
rather fly one of these than your
typical airline unless I got first-class
ticket because you sit on the side you
get lots of legroom but there's some
really spectacular scenery you look out
the window and there's sea ice you can
spend your whole time staring out the
window I mostly I did then you land you
get off the plane bunch of other people
everybody's on their big red jackets why
red I think it's mostly that if you lost
somewhere you can be seen easily there's
actually I don't know if you can see
with this like a reflective is a patch
reflective patch that if you know if
they're flying over you and your face
down it'll reflect light I that's my
guess maybe it that's it or not but I
think it's just a stand
you know in a snowstorm or something
that's Mount Erebus it's off its kind of
weird to go to the bottom of the US and
see an active volcano but there it is
and that is McMurdo Station itself which
some people think it's really nice i
think it's kind of kind of dirty but it
certainly has its appeal no that's
actual dirt that's actually can actually
does actually expose land there so you
can see laughter there's a picture off
in the distance of an icebreaker they
basically break up the ice once or twice
a year in order to bring shits down to
shipping supplies it's always fun to see
the ice breakers off there's some
spectacular scenery down there i was
there i was really lucky it was a nice
day i got to go out on a hike went up to
that's castle rock this is a picture of
the trail out a castle rock and just for
a frame of reference that's Mars so to
give you a sense of what it looks like
they're the curse can't talk about Erika
without a photo of penguins there's some
penguins I do I wasn't looking up to see
any penguins did you see any penguins in
here well so there's Ivan the Terrible
so that's me I'm just under sixty four
lets me standing next to this bus that
drives around that thing got stuck in
the snow when we were driving it there's
like double Dooley's in the back
actually got snuck stuck in the to like
like amazing cat snowcat things they
brought over to drag a hangout was
pretty impressive there's some really
impressive machinery down there I've got
a thousand more photos that I clearly
don't have time to get through but I can
show you if your entries didn't see any
more so then from McMurdo you go even
further south this is a c-17s c-130s
turboprop planes very loud slower
smaller more old school they're a little
more dense on the inside there's some of
my coworkers pretty much wonderfully
because Hugh from 30 looks like but then
is even more spectacular scenery flying
over the words of the trans end trans
Antarctic mountain range which is
basically a mountain range that is
almost entirely covered with snow
so that's a mountain top that's
completely covered in its now there's
another one too it's just kind of crazy
to think that's what would be the top of
the mountain here you can see you see
amazing glacier drifts this is fun I
thought that was funny you actually see
somebody sticking their camera out the
window to take photos if you're lucky
you can go up and talk to the guys who
are flying the plane the kid some
believe it or not it's a new york
international guard that has a contract
for doing the transportation back and
forth apparently in new york
international guard got it because they
fly in and out of iceland so they've
experienced with planes and cold plates
there's there's a plane landing at the
South Pole you get off the plane and
there's the new station that's a
probably a couple years old they're
building a new state the I think they're
finished with the finished with the
construction of the new station down
there you see it's kind of built on
stilts yeah no no no no sorry didn't me
give that application there's many many
different science projects that happened
down at the South Pole and the ice cube
is just one of them it's one of the
bigger ones but it's just one of them so
there's a lot of science it all goes
down there it's a u.s. station but that
doesn't necessarily mean all the
projects you're just us-based there's a
lot of different international projects
that happen ice cube itself as
international project I mean we have I
don't know some 50 different
institutions from I think every
continent on the planet so yeah so it's
not just ice cube there's lots of
different projects listen to the scenic
shot of the station it's actually built
on stilts because a fair amount of snow
drifts that builds up pretty little
snowfall but fair amount of snow drifts
so things get buried which is why the
dome is being taken down because it's
getting buried there's thursday's he's
one of the one of the jack one of the
primary attack software authors standing
at the South Pole you got to go out and
get your hero shot there's another mark
he brings his golf club and likes to
golf so there's there's proof that was
actually at the South Pole if you can
believe what you GPS tells you 90
degrees 0000 took me a while to get that
photo
was going to freeze first Mahan or my
GPS from a camera but it finally got the
photo that's the South Pole marker right
next to it so and there of course is my
hero shot holding up the world you're
welcome this is some of the luxurious
accommodations you have to stay in
because you stay in a James waved you
get to stay in the main station in this
day and age weight yeah some people if
you're important enough for have enough
ice time as they say you can stay in the
main station it's a lot more comfortable
I'm not one of those people had to stay
in a James way which is this that's a
panoramic shot that's about 50 different
photos bored one night to go when shots
this week but that's where I was staying
back here still have this and less
that's just like a series of wool
blankets and canvas between me and the
outside the plywood is to the next birth
your hard water with the next bunk so
it's a little bit disturbing to like be
sleeping there's my head you know like
six inches from where it's 30 below zero
fortunately that time that was the
second time I was there I was further in
towards the middle where if you look at
this James we see that things sticking
off the side that's a furnace it's
probably a big enough furnace to burn my
house down here but it just heats that
and it's just candidate the column James
ways or what are the Quonset hut it's a
constant hot like thing it's like it's
like canvas with like green you know
like you know with some insulation in
there but a whole lot less than you
would think this thing's much just wants
bleed heat I can't believe they're very
efficient lets out in summer camp it's
only they only have that open in the
summer time to accommodate the you know
200 as opposed to 50 people that are
there and what do they call speakers
your science people who show up as
opposed to the other people who work
there so let's see what else the other
force pretty cold so believe it or not
my laptop overheated in that room and I
and because I was well my dis die decide
to rebuild my Intel
I'd rebuild a whole bunch of stuff but
it actually overheated and I solved it
by sticking it on the floor and it
stayed nice and cool but it didn't
overheat and it was because it was the
air so thin that was in problem with the
laptop there's a really nice cafeteria
down there far better than the cafeteria
we have at the Berkeley Lab not as good
as yours though so but still a good
cafeteria it's kind of a typical work
environment just I'll sit around a table
hack on stuff there's there's another
shot inside the station there's a
there's a wise the name of this escaping
me those are that's tomato plants yes
tomatoes so they have their own this is
basically so they can grow fresh
vegetables they kind of vegetables
lettuce and tomatoes let's definitely
get over the wintertime which is pretty
important there's another scenic shot of
our counting-house some more oh there's
the there's the drill camp so that's
where the heat up all the water and
compress it so now use snowmobiles to
get around much the time so know if you
guys have any other questions these are
just kind of fancy photos sure good um I
guess probably now charged particle from
that people should be there were so so
the decision isn't down you know
who can also not advantages that we're
looking at he said we didn't talk too
much all the energy with that least
important things are here at link from
goals so there's nothing really doesn't
make anything that's right actually the
shot in which of all shut noises in the
glass the ice is very very clean very
little bit activity but the glass that
we're swinging pound around me here is
some potassium in it but as soon as
indicated on the mix essentially your
life but as you say not correlated with
in life we just become great each module
but not behind with other module but
mostly it's weed it out yeah that could
be somebody could be thrown out
algorithmically if only one dog show you
something throw it up board yes well yes
it is straight line is our ideal English
time sort of me imagine Dom you think of
zombies if X Y Z and T and then you have
whole bunch of thumbs with different
time and from that you can reconstruct
in line occasional decorating fewer of
the charged particles of trouble from
one place to the other and that's just
what you detected right now i'm sure the
charged particle just keeps going you
just see a little bit of light that came
from it they so let me read these
neutrinos neutral it comes in and
doesn't make any light ones that do
incorrect native make a charge particle
a charged particle if it uses a little
bit of light that the one that you have
to observe with your dog he said so by
looking at a charged particle track
moving fair that it was a neutrino
nothing else could have produced the
charged particle loin not multiple this
means our technical event is the track
made by Dave charged particles a new one
is equally no matter long so the thing
that it's crossing at sea of light
bringing a speed of light from one side
to the other of these inspector thank
you for Damon he's making life and as it
goes through the eye this particular one
is a Down going yes yeah that's coming
from the top but you can it's hard to
make out here but you can see that you
know the different flash of light the
different flash of lights that's each
Dom seeing something and so based on
that kind of you know what they all saw
you could then reconstruct you can
barely make out but there is a line that
gets drawn in which is presumably the
trajectory we are of another interesting
part because they're producing ways that
already have been in a way and then when
he didn't fear they may be prima so we
observed over that they want we have not
yet observed and grow for looking for
without view discovery is ingredients
that came directly from the source so we
would see those is you look at entry on
sky map and you can see it a combo of
between events coming from a single
direction that will tell you
not atmospheric neutrino that actually
comes straight from the source but that
we haven't discovered session you will
need to see if you to be able to tell it
from from the background which is these
atmospheric entry notes so at least it
with you about the 45 on the same
direction the lens concept for neutrino
is is almost impossible because the
interaction you know the way he can make
in lens for lights that mean the default
under actually interacting with your
lens right for bending he knows he
tracks so weakly that essentially he
cannot he cannot really make the lens of
what we call these incredible but really
what you're doing hoping one of these
just goes through your architecture
agglomerate I think the chances of that
is very very very modern but so here's I
mean somewhat related what you're
talking about here Zaphod we skipped but
this is a picture of the Sun taken from
a different between Oh detector but
that's a picture of the Sun with a in
terms of camera of 500 day exposure so
and and it's pretty poor resolution so I
think the idea of neutrino lens is yeah
not terribly practical so any other yeah
good yes it's like 270 million yeah
national science foundation so and
there's other is there the main funder
but there's other other institutions
international institutions have have fun
european lending sources and stuff so
detectives about 59 strength so we're a
little more than halfway completed in
terms of the construction of course
everybody thinks in software is done but
you always think your slumbers done so
we'll see when the next eat every time
we deploy new stuff every time we get a
new set of strings we all played our
nails as we watch our software fall over
because you know the extra load then we
have to figure out how to fix it and ask
for faster hardware or we're just about
to release a new data compression and
maybe that'll save us you know bias
sometime so mm-hmm what is it what is a
lifetime 15 or 20 years in the acne Gulf
of Aden up this is in the Mediterranean
listen okay we should get work on that
then we can go the Mediterranean as well
as a cell phone yeah okay any other
questions or okay yeah sure
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
