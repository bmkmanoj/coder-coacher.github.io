for your interest in citrus trust
testing techniques my name is Joe Young
I'm a member of the testing technology
team my team is responsible for Google's
testing infrastructure like the
automated testing demons test courage'
tools and code dashboard I'm based in
Kirkland so it's quite nice to be in the
headquarter
my interest is mainly in developing
tools for helping people to write better
C++ tests and today I'm gonna talk about
this in-house framework we made which is
called G Mach nice for right in C++ mark
classes and using them in tests um first
let's take a look at what a typical C++
test is like usually a test we try to
first set up some stage by creating some
objects and putting them into some
proper States and then the test will
exercise a code you want to test after
that you verify the result is expected
or you check the state of the system is
in some acceptable state and finally you
clean up after yourself okay this is
what we are all familiar with and since
this approach focus on the state of the
system and how a piece of code transform
let's state is sometimes referred to as
state-based testing okay on state-based
testing is used every day at Google and
we know it works and however it has some
limitations okay I think the biggest
limitation of it is that it ignores the
fact that C++ is an object-oriented
language okay we know that in
object-oriented program we don't have
just a single object that's pretty rare
more likely you're going to have many
objects that talk to each other
okay so opie is about collaborations
between objects
those objects actually talk to each
other by sending messages and responding
to messages so naturally sometimes we
want to be able to test how objects talk
to each other okay and sorry
important we know that state-based
testing is good for verifying how object
responds to a message you just exercise
that message and compare the result with
what you expect
okay that's parsing is simple however
it's not a very good approach for
testing how objects send out messages to
others now one example is that we use a
lot of logging in our system because
proper logging is essential for
debugging a server crash so we want to
make sure that the right information is
logged at the right place okay and with
the right proper information in there
and to test that they basically want to
verify that your production code sends
the proper log message to the log system
okay on state based testing sometimes hi
some other problems on for example if
your code has some dependency on some
flaky components then your tests may end
up being flaky and one example is that
CPU had to talk to the network and we
know that a network is not always
reliable also your test can be very
expensive if you rely on some extensive
external resources like a database also
using state-based testing it's hard to
verify what the code does in in case of
a failure because you may not be easy to
it may not be they for you to simulate
an error like a file system error you
may have some good passing you know
program to handle a file rate error but
how do you course that parts to be
executed it can be hard okay to solve
those problems
we need interaction-based testing uhm
interaction-based testing the focus is
no longer on the curve
date of the system instead it tries to
look at what messages are being sent in
the system and what and and it also in
order to do that it needs to replace
dependencies on real objects with
dependency on test doubles this doubles
are just objects that implements the
same interface as a real object however
it allow us to intercept the function
calls and they can do verification on
the parameters and so on once we have
this test double injected in your code
base you can have your production code
talk to the testable object and that
probably it can be taught to check the
interaction between it and the objects
you are testing and mock objects are
particularly effective technique in
enabling interaction-based testing so
what is a mock obviously a mock object
has to implement the same interface as a
real object okay so you can use a mock
object when and how real object is
expected on also you can control the
behavior of a mock at runtime and such
that you don't have to write a different
mark class for each test because you
want to be able to configure the objects
to do different scenes based on the
different requirement from different
tests and those objects know how to
verify interactions on them so if you
tell mock objects that this method will
be called with this parameter then it
knows to verify it when the function
call actually occurs how do you create a
mock object the there are several
different ways you can certainly do it
by hand and it has been done in the past
however it's not very pleasant because
it's really a lot of work to come up
with a mock object that sees generic
enough to be able to be reused in
tests and that process is very tedious
and error-prone so as a result many
people just pretend there's no such
problem and they just avoid marks okay
clearly computers are quite good at
doing repetitious things so why don't we
ask a computer to create mocks for us
and this is perfectly reasonable so we
need some good tool to enable this
practice and for many languages like
Java we have some fine frameworks for
creating marks like there are two
popular runs for Java Jayma can either
mark the use implication of use
reflection of the language to
dynamically create a mock object at the
wrong time without any user intervention
okay and so for C++ unfortunately but it
didn't find any framework that's good
enough there was some effort but end
results was not very usable and we found
that it has all sorts of ad hoc
restrictions so we decided to create our
own and result he is jamak jamak was
actually inspired a lot by jay mark and
easy mark yet it's not a simple direct
port from Java to C++ some is big some
of the reason because of the difference
in the languages like C++ doesn't have
reflection and at the same time they
also try to get the best parts from both
frameworks and make them work in the
context of C++ so we made many different
design choices in um so what does he
mock give you there are many two parts
the first is some macros for creating
mock objects after that we provide a
domain-specific language
for you to configure the mock objects by
configure I mean you should want to be
able to set expectations on mock objects
meaning how it will be used and what
method will be called and you also want
to be able to set actions that should be
taken once the method is invoked let's
look at the macro for creating marks
it's not just a single macro it's
actually a family of macros but they are
all similar so the main macro is called
Mok method n where n can be 0 1 2 and so
on and n is a number of arguments your
function takes okay so this macro
actually creates a single marking
implementation for a method in your
interface okay so it takes two arguments
the first one is the name here its name
of the method and the second argument is
a type of the method okay so you just
declare your desire to create this mark
and key mark will expand this macro in
two it's actually in sexual
implementation here's a concrete example
I suppose you have this full interface
here it has two virtual functions which
are pure the first spline is do this it
takes no argument and returns void the
second two that takes an int N and a
double X and returns a bool so how do we
create a mock class for this interface
well you just use a mock measure for
each measure in the interface so here it
goes
so first you define your mock full class
as a sub class for this full interface
okay and then for the first Messer to
this you write a mod methyl zero
remember that zero here means this
method takes zero arguments
okay now comes the interesting part so
for the type of the argue of the mock
method it's actually avoid Paris's so
what's this funny notation well it's it
turns out to be C++ way of saying that
this is a function that takes no
argument and returns void okay and we do
the same for to that okay so it takes
two arguments so we write mock method
two here and pull the times we just read
this returns ball and takes an int N and
a tub X so as you may have figured out
now so the type of the method is
actually obtained by dropping the method
name from the signature okay so in the
complete signature of two that you will
have like go to that int N double X here
you just kill this to that name and
what's left is the type okay so the
process should be pretty straightforward
and I paid some Emacs hiker may be able
to come up with an MX micro to do this
automatically okay so once you have this
mark class you can use it to create an
instance of the map object and just like
you create other instance of other
classes okay now that we have the mock
class and we can create mock objects how
do we actually use on use on map object
well people answering this question I'd
like to ask a different question so
instead of how we should be able to use
it how how we should use it I want to
ask how we should be able to use it
so if you can design the perfect API
what would it look like okay so I think
a good API should address address the
others concerns at the right level it
shouldn't be too detailed as to make the
code look obscure
it shouldn't be too high level such that
you cannot express certain important
scenes in this CPI we should be able to
say which methods should be will be
invoked okay and with what arguments
also how many times should the method be
invoked in which order and what method
should do in response okay those are the
important things we want to be able to
express and they want to be able to
express them concisely okay let's look
at a concrete example so suppose this is
something you want to test you want to
verify that let's mark two objects do
that method will be called where the
parameter n should be positive and each
will be code twice and then you want it
to return to the first time and return
for the second time okay so here's the
spec of the test and here's how we
translate it into the syntax of G mark
okay so the first part of the spec says
this measure will be called okay it's
fine we write it in key mark
they say expect call this object and
this method okay then we want to say
that the first argument is positive and
we don't care about the second argument
in Gmail could be just right do that
with two things the first thing is GT 0
for greater than zero and second thing
is just underscore which means we don't
care what actual value it is it can be
anything it's a wild card and we want to
say that method will be called twice
okay so in democracy times two and then
the actions so it should return to the
first time enforce a second time this is
more verbose but still pretty
straightforward who may say we are once
returned to followed by we always
written false okay now let's put them
together the first you create a mock
object and you specify the expectations
in this case we have expects a call mark
fool do that with something greater than
zero and something in whose value we
don't care about and you it will be
called two times and we return true and
force consecutively okay after you have
set the expectations you just exercise
your code in this case you call the
server object and ask you to do this XYZ
operation and you tell the object to
tell the method to talk to this mock
object instead of talking to it's real
dependency okay that's all you have to
do you don't have to do the verification
key mock will do it for you so the rest
is completely automatic and by that I
mean it and the method is called more
times than expected for example if it's
called for the short time you will get a
report right away with the current stack
trace so you can debug also you be the
mystery is called with some wrong
arguments you will also get error
immediately in the end if all your code
has finished it and the disrupter Roman
mock object is expected and is executed
if better at that time and some
expectations haven't been satisfied yet
quemic will also find that and report it
to you and so the syntax they have seen
is pretty declarative so instead of
trying to express how you do the
verification it actual focus on what
should be verified and it needs the
details to the implementation also it
has this benefit of
it can report an error as soon as error
advice so you can get access to the
stack trace that contains the bug which
is very helpful so let's sit back for a
minute and think about how we would do
this verification in the traditional
state based testing technique if you use
state-based testing you will have to
execute a piece of code and wait for you
to finish and then you compare the
result by that time all those internal
calls have returned so you no longer
have access to the call stack that
caused the violation that leaves you in
a very bad place to debug that's why we
want early report home errors and now
let's take a closer look at the syntax
og mock on here instead to that method
we have two things for specifying what
arguments can be there okay those are
called
measures we have seen two example and
key mock has many more to offer
so what measure a much measure does is
basically tells you whether a certain
value is expected so essentially it's
just predicates and indeed you can use
arbitrary predicate logic in a measure
so the matching logic can be as complex
as you want on as a extreme example a
metro can also be a simple value for
example five is a nature which match the
value of five okay so that's when you
want to be exact
okay you can say that I just writes
value directly and hello would be an
example that matches the screen hello
and that's three only my chores are
composable that means you don't have to
rely on those
real teen measures you can create new
ones by combining with those building
blocks here's one example
um in this test they use some code to
drive a turtle on the screen suppose
they are using a logo like graphics
interface okay so we want to tell the
turtle to go to some place where the x
coordinate is zero but the y coordinate
should be something that is post greater
than zero and less than 10 so you take
two primitive measures and they combine
them using this or combine ATAR okay
that's how you create complex Naturals
from simple runs any question at this
point okay next we want to specify how
many times some mystery is caught for
that we need cardinalities okay and they
have seen one example which is tends to
and guess what you don't have to be
precise okay you can say that I don't
care about how many numbers how many
times you select your code as long as
it's at least three times okay you just
write x at least three you can do that
too
this is important in making sure that
your test is not too tightly coupled
with the current implementation suppose
you have a test and some irrelevant
change to the production code breaks it
you won't be very happy because you have
to do work to fix that test and that's
what gives automated tests a bad name
basically people sometimes write tests
that are too strict and the complain
about and automated testing doesn't work
well it's actually not that automated
testing doesn't work it's that you
shouldn't be writing tests that had too
tightly coupled with the implementation
and he mock offers some
and facilities for you to be right on
spot okay
also we want to be able to specify what
my heart mark measure should do when it
is invoked
that's called an action and we don't
true you son actually I have seen we
have seen and in gmod actions are
optional meaning that proper ability
sometimes you don't have to write the
action explicitly in your expectation if
that's the case G MOC will try to find
some default action and when the lessor
is invoked and as an Euler you have the
option to define what's that deport
behavior is okay here are some more
examples of what you can do in G mock
action the first one works when the
argument number n is a pointer what it
does is to assign this value to the
object pointed to by this argument
number n okay so it only works in
function where the N segment is a
pointer and the type of the pointy
matches the type of value and the second
one is a composite action so instead of
just doing one single action you do n
actions in sequence okay you do a 1
followed by a 2 and so on and instead of
doing well each one of them for each
invocation you do all of them in a
single invocation of the method okay
also you can't return a reference to an
object or you can invoke an e-stop
function that means that the action can
have very complex logic if you want
um we talked about simulating fears
earlier here's one example suppose your
code writes to the file system okay and
you want to test how it handles a case
where it cannot write to the file in
order to do that you set an expectation
on this mod file object okay you say
okay write will be invoked at least
three times and suppose this write
method returns the number of bytes it
successfully writes to the disk
okay and then you want this measure to
return 256 the first time and it seems a
second time
however from third time on you want it
to return zero meaning that it cannot
write any bite to the disk okay that's
how you simulate an error then with this
in place and when you execute your
production code which will actually see
a zero return from the file object and
the error handling pass will be executed
and you will be able to verify whether
it doesn't writing um here's another
real example taken from glucose three
code ok and we talked about testing logs
uh here's how you do it on first may
create an instance of the scoped mock
log class which is provided by G mock so
what this class does is that its
constructor it tells the log system from
this point on whenever you see a message
being locked please send me a copy of
course I want to intercept it and verify
it and in the destructor of this class
it tells the log system okay from this
point on don't bother sending me any of
those messages because I'm dying ok with
that then you can set expectations on
this object here we have this
a lot of info meaning that you will have
an informational log generated by this
source file and a lot message must
contains this sub screen okay and it has
to be there at least once but it can be
modems in that case it will still pass
the test okay after you set the spec you
just excuse a production code and the
verification is automatic ok questions
so far yes
um sorry could you repeat the question
um where do you want to return that
pointer okay mm-hmm can it be your mark
object okay
so let me repeat the question so the
question was that and if you have a like
complete our complex hierarchy of test
oh sorry
classes and you want to test them and
while the class wants to return
something and you want that thing to be
a mark is that possible right
that was Christine okay yeah yes you can
return anything from and the production
code you can basically inject your mark
objects into the production code using
dependency injection or whatever
technique you want to use and you will
be able to configure the production
class to return either a real object
pointer or mock object pointer and then
you can if you use a mock object then
you can set expectations on it and then
having to verify the expectations so
it's that answer your question
okay that's fine so we can talk more
offline okay here's one more thing I
want to tell you about key mark okay um
what about other of course right so we
earlier research that we want to be able
to express in which holder the function
should be called how do we do that
here's my example so suppose you have n
expectations that needs to be that need
to be matched in the exact order they
are defined all you have to do is to put
them inside a block and you create an
object of type in sequence in that block
okay so the actual name of that object
is not
medicines because you don't actually use
it the real work is done in the
constructor and destructor so basically
this tells key mark everything in this
block needs to occur in the strict order
okay and what what we have seen is an
example total order and kima allows you
to define partial order as well by that
I mean and the order between some
function calls may be relevant well the
order between some others may not be
relevant and you have the option to be
as flexible as you want um
I'm not I'm not gonna show you how this
works
what's the actual syntax look like for
that I want you to guess rate the
documentation because I want you to have
something to do after the talk okay
however there's one thing I want to tell
you now so the syntax Dimock uses which
is borrowed from J mark actually
guarantees that you cannot create you
from order in relationship meaning that
no matter what you do it will always be
a technique there cannot be circles
created so I think that's pretty nice
also you can express arbitrary directed
acyclic graph so as long as it's grow up
and it's a signal it can be expressed
using key marks okay there's one nice
thing about G mark
so suppose we are not happy with what
tea mug has to offer today well the good
news is that it done stand still it can
be extended by you the users okay so we
provide API for you to define your own
majors and your own cardinalities and
your own actions and once you define
them they can be used interchangeably
with the beauty in one's there's no
difference
so they work seamlessly with a framework
just as a butene natural sencilla so if
you find there's a need that hasn't been
filled please write your own extension
and share it with other team of users in
this company um we have seen how quemic
works now I'd like to talk a little bit
on how you can use it effectively so if
there's only one thing you remember from
the top this is the one okay this is the
golden rule for using mocks when you
write your tests you should always
specify your intent precisely no more no
Ness by that I mean sometimes we write
tests that's too tightly coupled with
implementation details that gives us
brittle tests okay for example if the
actual value of a function doesn't
function parameter doesn't matter
you shouldn't specified in the mock
specification or if all it matters is
that this value has a certain property
you shouldn't be sub s times that this
value has an exact value you should be
describing the property it has the same
thing goes for cardinality and other of
course you should only be strict when
it's important that's what important way
to avoid having brittle tests and on the
other hand your tests should your
specification should not be too loose
either if you are too Ninian's you may
end up having bugs creeping in without
being caught by any tests you don't want
that to happen either so you should
always try to express precise intent in
your test specification I know it's not
always easy to do so but this is
something at least you should be aiming
at let's go
and G Mach provides some constructs that
help you to do a cheap disco um next I'm
going to talk about some implementation
techniques they used in G Mach we cannot
possibly talk about everything so I
picked some we check some things that
are considered interesting um how do
they implement this mark measured macro
I mean you just described the interface
and the implementation is automatically
generated but there's a certain amount
of thing going on under the hood and
what has a um before answering this
question I'd like to ask a question
first which is why do we use this syntax
why not using a more obvious syntax like
this okay so instead of expressing the
type of the measure as a single argument
why don't we split it up like okay so we
have separate arguments for the return
type and for each argument type like
what we did for callbacks in Google
sorry okay
well the reasons turned out to be many
folds and I'm gonna give you some main
ones the first is that not all types are
created equal in C++ now for a simple
type like into a char you can declare
our variable of that type by writing a
name and to the right of the type right
you cannot always do that for gum here's
a type char for instance star followed
by princess's so can someone tell me
what this type is
okay so this is a function pointer and
takes no it points to a function that
takes no argument and returns a char
okay
the problem is that if you want to
declare a variable of this type where
should you write that Barbara's name
it's no longer after the type name right
you have to do it right after the star
here in the middle of the type so if you
have this mock method macro take
individual types as admins and you want
to use this argument directly in
building the implementation you may be
surprised when you declare a variable of
that type okay so that doesn't work
um another thing is that in a function
declaration a type may not be what it
looks like so we have a function f it
written telex two parameters versus a
constant the second is char array of
five elements okay to the compiler this
signature actually means something not
exactly like what we have seen it
actually means this okay so for the
compiler the first scene first parameter
is actually just int the constant
multiplier is dropped
silently and the sink and argument is
it's type is actually taking as char
star it's no longer a char array okay
let's just how C and C++ work so if you
let the user specifies a function
parameter types and you use that type
directly you may be surprised that it
doesn't match the real function
parameter type so we cannot do that in
this case we don't want to original type
in the parameter list may want to the
decayed type which the compiler wants
another thing is that
mark rows were introduced before we had
templates in the language that means
that they don't play well together and
for example suppose you have a macro
which takes a single argument and you
want to give it an argument which is a
template type it's a map from int to
screen ok so can someone tell me what's
wrong with this okay so this won't
actually parse the reason is that the
preprocessor and the compiler sees a
comma here and you think that ok here
ends the first argument and the rest is
the second argument so you end up with
Margaret has two arguments the first one
is my present
the second is string greater than which
doesn't make any sense so the problem is
that you cannot have unprotected commas
in a macro argument so if they do it
naively we will run into this problem
and the solution is to use the current
syntax ok here's how you do it note that
we have this mock measured has a
argument which is a map ok and there you
have a comma here however this works
because this comma is protected inside
this set this pair of parentheses okay
so the preprocessor is happy ok and once
this problem is solved then we rely on
template ok there's a question mm-hmm
that's a very good question so in this
case we'll return a bool that's fine
what if you returned a map from into
spring or something like that well in
that case we have no way of preventing
the compiler from complaining so as a
user you have to attack def on a return
type and then use that to F here and it
basically this is as good as we can get
okay but by putting all those parameters
inside princesa we at least eliminate
the majority of the case where you need
these type tips that was a very good
question and with this in place but then
use template metaprogramming to extract
the types folders individual arguments
ok and the types they extracted will
have no holes in it so you can declare
new variables using that tabs and
directly and the tabs will be dictated
by the compiler automatically so that's
what we want exactly um another
challenge is that we need to be able to
mark methods that take different number
of arguments and their implementations
are all different although quite similar
so if you are not careful you end up
with a lot of duplicated code and we
have funds that the tr1 topo library is
really handy in eliminate those
duplicated code so we were able we were
able to generalize the code such that it
works with different types so you don't
have to write different versions of the
same code and still sometimes it's
necessary to repeat code and for that we
resort to a Python script ok which
generates code at compile time actually
pre compile time we check in the
generated code then comes the question
how do we implement domain-specific
language or the DSL
um well the ESL is nothing but some C++
expressions that has a look and feel of
another language but in the end they are
still C++ okay
so the difference is that ordinary C++
expression will do something when they
are evaluated wigglin which make can
calculate some value it may cause some
side effects instead expressing the DSL
for example expect call expression in G
Mark will just construct the abstract
syntax tree from the expression without
doing any actual work yet
okay with this ast we can do some
checking on it to ensure that it's valid
so we actually do post grammar checking
and tab checking on ast and some of the
chicken is done at compile time where
some is delayed to run time now here's
an interesting scene it turned out that
we were able to actually do all the
chickens at compile time all the
important chickens at compile time still
we decided to postpone some chicken at
wrong time and make it really is that if
you do it at compile time then you leave
the user to the mercy of the compilers
error messages okay and in this case
it's tons of templates with no hope for
any ordinary human being to understand
so we decided that that's the cost of a
later error reporting we want to put
error messages in our hands so it's
wrong time they can generate whatever
error message we want and it can be very
friendly and very informative um once
TSL expressions are checked and when the
mock method is invoked the invocation
will be intercepted and hand it over to
interpreter
that's interpreter we will try to match
the arguments and do the proper
dispatching of them Nestle course um
next question is that just the same as
TSA or having a different syntax than
ordinary C++ constructs it also has
somewhat different type system okay so
how do you actually encourage that type
system in C++ type system and to see
what I mean
here's an example in G mock on the
constructs are all statically typed
meaning that if you use an action in
round function which whose type is not
compatible with the type of the action
you will get a compile error okay that
helps you to find error earlier him and
my grandpa the wheel ones Clause takes
something of type action of F where F is
a type of the mock function okay
um to complicate things many of the
actions are polymorphic meaning that
they can work in different types of
functions and take this most simple
example return five okay so what's the
type of written five apparently it can
be used in any function that returns a
number no matter it's an integer or a
double okay five can be interpreted as
an intern or a double okay however it
cannot be used in a function that
returns a say pool or pointer okay so we
should be able to catch that at compile
time and so the question you said how do
you have this expression what happens it
have it turned out that C++ type system
doesn't allow you to express this
polymorphism and directly however
there's a trick to I see to simulate
this
effect and here's how we do it so at the
bottom and this return X function and
generates a return or actually objects
okay it's a template so it's written
actually of type T where T is the type
of X okay so this with an action class
defined here it's not actually an action
notice that it doesn't inherit from the
action class
okay so itself is not an action however
we define this type conversion operator
which allows us to convert this object
to any action type that is valid for the
context okay so here so this type
conversion operator says that okay you
can use this object as an action of F
okay so this is a template and the body
of the definition ensures that this
class only compiles when the type of X
here is compatible with the type of F
here okay so this worked out very nicely
and here's some more complex example ah
so we have a composite action which
involves two actions so the first
section is to set the number one
argument and the pointy of the number
argument to this number and after that
we want to return true okay so what can
we tell about the function in which we
can use this action so from the first
action we can tell that this actually
must being a function and where the
second where the number one arguments
must point to something like a double
okay or float and this function must
return a bool okay so G mock was
actually able to combine those two
pieces of information and make sure that
this only
when you use this in context where all
the constraints are satisfied note that
there's nowhere in an expression and you
have to explicitly write the template
type parameter which is pretty nice I
think um okay here's the sales pitch
part of the talk okay we've seen how
gimmick works and how its implemented
and here's benefit from using it it's
not some kind of snake oil but it helps
you to do certain scenes really well and
it allows you to test interactions
between one object and its neighbors
which is not something that can be
easily done using state-based testing
and also by replacing dependencies on
flaky objects with mocks you can make
your test robust okay for example
instead of using a real network and you
test you can use a mock use network that
won't fail okay and by replacing
expensive external dependencies with
mocks you can make your test go fast and
also it allows you to easily trigger
failure conditions and tested failure
cases with Jim walk there's one
application and outside of the area of
testing which is rapid prototyping okay
so before suppose you are working on
something that depends on a library the
other team another team is working on
you you really have to wait and hear
that library takes shape before you can
code your own scene however using a mock
free more clunky mock you can start
coding right away as long as you have
the interface in the system agreed on ok
you don't have to wait for the other
team to deliver their product ok you can
just start writing prototypes with the
help of box
and people have observed that doing this
actually helped you derive better design
from your system because on the process
forcing you forces you to sink in terms
of interfaces and that tends to lead to
more modular code and more reusable code
okay so those are the benefits of the
system and when you go back to your desk
today don't just check your email first
go to this website and check out the
documents and try to use it in your
tests and maybe prototypes and keep your
feedbacks and send to up me okay so I
guess that's all I have to say any
questions no question yes
so the question was either any plan to
open source to mark the answer is taping
it yes and currently they are still
running low on resources because I'm the
only person working on this full time so
I put in help from other people but they
don't work on this as their full-time
job and also he MOC currently has some
dependencies on other Google components
most noteworthy G unit so we need to
make sure that works out first and the
good thing is that they also plan to
open-source G Unit so the first step
would be to actually open sourced unit
and then we can talk about open sourcing
teamwork and if you are interested in
help with the effort please talk to me
so the question was either a time frame
for open source in G Unit so my opr for
this quarter includes making sure I
understand what's involved in open
sourcing key units because I have never
done anything like that before so it's a
new process for me so from that point on
I can be more certain about the actual
amount of work it takes so if you some
other members of the audience have more
experience with open sourcing stuff at
Google please help me okay any other
questions
maybe one question for you so how many
of you have already used that unit okie
mob okay there are three or four four or
five of them okay for the rest of you do
you plan to use him oh okay pretty good
go back and talk to your teammates about
this and have them try it and give me
feedback thank you for coming
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
