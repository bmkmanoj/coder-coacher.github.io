great thank you all for being here and
thanks to sponsors organizers and all of
you for coming and listen John you
couldn't have set up my talk any better
about the need for conceptual design
tools i hope i can follow through so the
work i'm going to present here was work
I did it Stanford I recently left there
and started a company and like all
professors I'm really presenting the
work of many people other than myself I
really tried to put together a
multidisciplinary group of architects
engineers structural and structural
mechanical no electrical engineers that
would have been my next add as well as
some mathematicians and decision
analysis people i called my my talk
expanding design spaces kind of for two
reasons one is the design spaces we need
to consider today are expanding greatly
twenty years ago when i was learning to
be an architect energy barely even
entered the conversation mature or use
was barely talked about they're all
these kind of weird guys down the hall
in the architecture department who are
kind of the environmental guys and we
sort of steered clear then we want to do
the cool design now it's very much front
and center we need to consider
environmental issues we need to consider
equity issues we need to consider
economic issues so the things we need to
consider are growing greatly also all of
the different options we had to choose
from I'd learned yesterday that while we
have added in manufacturing now to
consider in terms of the construction
methods we're going to use something I
never even thought about five years ago
so all sorts of new technologies that
we're dealing with new ways to analyze
all of these different spaces so the
potential space that we need to look
through has grown tremendously and we're
starting to get tools that are going to
help us search through that space more
efficiently and effectively so just
generally get us on a baseline how do
good designs emerged today well theory
says we need to generate and give a
large design spaces we can't rely on our
precedent and say hey last time we build
a building just like this let's just do
it again we have to really step
back look at all the possibilities
search through them understand trends
get to the best designs so design space
generally consists of four subspaces the
objective space one of the things we're
trying to achieve in this case we're
talking about a high-rise in Switzerland
so we want the cost to be 150 million
about 150 rooms an iconic building view
of the Alps maybe some energy efficiency
goals maybe some other types of goals
and understanding which are most
important is is really about energy
efficiency this is about great rooms
with great views what are the trade-offs
there next we need to figure out what
the alternative spaces we need to know
kind of what the logical and geometric
features are of this alternative space
we might be interested in in this case
looking at a design that looks a bit
like a ski pole or perhaps one that
looks a bit like a ski boot we need to
describe those things geometrically so
we understand what the alternatives are
next we need to understand the impact
space okay how are these different
alternatives going to perform in terms
of all these different objectives were
concerned with in all these different
issues and then finally we need to make
some value assessments we need to
finally pick a design well this one's
better for energy not so good for
aesthetics this other ones vice versa
which one are we going to choose which
one do we think is going to you know be
most sustainable for us our clients
users going forward so good design
decisions require efficient effective
processing of an amazing amount of
information and I tend to try to break
it down to sort of six buckets I guess
who are the teams who are involved in
this process who are our stakeholders
who are designers who are
decision-makers who are the gatekeepers
you can constrain this design space
we're going to look at next are the
objectives environmental social economic
objectives that we're considering we
need to know about those weights which
are most important to who I'll certain
is all with all this information we need
to understand our options what are the
alternatives who provides them what
information is available about available
about each of these you need to analyze
all these options again for all these
impacts finally we need to pay pick pick
out that design it's really hard work
and designers today out of necessity
take a lot of shortcuts may
some mistakes and working efficiently
through this process so let me just give
you a couple examples this is from just
down the road at Stanford University on
the Graduate School of Business as we
observe the process this is something we
would seek fairly often is inconsistency
in the information so if you look in one
part of the file structure you see that
they made some decision matrix that said
that for the HVAC options for one part
of the building looked like displacement
ventilation was going to be pretty bad
idea go into the other part of the file
structure and look at that they got
displacement ventilation all over this
building what happened maybe somebody
made a mistake and missed it maybe
there's some process that wasn't clear
but this information is very
inconsistent can be very disconcerting
for a large team he's trying to make
sense of all the information and move
forward why did they choose displacement
ventilation another problem is we have
difficulty sharing process information
across projects so in this case the
structural engineer on the project was
asked to consider life cycle
environmental impacts of the material
should we be building out a concrete or
steel here so we have this great revit
three-dimensional cat or we call it
building information model now and he
went out and said okay I have this
information how these quantities how do
I go about understanding what my
environmental impacts are he spent about
the you know four hours that he had in
the design budget to work on it couldn't
find a process gave up never got the
information to the owner and they made a
decision about structural materials
without that kind of lcn information
well but as it turned out this is a big
multinational engineering firm over in
Australia they had a process already
being developed and being used in some
pilot projects which could do exactly
that so the exact same organization
couldn't communicate that there is a
process to do a one engineer needed new
on one project they already knew how to
do it on another finally firms tend to
have a difficulty stepping back and
saying okay you know on every project is
unique let's step back and say what are
we doing over and over and over again
how can we start to find some
efficiencies there so here's an example
where they have their architectural
model they have to go through a number
of
really what it might be considered
value-adding issues of generating that
model strategizing what they want to
model and interpreting the results of
the daylight analysis but then they
spent about 12 hours doing what everyone
considered non-value-added information
taking the architectural model you know
stripping it out simplifying it changing
the geometry so it will fit into the
daylight analysis running that daylight
analysis okay you do it once that's 12
hours but how many times they do this on
one project how many times they do it
across many projects the management had
no clue so just to sort of summarize the
problem as I see it right now we're
doing very very limited exploration of
design spaces today in conceptual design
when it's John pointed out we can really
make the big impacts tenda you know
these are gross averages for a number of
different observations we've done but
conceptual design can last in the range
of about five weeks can be a team of
about you know 1800 architectural
man-hours very few mechanical and
structural man-hours we're really
bringing those people as John mentioned
after the fact to try to you know fix
what we've done clarity requirements
really going in there and understand
okay what are the requirements what are
you guys trying to achieve you know what
are your energy goals what are your
space goals what are your other goals
very low very hard to really figure out
what those objectives are there in
people's minds they're in different word
documents spread out meeting minutes and
things like that not very good at
collecting and communicating the
objectives and everybody's trying to
achieve how many alternatives are we
really be able to model and analyze in a
meaningful way to get good feedback from
we're doing you know in the order of
magnitude of three before we really fix
on a design and try to fix that
particular geometry and the types of
analyses were doing really focused on
architectural first costs not a lot of
real energy and other issues and we
communicate our rationale as we go
through these spaces very poorly as well
this diagram tries to say that you know
we communicate the designers and the
alternatives architects are great at
getting up there and throw showing their
pretty pictures and saying you know john
hay maker and associates on the side
isn't this a beautiful design that's
built it but all this other information
who are the managers and decision-makers
who are really involved in this
who are the stakeholders we're trying to
satisfy what are their goals who are the
gatekeepers what are their constraints
what are all the analyses that led to
our final decision of a design is not
communicated well so if you think about
these kind of design spaces is
consisting of objective space
alternatives based impact space and
value space I'm arguing that generally
the quality of these spaces in the
clarity with which we communicate them
is shockingly poor today so how do we
make decisions today while we fall back
on some may be less effective methods
but ones that I run into a lot we rely
on precedent we do what we've always
done before rely on power you know that
guy in the thing slams his hand I'm at a
table and says we're going to do it this
way let's move on persistence the other
person the meeting says no no I really
want to do it this way I really want to
do it this way and you finally just give
in intuition yeah this feels about right
approximation well you know might be
this way it might be that way or we just
try to simplify things and make
decisions with with less information so
generally you know what are the research
questions that I've been trying to
attack with this team is how can
projects teams generate and communicate
better design processes design spaces
and design decisions more effectively
and efficiently and it really has to do
with being within the project on a
project team and then these larger
scales of across projects and across the
whole organization how can we start to
manage these design spaces better oh so
I'm going to just very quickly give you
snapshots of five tools that we've tried
to build to expand some aspect of these
design spaces or communicate them better
talk about pip the process integration
platform macdaddy multi-attribute
collective design assessment decision
integration design scenarios
requirements durban parametric design
spaces pie dough process integration
design optimization and finally deem
which is a design exploration assessment
methodology explaining she goes to you
in a moment so pip this is a
collaborative tool basically when we're
collaborating on projects today we're
really looking at this a file structure
which breaks our information down into
some kind of hierarchy what's missing
there is the process all the
dependencies between all of the
information so this tool does something
fairly simple just allows you to draw an
arrow between files so here we kind of
have a high-level process where they're
going through that teams and objectives
and preferences and alternatives and
impacts and value and then each of these
folders for example the alternatives
breaks down under how do we actually
define that alternative well there was
some preliminary information we went
through we built a couple CAD models
then how do we analyze those well this
is the analysis of the day lighting
analysis the energy analysis life cycle
analysis etc break into the light day
lighting analysis this is the process we
went through for that day lighting
analysis so it's the opportunity for
teams to get together and really map out
the dependencies between their files and
we find that that's actually some pretty
useful and interesting information so it
allows you to create and relate your
information now once you have these
lines between them you can start to
search this information you're more
information to search including the
dependencies you can say i'm looking for
a process that starts with an
architectural ifc model that kind of
standard day for daylighting form of
sorry data format that we have and it
has an output of LCA is there anywhere
in this world of processes where
somebody else has done this so we can
start the pool up processes in that way
and then finally we start to develop
some community and some metrics around
these processes people talking about how
well they've performed how often they've
been running things like that and mouse
through some initial tests of using
these in classrooms and in some
classroom design charrettes we find that
when people are dealing with their
information in this way there are more
trend discussions you start to see
people talking about the trends of these
spaces rather than just point designs
they tend to iterate through the
processes a little bit more they they
understand how their information relates
to other information excuse me and will
therefore iterate through the process
their information is more consistent and
the designers are less confused about
what is really going on find improve
sharing between projects as well that
there are less process mistakes and
people are able to take information from
past projects and important in other
projects more successfully and finally
this improved understanding across
projects i'll just give you a couple
examples of
views that we were able to create that I
think are kind of interesting so this is
the class grades for a class project
here are the different projects here and
the different designers within each
project so basically what we can see
here is you know designer for sharing
information with excuse me no
information with designer one but is
sharing information with designer three
so you just see is a sort of generally
rough view we don't have any statistical
significance on this but it starts to
show some correlation between how
tightly people are integrating their
information how much they're connecting
it drawing these arrows and the ultimate
project grade you know are they they're
able to come up with better projects if
they can work with in this process view
and understand how their information
relates and just another view here we
can start to look at specific tools and
the information flow between those and
start to understand that wow we're doing
a lot of translation between autocad and
revit so let's go take a look at that
across the firm and see what's going on
maybe we should do some more automation
there we're helping the information
through okay so that's generally a
process mapping and integration tool
this is mack daddy get a sort of six
step process and tool it helps people
formalize and communicate decisions so
this is a front page you can see a
series of decisions that we have there
on the left and I'm going to just
quickly go through a high-speed rail
decision here in Palo Alto decision here
is whether we should tunnel the tracks
through Palo Alto and build density up
over the air rights to help pay for it
or if we should just build as a current
plan an elevated track which will go
right down the current right-of-way of
the caltrain so these are our four
options and this is a summary that says
according to this analysis we should
tunnel it and build mid density around
it okay so how do we get to that well
the first step is to go in and model
your teams who are your different
stakeholders in this case we have people
like Palo Alto government people who
work in Palo Alto but don't live there
etc we can have different gatekeepers
these are building department people
perhaps Stanford University or other
people who have the ability to really
restrict some of the alternatives we
have the designers and we
of the decision-makers next step is
defining all the objectives so getting
them all on one page trying to organize
them and communicate them and for each
objective for example the ability to
bike and walk we start to try to
describe what we mean by what would be a
good solution for this say eight miles
of biking trails through Palo Alto what
would be a very bad solution no miles of
biking trails so we can start to
understand how we're going to measure
each of these objectives now there can
be fairly qualitative aesthetic and
other site sorts of objectives I feel
it's important to get those in here as
well and if it's just we're going to ask
the architect that's that's a fine
metric if we don't have anything else we
then send those objectives out to all
the stakeholders and they have the
ability to weight them fairly simple
process at this point of just trying to
you give them a hundred points and let
them it's lay there are particular
preferences over the different
objectives we can start to view that and
understand okay well what are the
drivers on this project well
connectivity seems to be really a big
driver on the project and the ability to
bike and walk to living and working
environment seems to be very important
to a lot of stakeholders and we can
start to drill in and understand who
it's important to next we want to just
communicate what all the different
alternatives are give information about
them we want to go through a rigorous
aspect of making sure analyzing all the
alternatives for all the goals fine we
often miss you know some of these
analyses we focus on perhaps just one or
two of them make decisions based on that
we then want to present something that
we call value which is essentially
taking this idea of an impact of an
alternative on a goal and multiplying
and through thy by the preference for
that goal so if you care a lot about
something and it performs well there's a
lot of positive value if you care a lot
about something that performs negatively
there's a lot of negative value and we
can drill into that information to
really start to understand different
stakeholders and what value they're
getting from different alternatives and
start to drill down in that information
and for example here see a comparison of
increasing housing capacity versus
ability to bike and walk and see which
alternatives are performing well in
terms of just those two pools
okay so that's mack daddy the next next
tool is called design scenarios which is
really just talking about this process
of okay we understand who what our
objectives are how do we define an
alternative space that's going to really
well meet those we could just sort of
guess or have a nun full informal
process of getting from those down to
the alternatives or perhaps there's a
more structured way to make sure we get
a better alternative space that we can
start to look at so this is just a
process of four models where we're going
to first talk about some scenario logic
we're going to start with our goals and
this is what a real model will look like
an eldest drillin in just a moment we'll
go into that goal and we'll start to
break it down in terms of things like
action items how we going to achieve
that goal we want to maximize unit
exposure to water we're going to control
the unit orientation and we're going to
calculate the percent of units facing
water we're going to control the tower
orientation and then each of these
breakdown in terms of some strategies
and ultimately parameters things that we
can start to manipulate and wiggle
around to try to optimize for that
design we didn't take those parameters
it's a little too well and one thing
that we get that's very interesting
right there as we start to really
already understand which one's of these
decision goals are impacted by which
one's of these parameters and things
like that so we can start to understand
how our parameter is going to be
impacting our our objectives right there
and the next step is then to take those
parameters and build a parametric models
will take some of those parameters and
group them into like perhaps a floor
plate of the building and then describe
the geometry that will actually fit
around those parameters and help us
actually create geometry for it and
constrain that geometry and ultimately
so here's a model for a real project
that we did with som which shows we we
have the floor plate which relates to
the slabs and the unit walls and the you
know walls relate to the different glass
walls in the south and the yeast and
things like that so we're starting to
connect components of the building and
describe them parametrically and start
to generate these types of design spaces
that you're hopefully objective driven
because we've connected them to the
objectives we analyze them we bring them
into a big spreadsheet where we put the
different alternatives
goals we score them and we understand
how well they perform okay so the next
project is about going from alternatives
to impacts and doing that more
effectively and efficiently so here we
we look to mechanical engineering a
technology called process integration
design optimization used in aerospace
and automobiles this is a platform made
by Phoenix integration and we wrapped
you basically wrap commercial tools and
then put them in this platform to
orchestrate things like design space
exploration and optimization so we've
wrapped kit digital project which is an
architectural flavor of catia Energy
Plus which is the kind of leading energy
model or for us right now GSA is a
structural application made by arup and
wrap it into a process flow like this
and we have an optimizer provided by
Phoenix in this case so our first
attempt at this was to just do a very
simple case take a classroom building
you can see we were going to orient the
orientation the building length the
window to the wall ratio some parameters
like that is what we're interested in
looking through and we're able to now
start to get some really interesting
performance trend feedback that just
hasn't been available to designers until
very recently so this diagram is called
a parallel coordinates plot basically
the blue lines are the best designs the
cheapest and you can follow them through
and understand that there are two
building lengths for example that lead
to the best structural the cheapest
structural solution and here we're
looking at trade-offs between structural
costs and lifecycle costs so I'll just
drill into a couple projects related pie
dough in a little more depth so this is
work by Ben well II and what what he's
trying to do here is to John mention
that design Explorer is great for square
buildings we're trying to develop a more
robust workflow which can work for more
complicated buildings so we're basically
going to take the digital project catia
model put it through what's called an
IFC translator put them the model into
energy plus put it in a radiance going
to take that day lighting information
plug that into the energy because you
want to know how much daylight you need
so you know how much you need to turn on
the lights etc and then we we put it
into this optimization flow
give you a sense of some of the issues
we have to deal with for this data flow
all sorts of things like there are
things called space boundaries single
level space boundaries third level space
boundaries you can see the difference
here it's just about how the thermal
flow goes through the walls and things
that we need to set up that geometry
differently for energy plus then the way
it came out of the architectural model
we need to deal with the way we we model
things like columns and overhangs and
and and thins etc differently energy
plus districts expects different
geometry than the architectural model we
have a number of automated translations
that work through that and you can see
the types of buildings that were able to
now push through this process and get
get accurate results and now we're able
to get this kind of information we can
understand that hey overhang on the
depth overhang depth on the west facade
is the real driver that's what's going
to you know drive most of our energy
performance we can talk about these
other things but if we really want to
focus on it let's talk about overhang on
the West we can see some relationships
between for example West overhang depth
and self overhang depth and their
trade-offs when you're considering
annual energy costs second project is
this is structural so this is a case
where in a structural frame you
sometimes have continuous variables and
you sometimes have discrete variables
case of a structural frame each of these
members are going to be discreet you
have like a different size steel that
you can put in there off the shelf but
the geometry itself is continuous right
you can move it an inch an inch an inch
up or move this node back or fourth or
something so in this case we've
developed a specialized optimizer which
can do both the sizing with discrete as
well as dealing with the shape shape
optimizer issues this is just showing
some moderate improvement over we just
see here well I'll just go to the next
one if we were able to show moderate
improvement over existing structure
allow the structural optimization
optimization algorithms they've been
around for a while and so we can show
for some
our problems some improvement but the
real issue is when you start to bring
this into large projects with many many
members so here's a steel stadium roof
and you can see that we're able to
really reduce structural steel weight by
a significant amount twenty four percent
in this case I'd show this example
because I feel like there's incredible
fat on our buildings when people are
using this tekken all technology &amp;amp;
aerospace for airplane wings and stuff
like that they get super excited by like
a point five percent improvement so
there's real opportunity here just the
last piece of work i want to talk about
is so it as a designer we come and we
face different challenges might have
fairly simple challenges of a
relocatable classroom building in San
Diego you might have extremely
complicated challenges of Google campus
somewhere else so we have a series
different challenges maybe a bunch of
different strategies we can just let the
designer go and pick an alternative and
that will be our strategy or we can do
some of these really advanced strategies
that I've told you and each of them
afford a different type of exploration
so wouldn't it be great as hod mentioned
before to say hey I've got this problem
I want to you know pick this built this
building design and plunk it in there
make we need to take a step back from
that and say well have this problem
what's the right process for me to
attack this problem and so that's what
this really work is trying to say it's
glee measure challenges we major
strategies we measure the exploration
and we've just shoot through that but we
did a shred test with allowing people to
produce some given different challenges
apply different strategies and we can
measure their exploration and understand
what strategies suit challenges the best
and just a couple of interesting things
that emerged was that when we allow
people to just get point data so we say
give us a design and we're going to give
you the energy performance back you'll
look at that energy poor performance you
can give us another design will give you
the energy performance back amazingly
their exploration their ability to
achieve better designs was not much
better than if we didn't give them any
energy information off they just relied
on their precedent this is for
professional designers
say but when we start to give them trend
data about you know looking through the
whole space give them the trends then
they're able to achieve much better
designs much more quickly so we've had
some early efforts of really bringing
these architects and engineers and
stakeholders together this is a
charrette where I see a bunch of blonde
heads there we brought some researchers
and professionals in from Finland Nevada
an afternoon we're able to go through
these process with all these different
tools and look through a fairly large
space and get people to understand where
the best designs might be for in their
case a classroom building in Helsinki so
where are we now I argue that we're
getting a little bit better in terms of
the quality and clarity these spaces but
there's a lot of work to do one thing I
run into is building these models is a
challenge and people don't want to
commit to really changing their process
and doing something else even if it will
lead to better designs eventually so is
this kind of ongoing research question
about you know how much clarity and how
much quality should this design space be
four different challenges so this is one
tool that we built which is just trying
to show different options the different
stakeholders and what the value is to
each option is just one page it allows
these different stakeholders to go on
and say hey I like this one because of
this I like this one because of that and
we can then compare and understand on
just one page the design space without
all that other detail so just in summary
sustainable building design involves
exploring and communicating design
spaces project teams really struggle to
do this efficiently effectively today we
have tools emerging that do improve this
exploration and communication but there
are great organizational cultural
educational and technical challenges
remaining to apply this to practice
thank you
hello Douglas Eck from google and wonder
if you could go back to one of the
slides from pit where you had all the
graph big graph up going way back to the
first third of your talk I know sorry
about that that's how go ahead and start
the question for like or I can so I'm
coming at this from a software
development view yep and there are
numbers a number of graphical languages
in software development that work for
small problems yeah i can think of my
area of music and there are lots of
great little software development
platforms let you pull together boxes
and arrows and and build cool things and
i would i would hold it to be almost a
universal that these sorts of
programming paradigms don't scale well
they don't scale well at all no and I'm
warning if you've had issues with yeah
that's the one that scared me right
there drop that but that's scared oh no
like underneath this or behind all this
have you thought about ways to take
advantage of the the paradigm of open
source software development which is
really about building small reusable
components of code and defining
carefully ways for pieces of code to
communicate with one another or is it
that architects love this kind of stuff
I'm not saying it's bad just but
honestly for me as a software developer
I look at this and I think I I don't
know how it ever spin up and be able to
use something like that sure good it's a
great question this is an exploration to
see you know how well can the scale to
the architectural domain and it another
challenge that we have is you know in
practice now we have lots of people
using lots of tools already I mean these
are all commercial tools that we're
wrapping in here right so I have done
some previous project where I went down
to the very bottom and talked about the
different components and how they should
plug together and get the data to flow
through automatically you know I'd love
some help from you guys to figure out
how to do that better this was really
coming out a little bit from the
different side which is okay we're
starting here right we already have this
folder hierarchy with everybody with all
their information and what we're missing
one thing we're missing is that just
knowing
it's something depends on something else
that gets completely lost
the class project i'm working for 10
weeks on one design problem this does
actually scale pretty well you know for
the number of nodes and links and things
like that some of the things that help
are you know we have a hierarchical
organization as well as a graph
organization she can kind of work
through either view when you want to
depending on what you need to do so i
found it did scale up to that level i
know certainly interested in bringing
that on to larger projects and seeing
where it starts to break down and what
the other issues are related to that ok
Michelle prove Nelly from University of
Southern California I think we've all
had the experience where we've been in a
building and you can see what the
architects wanted to do and you can also
see which parts worked or didn't work
maybe you see a collaboration space that
was clearly meant as a collaboration
space that no one ever uses or chairs in
the lobby that people don't sit in etc
so I'm interested in how much data you
have about which parts of buildings
worked there are a lot of buildings
existing there are a lot of buildings
that have been built already how can you
get data about what worked and didn't
work and maybe use that to constrain the
design process or guide architects we
saw the session this morning and
yesterday was all about how if you have
enough data you can do feature
extraction and start to guide designs do
you have access to that kind of thing in
this field or what would it take
technologically to start gathering the
kind of data that could feed back to
your models great question so we we
certainly have a process called post
occupancy evaluation where we go should
go into buildings after the fact and
understand how well they're working and
record them based on the metrics that we
use when we were designing it's kind of
a great idea in practice most projects
kind of run out of money it's usually in
the construction budget first of all
unfortunately that and then you run out
of money and you end up cutting that out
and don't do any post occupancy
evaluation another problem with post
occupancy evaluation I think is that you
know the metrics used to design the
building get sort of lost I mentioned
that there never communicated well so
then how do you go in after and say well
is this perform
based on designer intent or not because
the designer intent fairly diffused sand
lost so I guess I view the mack daddy
tool as and I guess pip as well as the
first step in that which is in design
must be more clear and structured about
the way we're going to put this
information together and present it I
haven't done any work and following this
model through the construction and the
operation phase but I think it would be
wonderful you know I have these graphs
of value it would be wonderful if during
construction people were you know
tracking all their decisions based on
the value they're providing to the
client and as well an operational return
and say are we really providing that
value in the in the end building edelman
stock at MIT you mentioned that the many
of our buildings have too much fat right
now given uncertainty in sort of the
design parameters and forcings and so on
how much of that fat is sort of needed
in terms of extra safety and how much
can you really shave off it's a great
question and I love for some of my
colleagues to jump in on that as well
but and for example structural
engineering I think what we saw there
was there are already factors of safety
put into these analysis packages right
what is it 1.4 and 1.74 live and dead
loads or something like that so you know
there's already some factor of safety in
there and for that uncertainty I guess
I'm all of my work has assumed that the
tools are good and that you know if if
the there's certainly a lot of work to
do to validate the energy analyses and
the structural analyses to make sure
that they are you we don't have to add
that extra factor of safety but I think
you know the work says we can include
that factor of safety into the analysis
tools if we want to and then we should
be able to optimize to that point and
not add you know all these sort of
softer factors of safety based on
designers intuition and things like that
that make sense
great looker we have time for one more
quick question browse our pastry MIT so
this is a question for you and John
since there's no panel today so trees
have evolved over billions of years of
evolution to stand tall and collect a
lot of sunlight for their energy and
given that most of us are going to be
living in cities in the future which
means we're going to have a lot of
skyscrapers do you think it's practical
to build buildings like trees where you
actually have stuff that comes up and
then branches out and then is covered
with photovoltaics to have high roof
area or do you think that would be
extremely expensive and impractical to
have all these branched structures
coming off the building you know
certainly the discussion yesterday with
the additive manufacturing I have no
precedent knowledge and what that stuff
could cost but that seemed pretty
promising that you would be able to you
know generate that kind of I guess
complexity more easily and constructed
more easily than you could today I don't
quite know what that looks like yet but
it seems like a big part of like
building that thing would be the just
cost of building such a structure and
handling all those cantilevers and
things like that but with better
structural analysis and better
construction techniques I believe we
could build something like that and
perhaps even do it in a financially
feasible way really I guess for me the
question be what are we going to put in
that building what does it need to do
you know that says John showed that
great thing about yeah
can I just and I just chime in real
quickly David branches sway a lot and
humans don't like that much acceleration
normally number one number two there are
set back laws because daylight is a
natural resource and if all the trees if
all the buildings create a canopy and
the streets are dark were unhappy so
biology can do a lot for architecture in
terms of inspiration but we have to be
careful just to copy directly and say
we've got it we're gonna buildings are
going to be trees but I I agree that
trees are an unbelievable work of
technology that we're only beginning to
understand and if buildings could be
more like trees and how they perform
absolutely but we can't translate the
metaphor directly thank you John</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
