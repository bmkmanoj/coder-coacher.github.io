MALE SPEAKER: Hello,
everybody.

Vladimir Bolatov is going
to present today.
He got his Ph.D. in quantum
physics from St. Petersburg
University.
And most recently, he is
working as a research
scientist in Shapeways, where
they're working on ways to
turn three-dimensional models
into something that can be
printed, and this is what he
will talk about today.

VLADIMIR BULATOV: Thank you very
much for the invitation.
I'll start.
So my talk is called &quot;3D
Modeling For 3D Printing.&quot; And
I will start with a few examples
of what I was doing
about 10 years ago.
I was building wood sculptures
about this size.
And here's a few examples.
This one is a small stellated
dodecahedron.
And it is based on 12 pentagonal
stars interlocked
in space, and made from
walnut and oak.
This is a very long name--
stellation of small stellated
truncated dodecahedron.
And this was actually the first
model I built, and it
was quite a challenge
to make it.
It has about 200 different
parts.
Another one is a great
dodecahedron, and 12 identical
shapes with five arms each.
And pentagonal hexecontahedron.
It has pentagonal faces, and 60
of these identical faces.
And this is a stellation of
rhombic triacontahedron.
A triacontahedron has 30 faces,
being translated in
Greek, made of maple
and purpleheart.
And this is another stellation
of a rhombic triacontahedron,
also with 30 identical faces,
but made in curl shapes.
And a stellation of
tetrakishexahedron.
It has 24 identical faces.
So how are these things
actually done?
So a traditional way of making
these is to buy nice--
first of all, to get
a lot of tools.
Like what I have, it
is a partial list--
it is table saw, drill press,
disc sander, belt sander,
router table, band saw, plenty
of dust collectors, a few of
them, different hand tools.
And the list can be continued.
Next step, it is
you get several
boards of nice hardwood.
In this case, it is walnut,
myrtlewood--
it is growing only on Oregon
coast-- then birds eye maple.
And you're making drawings,
making templates, and making
jigs for actually
building stuff.
And jigs, it is to help you
assemble pieces in space.
And building jigs usually takes
much more time than the
actual piece, because you're
making jigs to help you do
stuff, but nobody is helping
you to make jigs, which are
also complex structures.
And after that, you cut this
wood in several pieces, in
several directions.
And finally, normally it took me
about four weeks of work of
breathing wood dust, and getting
to a final assembly of
this piece.
And five years later, and it's
still collecting dust, and
it's not finished yet,
unfortunately.
It was the last piece.
After that, I stopped
doing wood.
High-tech way of
making things--

you can use a 3D printer.
And what I was doing since I
stopped doing wood, I will
show you an example of how
direct metal printing is
organized, how it is done.

Is the mouse on the screen?
No?
OK, I will try to live
without mouse.
So, it is like a big table which
has a powder supply and
building bed with
a powder bed.
And from the powder supply,
levelling roller pushes new
layers of powder to the
building carrier.
And building carrier kind of
going down, and powder
supply going up.
And every layer of this, inkjet
head, which builds
cross sections for
building parts.
So how it works schematically,
it deposits a very thin layer
of steel powder.
And the inkjet head deposits
a liquid adhesive into a
specific cross section.
You make another layer of
powder, another cross section
of adhesive.
And doing so for many hours,
but computer time
doesn't cost your time.
And finally, when the whole
piece is built, you remove the
loose powder.
And the part is heated to--
first of all, it is dried
to 300 Fahrenheit.
The water is evaporated
and glue solidified.
And the next step, the part is
heated to 2,000 Fahrenheit.
And during this process, glue
is burned out, and stainless
steel powder is sintered, and
the particles of powder
connected together, almost
melted, but not melted.
Next step, this sintered part
is brought in contact with
molten bronze.
And molten bronze, like liquid,
via capillary action,
it will fill all the voids
between particles of powder.
And so we can now remove the
cooled part down, and it is
solid composite of
steel and bronze.
And then it can be finished in
any standard way which is used
for finishing metals.
So a few examples of the metal
pieces I did using this
technology.

You can see all of them kind
of based on geometric
symmetry, some of them on
hyperbolic symmetry, some of
them on Euclidean symmetries.

Part is very, very thin bridges,
and basically, I had
several of them broken during
finishing, even.
I also did a few pendants using
hyperbolic symmetry,
another one.
And they're gold plated.
This is stainless steel again,
and several bracelets based on
hyperbolic geometry.

But there's still another way of
doing things which is kind
of a little bit more advanced
and more easy for user.
I call it the Shapeways way
of making things, which
basically, it is
outlined here.
It is several steps.
First of all, you've got idea,
and make your design the way
you can, in computer, and
upload it to Safeways.
Choose the materials, and
instantly get pricing, how
much it will cost you.
And Shapeways will fabricate
a part for you, ship to you
directly worldwide.
And basically, you've got your
part finished, and don't even
get your hands dirty.
A few short information
about Shapeways,
what it is right now.
So it is for about six years.
It is still a startup.
About two weeks ago, we got
final hopefully round of
funding that was $30
million from
investors in Silicon Valley.
And Shapeways is located in
headquarters in New York City.
And we have built so far one
million products and shipped
to customers.
And the same number, very
recently, our system
administrator got we have also
one million different parts
uploaded by users, so the count
of actually models which
we keep in our database,
also over one million.
Certainly some parts
never were printed.
Some parts were printed
in a few thousand.
So also, there are 30
different material.
And we have 80 employees
at the moment.
And it is growing every day
by number of employees.
And at this moment, we
have two factories.
One factory, it is located in
New York, in Long Island City.
And another is located in
Eindhoven in Europe.
And how actually three kinds
of users Shapeways has--

three categories of user.
One category, it is makers,
people actually who built the
product who want to do something
for themself.
And they buy the product and
they use it for whatever they
want to use.
So it is several steps, just
upload the model, create the
model, upload design.

Is better?
MALE SPEAKER: Can
everybody hear?
VLADIMIR BULATOV: Again, so
select materials and ship it.
Another category of users, it is
people who don't design the
project, the objects, but just
buy the object which we have
in a database.
And another category
of users, it is--
and basically, it's probably
most important one-- it is
people who are doing design, who
allow other users to buy
this design.
They are more serious about
designing specifically nice
and usable things which other
people will be ready to buy.
And it is basically the
base of our users.
And we have about 10,000
shop owners at
this moment at Shapeways.
So a few photos of the actual
printing process.

The printings are at different
printers, different models,
and different materials.
But all the printing is
basically done by layer by
layer in a little bit different
technologies.
Interesting part, actually,
how you extract the actual
model from the printed area.
At this moment, it is basically
a hand task to use
whatever tools are possible to
get a printed model from the
block of material
of loose powder.
And you can see on the photos,
on the left, it is
quite a dirty job.
And people, they are in
some protective gear.
You don't want to have this in
your garage shop to have all
the dust around.
And so cleaning again, and after
that, we have several
steps of post-processing
[INAUDIBLE]
with tumblers with abrasive
media and also dye, different
kind of finishing to have parts
to make it different
colors, quite a dirty
job as well.
What kind of materials you have,
all the combinations of
different finishes and
base materials, there
are about 30 of them.
But a basic one is alumide,
and plastic, a couple of
several types of--
alumide, basically it
is plastic with
the addition of aluminum.
And it is quite much stronger
than usual plastics.
Several kinds of plastics,
several types of stainless
steel, silver, we call it
full-color sandstone.
It is kind of like a plaster,
which binds with a super
glue-like binder.
And a very interesting
material is ceramics.
It is actually a clay which is
built in three dimensions,
fired, and glazed.
I also, just two examples, what
the users are doing from
these materials.
So these are materials
of plastics.
These are also several
examples of plastics.
So people are doing lamps, or
some holder for pencil, and
bookmarks, and coasters.
And these are a few examples
of alumide.
You can see it is possible
to build parts which are
interconnected, and
they are loose.
They can move independently
from each other.
It is the part on
the lower left.
And a few examples for Apple
fans, and what people are
doing with color.
What is this plastic, which is
called frosted ultra-details?
It is very, very precise, and
people are doing a lot of
building model trains, and
all kinds of models.
And what they are doing, they
paint these by hand.
MALE SPEAKER: Test, test.

VLADIMIR BULATOV:
Is it better?

Is it better?
So OK, people paint it by hand
to make actually a very good
competition to model
building industry.
Because model building industry
basically, they take
years for new models
to appear.
Now makers just create
models in one month
after object is created.
And there's a lot of people
who actually want to have
these models for themselves.
So ceramics, you can build
actual coffee cups from
ceramics, and it is very
safe material to be
safe to use for food.
And silver, it is mostly
used for jewelry.
But any application
is possible.
And stainless steel, also very
much used for jewelry.
It is one which I use myself
most of the time.
And the nice thing about all
this 3D printing is that the
cost of production has no
relation with the complexity
of the object.
This is an example of kinetic
sculptures by a sculptor from
Holland, Theo Jansen.
And he has a few meters size,
these walking sculptures.
They are basically
wind-driven.
They just walk by themself on
the beaches in Holland, which
[INAUDIBLE]
experiencing before
you see it.
But also, he made these models
available in a small scale,
about like a few inches size.
And you blow on it.
It was used like a fan,
and actually, it
will walk on the table.
And it is built as
a one-piece.
So now we are going to how
actually 3D modeling.
So the technology is
here to printing.
But how we can do--
how we can model these things
the most easy way.
Traditional 3D modeling, it
is kind of not easy task.
You have to place a few polygons
in space, somehow
arrange them.
And what I'm showing here,
it is a simple process of
refining the surface.
And finally you get a very nice
smooth surface from the
kind of original
rough polygons.
And several more real-life
examples, what I used for my
metal sculptures before.
During this refining, you have
from original shape, which is
hard to understand what it
is, and definitely has no
aesthetic values, and getting
into some nice organic shape.
And a few more examples
of these pieces.
And it is really a hard job.
There are special software
packages for
doing it, but very--
I would say, somebody counted.
There is maybe 1,000 3D
modelers in the world.
Maybe not 1,000, maybe 10,000,
but there are much more people
who can draw, and very few
people can think in terms of
triangles and points
and polygons.
But nowadays, everybody can
camera and can take pictures.
And many people just can draw
on paper and scan it.
And how we can actually give
these creative folks ability
to create complex 3D objects,
not just simple one to build a
few boxes on top of each other,
but actually something
which will be comparable
with what can be drawn.
And initial approach for
this, we just use
raster graphics in 3D.
So just a few words, difference
between vector
graphics and raster graphics.
So in vector graphics and
triangles in traditional 3D
modeling, such as a description
of objects via
vector graphics,
via triangles.
So in vector graphics,
we have shapes.
They are described as a set of
geometric drawing primitives.
But an image in raster graphics
is described as a
rectangular array of
individual pixels.
And color of each pixel is
represented via values of its
red, green, blue components.
And before, in earlier stages of
ink printing technologies,
they were based on
vector graphics.
It was like PostScript.
It's still used today.
But mostly, it was designed to
have a compact presentation.
And nowadays, it is useful as a
transfer format and a format
for drawing more
simple graphics
like maps or diagrams.
And a good compact
representation for raster
graphics was introduced much
later than the vector
graphics, like JPEG or PNG.
But today, raster graphics is
only used for photos and
video, and I guess photos and
videos, it is the most
graphics in the world
right now.
And before I joined Shapeways,
I was very familiar with
two-dimensional technology, and
can confirm that all the
modern printing technologies,
two-dimensional, they are
based on raster graphics.
Vector graphics remains
a legacy support only.
At the same time, the memory
requirement of raster graphics
is not an issue anymore.
And basically, raster graphics
is the way to go for
two-dimensional.
So how we can go with raster
graphics for a
three-dimensional object?
Most widely used 3D printing
technologies, they are based
on the slicing 3D models into
thin slices, and after that,
processing each slice using
two-dimensional image
processing algorithms.
And many of these
two-dimensional algorithms,
they are purely raster-based.
And some of the
three-dimensional printers,
they accept external 2D slices
data in the form of vector
graphics, but still
convert data
internally into raster graphics.

In slicing three-dimensional
objects, each slice gives us a
two-dimensional XY grid of
pixels And it will stack these
two-dimensional grids of pixels
on top of each other.
It is natural to handle this
stack of pixel images as a
single three-dimensional
grid of voxels.
And here, we come with the main
current software product
Shapeways is developing.
It's called AbFab, a voxel-based
toolkit.

AbFab3D--
AbFab came basically from the
developer who started this,
Alan Hudson, he's a big
fan of English sitcom.
But now it's Absolutely Fabulous
3D Printing toolkit.
And it is an open source
toolkit, and a quite liberal
GNU LGPL license.
So it is possible to use this
toolkit in a closed source
application as a library.
And this toolkit is specifically
targeted to
facilitate process of
3D printing and
modeling for 3D printing.
And version 1.0, which
is kind of--
before, there was version
zero point something.
Now version 1.0 was released
just two weeks ago.
And it is downloadable from
the website of AbFab3D.
So how actually in part of this
voxel-based library--
first of all, it has a way of
converting triangles to
voxels, triangulated polygonal
models into a voxel grid.
And it has a quite unique
algorithm, which is based on a
generalization of
two-dimensional rasterization
with the use of a multiple-layer
z-buffer.

What we can do with grids--

all kinds of transformations
which people usually have in a
vector-based space.
Like translation, if you try to
translate a grid object in
space and use a naive way of
translate coordinates of each
voxels into space, it
basically works.
But if you do some other
transformations like, for
example, scaling of the grid,
if you translate coordinates
of each voxel of original grid,
if you transform each
coordinate for each voxel,
original grid by scaling it,
you will have new grids-- in
this case, I scaled just
exactly by factor two.
New grid became just
like a bunch of
disconnected voxels in space.
So what is correct solution?
You actually you have to work
in the opposite direction.
We have to apply not a direct
transformation to the voxels
in original grid, but you
have to apply reverse
transformation to the voxels
in the destination grid.
So for each voxel in grid G2, we
have to find to which voxel
it corresponds, and sometimes in
this scale, several voxels
will correspond to the same
voxel in one grid.
But in this case, we will have
a solid filled space.
And in general, for any
transformations, we shouldn't
use a naive way of
transformations, applying
direct transformations.
But everywhere transforming
these, you should apply
inverse transformations, and
work in opposite directions.
The same way, it works for if
you want to have compositional
transformations.
And inverse of composition, it
is composition of inverse
transformation, but taken in
reverse order, which is also a
kind of important thing
to keep in mind.

Normally, inverse
transformations are really
often very difficult
to calculate.
Not all transformations can
have directly equivalent
reverse transformations,
sometimes it may be easier
sometimes, maybe difficult.
But this is one special case of
transformations which are
easy to calculate, inverse
transformation of linear
transformations, which are
represented as matrices.
And inverse transformation of
these matrices, it is just
inversion of original
matrices.
So what we can do with grids--
very simple Boolean operation.
If you want to do some union of
several objects, basically
just like we're doing it voxel
by voxel, and these
calculations are
mostly trivial.
It is for union for intersection
and for
difference.
There's a few lines of
code for actually
calculating the result.
If you compare it with taking
a union of raster-based
models, in general, it is a
very, very difficult task to
make it robust and
without problems.
And the evil is in
the details.
Most of the problems are to deal
with degenerate cases of
several triangles in one plane,
and several triangles
touching each other
over the edge.
But with voxels,
it is basically
trivial and very robust.

This is a very easy, natural
way to work with grids.
But basically, we need to
go back to triangles.
Why do we need to go
back to triangles?
Because all the current formats
which accept all the
printers, it is a vector-based
triangles format.
And also, the file size can be
much more compact, if we
convert to triangles and have
it in degrees form.
And also, visualization
is much easier when
we deal with triangles.
And a simple way of converting
back to triangles, if you will
take just isosurface of
the grid values--
for example, here is a torus.
And I intentionally took it like
a low-resolution grid.
And it is reasonable.
We have this stair structure,
which is voxel sizes.
But the problem is, it is a very
huge count of triangles.
Normally, for a reasonable size
model, it is up to 10
million triangles, and it
basically will overload any
desktop PC to display even these
10 million triangles.
What you can do is to reduce the
number of triangles using
an algorithm which is
implemented with AbFab3D, this
triangle reduction algorithm.
It joins the triangles to make
bigger size triangles.
But still, this stair step
structure remains, because it
is too rough to be able
to [INAUDIBLE]
to deal with triangle
reduction.
The solution for this is
actually, we need to get rid
of hard grid which has zero and
one variables and go to a
grid with more continuous
values.
For voxels which are
inside of the grid,
have a maximum value.
For voxels outside of the
object, have a zero value, and
voxels which intersect the
surface of the object have
some intermediate values.
And for this, the same torus
rendered on this anti-aliased
grid, we have a very
smooth torus.
And after decimation triangle
reduction, we reduced the
triangle count for
this torus from
59,000 to 3,000 triangles.
So now I will show you a simple
application, a simple
kind of real-life application
of AbFab3D.
It is called a ring creator.
And let's start.
If you want to make a ring.
Let's start with a solid block
of material, about the size of
one millimeter thick, five
millimeters wide, and 60
millimeters long.
It is basically to the size
which you need to wrap it
around your finger, with voxel
size one tenth of a
millimeter.
It actually consists of very--
the triangle count
for this block of
material is 170,000 triangles.
And we can reduce the number
of triangles for this very
easy by the decimation
algorithm.
And after that, let's take
just an arbitrary
two-dimensional image.
And this two-dimensional image
can be converted by AbFab3D.
The object [INAUDIBLE]
can create a three-dimensional
object from this initial
image, a three-dimensional
object from a
two-dimensional image.
And the image can be tiled
in both directions.
But in this case, it's only
tiled in the x direction.
And now we join this solid block
of material with this
pattern which we applied,
and bend it into a ring.
And we can add some--

subtract two-dimensional text
from inside of the ring, add a
couple of bands on both
sides of the ring.
And finally, have some rounded
profile to the ring.
This profile is not quite
visible here.
I kind of show example.
So if you'll take a plain ring,
it has this rectangle
profile, and it has
very sharp edges.
Instead, we can have like this
profile, we can draw any
two-dimensional object and
use it as this profile.
In this case, it was some kind
of rounded shape which feels
very nice on a finger.
If you needed a more fancy
profile, and an even more
fancy profile, maybe just
like a bracelet.
And it is an arbitrary image
which can be used for a shape
in each direction.
And this is basic functionality
wrapped in a
nice web-based interface which
is, right at this moment, is
[INAUDIBLE]
on the Shapeways website.
It is in a better version
tomorrow.
It will be demonstrated
on Maker Faire.
Basically it is almost ready
to go prime time.
And it all is based--
the front end, it is
on our server.
Back end, it is an application
which is part of AbFab3D.
And this application can be
customizable as a programmer
checked how it works and made
a nice, customizable other
creators for other objects.
And here is a couple of screen
shots for this web interface,
how it works.
Another application for AbFab
is something which I did for
fun for myself with this much
more complex object based on
fractal geometry on
invasive geometry.

It is a very complex set
which has no boundary.
It is like a counter set.
But at the same time, it is
possible to convert it into a
basically printable object
using AbFab3D.

And I made a few of them, and
you'll have them tomorrow on
Maker's Faire.
And that is basically it, what
I wanted to talk about.
And three links--
shapeways.com, where all of
our company stuff is.
AbFab3D, it is where this voxel
modeling library is.
And my website, bulatov.org.
It is where I have my sculptures
and my jewelry.
Thank you very much.
[APPLAUSE]
VLADIMIR BULATOV: So
I guess, questions.

AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

to make a regular-- make one
of those fractal balls?

VLADIMIR BULATOV: Repeat
the question--
how much it costs
to make things.
The cost is basically measured
by amount of materials.
For these rings, it is like, if
you want to make them from
steel, it will be under
$10, maybe $5, $8.
If it is from silver,
it may be somewhere
going like $30 or something.
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
What's the biggest thing
you can print?

VLADIMIR BULATOV: The build area
for our steel printers is
about one meter by a half meter
by a quarter meter.
And I was given a quote on
how much it would cost.
It was $15,000 to print
this build area.
And it was out of the question,
actually building this.

AUDIENCE: What's the main
component of the cost?
Is it machine time?
Is it the cost of
raw materials?
Something else?
VLADIMIR BULATOV: You know how
HP is doing business model of
printing on paper?
They sell you a printer for
free, and charge you a hand
and a leg for ink.
It is a business model which has
no relation with actually
how much stuff costs.
So basically, like
for 3D printing,
materials cost something.
I don't know who's charging
for them, who decides they
should cost this much.
It is demand and supply.

So far, nobody gives away
3D printers for free.
Maybe in 10 years, 3D printers
will be given for free, and
materials will cost a lot.
At this moment, if you're using
Shapeways, you don't pay
for printer.
You pay for the object
you made.

AUDIENCE: So when you're working
with tool steel, one
of the problems is that when
you set it, it can warp a
little bit.
Do you have any problems with
additional change on cooling
when you're doing
the sintering?
VLADIMIR BULATOV: Yeah.
It is some reduction point--
there is some percent of
reduction in size.
which is taken into account
before actually you send a
model to the printer.
AUDIENCE: So if I print a
large-ish stainless steel
thing, and then I have
it filled with
bronze, I can count on--

VLADIMIR BULATOV:
People who are
actually running the process--
it is many years of--
they try to take it
into account.

The reality is, sometimes
the model breaks.
Maybe somebody just slams the
door next to the printer, and
somewhere separation happens.
There is still--
it just breaks.
There's no reason.
Sometimes they break during
this cooling,
heating, and annealing.
There's no reason.

It is a little bit like
magic, still.
AUDIENCE: OK, thanks.
AUDIENCE: So these complex
dodecahedrons [INAUDIBLE], how
did you model those?
How did you use your
own software?
VLADIMIR BULATOV: Yeah.

How I model these dodecahedrons
which I did show
in the beginning of the talk.
Yes, I wrote my own
software for this.
Basically, like every model was
a specific piece of code.
And some friends worked to make
a user interface to help
to model it.

MALE SPEAKER: If there are
no more questions--
VLADIMIR BULATOV: There's
another one.
MALE SPEAKER: Oh, another
question.
AUDIENCE: How far away are we
from being able to print in
multiple materials?

VLADIMIR BULATOV: People
are already building
with multiple materials.
And we are trying, at least in
AbFab3D we are trying to
already support multiple
materials.
We don't have this technology
at Shapeways yet.
But we don't develop printing
technology.
But there is a lot
of experiments
with multiple materials.
Specifically, it seems to me,
people printing objects with
circuit boards already built
in, so you just plug it in,
and it will do some
funny stuff.
MALE SPEAKER: So pretty close?
VLADIMIR BULATOV: I guess
it is five years.
It is a good number.
I mean, in term of availability
for commercially,
I'm pretty sure that it is very
close to this number.

MALE SPEAKER: All right.
If there are no questions,
we're going
to thank our speaker.
[APPLAUSE]
VLADIMIR BULATOV: Thank you.
