invitation to this wonderful place and
I'm glad I have an opportunity to say
something about my favorite topic which
is to attack problems or just shortly to
our games so there will be several parts
in this talk the first one is about
graph colorings this will be more
concretely non-repetitive colorings of
graphs and this this area starts with
that very nice tialan discovered many
years ago by Oxford to em some of you
may probably know it so the theorem says
that there is a three coloring of the
integers such that no two adjacent
segments have exactly the same color
pattern what I mean by color pattern so
we can think about integers as a
vertices of an infinite paths and well a
coloring is just an assignment of colors
to these vertices so we have three
colors red blue and yellow and the
property is that whenever we take a look
at two adjacent segments the color
patterns must differ at least at one
place so for instance we can see here on
this example two blocks two adjacent
blocks such that the color pattern
agrees at first three positions ok we
have yellow at first position of the
first block and also yellow in a second
block the same place then blue and red
but they differ at the last place ok so
the property once again is that any two
adjacent blocks must have different
color patterns
they should differ in at least one place
okay so the proof of this theorem is not
hard if you if you know the trick the
following the argument is very easy but
I think that it was quite quite
mysterious how to started to think about
such properties anyway so the proof is
algorithmic constructive we have a very
simple procedure to produce such such
colorings not let's think about more
difficult structure let's let's take a
huge graph so this picture is just a
metaphor of a huge graph and we can
think about colorings of the vertices of
the graph by some colors and what what I
mean by this example is a kind of a
repetitive path so what we see here is a
sequence of vertices along a path which
which have exactly the same color
pattern such thing is forbidden in a non
repetitive coloring of the graph so we
are trying to color the vertices of the
graph in such a way that there will be
no repetitive part of any length so for
instance two adjacent vertices must be
colored differently so this beast
coloring is in particularly proper
coloring of the graph but also there
cannot be a path like abap or any any
any length and if graph is huge but
finite of course we can do it with with
a finite number of columns we can for
instance give a different color to every
vertex and using many colors we can
Shiva non-repetitive coloring but of
course the task the question is how
small number of colors will be
sufficient to achieve this goal and a
natural parameter is the to a chromatic
number of the graph which is the minimum
number of colors needed to a
non-repetitive color into the ground and
I decided to denote it by pie orgy any
questions ok and of course of course
what we are interested in in questions
like is this to a chromatic number
bounded for instance for graphs of
bounded maximum degree for which classes
of grass is this parameter bounded
independently of the size of graph and
we have some some nice results I guess
for instance we could prove that if we
restrict our graphs to such class that
have bounded maximum degree then the
number of colors we need for another
budget of coloring is at most 16 times
Delta square or Delta is the maximum
degree so for instance if Delta is equal
to we have only parts or cycles so just
by three trm we have a finite finite
bound for this parameter for party three
four cycles it at most four so this
bound is even even too large but even
for graphs with delta equal to three so
the so-called cubic graphs it is already
non-trivial to prove that that that in
fact this to it from
number is bounded by some constant and
the proof of this theorem is also not
very difficult but it uses a very
sophisticated tool the so-called lavas
local level this is the probabilistic
tool so so so the idea is just to take a
random coloring of the graph so we have
this number of colors and we choose a
color for a vertex random with
independently for for every vertex and
then we use this magical inovas local
lemma which allows us to show that the
probability that there exists a good
coloring is strictly greater than zero
so there must be such colorings and once
again even for that are equal to three
we cannot we do not have any any
constructive way to prove it only this
one constructive existence probabilistic
argument so it would be nice to find
some other way to prove for instance
even for cubic graph that the piece is
finite on the other hand also using
probabilistic method we could prove that
this bound this delta square is
asymptotically almost tied because for
each day there are graphs that demand at
least our delta square over log delta
colors in a non repetitive coloring so
on it is this factor of log Delta e sees
eventually
so asymptotically they do this
probabilistic upper bound this is almost
correct okay I because I I will not go
into details no proofs only results and
open problems another nice result done
some years ago by England and perspire
asserts that this toy chromatic number
is bounded for graphs of bounded three
width I hope you all know what is a
three week or shall I explain it for
instance trees have three with one and
trees can be defined as grass such that
we start with one vertex and then we in
every in every step we add new vertex
and join it to some some vertex in a
previous graph so for instance to tree
can be defined similarly and we start
with one edge and then at each step we
add a new vertex and we join it to two
vertices that are joined by an edge and
the same with three trees four trees and
so on and three week is the smallest
trivet of a graph is the smallest k such
that this graph is a subgraph of some k3
and again if we restrict ourselves to
graphs of boundary with this to a
chromatic number is also bounded by an
exponential function but anyway it is it
is at least finite and as you see there
are even trees with arbitrarily large
maximum degree so the previous theorem
didn't imply that doesn't imply that
next one the method is different
okay in the first open problem my
favorite one and many experts think that
this is most exciting and most difficult
problem in this area it concerns planner
grass so this picture is just to make
your imagination in this area we are
thinking about very large but plan our
graphs the plan our graph you know it is
a graph and be embedded in a surface of
a sphere such that the edges do not
cross so we have a huge platter graph
and the question is how many colors are
needed in a non repetitive coloring my
break conjecture is that some finite
number of colors is sufficient this
number actually in this conjecture is
not accidental but let me skip
explanation of of this number to the end
of the top so if you want to prove this
conjecture you should show that every
plan our graph has a color ink which is
non-repetitive using at most this number
of course if you want to disprove it you
should find a graph that demands more
colors and of course my question then
will be whether whether any larger
number of color is sufficient so if you
want to destroy the whole conjecture you
should find a sequence of planar graphs
that demand more and more colors
in a non repetitive color
so probably this this previous
conjecture is just a eyes just a small
part of greater greater idea greater
supposition well maybe even this is true
that if we have any proper but early any
class of grass which consists not of all
graphs which is minor clause which means
that if we have a graph from the class
than the minor of this graph is also in
this class pencil paragraphs have this
property okay and what what is a minor
so this picture explains what is a minor
so for a week we have a graph and we can
speak about minor in such a graph if we
can find a disjoint sub graphs which are
connected and there are at least one
edge between these these sub graphs so
for instance here we see we see a minor
of a click on four vertices now there
are the other way of explaining my nose
is by contraction of edges when it's as
if we if we contract the edges in a one
connected graph we will get only one
vertex so after contraction will get
just the click on four vertices and once
again climber graphs can be defined as
as graph that do not contain a minor of
k 5 or K 3 3 and clearly this is a cross
cook the closed form for taking minus so
this conjecture is much more much more
general and much stronger than the
previous one if this is true of course
or toddlers where this is true
but photographs again form something
like like a very nice geometric special
case in this problem because because a
very deep theorem by Robertson and savor
the theorem says that if we have a graph
and we forbid these gravures at mine are
we get a class of grass without this
graph as minor poisons populace for bit
k 5 and we'll get a class which is
larger event in paragraphs and the
theorem says that graphs in this class
will have a bounded three wit if and
only if this forbidden graph is planar
okay so this term implies that the
conjecture for planner that that in
other words that planner graphs for the
smallest possible class for which this
this conjecture is open due to the
previous result of Kincannon perspire
that for graphs impounded three wait we
have bounded to a chromatic number
ha not now I have some some results for
a restricted version of the problem if
it is difficult to control repetitions
on parts of any length let's let's let's
think about the simple problem when we
just take care of parts of bounded
length then we can prove much more for
instance if you have any proper minor
closed class and the length of this
forbidden repetitions is fixed is
bounded then we can achieve proper
colorings just using finite may be large
but finite number of colors ok so so for
instance if r is equal to 1 then we just
take care about two adjacent vertices we
get the usual chromatic number and of
course this this chromatic number is
finite for for such classes but if we
take for instance are equal to two will
get so-called star colorings so no two
adjacent vertices get the same color as
well as there are no parts of the form
abap and if you think for a little while
you will see that in such colorings if
we have to color classes then the graph
spend by by these two classes is just a
star forest and it was also investigated
and even in some simple case we have no
exact bounce even for planar graphs it
is known that the star chromatic number
four
versus at most 20 I guess and there are
graphs that demand 10 colors for
instance in the whole problem this R can
be arbitrarily large but if you restrict
our to some finite and just take care
about bounded parts of bounded line we
get you get this type of result and
moreover the coloring that that we
achieve from from from this method are
much more general much stronger for
instance we can even assign lists of
colors for each vertex of some
sufficiently large size and then we take
colors four vertices from these lists
and obtain a proper coloring in this way
and also the method gives a game
coloring version of the problem in a
game coloring version and the situation
is as follows we have a graph and two
players say n in bed and they call our
vertices alternately and for instance if
r is equal to 1 in a classical case the
rule is that none of the players is
allowed to color adjacent vertices with
the same color first of all but the
goals are different and this goal is to
color the whole graph while Dan's goal
is to achieve a partial coloring that
cannot be extended anymore if the number
of colors is fixed of course this
situation can happen if there is for
instance and colored vertex and all
colors are on its neighbors then there
is no no colorful for these products so
even in this game version this this
number is finite
and it has strategy with sufficiently
none large number of colors to get not
only a proper about non-repetitive
coloring with this with this restriction
to the path of bounded length but we're
speaking of least version i have another
conjecture so the conjecture is that if
we have a path of any length and lists
of size three assigned to each vertex
and we can choose colors from this list
two vertices such that the resulting
coloring will be non-repetitive this
seems like something easier even than to
a theorem because into a theorem we have
the same set of colors for every vertex
what can go wrong if we have different
lists of colors for different vertices
this is something counterintuitive but
there are examples in the usual graph
coloring that we have for instance are
bipartite graphs can be just took over
and such that in a least version this
this list coloring the list chromatic
number will be unbounded okay so this is
may be counterintuitive and this is also
a nobody who could prove it so far but
using the probabilistic matter we can
prove that 16 is a is a is a bound for
the size of this list so if there are 16
colors at least we can do it and again
the coloring the coloring is random
using this
magical of us locally
finally some games in this in this to a
fashion so this is the second part of
the talk so as I said before we have two
players and then and he's a clever girl
bernie's maybe some kind of well random
player but he will not certainly will
not be cooperating with her and the
point of the game is a long path they
have they have a fixed set of colors for
instance three colors and they will
color this path consecutively and outer
lately so for instance and stars and
band and add a color consecutive
vertices of on this part and the main
role is that none of them can create a
repetition but ends goal is to color the
whole part in this way while Ben will
try to prevent it from happening so he
will try to color in such a way that at
some moment continuing without creating
a repetition will not be possible let's
see a simple example for instance and
can play greedily should we should use
the first the first available color so
she starts to be yellow for instance
then when of course must use a different
color cannot do the same because this
will be repetition and you lose then and
of course in his in hell in her stupid
greedy strategy uses yellow okay it's
fine but now then can use what color
certainly not yellow but also not read
because there will be a repetition
yellow red yellow red so he must use
blue only three colors I let's mess
think that n plays again by yellow then
then must use red and now the last last
movie n again by yellow and the game
finishes now has he seen easily so even
even the den cannot make a move he's a
winner because he says okay I have no
more colors to to satisfy this rule and
not the whole part is colored so than in
the winner nevertheless my conjecture is
that n has a strategy in this in this to
again even if there are only three
colors at the disposal I'm not sure why
am I believe in this conjecture again if
it is not showing three colors i will
ask you about four or five or any final
round and i think that it can be proved
that there is a final part but with
three colors this is this is off
exciting of course
I think that there is even a result I'm
not completely sure about what I what I
showed you here but I think it can be
proved Sultan what I want to say that
the result of this this guy is about
some little different game where in fact
then is allowed to to play the same
color in a row but and you can prevent
repetitions of larger leg so he proved
something like this so if the
repetitions of just length two are
allowed then still n can control a
period of repetitions of larger length
so I think this this also at least the
method can be applied for for such a
result for this original game and
another game that came to my mind some
time ago in Krakov here we have the same
end but different different band because
the the game is now a little bit
different so n will be coloring vertices
well then we'll be presenting new
vertices so the game starts with just
one edge will with different colors on
the end point and then Ben is putting a
new vertex on an edge ok so again the
thing that there are three colors or
banded number of course and n must color
immediately this new vertex in such a
way that the whole part is colored long
repetitive so again Bank chooses an edge
puts a puts a new vertex there Oh
these TV is too short I can see the last
vertex on my screen anyway so the game
continues and as I said that every every
move bands move he adds new vertex is
something like subdivision of an edge
and okay so his goal is of course to
achieve a situation when when and will
not have any available color to to
satisfy this this this property and now
a conjecture is that n wings with five
colors I guess someone showed me a
strategy for ban even with four colors
or three colors certainly are not
sufficient or even four colors are not
enough but maybe five or I will be
satisfied with any with a result that
that shows any finite bounded game I
call it online to a day it's probably
good name because these vertices appear
somehow
in an online fashion and speaking about
subdivisions okay first first success
suppose we have a large click of course
the usual chromatic number as well as
the to a chromatic number is equal to
the number of vertices of subject but
how much can we lower to a chromatic
number by making a subdivision so we add
new vertices as many as we wish on a
very edge and we will we get then
subdivided Greek and the question is how
how small to a chromatic number can be G
and in fact it can be proved pretty
easily that we can go down to five with
every every click every no matter how
large by sufficiently large subdivisions
we have to add many vertices on the
edges but eventually we will get a graph
with to a chromatic number not five then
some guys proved that even we can
achieve it with four colors but recently
two students from a kalonian university
could prove the the best possible result
they showed that in fact it is always
possible to achieve a subdivision that
demands not more than three colors
and the proof is not completely true
though I think it's given ingenious
sometimes but it uses it uses original
tour sequences so they take special
special class of 20 sequences and they
just put it put them in a proper way on
this graph to achieve to achieve the
goal okay let me say a few words about
about another topic that that is
connected to all these of this area this
is the something widget which could be
called necklace PT and the first problem
is probably due to a dash others ask the
following question in 1961 can we color
positive integers with four colors but
in such a way that not only the adjacent
segments are have different color
patterns but the coloring is stronger in
the sense that the must be at least one
color cause number of occurrences one
segment is different than in the other
so here we have an example of such color
in curry we can see that in these two
segments blue appears only once in
another segment and twice in a second
sir this is a stronger coral in color
ink and once bulla bulla basoski white
white elders asked about four and i
answered probably because three is not
sufficient so he certainly check that if
you want to find such coloring given a
segment of length i guess eight or ten
maybe you just cannot do it with three
colors so then the next question is is
for of course but
but why far is he see Sir is is best
possible for some time was even not
clear whether there is any finite bomb
but for for such color but it was proved
by the eve dokey mob that 25 colors are
sufficient then pleasant slower this 2
504 for many years it was open with a 5
is best partly he's the best result or
maybe we can do it with four colors
finally cannon included in fact four
colors are enough but in this last
result some computers were useful for
verifications of the construction of
this coloring is really really really
difficult and as I said this is one of
these results were we have a
mathematical crew but we have to use
computers for some verification
oh here i have another another result so
this is this is a continuous version of
elders problem let's think about
coloring not not the positive integers
but the real line continuous object and
what will be the analog of the others
property first of all we have to do it
in such way that points in one color
occupied a measurable set in an inner
usual sense with the set some lebesgue
measure so if I say we take a look at
some interval there should be a some
amount of the color which is expressible
as a real number okay and the analog was
property would be that that if we have
two adjacent segments that there is at
least one color whose measure is
different in one segment than the other
and too clever students from elon
university again could prove my
conjecture that there is a finite
coloring this property but a funny thing
is that in fact they prove that fall
colors are enough in such coloring so
there is a for coloring such that
whenever we take two adjacent segments
on the real line there will be
distinguished by measure okay here I
have a son picture which is probably not
very intelligent
I wanted to decided we have this segment
and we take all points in one color and
we form a segment of these points then
we will get some some kind of segment
color ink and as you see segments in one
color matte must be longer in 11
interval than in the other what is even
more surprising they method allowed to
to prove something much more much
stronger about that with one color more
even so there is a 5 coloring such that
not only adjacent segments can be
distinguished by measure about anything
segments on the real line so this is
really incredible the method is again
non-constructive cannot find any video
that such things exist but we cannot we
cannot see it or defining it in some
sensible way but what about necklace
splitting so let's let's adopt a
definition that the necklace is just an
interval colored with some colors and
and the points in one color for my
measuring set and suppose so this is a
necklace and supposed to thieves stole a
necklace and want to cut it and and
split it between them in a in a proper
way in a fair way so I mean that each of
them should get the same amount of each
color so after this splitting these
pieces should should be possible to to
form two families so that the amount of
one color in one family is
exactly the same as India this is a fire
speaking of a necklace and the size of
splitting is the number of cuts okay so
here we have a splitting of size 3 there
is a very nice theorem which uses
topological metals which are says that
you will have a que color interval then
k cards are sufficient for such very
speaking the profuse is a famous
possible up the earth so any any k
colored integra has a speaking of size
most k 0 so maybe maybe one comment
about what what what it has to do with
with this elders property of course in
this continuous motion for instance if
we have a interval if we have two
adjacent intervals which are
distinguished by measure we can express
it in the following way we have an
interval that cannot be splitted finally
just buy one card okay because one card
should be in the middle and we will have
the same amount on both sides so going
in this direction we could prove a more
general tier so the previous theorem by
these two young guys was for k equal one
now interval has fitting of size 1 but
it can be proved that this is true for
any K so for any K we have a cape lat
three color in coloring of the right
such that no interval splitting of size
of decay this is really very incredible
do you agree
but this is a nice theorem okay and this
is a continuous version but we can go
back now to to to a discrete world and
we also have a discrete version of this
necklace splitting theorem so now our
necklace is just a path colored by some
number of colors and we should assume
that the number of vertices in one color
it's even such that this failure
splitting should be possible so here is
an example of a splitting which is fair
because we can form two families of
these pieces one family for one thief
the other two the second and each of
them gets the same number of beads in
any given color and there is there is a
theorem which asserts the same as for
for a continuous version that each cake
ala gly class has a speaking of size of
most K again the method is by or so cool
cool onteora but now my conjecture is
that something like this theorem for the
real line should be may be possible for
coloring of the integers so as you see
in this bridge conjecture if k is equal
1 we get exactly the others problem okay
k is equal 1 we get a for coloring such
that no segment as a splitting with one
cut this is the same as saying that
there are no two adjacent segments with
the same number of occurrences of the
color
it is open for k equal to and I don't
know if there's any finite dog or a
large okay i guess i guess there should
be but i'm not sure if this is a plus
three and finally the last chapter the
last part of my talk is is devoted to a
another version of this tool to a tight
colorings this time we will use numbers
as scholars and here is a very nice
problem she's still open and calls for
for solution we are coloring the
integers by numbers so so okay we can
imagine colors but we can put numbers
instead of colors red is one blue is to
it positive integers and now we demand
that the sun's in adjacent segments the
sons of these numbers should be
different in segments of the same length
so for instance here we have a good
coloring in all proper sentences into a
science in other sense but in this
addictive science it is not good because
the sum in the last segment is exactly
the same as in the second segment so
again the question is whether there is
any finite k so that we will have a
coloring with cake integers from walmart
okay so that any tool segments of the
same thing you have different sounds I
don't know how to prove it but i'll be
very happy to see a proof or a counter
example of course
another believe it is true that there is
a finite color and another fun I think
about the about this area is that there
are some problems which are completely
differently motivated came from
different places and have the same
flavor for instance is a very nice new
new question in graph theory which in my
my son's has the flavor of off to a
problem at least in this additive sense
of what is the problem we have a graph
and we label its edges by integers 1 2 3
up to son maybe bowels sak and then for
every vertex we we complete we add the
numbers which lie on this edges incident
so for instance this red vertex is
adjacent to two edges labeled by one and
two so the Sam computed around it is is
three and then we assign this Sam's two
vertices and the property is that look
for is that these sons should form a
proper coloring of the graph so adjacent
vertices of the graph should get
different sounds ok so this quite
similar to the previous problem where we
want different sons in adjacent segments
here we want different sons around
adjacent vertices
and there is a there is a very nice
question or supposition that every
connected graph except one ad because
for one that we cannot do it of course
we'll have such labeling just by three
numbers one two and three okay so that
so using just three numbers you should
be able to do such a laboring for a
graph without without isolated edge side
and again it was not clear from the
beginning that there is any final bout
first bounded was produce Paul was
probably 33 cause then then the
improvement was to 16 colors but now the
best result is only five so recently
karnofsky Karan iskcon defender could do
the numbers from one half to five are
sufficient the proof is really again a
very very very nice trick a much easier
than the previous proves that with this
dis larger larger bounds
okay so i think i think that this
conjunction will be proved maybe or
maybe this is something like for quality
are very so again in a four-color
problem we could prove easily six colors
five then would further really really
difficult thing to do one approach to
this to this problem is to use out the
bright method so i will not go into
details but we do something like
assigning a special polynomial to a
graph in such a way that if we have a
nonzero substitution in this polynomial
it finds out some vector the polynomial
has many vampire evil so you can find a
vector that is substituted to the
polynomial gives a nonzero value will
solution for such thing and using this
method we could prove something stronger
but just for some classes of breath so
for instance for creeks are bipartite
complete grass or trees we could prove
that this conjecture is true in a
stronger sense mainly in the least sense
so we have a list of three quater three
numbers for every agent Lee chose these
numbers from this from this list and of
course my conjecture is that the the
answer is positive not only with one two
three button any lists of size three
and here is a very recent version of
this problem where we put labels not on
the edges at 136 autographs of a vertex
version of a previous problem so what we
are doing we are assigning car numbers
from 1 up to K vertices and we compute a
son for every vertex they can over its
neighbors we do not we do not take the
label our vertex itself so for instance
these upper vertex two neighbors with
labels one and two so it's a mystery and
again we want to obtain a proper
coloring in this way here is a very
brave conjecture that for every graph
top ok I I call such labeling and lucky
labeling so if this kind of property
labeling is lucky if we have some luck
approaching and the conjecture is that
if we have a graph of G sky color able
then we can do this like labels from one
after k why it is brave because we know
it's true for clicks if you have a click
we must use numbers from 1 up to the
number of vertices of the screen clearly
we cannot we cannot we cannot repeat any
any color this is not modern evidence of
course for the conjecture but in fact
this is open even for bipartite graph so
we where you have a bipartite graph
which is two colorable can we do this
labeling just using one and two we do
not know if the answer is positive even
even it is not clear whether for
bipartite graphs you have some finite
we have some partial results for
instance we could pull by this algebraic
method that we take bipartite graphs
with are bounded every city what is a
velocity this is a so we can split the
edges of a graph and in such a way that
the edges in 11 class format forest long
cycles in one class and Arbor icity is
just the minimum number of parts in such
a composition and we have bipartite
graphs of bounded arbor ECT we can do
this lucky labeling just using one more
color this can be put by by this
algebraic method but is not very hard
but uses a sophisticated tool so for
instance for bipartite planar graphs we
can prove that three three colors three
rivers one two three hours efficient
because bipartite planar graphs have a
velocity to I guess any any chemical we
went in the version with with lists ok
so the stronger the stronger result and
here is an explanation of this constant
that appeared in the previous on a
previous slide for the for the
conjecture with the to a chromatic
number of paragraphs so we could prove
that the lucky number is the minimum
number of labels that allows for a like
me leyburn ghagra for planar graphs is
at most this number so this is huge
probably Tuvok to huge the conjecture
that only for labels are sufficient but
at least we have a finite bound and I
should also say that there is an
improvement I was I was a few days ago
on a conference when I presented this
result and said that I I have a price
for anybody who can lower this bound at
least by one the price will be a bottle
of one and after the talk
or in the evening maybe a guy from
Princeton seminarian showed me a proof
with much lower number than this one so
but still still must be good and for
okay so summarizing this is this talk
let me let me say a few general words so
this looks like like a starting point of
something which I could call it to 80 or
so we have many different problems of
the same flavor what is this flavor we
have some structures and combinatorial
structure graph or or a powerful or an
order and eat anything and we have some
favorite substructures so for instance
in this to a tower and the structure is
just a leaner order and sub structure
are Georgie's intervals or or segments
solver and we have some adjacency
relation on these substructures we can
speak about the Jason segments some
segments are not motor Jason some summer
projects and the task is to color the
structure the points of the structure in
such a way that these adjacent
substructures will be distinguished in
some way so this is the this is the
general philosophy of this to a theory
and let me finish with one in one
example of an airy area resulting in
this direction that came to my mind some
years ago so we have we have a plane a
usual Euclidean plane and we want to and
we color the points of the plane and we
want to distinguish topological disks so
usual disk is just just a disk but a
topological disk is
the shape which is which is obtained by
some topological deformation of such a
tease well to such DS and when when I
what are the color differently we can be
distinguished then well maybe it's
better to say when they are similarly
colored two disks are called similarly
if we can transform one disk onto the
other in such a way that the the colors
of every points will agree so the color
of our point in one this will be the
same as a color of each image to end
without the topological disk colored
differently if doing any transformation
there will always be a point in one disk
which is colored differently than its
image believe me or not but there is a 2
coloring of the plane such that no two
topological discs are colored similarly
in this way so we can take any shapes
and we could try any transformations
there will always be some some some some
difference
