president and the founder of the
relative happiness index okay I know
what you must be thinking another crazy
dreamer another gimmick about happiness
another who believes you succeeded to
put a penis in a box and ready to
manufacture it I cannot blame you
because if you type the word a penis in
Google you will have the choice between
382 billion results at least that was a
number of results that I found the last
time I searched I didn't consult every
article for my google but I can bad bet
that the y majority of these articles
were superficial articles based on
esoteric notions and psycho pop rather
than irrational or scientific approach
many many people take advantage of
society's fault perception of happiness
it's a very profitable industry we are
talking about trillions of dollars and
why is this industry so profitable
because of course happiness can be
anything it is a fuzzy concept which
people use and abuse without guilt in a
society where everyone is searching for
their identity and their place where the
quest of census takes any direction the
sellers of Dreams make very good
business for me happiness is everything
except that the index I've created in
2006 goes in a total opposite direction
in fact happiness for me has become a
concrete notion a true variable one that
adds something more human and social to
the traditional economical and financial
data one that gives a different
perspective when comes a time to
evaluate the status and the situation of
a society a community or group
okay there are probably a lot of
skeptical people among you so my
objective with this presentation will be
to change your minds to interest you in
this index a powerful one that contains
the potential to improve our societies
and our individual and collective
happiness but what is the relative
happen index it's very simple it's a
self assessment of our own state of mind
despite all the modern technology and
all the sophisticated instruments
happiness is still a mystery and no one
is able to evaluate the level of
happiness of the other what is going to
make your happiness it's not going to
make mine and what makes mine is not
going to make sewers it is as everyone
knows a relative and subjective notion
even today the only way to evaluate the
level of happiness of someone is to ask
him simply and to transfer this
evaluation on a scale of 10 or 100 this
is exactly what the relative happiness
index does even John Zielinski director
of the app in this laboratory of culture
and university in ottawa after many
years of research makes the same
conclusion the relative happiness index
is based on the self-assessment of the
individuals but you are the years the
RHI has also become a statistical index
a scientific and a mathematical one and
index we can integrate inside a model or
system allow me to return briefly to the
past in 2006 by pure chance I watch a TV
program that was a debate between two
opposing groups the question was the
following is the province of Quebec the
only french-speaking province in Canada
a poor society interesting subject but
after 30 minutes of fertile discussion
debaters only use financial and
economical data to
justified and support their position no
one was 30 minutes later more informed
and more able to know if Quebec was a
poor society myself included they missed
the most important thing the most
essential information instead of knowing
in Quebec society is poor not can we try
to know if the society is IP or not this
question seems fundamental to me the
wealth in this context becomes accessory
to a more important notion the idea to
create an index that measures the
happiness of a society or a community
came in my mind at that precise moment
the idea to create a human index but a
credible 12 to make a true variable from
a penis a serious one that could be used
in different way than selling books
dealing with personal growth in my
craziest dreams I saw the enormous
potential in this index and
international index that evaluates the
level of happiness by country by state
by city a comparative index giving
precious information to leaders that
could be used to bringing solution to
the different populations and improving
their level of happiness if it's true
that information is power it is a
quality true that a penis is information
the best way to act on something is to
know and to understand the subject very
well so I spent the last five year
studying happiness and I wanted that the
RHI to be a different to the other
indexes I wanted to make it source and
it routes from the individuals you know
the United Nation I declare that Denmark
was the obvious country in the world
maybe but did we ask the Bandit the
Danish people if they are happy probably
they are but as IP as the indicators
tell us all the contest about happiness
are inspired by the same principle
they use 20 30 40 indicators often
different from a study to another they
allow a relative importance to each of
them they weighed them the shake them up
the winner is the contest or dis
contests are useful no doubt about it
but what they really say is that
according to the indicators used in the
study the people of such country or city
must be happiest are they this is
another question it is not because
indicators says something that
automatically the people who these
people are the appulous ones the RH I
proceeds totally in rivers no indicator
is used everything starts from the
self-assessment of the individuals
because they are the only one able to do
so it took almost a year to validate the
theory behind rhi and to create the
website for major principles supported
the creation of the syndics the first
one was if we ask people to answer
personal question they would be honest
enough to ensure with integrity all the
surveys are based on this principle the
question about the self assessment of
their level of happiness would be part
of every single questionnaire the second
principle was that if we ask a lot of
complementary questions it would be
possible to cross data with
self-assessment and analyze the
fluctuation and the variation of the a
penis level link to the entropy
aventures given pure statistic and very
simple the third principle depend on the
quality and the credibility of the
information published on the side
journalists should be interested by this
information and mention it in their own
media by consequence they are going to
push their clients to visit the RHI
website to know more about this subject
mentioned the fourth principle was
relied on the voluntary participation of
the
deters to answer the online
questionnaire where they will be
automatically and systematically called
upon to evaluate the actual level of
happiness these four principles work
beyond all expectations in five years
the RHI has become in the Quebec
province a genuine independent social
observatory with an impressive data bank
40 acquire ease completed in the last
five years more than 800 questions asked
no one sponsored over 70,000 cab occurs
who were interrogated more than 500
articles written and published on the
website imagine all this information but
on a worldwide scale an information that
is rich intelligent contemporary and
useful an information that covers all
spheres of life politic culture economy
environment family work education life
habit relation between men and women
dead and so on there is no limit to the
question we can ask and to the analysis
we can make this worth of data makes it
possible in the last year to identify
and wait 24 a penis influence factors
and classify them by order of importance
to identify and wait the five a penis
factors at work and to develop a
specific tool to diagnose and propose
solutions to improve it there are H I
which the data accumulated in the last
five years goes several step forward
than anyone as before its biggest
strength is to make concrete something
that wasn't before to determine and
calculate the different influence
factors by establishing impacts
correlations and relations from the
causes to the effects
the most popular example sure money
everyone knows that money helps
happiness but in which way up until what
point now thanks to the RHI it can be
done and calculated systematically on 14
queries realized since five years the
people who declare the lower income
after rhi from nine to twelve points
lower than the ones who declare the IOUs
and cons the curve as you can see on the
graph is almost always directly
proportional doesn't mean that the
richest people are automatically happy
and the less fortunate have misfortune
hanging over their heads but we know now
the influence of money on the level of
happiness in fact money or the personal
financial situation occupies the fifth
position under 24 a penis influence
factors also it's important to note that
this factor like the 23 others is
sub-divided in many different attitudes
and behaviors that influence different
to the level of happiness of people and
be careful the curve of happiness
declines after a certain point and
become flat there's no gap between the
one we declare two hundred thousand
dollars and the other who declares three
hundred thousand dollars and at the
moment you give too much importance to
the money factor or if money becomes
your first motivation in life your level
of happiness decreases and becomes lower
that the population average don't forget
money makes up here but not better I
could spend our talking about money but
let's go with some other information
another more important factor work
everyone knows the importance of our
work in our lives many define themselves
more by their job than by the person
they are so consequently it's much
better to light one job if not the
impact on the level of happiness
catastrophe this graph show the gap of
the RH I between the ones who are fully
satisfied about with their job and the
others who are not imagine 30 points
we're not talking about a gap but more
about a ditch which this numbers no one
would be surprised to know that work is
the third a penis influence factor on 24
and for those who have a doubt they they
must know that eighty percent of people
consider it impossible to be IP without
a fully satisfying job in comparison
only sixty percent believe that is
impossible to be happy without feeling
love with another person consequently
love occupies the sixth position on the
24 factors just after money happiness at
work or satisfying job is defined by
five essential elements that influence
employees in this order of importance
first self-realization second labor
relations third recognition for
accountability and five remuneration you
are probably asking yourself what is the
number one a penis influence factor well
it's the feeling of achievement the
satisfaction about our lives and what we
made in what we make of it it is very
simple achievement is like the puzzle
theory take two pieces of a puzzle one
represents the life you dream of the
second represents you realize the life
you have to other feeling of achievement
and a penis the two pieces have to fit
one in the other more it's difficult to
accomplish more you're feeling of
achievement is weak and if it's simply
impossible to fit one piece of a puzzle
in the other you are in a big trouble as
you can see in the following graph where
you can see the difference of the RH I
between the one we live the drivers
believe the dream of and the other one
not
live the live the dream of in fact
achievement it's a very broad feeling
that take its source from the 23 other
happiness influence factor I could stand
here for hours talking about each of
these 24 factors and show you graphs
data numbers and numerous element but
time is running out and I just want to
explain quickly some others family
family is in the fourth position but
drops to the seventh position for the
1824 age group for them friendship which
normally occupies the nine position
switched the fourth position families
are smaller and the siblings are often
replaced by friends would be interesting
to discuss the notion of friends
according to facebook but in real life
the number of real friends authentic
ones is much lower as you can imagine
75% admit that they're real friends
network contain three friends and less
but the size of this network influence
positively the level of happiness up
until a certain point like money same
phenomenon with like money if you see on
the graph there's the RHI with the one
who have no good friends in their
network and after that the RHI with the
one who have four friends and more but
as you can see the curve becomes flat
and after five or six real friends
there's no matter there's no importance
the curve of happiness still flat it's
the same thing with ya the frequency of
our sexual relations yeah like you've
seen a graph it's essential to have a
minimum but after a certain frequency
there's there's no difference no impact
and no lling to a penis so the curve
climb until two or three times a week
but after that doesn't doesn't make a
difference if you make it four five six
or seven times a week the curl of
happiness still the same
can bet you if you have to make it 10
times a week your level of up in this
decrease because that means you have a
sort of dependency what is Morton what
is much more important it's
dissatisfaction of our sexual revolution
so in the graph you see the difference
of the RHI between the 11 satisfied with
your sexual relation and the one who are
not so with this graph we can see that
it's better to have good sex less often
than bad sex too often many other
factors take their roots in the to be
notion instead of it too I've notion
serenity optimism spirituality altruism
solidarity all represent at different
degrees several of the 24 a penis
influence factor the RHI also proved
without any doubt that woman evaluate
their level of happiness higher than the
man do imagine a perfect score on 14
queries realized up until today woman
I've shown ire rhi than the men 40 times
not by much two or three points but it
is systematic man after use of joking
might respond that women are up here
because they satisfy them I know many
woman would choke in their coffee mug
when the ear this argument in fact and
according to the number of data woman
considered themselves happier because
they are more sensitive more human more
emphatic closer to their feeling
feelings and more focused on helping
others they are more open communicate
better and look for well-being before
power for the RHI happiness has become a
science therefore it's much easier and
relevant to integrate this notion in a
model or a system in the last five years
Quebec province average rhi is 76.6 this
score also corresponds to the Canadian
average but the score is much higher
than the French ratted up innocent
in a viral world and without any
promotion on the other side of the
Atlantic Ocean the RH is collected so
much data from friends from trends
citizens that we compare the result
twice between quebec and friends both
signs the quebec rh i was eight points i
heard in the french one it's a lot the
explanation of this gap is simple and
finds the source in the analysis of the
answers given under 24 a penis factors
Quebecor show better resolve for a team
of them and for 12 on the first 14
factors we could spend hours analyzing
and interpreting the results but this
data and the information we have a thing
show that the rh hi is an exportable
index with a strong potential on the
international scale it also many
possibilities yeah maybe the french
citizen are more critiques more severe
about themselves and of course the 24
factors and their position could be
different from a country to another but
the principle behind the RHI stay
relevant efficient and the main
fundamental values of a society will
always find a place in this index in the
24 factors no matter the country the
multitude of data collected up until
today from the Quebec province and from
France along with the comparative
analysis are such that the data
presented by the RHI is unique in the
world for dozens of cities in the Quebec
province it's possible to know instantly
there are H I average to compare it with
the national average and to do so
according to different to different
demographic segment like the age the
gender the status this dynamic
calculation system is automatically
updated after each person answer the
question on the website this system
allows to know for any population given
how happiness works
where the weaknesses are and in which
segment of the population imagine the
power dissing formations all and most
importantly the possibilities and the
capacity to intervene and act improved a
penis level of any of this group but
that's not all the RHI goes a few more
steps ahead the index also calculates
the performance of this group of
population according to the 24 a penis
influence factor and always in
comparison with the National results to
ormond mayor's when the new
disinformation was of the label told me
that it was unthinkable not not to use
it because this information hollow them
to improve the faith of the citizens
here we add the result on the graph from
montreal and we can see the general rhi
for them and the same result in
comparison with the national average and
we can have always from montreal the
same result according to every factors a
penis influence factor and as you can
see it's red red for accomplishment red
for the second for the third red for the
45 and 6 factors even for the seventh
factor the first positive factor is the
number hate recognition and after that
friendship so with this results from
montreal we understand a little bit
better why montreal occupies the last
position in the RH I annual obvious city
ranking we have also a better
understanding of the gloom of Montreal
in the recent years so and if you want
to compare to city it's possible here we
have the resolve between Montreal and
Quebec City and the number of parties
spend to the questionnaire so we can see
the difference of the RHI between
Montreal and Quebec City can see that
only ten factors are positive for
Montreal instead of 16
for Quebec City in the negative factor
achievement work money and love I
negative from Montreal but by but
positive for Quebec City and the factor
number 17 environment is positive from
Montreal but negative fought for Quebec
City so the comparative analysis for
these two cities could be extended but
anyone who knows the actual situation
and economic context of the Quebec
province will agree with this results
and recognize how they are
representative and loyal to reality this
show and illustrate how and how much a
specific situation or context can
influence the a penis level of any
public given population it helps and
contributes to add a better lecture and
a better comprehension of any social
group imagine one more time if this
information was available everywhere for
countries regions States city's
neighborhoods it would be possible to
analyze for each of them a penis and
it's different expression and some toms
and mainly think back and take the best
decision to improve it the same that is
also available for businesses and
enterprises happy workers are more
efficient more productive in the company
as a result more profitable everyone
knows this we can calculate the benefits
of this by millions of dollars it is
possible now to calculate happiness at
work and to give crucial information to
business people that allows them the
possibility to improve it don't forget
work is the third Atlas influence factor
and as you can send a graph that's the
five the performance of the five a penis
factors at work for any for a population
given and you can see exactly the
general result and the result for every
segment analyze so we know exactly where
the weaknesses are and what and where
the strengths are in the ER in the era
where the retention of the best
employees and the
treatment of new talents are becoming a
major major issue for businesses rhi
with its several possibilities represent
a contemporary solution to the modern
world unfortunately the RHI hasn't been
developed by an army of University
scientists but by a person comes from a
marketing and communication background
there are some advantage to that this
gives a contemporary index a simple and
irrelevant one sure you could contest
this pretend that this index is in
scientific and just speculative but
statistics when it's professionally done
is a science in fact for the RHI
happiness has become a science a popular
one sure but an accessible one that
allows us to know the real things to use
to obtain useful and concrete
information that we can benefit and use
very quickly the RHI with the simplicity
of it works as the potential to explode
and rapidly radiate on almost all of the
territorial markets the RHI is a tool
designed and developed to fit in the
actual international trend that tries to
make our planet a bigger and a better
place for humans I believe that the RHI
represents also a very interesting
opportunity for Google a natural
association that permits Google to
strongly FM its desired to work towards
a better world the RHI also offers the
possibility to build a colossal and
unique information database that is
going to interest billions of people all
around the world yes I'm a dreamer and
I'm firmly believe that our societies
will be better from the moment that
humans search for the real well-being
and happiness will then dominate all
other aspects also I think a penis and
Google can become a very good pair thank
you very much for your time I also that
I change a bit
mind and your perception about a penis
thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
