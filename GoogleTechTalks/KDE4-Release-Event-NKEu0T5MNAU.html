is Aaron and I'm with Pluto we actually
wrote the code that got branched off and
integrated into Linux MCE Linux MCE is a
suite of media center home entertainment
and smart home applications where you
can Tran scroll everything under one
user interface so it has media
functionalities like PBR it will control
your AV devices turning on and off your
TV's and setting all the inputs and on
your receiver and things like that it
also has a voice over IP telephony built
in home security which integrates your
surveillance cameras and notifies you on
your cell phones and so forth as well as
home automation for controlling your
lights climate pool other devices so we
put together a very short demo video
here about five minutes that shows you
what it's all about we can go ahead and
start the video now and it shows how the
next MC has now been integrated into que
te whoops ok it'll start in one second
now the wind the key thing with Linux
MCE is it is really totally geared
towards a home theater application so
when you start it up you have a wizard
to help you get the resolution going and
get your audio settings going and
there's a setup wizard that ask you some
basic questions to get you going
so it does not interfere when you're not
watching your own media daily gallery
art from Flickr is displayed so there is
full screen media at all times I insert
a DVD it plays automatically I plug in a
windows ir receiver transmitter and user
windows remote the start button brings
up my menu and all the navigation
buttons work as expected however linux
mcs you i was designed to require only
three buttons to control every device in
your home if you have a pointing device
custom remotes for linux MCE with the
three button control are now being sold
you can do the same thing with a
keyboard and a mouse or a gyro mouse
this remote also has traditional
navigation buttons if you prefer but for
this demo I won't use them to prove that
all the functions really are accessible
with only three buttons plus ok and
cancel tap menu to bring up the main
menu on top of your media the remote has
a gyro so moving it moves the pointer on
screen press ok to choose the
highlighted option or cancel to make
whatever menu is on screen go away tap
media and move up and down for the
skipping action chapters on a DVD
channels on a TV tracks on a CD etc move
past the top and bottom of any list to
scroll it up or down you control the
scrolling speed by how far you move your
hand past the edge tap media and move
left and right to control the playback
speed it's like a jog shuttle the
further you move left and right the
faster it goes or hold media and don't
let go while you move left
ripe for absolute positioning to find
any scene extremely fast turn your hand
45 degrees to the left for the beginning
of the movie and 45 degrees right for
the end it's very precise so you can
find any scene let go to resume playback
press the ambience button and move left
and right to adjust the volume I syringe
his head from his shoulders I will slide
up and down to adjust the brightness of
the lights the other less common options
are accessed by pressing the menu button
the left menu pad changes depending on
what media you're using so for this DVD
I can select subtitles and audio tracks
inputs you adjust the zoom and aspect
ratio etc the regular ir remote still
works at the same time you can also copy
a disc to the hard drive start TV press
the media button and move up and down to
skip through channels when I fly through
the guide fast it's still easy to
recognize the rows with icons now when I
browse the guide it's easy to spot all
the simpsons episodes highlight a
channel and move to the right to see the
upcoming shows and scroll through the
next two weeks of programs when a show
is highlighted it's one click to record
this episode all episodes or bookmark
the show or channel as a favorite I'll
plug in a network storage drive with
previously ripped media it is plug and
play and all the attributes and cover
art are imported and the media is
cataloged the gyro makes navigating long
lists of media much faster wave your
hand to scroll the list instead of
hitting page down 100 times I can also
filter such as only show hi def content
or only disk based media or only TV
shows or certain genres or do a keyword
search
there are many remote controls you can
use with Linux MCE each with its own
advantages a regular windows infrared
remote this gyro remote a gyro mouse a
regular keyboard and mouse a web pad a
PDA or a mobile phone you can do all the
same things on all the remotes all the
remotes are always in sync and can be
used in parallel start a movie with the
gyro remote and note that the web pad
switches its controls to and I can
browse movies on the web pad to Linux
MCE is a whole-house solution that
shares all devices and media so that
rack of equipment I just set up can stay
in one room and everywhere else in the
house I need only TVs with thin clients
this is very significant in ways you may
not expect like many newer places my
phone jacks were wired with cat 5 which
gets me network for Linux MCE that's all
I need I get all my entertainment by
only attaching a thin client to the back
of the monitor I'll turn it on here's
the out of box experience here's my
cable box with all the channels are
order and on-demand movie here are all
my videos including network media and
the dvds in the jukebox watch youtube
check the weather and one of the best
things is that linux MCE keeps track of
each remote control individually so if
you start media and want to move take
the remote and press follow me
note that it even turns the TV on
mathematics so it's just one button
press ok so that's the demo video if you
could pause this so this stays on the
screen great thank you so there's a
actual demo videos 20 minutes long and
it shows the whole setup process and
it's on a DVD that has the full
installation with all the software and
the source code on it and I have a stack
of spindles in the back so if anybody
wants to take the DVDs home with them
they can they can do that every step is
shown in the DVD now architectural II
what makes Linux MCE different is that
it's not one program but rather lots of
different programs that are working
together this is really significant
because all the different modules can
wrap and encapsulate the functionality
of various different open-source
software for example the PVR module is
provided by mythtv but you can pull that
and substitute something else you can
have the same user interface the media
playback was done bike scene but in the
new release it's actually doing both
clean NM players so that sometimes when
you're watching blu-ray and HD DVD it's
coming off of em player when you're
watching DVD it's coming off the zine
but for the user it's just one user
interface one experience also the way
that it separates the remote control
from the functionality so that you can
use an IR remote or the web pad or use
your mobile phone all the remote
controls work together with all the
different pieces the phone system as
well as something you know you don't
normally think of in a in a home theater
environment but it's convenient it's
provided by asterisk and now that can
feed messages on the screen and you can
control it with the same remote so the
key is that to the user though it
doesn't look like a hodgepodge of
disparate pieces like you normally would
get if you installed lots of separate
software to the user there's one UI it's
one common experience everything works
together like a cohesive whole now what
our focus is on going forward is we want
to take particularly the media portions
in the
analog and make it more tightly
integrated into KDE so right now they
are working together you know you can
switch between the KDE desktop and the
Linux MCE desktop back and forth but a
lot of the things are still happening
separate for example in XM CES media
catalog is completely separate and so
forth we want to make these things
consistent and better integrated into
KDE and we also want to expose the same
functionality on que des two foot
desktop UI as on the ten-foot you I so
that if for example you want to browse
your media catalog you can do it with
the keyboard and the mouse and it's the
same catalog is when you're in Linux MCE
now the main thing that we're working on
is planning a next-generation user
interface with a very robust design tool
our intention is to build this on the
cute libraries going forward and the
goal is we want to allow graphics
designers to be able to create themes
and skins and user interfaces that can
be bolted on top of any other
application when you want a 10-foot you
I so this is going to be a fairly unique
approach there's a lot of you I
generation tools out there but most of
them are something like flash where
they're designed to be standalone you
know in other words you run flash it's
it's own little application what we're
talking about is more the paradigm that
KDE and cute give you on the two-foot
desktop with the 10-foot desktop if
you're a developer who is creating you
know a spreadsheet application you don't
have to take the time to create the X
button to close your window in the end a
figure out how to navigate pulldown
menus that set of widgets exists for the
2-foot desktop it does not exist for the
10-foot desktop and so what ends up
happening is is that unless you're a big
company like Microsoft that you can
spend lots of money on vista to have
these floating you know pretty eye candy
rich 10-foot UI for the rest of us you
know especially in the open source
community most of the effort is spent on
the core functionality like if you're in
myth or you're in scene and the user
interface is not as much resources to
depend on to to invest in the UI so what
we're looking at doing is making a user
interface that can be linked into all of
those products so that if you're
developer of an application like in myth
or exceed you can really focus on the
functionality your PBR your video and
you'll have all of the tools sets for
the user interface just like you do with
the two-foot desktop and let's see so
this also will allow them more time to
focus on the core feature set will allow
to have more you know pretty eye candy
and a more consistent user interface
across all of those those different
desktops tomorrow we're going to be
hosting a little mini impromptu
last-minute plan developers conference
at a sheraton hotel nearby to get this
going we're sponsoring bringing a few
people out to discuss in to brainstorm
how we should architect the software how
to organize the project and to get
things going and so forth our hope
though is that this will be a big help
to the free software because it allows
you know whether we're the free software
really works the best where the
developers of the most skilled is in
creating all of this broad depth breadth
of functionality and this allows them to
focus more on that core functionality
and when we get this user interface tool
built the UI will kind of come along for
and you have more time to spend on
adding the features and functions that
you want and then traditional apps like
Firefox which you don't necessarily
think of as being a 10-foot user
interface they'll be able to add one and
make it more usable if you want to use
it in a home theater environment or a
home pc environment so are there any
other questions it's nothing it's free
you can download it with all the source
code yeah all the source codes included
you're on give me the mic yes um I have
a question I don't know if I should ask
a bday why do you well I'd rather we ask
the question why not support open source
photo galleries like gallery for example
as opposed to flickr oh that wasn't
particularly a conscientious decision it
was just that they're happened we had
one of the programmers that said find a
place where you can get pretty pictures
that has an API to make it easy to
download and do
keyword searches and so forth and that
was just the one they picked I wasn't
particularly involved in that decision
it just you just changed there's a
script right now there's a script
flickered up l you just change it to
something else and you know you can pull
it from another source you said you're
using mythtv for the PVR component right
I have the cannot miss running at home
and the user interface does not look
like the one in the video is that just
because I have an older version of it or
no no that's because the the user
interface that you saw in the video is
mist is Linux mces not myth TVs so you
have a little bit here already what
we're promising which is that Linux MC
has a common user interface that kind of
sits on top of mythtv and seen and the
other applications so all the UI that
you saw with the the 3d scrolling with
the navigating your program guide that's
all Linux MCE and what happens is it's
linux empties the socket based
architecture so the UI is a separate
application that is controlling mythtv
on the back end now if you hit the menu
button you'll actually bring up you can
bring up TVs user interface and use it
with the native UI too so at the moment
you have you have both what our goal is
with this new UI is basically to develop
it from the ground up under the GPL
license with in a full collaboration
with the open source community so that
going forward some people when they want
to create let's say a PVR application
rather than starting out with their own
and then that's bolting one on top that
we give them all the tools and the
widgets to have this user interface
built in you know just use use these
tools and widgets and then coming along
for the ride you'll be able to curl
control that PVR with your mobile phone
you'll get to follow me features you can
go all the other stuff that's built into
the architecture I saw earlier how you
flip through the channels looking after
programs coming on so on I suppose you
need to have a data source for that
externally and right is other formats
for those same for all countries or do
you have to adapt it to different
regions um well that's actually not
particularly our function that's the
function built into mythtv and so mythtv
includes schedules direct for the
US market and then there are various
grabbers for the different countries but
to my knowledge most of the the world is
covered there's also in the new release
you can switch instead of mythtv you can
use vdr which is more commonly used in
Germany and it might be more popular in
Norway as well because it was really
written just for the satellites around
the around the asteroidal SAT satellite
so there's a new vini our module coming
the next release as well you can see
there's the software here but I don't
understand what's behind it are you a
you business you offering this is a free
software project as well and you selling
this into hardware right he tells a
little more about the ecosystem please
okay well I am actually not linux MCE
I'm part of Pluto and we don't have any
formal connection to a Linux MC is an
open source community project the
background is is that Pluto is a
commercial for profit company we make
this suite of interoperable products
that we then license to companies to
embed into their products to make them
interoperable and to add functionality
so we work with cee manufacturers are
mostly our clients and we're in the
software licensing business we provide
them tools you may have even used some
of the products or seen some of the
products that have our software in it
because in general when we license to a
company they strip off the user
interface and what you see doesn't look
anything like this stuff with their own
a completely different user interface on
top of it so that's our that's our
business as we do the b2b now what had
happened is is that for many years Pluto
had released all of our code to the open
source community for download but nobody
really it didn't really take off mainly
because it was tightly embedded with our
own distro so you couldn't use
openoffice with it it was our own distro
with our own version of X and our own
version of windows manager that was
really geared just for the set-top boxes
and these commercial applications and
where Linux MC came out is some people
volunteers from the open source
community said let's take this and make
it more usable for open-source people so
they took the code and they adapted it
so there
runs on kubuntu and that's what you see
here so how tightly or loosely is Linux
MCE coupled to any particular
distribution well at the moment it's it
is fairly tightly coupled to coupon too
and the main reason is is that it it
provides a lot of functionality that
really gets under the hood so for
example the way that the plug-in play
works it's the way that I can take a
cisco phone out of the box and plug it
in and it pops up with the user
interface and starts working is because
yeah there's an add-on to the dhcp
server that's monitoring IP requests
around the home and is able to figure
out when new devices pop on and off and
because it's everything is designed to
be self configuring you take out of the
box and you plug it in it has lots of
hooks at the you know at the lower
kernel level into you know apache and
two asterisks can't all these other
things so it's not quite so easy to just
take the code and compile it and make it
run on different districts the goal of
course what we want to do with going
forward with this interaction with KDE
is take a lot of the more exotic
features that are not of mainstream
interest out and focus on the media
cataloging the user interface for the
10-foot GUI and bring those into
something that can be easily compiled
and run across any distro so that you
don't need to have it as part of this
this distro so right now the answer is
Linux MC really you need to run it you
need to install it with that disc which
gives you coupon too but going forward
we're intending to take a lot of that
other stuff out and get something that
you can just is more lightweight that
you can move from desktop to desktop now
another question I own Nero's OSD not
sure if you're related with a piece of
hardware it's also a multi-media kind of
like a PVR but it's just the interface
they don't sell the whole box to it with
the whole storage device but what I'm
seeing and also nur nokia n800 what I'm
seeing is that all these embedded type
devices are pretty much kind of like
reinventing the wheel to an extent but
at the same time they're creating their
own leader innovation but
and get out of that environment so for
example the nearest OSD has are pretty
well integrated YouTube browser in which
it won't look at all like you're
browsing on the web it will just be type
whatever you want to search and put play
and it will be display on the on the
full on the full screen with very good
resolution and that is a something that
the community created is GPL completely
and it would be really nice if there
would be some kind of like bridges that
can easily read these to read all these
innovation on the on the other side for
example i have a nokia n800 they have a
video center application which works
like remote that will interface with a
kind of myth DBS like although it's not
me to be but on the flip side when I ask
them I ask them how how well could it
work with means to be I was like well if
I have me to be in my house I would
probably make it for that but I don't
have any my house so it's just this tiny
little things that is stopping
innovation and cross-pollination of
Technology between all these projects
and I wonder how how difficult could it
be to to just make the bridge between
all these projects well that's actually
that is what our core business is all
about I mean that's what we're that's
what our job is we don't see ourselves
as providing a user interface or any of
the high-level functionality it's just
what we our focus is on this
interoperability layer that allows
pieces to play together so the
interoperability layer we created it's
called dce and in your case what you can
do is you there's a web admin panel for
it you can see I'm creating a new
category of device you know a web powder
or whatever you want check off the
commands that it implements the data it
needs to be configured with and the
events that it fires and then you run
this code generator and it builds a C++
application for you with a make file for
GCC in a project file for vs net under
windows and it's precompiled with all
the stubs and the headers and they to do
you know put your coat in here to make
the whole thing work so what you do if
you want to take another let's
that you have another PVR something
based on hero is you just go through and
you add a new device template you check
off the same commands date and events
the myth has click on generate and it
will build you the C++ file that you can
link into that application and then you
can just you know make the function
calls what what our goal is with with
Pluto is the middleware market you know
where you're providing a user interface
and immediate player that's a pretty
saturated market there's a lot of
companies playing in that what we're
trying to do which is something that
other people aren't doing is providing a
lower level platform that allows the
interoperability so some of the
commercial options that we're working on
for example you they're not even using
our user interface or our media player
they're using something completely
different they may be built into a
set-top boxes that's not x86-based it
may use a sigma chip and doesn't have
hardly any of our code in it but what
they do is they use the generators to
create basically this wrapper that links
on to their box and it provides it the
interoperability so that you can then
control that box through other devices
in your home and then we also have what
we call these logic modules that defines
not only the communication layer but how
would the functionality supposed to work
for a customer for a homeowner like the
functionality that if the doorbell is
ringing while you're watching TV pause
the TV display a little message in the
corner and let the user view the camera
that's like a functionality that's
provided by the logic module which is
saying find out these other pieces on
the network that are providing this
these services and one of our focus is
unlike say you P and P and most of the
other protocols that are based on
defining a protocol that you go to a
manufacturer and you get to implement
our our focus on interoperability is
providing benefits and features so for
example we don't we support a wide
variety of different protocols some of
the stuff you see is happening with you
p and p some is happening with bluetooth
some is Ethernet we don't we figure that
from a consumer you don't care what the
protocol is you just want to know that
it works and that you know if a burglar
breaks into my home I'm going to see to
see the alert on my cell phone and I can
scream at him to get away from my kids
that that's what I want to know as a
homeowner I
care whether it's talking upnp or any of
these other protocols so that's what
we're doing is providing this
interoperability layer I wonder what's
the business model for Pluto in days I
mean how do they expect to well benefit
from this well there's two two aspects
to that at the moment most uh most of
the code that Pluto has provided in the
logic modules that the core logic pieces
is under our own license which is the
Pluto public license which is one that
allows it's basically it says it's the
same thing as GPL except if you sell it
in prepackaged hardware you have to come
to us and buy a license so that's why
it's free for download that's why we can
give away the DVDs you can add to it you
can derive works from it but the catch
is is if you're let's say Motorola and
you say I want to build this into my
set-top box then they come to us and
they apply to get a license from us now
naturally there are while there's a lot
of people using it it limits your
ability to expand and move forward in
the open source community because in the
open source community if you're not GPL
you're basically evil so what we're
looking at doing is you know following
kind of what troll text example was with
this new user interface we wanted to
make all of the code under GPL the
business model for us will be that the
user interface tools are GPL but that
the user interface but when you want to
link them to mythtv and tech scene and
so forth it's not an issue because it's
all GPL code but that if you're somebody
like Sony and you're going to embed this
into a you know set-top box product
you're obviously not going to release
your user interface and use of your
graphics in your logo and your GUI to
the public domain and then we can do a
licensing exactly like what trolltech is
doing so the bottom line is is right now
we have the Pluto public license which
gives us a business model because it
ties the freeness to being distributed
without hard goods but going forward
this user interface piece we want to get
tightly into more tightly integrating to
KDE will be GPL with the same business
licensing model as trolltech has
what kind of what kind of limitations
this drm place on place on limitations
of your products or of linux MCE to
mention like blu-ray right I don't know
if I can watch blu-ray on a set-top box
that runs runs linux I'm not sure that I
can connect it to a cable providers to
hear providers a digital link right well
I mean obviously DRM is a big nightmare
for everybody to have to deal with but
it is not for the commercial
applications it's not an insurmountable
one because all the licenses are
obtained I mean we have commercial
customers and you generally they don't
put our software in an x86 box it's
going into a special box that has like a
broadcom chip set that has the trusted
platform environment although the
licenses are paid and so forth now for
Linux MCE of course for the free
distribution it's more complicated than
that in the you know we don't ever give
you Lib DVD CSS or tell you we're
together that's up to the consumer to
figure that out we don't want to touch
it drm you know there is always that
issue for the free distro but for it's
not a product problem for us on our
commercial side I've got a couple of
project e2 or a small one okay practical
question about hardware how cheap it is
on resources and how comfortable is it
with current harder okay well um the our
Achilles heel has always been video
drivers especially when you want to get
into a pretty use interface it supports
the compositing and the alpha blending
and you need good video quality so the
vertical sync has to line up
unfortunately you know the general
mentality of the video card
manufacturers is Linux is more for
servers and they put their effort in the
video playback on the windows drivers
now at the moment the nvidia drivers
work pretty well it doesn't have as good
video quality like it does under under
windows and there's some vertical sync
issues but as far as a mainstream you
know buy it off the shelf it works
and as John from AMD is here he will
tell you that a TI is progressively
working on improving their linux drivers
as well I understand they just recently
have supported the compositing
extensions which will get you the nice
pretty alpha blending so I I can say for
sure that the Nvidia stuff works and the
ati AMD stuff ito ah the every time
we've tried it with the intel video card
we've never been able to get the the
alpha blending and all the other stuff
to work properly alright ditto for via
thank you okay everybody stand up and
stretch because you've been sitting for
