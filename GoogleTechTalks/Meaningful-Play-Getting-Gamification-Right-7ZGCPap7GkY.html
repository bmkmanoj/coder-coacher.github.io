Ventures and a couple months ago I
started working with a lot of the
startups that we work with and they're
all interested in game design and so I
thought oh crap I need to learn about
this and I went on the web and I looked
at all the stuff that was out there in
game design and there was just tons of
noise
eventually I ran across some slide decks
at sebastian diedring had posted and
they were just amazing I was impressed
with both the depth of stuff that he
worked looked at all the different
techniques for gamification and the
depth you really understood why these
techniques were working and when to
apply them in different contexts so I'm
very pleased to have him here at Google
today he is in town just for a little
bit he currently is a UX designer and a
researcher which is a nice nice
combination to have he's working on his
PhD and studies persuasive design and
bringing game design principles into
different contexts so please join me in
welcoming Sebastian Dida ting so hi
everyone and thanks for having me and
yep just as as Brayton said I try to
spread myself a little through the world
usually if people need somebody who play
the contrary and then they ask for a
grumpy German scholar which I am to sort
of play the opposite to the enthused
venture capitalist all the food the
enthused startup so that is usually my
role and at one of these advanced
actually last year and London and
playful a friend of mine said well all
of your critiques and your ideas they're
all nice and fine but is there actually
anything that you do like and do you
think actually it can be done well and
for me that's sort of what's the the
starting point what I'd like to talk
about today what exactly I believe or
how exactly I think gamification
applying game design in non-game context
can be done right so to speak I'd like
to do that basically in three little
steps arm first off for those of you are
not familiar with the topic I'll just
like to jump through a quick
introduction what is gamification what
do we mean by that term and then
basically for the majority of the talk
talk about three essential things that I
think in the current discourse and in
the current applications that I see are
most definitely missing and how to
address those missing ingredients so to
speak and in the remainder of the
then like to say well fine what does
that mean for user experience designers
for product managers in practice how to
translate that into your own job
practice so let's start right off with
gamification and I'd like to start
really with with three little stories
because in my mind or in my opinion all
of us or basically game designers or
gamification designers at least in our
childhood now this is not me but this is
basically how mile a walk on my walk
home from school usually look like it
was a very boring dreary work so what I
did to make that walk less less tedious
I sort of looked at the cracks in the
pavement I imagined well let's say I'm
not just a you know a boy walking home
to school but let's imagine I'm a
research scientist and I have my cover
suit on and this here is really a
volcano and out of these little cracks
in the pavement there is hot lava coming
and I basically made a game out of it by
deciding ok I imagine there is lava and
I do not I I should not step on the
little cracks in the pavement which
turned that very boring walk home less
boring and more exciting for me second
story which which some of you might also
have have a memory of from their
childhood my parents had a pretty big
lawn in the backyard of our house and it
fell to me to to mow the lawn and
usually because it was so big it was a
very daunting task so to make that
daunting task less daunting to me what I
did basically was that I would slice up
in my mind that lawn into smaller chunks
and I would say okay this is the whole
lawn but I'm gonna do the third first
and that one I'm going to do in long
rows and then I'll do the second third
and that are going to do in short rows
and so on splicing the whole thing up
into smaller achievable goals so that
the whole experience got less daunting
to me and the third example I'd like to
give is just the the playground the
sandbox that we had back in our house
where our parents would usually let us
play or let me and my friends play and
what they were thinking it was that
basically what we would do their play in
the sand play little sand castles but
the great thing about the experience for
us that we were left alone to our own
mischeif so what we use
end up doing was doing all kinds of
weird stuff with Lego or Playmobil
things the real enjoyment there for us
was exactly the fact that our parents
were not observing us it was a free
space to play around to toy around with
stuff and I think as I said in these
three little stories there are already a
lot of principles that game and game
design put to good use to make an
experience more engaging and more fun um
like having a make-believe story wrapped
around an experience or adding rules and
challenges to make it more interesting
setting goals and having feedback like
looking at the lawn and saying oh yeah I
already made three lines or having a
free space play free place to toy around
with other people so let's move on
today's software world um as you may
have or may have not heard that is sort
of the world although many people don't
like the word that is sort of the word
that people have agreed on gamification
describing can we not use elements out
of games elements out of video games use
them in non entertainment software to
make them more motivating more engaging
to the users just a quick couple of
examples in Fitness of course there is
Nike Plus which you basically see at
every second UX conference now thrown
around and it's also an example thrown
around for how to add points and
challenges and competition to the
experience of just jogging it becomes
more encouraging and engaging one of my
personal favorite Health Month by Buster
Benson which is basically a game where
you set for one month rules for your own
health behavior like drink no alcohol or
something like that and you earn points
and badges based on whether you make it
or you don't make it mint.com
always an example that people often give
where you set yourself financial goals
like get out of depth or save up for a
holiday and then again it gives you
feedback on how how good you make on
those goals sustainability nice on my
leaf just came out with the nice on my
leaf challenge where you basically try
to beat others in taking a certain road
more efficiently than your competitors
so to speak entertainment this is one of
the example that was just up in the
gamification summit in San Francisco
this Thursday a club site basically a
website around a TV show where with
challenges with minigames with point
earns for doing stuff on the website
people would try to bring in more and to
engage more with the brand shopping
there are stuff like barcode heroes so
where you earn points for checking into
chops or or or writing reviews for for
products and finally more close to home
even stuff like debugging that is try to
be turned into a game like play nicely
where you earn badges and points for
depending on how many and how well you
use submit box and to round it all off
in the past year a quite a couple of
service vendors have popped up that sort
of try to offer a service platform or a
kind of turnkey turnkey solution to to
add game design or to add game design
elements to your website now if you zoom
out a little and if you look at all this
from a little bit more afar you'll
notice that the blueprint that all of
them are still thinking about or that
really still sets the scope of what is
meant with gamification was the initial
Foursquare basically you have an
activity that you want your users to do
more often thus you you give points for
the users if the user does that activity
then you have some sort of goals or
badges or trophies that the user wins
for a certain amount of points or for a
certain kind of activity and then you
have some sort of leaderboards to add an
element of competition and all of that
and the whole discourse is pretty much
split between the one side like
scavenger startup here where they
basically think well gamification is the
future of user experience design in
general and it's basically pure mind
control we can do users we can make
users do anything with this kind of
stuff and mostly game designers on the
other hand where you see a big backlash
and they say well this is really as
Margaret Robertson and from the UK says
an inadvertent count this is trying to
sell you that there is an easy way and
slap on way to make something as
motivating as engaging as a
well-designed game with just some
Nidalee bits there so
the question that I'd like to take you
through the day today is there something
as a secret ingredient that current
gamification designers miss out or is
that some sort of snake oil 2.0 talking
and as I said in the beginning I think
there are three missing ingredients
right now that we have to take care of
really the first one going back to my
first story meaning how to make the
experience the activity connect to the
user in a meaningful fashion to his
interest to his passions to his goals
the second thing and that connects to me
to the story about the lawnmower is
mastery how to craft an experience in
such a way that the user gets the sense
of progressing towards his or her goals
of achieving something or feeling
competent and finally that is the
playground autonomy a sense of freedom a
sense of being left alone to your own
mischief a sense of being able to
curiously explore opportunities without
necessarily any kind of functional
outcome attached to what you're doing
there so let me start off with the first
one with meaning
um this blog post by our saying yo
Santos voice is a pretty common
observation among many many Foursquare
users right now where he says why he
quit playing Foursquare and basically
what he is saying over time I began to
notice that the achievements wound up
being almost the only benefit for using
the service and that is why he quit
playing Foursquare translated because
Foursquare underneath the game mechanics
didn't provide anything of value or
interest to him it is a very shallow
effect of novelty you play around with
it you discover some stuff and then
suddenly you notice there's there's
nothing really there for me
contrast that with Stack Overflow
right which is again a poster child for
having reputation having points having
badges for the user but even if you
would take all of that away from that
question-and-answer platform it would
still be immensely valuable meaningful
helpful to the user using this platform
on a day to day basis to translate that
into a sort of more practical
Oh recommendations or gambits as I call
him I'd like to start off with one
observation that Aaron Patzer the
founder from mint.com recently made
where he said well all of the game
mechanics that we were using on the side
all the points that we're using all the
progress bars and so on
they were basically meaningless to the
user unless they were connected to a
personal goal that the user him or
herself brought to the platform so that
as the sort of first recommendation
tried to hark into or try to offer the
user the opportunity to bring their
personal goals to the platform in the
case of mint.com that is very obvious
right you get the opportunity and say
well this is my financial goal team to
get out of depth or to buy a home or
whatever speaking more generally the
recommendation there is to ensure that
you have customizable goals goals that
the user himself can input into the
system and say the system now helped me
with all those mechanics achieving my
own goals now it needn't necessarily be
personal goals to that that you bring to
the platform um to make the goals or to
make the system itself meaningful to the
user it it is enough that it connects at
some way in some way to an interest or a
passion or a curiosity of the user that
he already has in his everyday life and
that can be pro-social goals like for
instance an interest in science or
general care of science and you're not a
scientist yourself but then when you
come to one of the many many crowdsource
platforms that offer you to play a
minigame and the data that comes out of
that minigame is them as unfolded or
here in Philo where it is about matching
DNA sequences the data that you produce
there is then used in actual in actual
scientific number-crunching that
connects to your interest and your
passion as a user if you have it for
science and therefore becomes a
meaningful activity to you the second
large way of ensuring that the system is
meaningful to the user is to ensure that
you're connecting to them to a
meaningful community of interest I'm
putting up bragging rights here because
many of the gamification vendors say
that the core motivator that they use or
that they believe they are tapping into
is status and reputation
showing off bragging in front of your
friends now to show
one two bragging in front of your fence
you better do that with something that
is actually an achievement and that is
actually something that your friends
would care about so to give you a
negative example the entertainment
recommendation side GetGlue comm arm
allows you to sort of check in and like
different items of pop entertainment and
then earn badges for that now since I'm
not that much into pop entertainment to
earn I don't know I'm a movie buff
because I like 50 movies batch isn't
really that relevant or interesting or
meaningful to me nor is it something
that I would go around to my friends and
saying hey I earned that badge you know
that's something that slips out as an
older person and say oh sheesh I'm
rather ashamed of that whereas if you
contrast that with a with a more focused
community like BoardGameGeek comm which
is basically a huge wiki and community
site for board games now as many of my
friends or board game geeks and as I
myself like board games very much if I
earn one of those micro badges on the
site like I am a Hornet leader to fan or
I am the moderator of of say the X's and
alleys page that is something meaningful
to me that is something meaningful to
the community around there and if they
give me a kudos or a thumbs-up or so
that is actually something that I care
about that delivers reputation I'm
interested in the again a more practical
way that BoardGameGeek comm achieves
that they just like the customizable
goal they offer community-generated
goals and community generated badges
that the community itself can create
with the art with the kinds of
activities you have to do to achieve
them and so on and so on thus
automatically ensuring that the
community itself cares about these kinds
of items now you might say well usually
with video games it is the case that um
they don't really connect very much to
anything in our everyday life or any
everyday relevancy how is it that video
games achieve that kind of meaning to
the activity that you use and the trick
that video games usually do is they
enrapt the whole thing in a story and
usually they don't make it under only
you can save mankind it's sort of 90% of
the
video games stories the big story arc
save the princess save mankind whatever
and that kind of overarching narrative
gives meaning to all the goals all the
levels all the activities in between
connecting them to something meaningful
on the long hand and take a game classic
like Missile Command
back in the 1980s by Atari I could
describe this game for you of this game
screen of for you without using any
element of story I could say well you
know the point in this game is basically
that you see these little green dots
they're going down and and you yourself
sheet shoot other green little dots up
on the blue line and they explode at a
certain point and your point is to keep
red from reaching blue down below not
very engaging not very fun now if you
and wrap that kind of abstract mechanic
in the story that missile command tells
only you can save mankind or in this
case defend your city from nuclear bombs
that becomes a more comprehensible as
well as a much more engaging activity to
translate that into into reality we have
a huge amount of crowdsourcing efforts
especially in the in the whole
transparency movement right where people
as here in Washington were calm I
regularly ask you know file something
you know about your representative file
earmarks or whatever if you present that
just as that kind of activity it's it's
kind of boring you have to be a real
policy buff to care about this however
if you're able to narratively frame the
whole thing more in a citizen journalist
The Untouchables and corruption or
discover corruption in your corner that
becomes more interesting and you
understand why the little earmark that
you file is actually a meaningful
activity one practical way to do that is
to ensure that you have supporting
visuals and copy for exactly that story
that you wrap around the activity that
support you and that cue you into that
kind of story or theme of fictional
world around it just to give you an
example imagine Mafia Wars the hugely
popular Facebook game would be devoid of
all kinds of copy or visuals that would
relate in any way to
to the world of mafia then it would
become a very abstract and quite frankly
very boring game of fill up the progress
bars so take care that the visual
carries the story that you have there
now in terms of meaning there is always
a danger involved and the danger in
terms of meaning is that the activity
that you do on a platform obviously has
broader meanings in the social context
of everyday life the story I always tell
to this is this platform aqua which
basically tries to engage people in
doing sort of random acts of kindness in
their everyday life by turning those
into missions like treat a friend to
your favorite dessert and then you earn
points for completing these missions
well a friend game designer of mine did
that with another friend of his treated
him to a dessert the other got curious
and asked well why did you do that he
pulled out his iPhone said well you know
I'm just playing this nice little
alcohol game here which told me to treat
you to a dessert
to which the other friend quite angry
replied have you any idea how degrading
that is that you treat me to a dessert
know why you care about me but because
you want to win some shitty game so the
recommendation I would give there to you
if you're building such a system do test
it in real life with your own real-life
friends to see if anything there feels
awkward and if it feels awkward to you
or your friends and especially your non
geeky friends chances are it will also
be the case for your users this is
another nice example that they found
with frontier world where you can design
your own spas once you made it to your
spouse and one of the game designer
actually did that and and designed his
own spouse and then the senior game
designer was called by his wife asking
say tell me did he and purpose design
that kind of spouse for himself or did
he hit the random button and that was
the random spouse that he got these
kinds of awkwardness is these kinds of
meanings in the larger context is
something that you have to take care of
so to quickly recap that point you have
to connect to personal goals and
interests and passions you have to
connect to a meaningful community of
interest around the activity you're
designing for you have to wrap it
individually support its stories and you
have to Prevert of those kind of social
context meanings
now moving on to the second thing to
mastery one thing I don't tire of saying
or I don't tire of arguing against it's
sort of a fundamental misconception I
believe in the gamification discourse
about why video games are motivating and
engaging and if you look at their kind
of copy and their their materials on the
website where they say why is this
engaging to your user they say well
because of rewards we deal out rewards
we incentivize behavior that's how video
games work so basically their idea is a
kind of pop behaviorist idea of video
games as a kind of skinner box where
every time you hit the right lever you
get a little sugar palette as a rat and
and then then usually liken that to
world of warcraft and say you know if
you kill enough creatures then some loot
pops out and that's sort of the skinner
box there but if that would be the case
then this should be the funnest game
ever earning you a whopping trillion
points or a whopping trillion rewards or
whatever every time you hit the bottom
luckily Jakob standing actually built
that thing he called the progress wars
just to make a point and there are lots
of these games just to make a point like
achievement unlocked or so and if you
play this kind of game and watch the
lovely progress war a progress bar
progress for a couple of times you
notice it's not really a very engaging
activity not really rewarding it's just
like mafia words exactly so why is it
that videogames are motivating then and
to me still the one sentence that sums
it up most nicely is by game designer of
coaster fun is just another word for
learning that might sound
counterintuitive because usually
learning we associate with school and
school we not necessarily associate with
fun but let's let's look more deeply
what he means with that what he means
with that is that the fun in games the
fun in learning is the fun of mastering
something the fun of figuring out a
puzzle recognizing a pattern having
developed the dexterity to make that
next step in the game here that you
couldn't make before and the good sense
of achievement that you get when you
finally master that that is the core
on their video games that video games
give us it is between the tangent of
will I make this clenching my tongue in
my mouth and then the final resolution
if I make it that is the core fun of
video games but then going back to
school you might ask well school also
you know poses those challenges like
solving mathematical equations why is
that not fun and why is playing Magic
the Gathering which if played well also
recommended requires a whole lot of
mathematics to understand the cards and
the strategies why is that then a fun
activity and I think that is one thing
we have to add to the sentence of ref
coaster fun is just another word for
learning under optimal conditions and
what witty games provide us our optimal
conditions for these kinds of learning
of mastery experiences and the cool way
they do this is that they design
interesting challenges for us if you
look at most of the current gamification
vendors the challenge that posed to you
is like read 5 blog posts or fill out
this little questionnaire or or check in
twice to our website which is not really
an interesting challenge it's just as
blonde as leaving the house games create
interesting challenges taking the
example of golf by setting you a goal
first of all right in golf the goal is
very obvious you have to put that little
ball into that little hole now if that
would be everything the game of golf
would be very boring because you could
just take the ball walk over to the hole
there you go so what games do to make
that interesting is they add some rules
there are certain ways in which you may
and may not achieve those goals and the
rule is you have to hit it with this
weird stick and you may not just start
everywhere you have to start at this
point and you have to play the ball from
wherever it ends up and that together
creates all of the interesting
challenges of golf when you're in a sand
hole or when you way of park and so on
that is what creates the interesting
challenges of any game trying to break
that down into a few more concrete
recommendations there the one is to
actually have clear visually present
goals in your
interface this is something that gat
glue actually does quite well because it
welcomes the user usually with some site
with some kind of invitation saying hey
you're returning here's the next
achievable goal for you to make progress
so to speak in our game but then it
games usually do not just present us
goals they also take care that the goals
that they said or well-structured
well-ordered think of the lawn mowing
example just setting me the goal you
know mow the lawn is a daunting task but
if you chunk it up into medium and small
term goals so that whenever I enter the
game I have a small doable achievable
goal right in front of me and the game
ensures that whenever I finish that
there is right next to goal for me to
reach afterwards which is just in grasp
that pulls me through the game
experience a good example for that is
the introduced missions in frontier we
land now in City Row where if you enter
the game you can play it without any
kind of missions or goals but when you
open it on the left-hand side you see a
list of missions that you can achieve
and if you then click on these missions
you see again that there are structured
just in the way that I described right
you have the long term goal or medium
term go build a bakery which is again
chopped up into other smaller even more
achievable tasks or goals for you so the
next thing or the next take the next
twist on that structured flow of goals
is to ensure that it is just not a bland
line of goals which are just on the same
level but that they get increasingly
more difficult my most beloved example
for that is when Twitter recently
crowd-sourced their translation and you
could earn points for entering
translations for the different pieces of
the interface and then you could a level
it level up by by those points and if
you look at the bar
the progress bar then you can nicely see
that from each level to each level the
number of points you would need to level
up gets increasingly more it gets
increasingly more difficult to reach the
next level the next goal and that
actually blends nicely with one of the
core psychological theories around why
play or games are fun which is Mihai
csikszentmihalyi's flow theory where
he basically says usually we feel best
not if we're under challenge then we're
bored know when we're over challenge
then we're frustrated and anxious but in
that ideal middle spot where we're
neither over nor under challenged where
the challenges match our abilities and
thus we get a feeling of achievement by
actually mastering them now games
usually don't pull such a very straight
line through there if you look at the
difficulty curves of games what they do
is they rather have a kind of flickery
line where you have a very steep
challenge and then suddenly something
but that is very low and it just moves
on slowly there to keep pace with your
growing ability to keep it interesting
but they have this fluctuation in there
and the reason for that is that this on
the one hand provides you experiences of
failure right damn I didn't manage that
level which gives you something to learn
from why didn't I do that let's try
something else this time as well as
valuing when you finally make it right
when you failed three times and then you
succeed the first time this is sexist
the success feels much more much more
rewarding than when you succeeded the
first time and then they keep the
difficulty low after that for a certain
time to give you the experience of acing
out of absolutely being the super king
finishing everything and then rising the
difficulty again for you and again
you're struggling there a bit so games
have this kind of fluctuating pacing of
difficulty but not only that they take
care that the kinds of difficulty they
posed to you are not just more of the
same right you are in a batch for liking
50 movies now let's see if you can earn
a bit now let's see if you can like 100
movies or 250 movies that's not fun
that's boring that's grinding that's
repetitive what games do if you taste it
takes a super Mario's they let you they
pose you one kind of challenge let's see
if you can make all that jumping then
another let's see when you whether you
can make all that shooting other
creatures with fireballs or so and then
combine that to a more complex challenge
let's see whether you can jump and fire
at the same time so they vary the
challenges as well as increasing the
complexity and not just in quantity so
translate it into a platform that with
me not just present me Oh even more
movies to like even more movies to like
have other activities in the platform
like engage in that quiz or whatever and
then try to scaffold that slowly to more
interesting complex tasks like become
the moderator of a page
the final way and for many people maybe
the most obvious way in which video
games give us these experiences of
mastery is by providing us with
excessive positive feedback if we are
able to master something my favourite
example for this is the haggle where if
you look at the screen you see the
little metal bowl and your point is to
shoot all the orange holes down there in
the in the room below and I already
shoot all of them apart from the last
one let's see what happens if I shoot
the last orange ball
that's what game design is called juicy
feedback and that's one way of providing
you these experiences of mastery sort of
underlining that you really made it
take for just a simple example this is
ribbon hero sort of the tutorial game
done by Microsoft where for the
achievement of clearing formatting you
get this big fat back saying
congratulations you're cleared
formatting could be a real challenge
depending so those are the ways to make
a challenge interesting to give you an
experience of mastery but again in
setting up these kinds of rules system
with points and goals and challenges
there is a danger and the danger
involved there is the kind of emergent
behavior that it can give rise to all
kinds of cheating or exploiting or
similar things in your software this is
a good example tumbler put up this this
dashboard for users of tumbler back in
the May 2009 where you have to score
this tumbler eg score which was the
overall score for your popularity on the
tumbler platform now it turned out the
easiest way to drive that score up was
just to post incessantly in regardless
of what you were posting because for
every post you were get a point what
that led to was that tumbler which was
previously very much as a community
about hand picking and curating
interesting stuff found in the Internet
in a sort of incessant dribble and the
community backlashed immensely against
this with all of these kinds you know
just at tumblr tea into into a google
image search and then you find all the
ways in which the tumblr communities
that we don't want that so tumblr
finally in January 2010 took down the
tumblr disco and replace it with a
directory because they found yeah it is
encouraging but it is not encouraging
for the kind of behavior that we
actually want to encourage another good
example is all the kinds of applications
like major maker and so on out there for
Foursquare which help you to auto
check-in and onto all places where you
just drive by the spoiling the actual
competition that you have for who gets
to be the major at a certain place
because the device does that
automatically for you at the playful
conference in London where was they
actually had a cow
of voting by the foot by people of the
Foursquare community they're asking
whether this would be deemed illegal or
not in London I don't know if whether I
win sticks to that but again you see
that you create this kind of unintended
emergent behavior very likely if you set
up these kinds of systems the
recommendation I would give there to you
is when you play test your systems try
to game it yourself give your play
testers the task game this system in any
which way possible so that we figure out
whether there is this kind of unintended
emergent behavior hidden in our system
to wrap that up again and what you
should do then is provide interesting
challenges to create experiences of
mastery clear goals which are scaffolded
paced and varied provide juicy feedback
and beware of that kind of gaming the
system we're exploiting the system
behavior that will eventually appear if
you create anything that is worthwhile
now we come to my last point autonomy
the freedom the play space in the
backyard that allows me to be involved
in my own mischief there with my Lego
and Playmobil figures and this is
something I believe very important for
especially productivity contexts because
one of the core elements of play and
games and one of the core things that
makes them motivating according to a lot
of research is that they are by
definition of voluntary activity an
activity that we chose for ourselves and
the most often told story there is
obviously the story about Tom Sawyer
managing to to convince his friends to
paint the fence for him and even paying
money for the privilege of painting the
fence for him how did Tom Sawyer do that
well the friends walk by him he had to
paint a fence he was asked by his by his
own to do that and when the friends were
kind of mocking him he said no no you go
fishing I'd rather paint the fence and
then they got curious and say huh
you're mocking us now you go ahead well
can we paint the fence maybe just try no
no you go ahead I'll paint the fence and
he was tried was able to create the
impression in them that he was painting
the fence voluntarily and that made the
experiential difference there which Mark
Twain himself very concisely put
as he said if Tom had been a great and
wise philosopher and he would have
comprehended that work consists of
whatever a body is obliged to do and
play of whatever a body is not obliged
to do just to give you a concrete
example one in the same activity like
filling out spreadsheets can be very
dreadful if you do them at work however
if you do them in an online multiplayer
game like like EVE Online in this case
we're very much you're doing precisely
the same activity you're even paying for
the privilege of doing that activity in
the game because you voluntarily chose
to play that game in the point and you
were not asked by someone else go fill
out that trust spreadsheet the point why
I'm talking about this in relation to
productivity context in relation to m2
gamification specifically is because
this core element of autonomy is easily
damaged if you slap some extrinsic
reward on an activity a cash incentive a
punishment a quarterly evaluation
whatever the one thing that we find in
research if you do that if you add an
if-then reward to a specific activity
you curb the felt autonomy of the person
the prison says ooh I didn't choose to
do that someone else helped me do that
and then I feel less in control of
myself which is usually a very
demotivating experience like here the
the scoreboard application just came out
for salesforce.com right depending on
whether that is just an innocuous
scoreboard or whether you're a
supervisor actually attached some
monetary value or some quarterly
evaluation to the outcome on the
scoreboard it can be empowering or it
can be very motivating and the second
problem with that is that you're
basically devaluing the activity if you
attach some extrinsic reward to it right
if you say please buy me one thousand
Twitter followers or please buy me one
thousand Facebook followers if I know
about that the fact that you now have
1,000 Twitter followers more doesn't
improve the value of your service it
devalues it because I know well they had
to pay for that right it's so bad they
even have to pay to get their own
followers likely if you have something
as a sweepstake and they say please
retweet this link to our service to
enter the sweepstake the social signal
that gets sent along with
that is well you know their service is
so bad they actually have to come up
with a sweepstake to promote it people
would not voluntarily autonomically
retweet it to their friends so how to
deal with that the first solution done
by a cube list calm a little a knowledge
management platform is that in their
platform they're using it for travel
agents and they have no strings attached
it's a question and answer platform some
game mechanics in there basically you
get to customize your profile more you
the more active you are on the platform
but that relates in no way to any other
performance metric in the company it's
just what you do on the platform no
strings attached
the second way which is done beautifully
in the in the whole customer service
thing in Zappos which I hope you're not
already fed up with hearing about is to
set up a shared goal with shared values
and intentions behind that we want a
good customer experience make the
customer happy but how you do that
completely up to you give the user many
possible ways to achieve a goal once you
are once you agreed on the goal that
increases the experience of autonomy
that you say ok great
I agreed to do that goal together with
you and now I get to choose how to do it
the third way of doing that is to
provide feedback that is informational
helpful in solving the task versus
information that is a pat on the back
and say now that you did it here is a
reward or now that you didn't do it you
don't get the Snickers bar like in that
case again a mint.com where they give
you helpful feedback on how far you are
in reaching your goal and next steps to
do if you if you don't make it
informational rather than controlling
feedback and the finally way to do that
unexpected rewards right easter eggs as
they are called in video games if you
don't expect a certain reward and
suddenly in the interface there is
something popping at you saying
congratulations you don't make a causal
relation in your hat between you doing
the activity and the reward hence you
don't feel controlled by it hence you
feel autonomous to recap that up again
for you play is by definition of
voluntary activity and beware of curbing
the autonomy of your users beware of
curbing that voluntariness with what you
do
- like extrinsic rewards or beware of
developing your product with that be
very careful about the social signals
you're sending out with these kinds of
things to package it finally for you
what does that mean in practice for you
as a user experience designer or product
manager how do I go about designing a
gamified service if I took care of all
of that well the first thing is think
process not features think design
process not features all the service
vendors basically give you this nice
list of features that they offer as a
turnkey solution but just as you will
know from the from the early web 2.0
days right whether a service took off or
it didn't take off was not about having
a tag cloud or not having a tag cloud it
was about all the nidalee fiddly design
details about designing the features
that you offered the user interface so
that it really met the audience you were
designing for and that you only get out
of a process not out of a feature the
first way there is just read the rules
understand core parts of game design now
there are some books you can read books
like the game design workshop which are
very much recommend but the easiest way
to do that basically is to start playing
board games if you play board games and
afterwards just discuss and reflect on
how did that board game create a dynamic
of competition between us or a dynamic
of collaboration between us or how did
it make that end game so dramatic
you have a very easy way of studying and
of tweaking the rules in a board game to
understand how the rules create that
kind of intra interesting challenge or
not the second thing and that also is
obvious for any good user experience
designers is know your users understand
that you are not necessarily the target
audience understand what kinds of play
what kinds of games what kinds of
motivations what kinds of play they like
what kinds of motivations they bring
just a quick example the platform family
calm was a platform that tried to
collect fan fiction throughout the net
fiction brought by by fans about Star
Trek or Star Wars or Harry Potter or so
and the way they did it with these kinds
of nice advertising is well we offer
sweepstakes and competitions who is the
best fan fiction writer and
Paige completely went under reason you
can likely see from the actual
advertisement turns out the audience is
99% female and turns out fanfiction
writing is very much about collaboration
expression mutual help and not any kind
of competition so it was a game mechanic
but it was the completely wrong game
mechanic for the audience they were
designing for finally and again you will
know that as a user experience designer
the only way to get fun right is to
build a prototype a paper prototype of
the rule system or point system as early
as possible play test it and iterate on
what you find that is essentially the
core of game design if you look at the
best-selling casual game of 2009 plants
vs. zombies with more than 15 million
downloads and if you look in the design
history there's a nice presentation in
slideshow of which the link I will have
in my own slides at the end what they
basically did that from the first sketch
up until the final polished product they
went through three years of iterating on
the product not full-time but three
years of iteration I don't say you need
to do three years of iteration I'm
saying if you want a game that is as fun
and as addictive as plants vs. zombies
there is no way around prototyping play
testing and iterating not only of a
qualitative feedback but also my last
point over quantitative feedback that
has been as in usability has been one of
the major steps forward in game design
in the last years that they have started
to bring in massive amounts of data over
user data like how many seconds did it
take to win that level and then finding
out okay that level is too easy that
level is too hard or all the kinds of
data that social games now bring in with
monthly active users or or daily active
users or the ratio between all kinds of
data to understand questions like have
we curbed exploits is that point system
fine balanced or is that point system
something that encourages the wrong kind
of behavior have we set the right
challenges or is that challenge too
boring too hard or too easy for the
people so finally wrapping up in summary
if you want to design for something that
is meaningful for meaningful play for
your users instead of some kind of
shallow progress Wars you have to
provide a story or any kind of meaning
that connects to the users everyday life
a rule system that they can master and a
free space that they can play in you
have to be mindful of the kind of side
effects you can create with the rule
systems and the social context of those
activities you have to learn the basic
ropes of rural design and finally just
be a good user experience designer thank
you how are we for time yeah sure
questions if they're awesome
so one of the things I've noticed that
many aims is the score as one - yeah and
I always feel yet you seem to advocate
um there is one thing about earning one
point versus earning a hundred points of
something usually in the terms of the
core currency that you run around in
your mind so soon what kind of currency
that you run around with you know a one
that's not so much hundred that's a
little more if you live in a country
will be hugely inflated currency there's
sort of another sense it gives something
if the point amount is bigger but again
you have to make sure that people get
the relations between the different
activities right and they just don't get
lost and say now was this twice as good
or twice as successful as the other
thing in just inflated numbers and then
there is a little value there in just
having juicy feedback as I said and just
in it just being very good to adjust in
in in in in giving feedback but then
again be sure that the user understands
the relations between the different
activities that you're measuring there
I see so yeah sure so the question was
is there a potential conflict of
interest between sort of the the
designer of the product that wants you
to to basically click more be longer on
the page and the user who actually wants
a meaningful experience
he asks there can be there can also be a
conflict of interest say between the
user for just wanting to be very
efficient and get away and get done with
it and decide wanting to keep you there
longer on the side for instance
ultimately as far as my thinking goes if
you're not able to connect to something
that the user himself is intrinsically
interested in or motivated by you get a
shallow novelty effect there so the user
is just curious figuring that out then
it goes away and then there is no value
in the game mechanics so if you're if
you're not able to sort of hook into the
users personal goals and motivations
there you're likely not going to be very
successful one way of doing that would
be something that lose fun aren't called
games with a purpose so you build a
full-fledged game and just use the data
that the game generates for your
purposes as a site so say he uses this
for image tagging right the game is
about you trying to guess which word
comes first to mind to another anonymous
player but in reality the words you're
typing in trying to guess what the words
is is used as image tags Google image
label basically uses that and that is
one way when you find that there is no
way in which the users motivations and
interests align with the interests of
the site
more questions
I see so the question as far as I
understood it the relation between
intrinsic and extrinsic motivation and
one of the people I think it was Rajat
pahari as well as from bunch ball as way
as the guy from USA networks who talked
about this at the u.s. networks where
they say once we entered the sweepstakes
into the whole gaming flight system we
had then we actually saw user uptake
before that we didn't sell user uptake
we actually added extrinsic rewards so
the relation between their I think it
very much comes down to how the user
themselves end up framing the experience
whether they feel that the extrinsic
motivator is some is some nice given but
something optional for them and they say
oh yeah why not right I don't feel
controlled by that and how you frame
that experience I believe is is
ultimately the question so if it's an
entertainment side and you don't really
care about it in the first place and it
doesn't really relate to you in your
first place doesn't have any harsh
consequences if you lose a win in that
then to add another little sweepstake
there you can just basically I'm buying
into people's motivation of getting
something for free which is also a
motivator but that doesn't curb that
kind of autonomy I'm more concerned
there with actual productivity work
contexts where I believe that is more of
the threat
great and thank you so much and as you
can see slides will be up together with
lots of linky goodness
