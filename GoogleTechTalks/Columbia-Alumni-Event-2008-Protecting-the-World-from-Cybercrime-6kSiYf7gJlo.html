and I work here in Google in university
alumni relations and it is my pleasure
to welcome you today on behalf of Google
it's actually very exciting to have so
many people here we've been working on
this event for a couple of months now
very closely with the columbia alumni
association the Columbia School of
Engineering Alumni Association in the
Columbia Club of Northern California and
I think this was a great example of a
fruitful and very nice partnership so we
are extremely happy to have you here
tonight I would like to thank Neil
daswani who our speaker tonight because
we actually owe him this event the idea
initially came from him so thank you
neyo and and before kicking off this
event I would like to say just a few
words about our partnership with
Columbia since this is obviously the
result of a long-term partnership Google
is building with the university of
Colombia Colombia is one of our big
providers of talent at Google we have
currently close to 200 alumni from
Colombia working at Google about a half
of them are here in the Bay Area and we
also have a pretty good representation
in our other offices across the United
States New York City and other cities
and also internationally we have academy
alumni in places like Great Britain
India China just to name a few so it's a
it's actually a pleasure to have you
here you'll see actually a few of our
Googlers from Colombia around some of
them have google t-shirts so please feel
free to you know if you have any
questions feel free to reach out to them
we're happy to you know chat about what
we do here at Google but our partnership
with Google is not just about recruiting
as some of you may be aware we at Google
support very strongly academic research
and Colombia is actually one of our
strong partners in that area so every
year we offer a couple of research
Awards two faculty members from Colombia
basically to support academic research
in areas of interest that we have you
know mutual interest in and we also have
visiting faculty program so we have a
faculty member of
we are working on our new york office
right now so it's been up for a couple
of years now very strong partnership on
the research part and we're very happy
about it it's something that works
really well we have other projects that
we work together with I I guess some of
you might have heard about the book
search project i think it was back in
two thousand seven the google book
search team I digitalized Columbia
library so we have you know all the
documents in the Columbia library now
available to Internet users worldwide so
that was a great project and a great
example of partnership between Colombia
and Google and we're obviously looking
and continuing and strengthing that
partnership moving forward so it's
really a great pleasure to have all of
you here I would also like to welcome
warmly our other guests I know that we
have a few guests from Cornell tonight
Stanford Berkeley Carnegie Mellon other
universities so welcome to all of you I
hope you enjoy the this evening and it's
it's really a pleasure to have you here
before I forget because i'm sure i'll
forget at the end you'll find on your
seats a feedback questionnaire so at the
end of the event if you have a couple of
minutes we'd like to hear from you what
you think and what we can continue to do
to strengthen our relationship with your
alumni community and with that I'd like
to hand it over to Alan eng who is the
president of columbia alumni club of
northern california and who's been
working very closely with us for this
event so thank you alan and it's too
after you alright so what do you guys
think of this venue isn't it awesome I
mean it's this is really really great
I'm so excited about the partnership
with Google that Columbia is forging
here and I'm also just really excited to
be here the Googleplex I mean heard so
much about it and I think with that we
really want to thank Sunita lafon Sarah
and the other folks at Google who put on
this event for us so I think they
deserve a round of applause what's going
around
so as soon as I mentioned my name is
Alan Inge and I am president of the
columbia alumni club here in Northern
California and I actually work at a
company that many might consider
Google's top competitor also has 2 o's
in its name and it's just down the
street and was also founded by two
stanford alumni but as evidenced by the
by those that I've met the Columbia I
that I've met there at that company as
well as all the Columbia lumps that I
met here at Google and then many of you
whom I met tonight the columbia alumni
have a very very strong presence here in
Silicon Valley in specifically as well
as in the bay area in general we have I
believe over 8,000 alums here and the
columbia alumni club of northern
california represent all of you
downstairs on the registration table you
guys might not have seen it coming in so
i encourage you to grab one on the way
out but there's this sheet of paper
which has some of the upcoming events
that the columbia alumni club is hosting
we host more than 30 events a year and
the number one thing that I ask of you
guys is to just check it out and
participate if you have a chance there's
a wide range of events that the
organization puts on from talks like
this too happy hours to going to
sporting events to going to Broadway
shows it's just a really great way to
meet other Columbia alums and to
contribute back to the university
community another group that helped put
this on is the Columbia engineering
school alumni association there's there
wasn't a representative that could come
here tonight and I just one I promised
that I would say a couple words about
them there if you're an engineering
school alum you are a member of that
engineering of that alumni association
and its unique in that it has its own
endowment actually which allows it to be
completely financially independent it's
over 100 years old and it puts on a lot
of great events like this one tonight
working with Google of course to make
this happen one of the things that they
just wanted me to mention is all the
great things that that alumni
association is working on on your behalf
a couple of things it does is it gives
away the Prentice scholarships to
distinguish students it gives away the
distinguished teacher faculty Awards
every year and it also puts on a
fantastic event back at low library on
campus that they want to invite you to
it's their annual awards dinner and it's
happening this year on November 11th so
if you have a chance they would love to
have you back for that event they give
away awards the most distinguished
alumni and so with that I think we
should move towards the program at hand
tonight I want to introduce one of our
distinguished alumni Neil the swanee
Neil is an expert in security of course
which is why we're talking about
security tonight but he's also an expert
in wireless technology as well as
peer-to-peer networking technology and
we're just really really glad to be able
to work with Neil and have him come
speak for us he has worked at a number
of very distinguished Bay Area
technology companies from lucent to
yodlee to docomo and of course here at
Google he's also had a bunch of teaching
positions when he was a PhD student and
an graduate of Stanford and he of course
also taught as a student when he was at
Columbia and the last thing I'll say
about him is he's a published author
this foundations of security book right
here one of the neat little facts about
is that the forward was written by deans
be Khalil who is the Dean of the School
of Engineering at Columbia so with that
I want to introduce Neil and have him
start the program great thank you
for the tech postal I need this no I put
this aside so so welcome everyone I
wanted to thank you all for coming out
tonight we're going to be talking about
cybercrime today and I I'm a really big
fan of bringing talented people together
so I'm really glad that Columbia was
able to work together with google for
this particular event I'm going to chat
for about maybe 40 maximum 45 minutes
and then I'm hoping to have some Q&amp;amp;A of
course if you have any questions that
come up before then please just let me
know I was looking at the set of folks
that registered for the event and I saw
a very good mix of both non-technical as
well as technical folks and so my hope
is that as I as I tell you about some
things that are going on I will
hopefully be able to appeal to both of
you of course if there's anything that's
confusing or unclear just just let me
know so I just want to give you a quick
overview as to some of the things I'm
going to be talking about I'm going to
start off talking about data breaches
I'm going to talk about hacking and the
title of the talk is protecting the
world from cyber crime and so to protect
the world from cyber crime I'm going to
talk specifically about three different
groups i'm going to talk about what
software people can do i'm going to talk
about what Google is doing and then I'm
going to talk about what you can do to
help protect yourself from various
threats on the internet and in fact
before I get underway I want to how many
how many of you would consider yourself
non-technical doing something besides
software okay and then the rest of you
software yeah okay so about half and
half so that seems quite reasonable so
being in the space of security i have
read press releases over the past four
or five years and after reading press
release after press release of security
vulnerability after vulnerability part
of me wonders whether or not the sky is
falling and let me provide some examples
that may help motivate why I a few
that way so I'll give some examples from
from the past few years last year
actually just about a month after I
published my book a holding company
called TJX which owns TJ maxx marshalls
a number of retail department stores
they announced probably what was the
largest cyber attack of all time in
which over 45 million credit card
numbers were stolen what the bad guys
basically did and you might ask well how
the heck did that happen right what the
bad guys basically did is they took
advantage of the fact that these retail
department stores were using Wi-Fi
technology to transmit credit card
numbers from the point-of-sale station
where they swipe your credit card to
their back-end servers so that they
wouldn't have to deploy cabling etc and
they were attempting to protect these
communications using a protocol called
WEP the wired equivalent privacy
protocol that was actually built into
the Wi-Fi standard but the technology
community and the security community
knew that this this protocol has been
vulnerable for some time and I guess TJX
didn't really upgrade so what this meant
for the attackers is they could simply
park the cars in the parking lot and or
drive by the retail department stores
gather lots of wireless traffic and due
to various vulnerabilities in this
particular protocol if they gather
enough traffic they can reverse-engineer
the encryption that was used figure out
the key and then decrypt all the traffic
and so the bad guys would do this for a
period of quite a quite a few months
even suspected out to be years and they
were able to steal you know a fairly
large number of credit cards from
transactions dating all the way back to
2002 so that's one example of something
that went wrong if you ever shopped at
any of these stores I would highly
recommend that you get identity
monitoring type protection for the
obvious reason did you know this this
size of event isn't isolated the year
prior to that there was a another data
breach that took place this particular
data breach
occurred at the Department of Veteran
Affairs so they would subcontract with a
number of other companies to help them
with some of their operations one of the
companies that they subcontracted to is
unisys and for those of you that are in
the field you know unisys has been
around for a long time what happened is
that one of the employees at unisys took
home a laptop and a hard drive that they
were not authorized to take home and
what happened that particular night is
that person's home got burglarized and
that hard drive that got stolen haven't
have name date of birth social security
information address information
insurance information for 26.5 million
veterans which is quite a significant
number and of course as per various data
breach laws passed by states they were
required to notify people the employee
was dismissed the supervisor was you
know resigned it was a big mess so
that's another another example a third
example is an example that comes to us
from a company called card systems whom
many of us would just have never ever
heard of they were basically one of
these back end credit card gateway
processing companies so whenever you
swipe your credit card there's a set of
gateways through which your information
goes through in order to authenticate
the credit card number so card systems
was one of such one of these such
companies and they had a database of
about 43 million credit card numbers
that they stored unencrypted which
didn't really big become you know a
bigger problem until somebody at card
systems decided to connect the website
to that database and so what happened is
that the bad guys would go to card
systems website except instead of you
know registering and choosing a username
and password and or filling out other
forms on the website what the bad guys
did is they started entering database
commands into that website now you'd
think that if a sites well protected it
shouldn't actually do anything with
those database commands but in this case
it did and as a result what the bad guys
were able to do is put a program onto
card systems database
which told the database to email them a
couple thousand credit card numbers
every day and this actually went on for
about six months before card systems
even noticed of course once they did
notice they had to notify Visa and
MasterCard and once they did that Visa
Mastercard cancel their contracts their
revenues went 2-0 their assets were
pretty much required by another company
so 43 million credit card numbers were
exposed to the at attack approximately
two hundred sixty three thousand were
were stolen so these are some pretty
spectacular events in fact if you if you
go back to 2005 there's a website called
privacy rights org that has been doing
their best to keep a chronology of all
of these types of data breaches and so
one of my one of my interns are catch a
day he compiled all this information
into some nice charts I've shown one of
these charts and so what it shows is
that since 2005 there have been there
have been over 230 million lost or
compromised records and what the chart
shows is how those credentials how those
customers records were were compromised
we can see from the pie chart that a
majority of it was due to hacking and
i'll tell you what i mean by hacking and
i'll show you some hacking type of
attacks but that's where a majority come
from comes from let's see there there
are other large parts of the pie that
just comes from lost in seoul and
equipment so this is you know bad guys
breaking in stealing a laptop that has a
hard drive that has lots of unencrypted
information on it or say an employee
loses the equipment that's kind of a bad
deal so this is a this is the breakdown
and this is this is how these things are
happening so for the remainder of the
talk what I'm going to do is I'm going
to focus on the hacking piece of it and
tell you a little bit about how some of
these act attacks occur as well as what
we can do as a community to help fight
them
so I I mentioned in the card systems
case that you know the bad guys kind of
broke into the website let me show you a
little bit about how that type of an
attack is is done some of you that are
technical probably have seen this before
and may realize how this works but you
can imagine that a website might want
you to enter a username and password and
so most reasonable users will enter a
proper username and password of course
the bad guys don't do that what the bad
guys do is they will enter a username
that looks like this too many of us it
might look like rubbish but for those of
you that are technical you'll you'll see
that this is actually a database command
and the bad guy can enter something for
the password it really doesn't matter
what and so you might ask well why would
this do anything why is this a threat
how does this result in you know bad
things happening so let me let me
explain that so most websites work kind
of as follows where it might be a user
that's using a web browser that web that
user that's using the web browser enter
a username or password into the browser
that username and password gets
transmitted to a web server the web
server needs to figure out is this a
authentic user or this is this an
illegitimate user and so what the web
server does is it constructs a database
command that does a lookup in the
database to see whether or not the
username and password are in detail
offending so for those of you that know
sequel structured query language you'll
you'll notice this is a sequel query and
it says basically get me the password
from the place in the database that
stores all the users where the user name
happens to match the username that was
provided on the web page now while this
is how things work normally you can
imagine that when the bad guy enters the
database command as the username that
string gets substituted in for this
variable and what happens is that what
used to be just to look up to the
database becomes more than that because
of the way that this malicious input is
structured it ends up actually not quite
being for any users all right I rather
at issues a query but that Prairie pride
doesn't return anything but the rest of
the input makes up a database command
that says delete all the information
about all the users from the database
right and so the database of course
we'll go ahead and execute this and
everything everything is now blank so
this is an example of what's called the
denial of service attack where by any
user any legitimate user that tries to
login after this point will end up not
being able to login so this is an
example of how you can do bad things to
it to a database of course you can
imagine that this is the only bad thing
you could do the database I could once I
have this capability I can steal
information from the database I can you
know put or alter information in the
database so that that's a pretty bad
deal so for those of you that are the
Technical Community you know that
there's ways to prevent these kinds of
attacks I won't walk through those types
of Prevention's I of course talk about
those types of Prevention's in my book
but let me let me go on and tell you
about some additional bad things that
can happen so before I talk about some
other other types of hacking threats I
just want to mention that the particular
threat that you've seen is called sequel
injection and it's so popular and so
well known that there's even cartoons
about it right so for those of you that
read the cartoon you'll see that this is
a case where a high school student was
mucking around with probably the grades
database or something like this and the
mother gets a call of course you know
the mother has no sympathy for to the
school and they should protect their
database a little bit better so so
that's one type of bad thing that can
occur another type of bad thing that can
occur is inside that a sequel injection
there's another attack called cross-site
request forgery and let me just set up
the scenario and I'll try not to get too
overly technical but imagine the
following scenario imagine that a user a
good user named Alice logs in tor bank
so she goes to her site bank calm she
probably wants to check her bank balance
and the way that most websites work is
that on the front page you may enter say
your username and password and what what
what the website will do is the the
website doesn't want you to have to
enter your username and password to view
every single page on the site so what it
does is it gives you back it gives your
browser something called the cookie how
many of you have heard of a cookie and
how many of you are non technical and
I've heard of a cookie okay good so so
this is one of the things that that
cookies already used for now in this
particular attack scenario what happens
is that Alice may be logged in door bank
in one browser window and in another
browser window she may get lured to an
evil website and there are lots of ways
to get lured to an evil website right
you could receive an email and there
might be some kind of malicious link in
the email you happen to click on the
link and it takes you off to a malicious
page well let's see what kind of bad
things can happen when a user happens to
be logged in to their bank and in
another window they get lured to the bad
guys site so let me just review what
what happens here in the good case in
the good case Alice contacts or bank and
her bank gives her back a web page that
says please login please provide me with
your username and password so Allah says
ok I want to log into my bank I will
provide the username and password so
once Alice provides the user and
password her a computer makes a request
to bank calm and provides her username
Ellis and our password is I love Bob
what bank calm does is bank calm looks
up the username and password in their
database and sees whether or not this
user is indeed authentic and in this
case it is Alice she's a good user her
password really is i love Bob calm and
so what the bank does is says oh okay
this is an authentic user let me go
ahead and give Alice a cookie so that
when her browser makes subsequent
requests I can know it's Alice and I
don't have to require her to type in or
a username and password again so so she
receives that webpage
you've logged in successfully and then
let's say that she wants to view her
bank balance what the browser does is it
makes a request to bank calm after she
clicks on the link to view her balance
and because Ellis is logged into bank
calm and the bank com site gave her this
cookie her browser gives the cookie back
to the server and the the bank calm
server says oh I've seen this session
idea before I've seen this cookie before
I just gave it to Alice it must be Alice
who wants to see her bank balance and so
I'll tell her that her bank balances
$25,000 right so this is how things work
in the in the good case so she is logged
in to bank calm in one window let's say
in another window she gets lured to an
evil site let's look at what can happen
so in in this case things start off as
before you know she logs in she gets it
she goes to her bank website she gets a
page that asks her for the username and
password she provides the user name and
password she gets back the cookie except
what happens now is let's say that she
gets lured to the evil site in some
other window well her browser makes a
request for the evil site because that's
where she got lured to and the evil site
might send back a web page to her now
web pages are very interesting things
right web pages you know can include
images they can include text they can
include movies that conclude all kinds
of things and the way the web works one
of the great things about the web is
that one web page can include images and
texts and stuff from all kinds of other
web sites in one page right so for those
of you have built websites you probably
use this feature of the web all the time
of course what happens in this case is
that when her second browser window gets
lured to evil com email.com sends her a
web page back that has an image in it
and this image what evil com tell us
where browser is that this image that
you should retrieve for me is on the
bank com site and to retrieve this image
you should execute this pay bill program
on the bank site and by the way here's
some
parameters that you should provide to
the pay bail program so what happens
Alice's browser you know was was lured
to this other site and Alice's browser
wants to faithfully render the web page
for Alice so what does Alice's browser
do Alice's browser makes a request to
bank.com now because alice is already
logged into bank calm in addition to
making the request to run this pay bill
program because it's already logged into
bank calm it also supplies the cookie so
bank calm gets this request that says
pay a bill send the bill send a check of
ten thousand dollars to 123 impul street
and it also sees that the cookie is
there and tabang calm this looks
completely authentic so what does the
bank calm sorber do it goes ahead and
issues issues the check 22 1 2 3 oval
street and alice just got twenty five
thousand dollars or in this case ten
thousand dollars stolen out of her bank
account now you can imagine that the bad
guys need to be a little bit smarter
than this right because if I'm the bad
guy and I have all these checks coming
to me and I go cash them then you know
someone's going to find out and turn me
in so if I'm a bad guy what do i do well
I start up a whole bunch of websites
where i put out job advertisements for
companies that don't really exist and i
recruit people for pay it home jobs you
know work out at home you know you need
to have some set of skills we require
you to have an internet banking account
we require you to be able to receive
checks and basically they'll have those
folks deposit these checks they tell
them you keep a ten percent for yourself
and then just transfer the rest to us so
what the what the bad guys have done
here in the in the online world is
they've hired a bunch of mules to end up
siphoning money to them so this is
another type of attack on the web so so
let's see so that that's how many of you
think this is scary yeah so the question
is what do we do about it right well I'm
going to talk initially about what um
software developers and
and software managers can do about it if
you're if you're a software developer
one of the one of the issues in the
education programs for computer
scientists and software developers as
they typically don't require you to take
courses in security when you get your
degree and the problem is that you know
you'll graduate you'll go to accompany
you may not be aware of how the bad guys
are going to try to manipulate the code
that's going to be running on your
company's website and you know so it's
important to become educated about about
these things my hope is that over time
universities will start teaching this
and start requiring it but I think that
process will take time so if you're at
your software developer you should arm
and educate yourself ideally it would be
good to be in a position where every
software developer knows about security
so that everyone can be vigilant when
they're writing websites and writing
programs but you know even even if
you're at that point and certainly if
you're before that point it makes sense
two on each project on each software
project I left elect someone to be the
software security czar so they kind of
keep an eye out for what are the bad
things and how can the the code and
websites that you're building get abused
so that's what you can do if you're a
software developer if you're a manager
it's extremely important to when you're
developing your software to make sure
that your software development process
is instrumented for security and that's
an important component I'll talk about
that in just a second it's also
important to organize initiatives in
your company for security so it might
make sense to have you no one to have
there be a group of security advisers
internally at your company that can
advise other projects about security it
might make sense to take if you have
people that have experience in security
to put embed them in various projects
around the company and service
satellites right one model that has not
worked well is a model where you take
all your security people and put them in
one department and turn them into the
gatekeeper for all the programs and
projects that come out of the company
there's simply no way that a
that a small group of security engineers
running as a gatekeepers can secure all
the applications coming out of the
company so so so you need to organize
for security it's also important to
invest in training so that for those
developers that are in your company that
didn't know about security they can
learn about it and even for those that
are you need to make sure to keep them
continually up-to-date and train why
because all the attacks are changing and
so it's important to learn about the new
attacks it's also important to give them
a paranoid mindset and teach them how to
think in a paranoid way about every
possible thing that could go wrong so
let me I mentioned instrumenting
development processes for security I'm
going to talk a little bit about that
actually and I'm going to illustrate
that with this picture I'm actually very
honored that well this picture comes
from a book by a Gary MacGraw called
software security I'm honored that Gary
McGraw is here in our audience today and
if you hear someone heckling it may be
him but but the the idea here is that
you know for those of you that are
familiar with software development
processes they're typically developed
they're typically organized into a
couple different steps right so you
might have a step which requires you to
gather requirements about how and what
kind of features you would like to put
into your software system there might
then be a stage where you come up with
the architecture and design at later
points you you write test plans you
write the program code you're at the
software code you test the code and then
you push it out and you get feedback
from the field and the important thing
is that at each of these steps there's
various things that you should be doing
to ensure that the software products
that your company is producing will be
secure so in the requirements phase for
instance you should not just be thinking
about what's the functionality of the
system what do I want the software to do
but I also want to I should also talk
about what do I not want the software to
do in the case that somebody's trying to
abuse it so we should come up with a
bunch of abuse cases you should also
develop various types of security
requirements right think about different
types of attacks that
someone might try to conduct against
your system and how how would you like
to to deal with that what are the
requirements in the architecture phase
it's important to analyze the risks it's
important to test for those risks when
you're at the code stage it's important
to use things like static analysis tools
and dynamic analysis tools maybe even
that help identify potential security
vulnerabilities in the code of course
when you have a system that has been
developed you might want to do what's
called a penetration test so the idea is
that like if you compare this to to your
house you want someone to look at both
the outside and the inside of your house
and look at where the doors are and look
at where the windows are and try to
think about what does the attacker need
to do to break in you know should I move
the window higher etc you want to do
these kinds of things and penetration
testing can also use a bunch of
automated tools to help try automated
break-ins so there's a number of things
that i'd encourage engineering and
software managers to do to instrument
their life cycles for for security so
i've talked a bit about i talked a bit a
little bit about these high the way that
hacking takes place most of the ways
that I've showed you are due to what's
called web application vulnerabilities
vulnerabilities in web applications and
what I'm gonna do is I'm going to shift
gears a little bit i'm going to talk a
little bit about malware but then i'm
going to tell you a little bit about how
these two things are related so how many
of you know what malware is okay good so
so malware is basically malicious
software programs that are written to do
bad things they're typically written by
cybercriminals actually used to be the
case that maybe three four or five years
ago this kind of malicious software was
written by teenagers who wanted to get a
little bit of Fame for themselves and
have their virus or worms for spread
throughout the internet but one of the
key changes that's occurred over the
past three or four years is that since
there's a lot more commerce taking place
online the bad guys are going to want to
make sure they get their cut too and so
they have become the primary authors of
malware and so if you look at what are
the kinds of things that malware do
these days instead of just
kind of spreading from machine to
machine they are doing things like
logging all of your keystrokes so once
your computer gets infected that
software will effectively a log right
down in some file every keystroke that
you type so this means that when you log
into a website or you provide any type
of credential that malicious piece of
software gets all of the usernames and
passwords that you say happen to type in
so that's that's one bad thing that
malware can do another bad thing that
malware can do is that it can once it
infects your computer it can have your
computer join a network of other
compromised computers so what the what
the cyber criminals do is that they
infect a whole bunch of computers and
then they have them connect to some
servers that they control and they can
basically then have those servers send
out commands of their own choice to all
those infected machines so that they can
for instance you know some people ask
well why is spam such a big problem
right can't you just cut this off at the
server or something like this well part
of the problem is that there's a whole
bunch of malicious or there's a whole
bunch of compromised client machines on
the internet you know people's home pcs
that send that serve as the relays to
forward spam around the internet and so
that's another type of thing that
malware will do once it's on your
machine I could go on and on about all
the things that malware does but I you
know and feel free to ask me about that
afterwards but instead of what I'm going
to talk about is how malware has has
changed with regard to distribution
right so it used to be the case that
when you got infected would say a worm
or virus what the warmer virus would try
to do is it would try to spread to say
other computers on your local area
network right within your company or
what it would do is it would look at all
the contacts in your in your Outlook
mail application and then forward itself
to all the people in your address book
what's fundamentally changed about the
way that malware is distributed is that
the bad guys realize that the web has
actually become
a much better platform for spreading
malware so you could imagine that if
there's some popular websites if I can
somehow infect those websites so that
everybody that visits those websites
gets infected just by visiting the
website then you know if a million
people hit a particular website i can
just infect a million people and so this
is effectively what is happening the
distribution of malware has now changed
to to the web so what the bad guys will
do is they will break into websites and
whereas they used to for instance to
face the front pages right after I break
into a website I put up my logo and I
put up my name and say hey I hacked this
website cool this would happen very
often with government websites the bad
guys don't do that anymore what they do
or they still do it but not as much as
the other things when I talk about
basically what they'll do is instead of
defacing the front page or defacing any
of the pages on the site they'll leave
what's on the pages there and they will
just add you know a little snippet of
code that will go source in some extra
content from servers in Russia China and
basically download malware to your
computer when you visit the web page no
user interaction required so when you
get to an infected web page you don't
click on anything you don't download
anything simply visiting the web page
will infect your computer and this is
how this is how the bad guys are now
distributing malware so so this gets
actually really bad you know you might
you might ask well if a if a cyber
criminal has to kind of break into one
web server at a time it might take them
a lot of time to compromise lots of
machines on the web it might take them a
lot of time to infect lots of people
well what they've done effectively is
they have automated their attacks so
what the bad guys will do is they will
first abuse search engines they will
make queries to you know the search
engines that you're familiar with and
they will ask questions like give me a
list of all websites that say happen to
be running you know some vulnerable
database server
and when the attackers get back these
lists of sites that are running say
vulnerable database servers or
vulnerable web applications what their
programs will do after it gets back the
list of vulnerable sites is that it will
issue automated attacks to inject some
of the malicious code that I showed on
the previous slide into the databases on
those websites now many many websites
effectively dynamically generate their
content dynamically generate their pages
based on information and databases so if
the database has this malicious code in
it and it gets spit back on every web
page that's shown on that website you
can imagine that this is a pretty
effective attack platform pretty much
any user that comes to view pages on
infected sites will now get infected
just by viewing the page and once the
malware is on there it can log the users
keystrokes or do whatever they would
like in fact um what the what the what
these guys do what sub criminals do is
they assemble these botnets right and
the botnets get rented out so so so
somebody may infect a whole bunch of web
pages they may get a whole bunch of
infected user machines and then they
will go on to underground chat networks
and they'll trade with each other some
guy will say hey I have a hundred
thousand infected machines what would
you like to do with them somebody else
would say hey you know I'd like to log
all the users keystrokes and so they
kind of trade and well what's the
payment some guy says oh I have 10,000
stolen credit card numbers so I'll trade
you the 10,000 stolen credit card
numbers for access to 10,000 machines
I'll use those machines to get more
credentials and then it will allow me to
you know get more credit card numbers
it's kind of a crazy cycle so so so this
is what the cyber or criminal community
is doing so what are we what are we
doing about it let me now talk about for
instance how Google is helping so some
of you may have noticed that when you do
searches on Google these days if you
happen to enter certain keywords and
I've left off the keywords for this
particular search intentionally but you
might get back you might get back a list
of
search results and some of those results
now due to features that Google is built
in will label some of these sites and
say this site may harm your computer and
if a user tries to click on that link i
mean basically Google thinks that if the
user goes to this website their computer
may very well get infected by malware
just by viewing the page and so if the
user tries to click this link google
says you know we're really not kidding
this site will infect your computer and
so so for for users it's important not
to go to these sites you know take take
the warning seriously let's see for
webmasters you can imagine that for
websites that get infected in this
fashion it's it's very very painful
right and so what I'd encourage them to
do is sometimes it's not even clear they
probably you know the website owners
didn't do anything wrong right they
didn't do anything malicious themselves
but their site just got infected because
it had some vulnerability and so what
what they should do is they should go to
stop bad word org which is a nonprofit
consortium organization and there's
various discussion groups that stop bad
word org I stop bad word or they can
join a discussion group and if they if
they need help you know cleaning up
their site they can post messages there
and there's a community that can that
can help them so that's um that's what
you should keep in mind this is what
Google is doing to help protect you
while you're searching your computer one
of the things that I should also mention
is that while Google protects you while
you're searching on Google and you know
seeing search results google also
supplies the list of infected sites to
various third parties for instance
there's a companies that make web
browsers and so this list of infected
sites is provided to organizations that
that build web browsers and so this way
when you're browsing anywhere else on
the internet you're not just searching
but when you're browsing anywhere else
on the internet your browser can protect
you from sites that may be infected with
malware by taking advantage of this list
of
malicious sites are not malicious sites
but rather infected sites so some of you
that our technical may wonder well how
does Google do this how do you figure
out what are all the infected websites
in the world well as you probably know
in order to get you the search results
that Google does Google needs to have a
big index has to have a big repository
of all of the web pages right and what
Google does is it it runs what's called
a MapReduce job to look through all of
the web pages and look for signs of
funny things going on so for instance if
a website has some obfuscate Adama
script on it and it looks a little bit
fishy than what what Google will do is
it will compile a list of suspicious web
suspicious URL suspicious websites and
it will kick off a bunch of machines and
load these URLs in these machines these
machines are actually a virtual they're
not real they're running in a big server
farm but the idea is that inside of this
virtual machine on one of Google servers
it loads this URL and what it looks for
is for instance if this virtual machine
was a clean and you know fresh and after
viewing this web page the machine is now
there's a new program running on it that
wasn't supposed to be there this is a
clear sign that it's bad so it takes
that list of you know suspicious URLs
tests out each of the URLs figures out
which ones are really bad and creates a
repository of malicious pages and then
of course when the search takes place
all of the search result links are
looked up in this malicious page
repository and if it appears in the most
page repository Google will say the site
may harm your computer so that's how
that that works for those of you that
are the more technical so so anyhow so I
talked down I've talked about you know
malware distribution and you know the
way that the way that web application
vulnerabilities and hacking things are
related is because of the fact that the
bad guys are taking
advantage of vulnerabilities in web
sites to effectively infect them with
this malware drive-by download code so
these two things are late what I'm going
to do now is I'm going to tell you about
some of the some of the more recent
attacks so these malware drive-by
downloads attacks have been taking place
since you know early two thousand seven
maybe even a little bit earlier and
Google's been you know blacklisting such
sites for about that time but let me
tell you about some of the new things
that the bad guys are doing let's see so
the bad guys don't just do a technical
attacks they they have to that'd be
pretty smart they use a technique called
social engineering to make their attacks
more significant and so you know in one
of the attacks they have you know
sometimes they might need to get you to
click on an imposter site they may need
to do to get you a web page and these
are some of the headlines that they've
been using so they'll send out emails to
people and they'll say breaking news you
know and the emails might say come from
MSNBC and it says breaking news
abortions outlined in California
abortion is outward in California or you
know google launches free music
downloads in China I mean some of this
stuff is just a little silly but you can
imagine that things like McCain gives up
fighting for the presidency might
encourage a lot of people to become
interested in the message and so what
what they'll do and actually this uh
this was pointed to me by amit patel who
was one of Google's first ten employees
on he he pointed me to a blog which had
some of these pictures basically this is
an example of an email message that
comes supposedly from MSNBC that arrives
in your inbox and it looks it looks
pretty legitimate right it has it has a
bunch of text it tells you about some
breaking news you know it has a bunch of
links in it it has some links at the
bottom this link here at the bottom will
really go off to Microsoft's privacy web
page this link here will really go to a
place which lets you suppose you know
unsubscribe from a list what what what
this link does and of course this is the
link that's right below the headline
that everybody click
on is it will take you to not a you know
many of you that are familiar with
phishing attacks are familiar that if
you click on such types of links it
might take you to a page that looks like
your bank's website and try to encourage
you to type in your username and
password right well the bad guys have
decided that's too much work I can
infect you easier what I do is I get you
to just click on this link and then I'll
take you to an infected website and that
infected website installs malware on
your machine and then once now where is
installed on your machine it can
basically log all of your keystrokes
they don't need to get you to any site
so this is an example of how the bad
guys are combining social engineering
together with fishing and now we're
drive-by downloads to create havoc on
the Internet so I've told you but of
course you know if you if you say use a
browser that has the anti-malware
protections you know provided by say
Google's Google's list of malicious you
know infected websites then you would be
protected so what I'm going to do now is
I'm going to tell you about say a dozen
things that you can do to protect
yourself online let me let me walk
through these so what can you do so how
many of you have wireless routers at
home how many of you when you got it
plugged it in and connect it to it about
half of you what do the what are the
other half of you do before you started
using it you hopefully change the router
is default username and password right
the reason this is important is because
there is an attack where if you don't
change the password for your router
effectively the way you administer and
manager router is the the router has a
little website built into it and so what
the bad guys can do is they can take
advantage of vulnerabilities in that
website that's used to manage your
router and do things like change some of
the very basic settings that your router
uses to connect to the internet right
once the once the bad guys have have
done that you know
then even if you enter bankofamerica com
correctly in the browser address bar if
the attacker has changed some of those
fundamental settings that are used to
connect to to the internet they could
take you wherever they would like so for
those of you that are more technical you
know that when you type in bankofamerica
com into a browser that really means
nothing to your to your machine that
name needs to get translated to an IP
address kind of like a telephone number
on the internet to figure out how to
connect your computer to the computer
you really want to communicate with and
so what the bad guys do is they take
advantage of vulnerabilities and the web
sites used to administer your routers to
change the dns servers that are used to
translate those names to the IP
addresses so change your default router
password also we talked about we talked
about web which is the security protocol
that TJX attempted to use to protect the
credit card numbers while in transit
over wireless so one thing you should do
is don't use WEP on your router instead
use a protocol called WPA and choose a
password and so you'll you'll choose a
password on the router and then you
choose a password on your computer and
it will be able to communicate securely
so use wpa we could also use a personal
firewall you should always keep it on if
a dialog box ever comes up saying would
you like to show off your personal
firewall or connect shut it off you know
just for a couple seconds or whatever
you should probably say no right so use
a personal firewall it'll help defend
your computer against what are called
network layer attacks on the Internet
use antivirus use good antivirus
antivirus you can actually get it for
free you can go to sites like pack
google com and you can get norton
security scan to to help defend your
computer against viruses it's important
to if your antivirus package says hey I
need an update I need to go out to the
antivirus server and get some updates
you should interrupt whatever you're
doing and let it do that update and the
reason is what the bad guys do is
eh sometimes target vulnerabilities in
the antivirus software itself so if you
have a particular antivirus package
running the bad guy can take advantage
of a vulnerability in the antivirus
package and take over a computer that
way so if your antivirus package ever
tells you hey I need to run out to my
server to get an update you should
listen in addition to keeping your
antivirus up to date you should always
keep your operating system up to date so
what happens is that whenever there's
you know critical enough of a thing
Microsoft will issue an update and you
know have your have your computer get
rebooted but even even for other types
of updates if you get that little box
that pops up and says hey there's a
critical security update or there's any
other kind of an update it's probably a
good idea to update your operating
system because the bad guys are you know
continuously running all kinds of
scanners and motions programs on the
internet that are trying to break into
machines so always auto update you
should also you know it's important to
do everything you can to protect your
computer at the same time something can
go wrong and it it might not just be
security-related but your hard drive
might crash all kinds of things could go
wrong so I strongly encourage making
backups and or using a backup service
it's just a prudent thing to do I
mentioned now we're drive-by download
attacks I mentioned that there's some
browsers that have malware protection
built in I would encourage you to use a
browser that has malware and phishing
protection built in so firefox 3 for
instance pulls a list of infected sites
from google on a daily or more often
basis and so that way when you're
browsing around the internet the browser
can help protect you against interacting
with websites that may potentially
infect your computer so I'd encourage
you to use that by the way I should
mention that you know all these slides
will be available at learn security com
or off of my website at Neal daswani com
you can you can download it from there
you know share it with whoever the IT
administrator is in your home whether
it's your your your small son or whoever
happens to be
so so what are the things can you do to
to protect yourself you should not
install software that you don't trust so
one of the issues with certain operating
systems you know like Windows XP for
instance is that when a piece of
software it gets installed on your
machine it gets full access to
everything on your machine it can do
whatever it would be like and so you
know if there happens to be some cool
freeware or shareware package you know
unless it's coming from a reputable
company and or you trust them from for
some reason you know you should you
should not download and install it
because you're actually giving it lots
of lots of privileges and in the
security world we have a principle
called the principle of least privilege
and the idea is that you should only
give a program or in fact a person
enough privileges to do exactly what
they need to do and no more right so for
instance when you drop your car off at
the valet you give the valley the valet
key why you don't want them to open your
trunk and take whatever is in it right
operating systems are getting better but
many operating systems today will let
programs do whatever they want even
though you only probably want that
program to do a certain set of limited
things another recommendation is to use
bookmarks for financial sites so the
idea is that if you type bankofamerica
com really quick let's say you're in a
rush to check your bank balance you
might miss type it and you might get
sent to some site that you think is
bankofamerica com it looks like bank
america calm but it's really not so one
way to deal with this is to at some time
when you're relaxed well rested type in
bank of it bankofamerica com make sure
that it's correct and then set up a
bookmark and then what are your very you
access of financial or such a site use
the bookmark to access it in that way
you know that it got entered correctly
let's see when you get to secure sites
like banking sites or brokerage sites or
even potentially your email if you log
in using SSL how many of you know what
SSL is it's the protocol that's used
when you have that little lock at the
bottom or side of your browser you
should you know once you login and
you know you're about to or once you're
even before you log in when you see the
username and password fields on the page
you know check that it's SSL a check
that there's a lock their don't enter
your username and password if there's no
lock there you should if your computer
gets to a website and says I'm going to
this website i'm trying to connect to it
using SSL and it pops up a warning
saying there's something seems to be
wrong with the web server its
certificate does not seem to be valid do
not continue interacting with the site
right if it's if it's a reputable
website they should be worrying about
making sure they have updated
certificates and security credentials on
the site to prove to your browser that
it's it's okay to interact with it so
don't ignore security warnings let's say
you should of course use good passwords
right so what is a good password a good
password is typically not something that
you'd find a word that you'd find in the
dictionary it's not a street name it's
not you know any and because the way to
think about this is that you know if you
thought about hacking right you're like
okay well a bad guy can try a whole
bunch of usernames and passwords and try
to break into my account try to guess my
password but of course the bad guys use
automated tools so they don't just try
one password at a time they'll have a
program tries trying a million passwords
within a second computers are really
fast micro processors can do things
really fast so you need to choose a
password that's very very hard to guess
right what one recommendation is you can
kind of um you know I think of a quote
that you might like and that that might
not be very common so one put that I
like and I didn't happen to you know
choose my password based on this quote
but the quote is but let's say the you
know the quote is by JM Barrie it's um
basically let's see so it's only work if
you'd rather be doing something else
right so what you could imagine doing is
taking you know the first character of
each of the words in that quote and
using that to construct your password
right maybe throw in a you know an extra
number in there or something like that
so come up with a good password in
addition to coming up with a good
password many of you use websites that
if you forget your password allow you to
reset your password
using a password reset functionality on
the website and the way these things
work is they'll ask you some kind of
security question right they'll say what
was the name of your dog or what was the
name of your pet something like that
it's important that most websites allow
you to choose either what you want your
security question to be right completely
a choice or they'll choose a couple ones
so it's important that when you decide
what you would like your password reset
answers to be I mean you should choose
questions that other people wouldn't
know about you so let me go ahead and
give an example how many of you heard
that Paris Hilton's phone got hacked
like back in two thousand four how many
even heard that right let me tell you
how many know how that high hack
happened okay so the way the heck
happened is that Paris Hilton had had a
pet right and so you know you might
imagine that her username might be
something like p hilton right and i
think she I don't know if she was using
tmobile or what what the wireless
carrier was but she basically had a
password reset question her password
reset question like was what was the
name of your pet or what was the name of
your cat or dog or something like this
well how do I find out what's the name
of Paris Hilton's pet open any magazine
or do a search using google right so
what the bad guy does is says oh my
username is P Hilton I've forgot my
password the attacker gets the password
reset question the password reset
question is what's the name of your pet
just enter a search on Google find out
the name of Paris Hilton's pet and now I
can reset Paris Hilton's password to be
whatever I want it to be that's how the
bad guy got Paris Hilton's broke into
their broken door phone got a contact
information got the numbers of all her
friends so so so it's not important to
just use good passwords but you need to
choose good password reset questions to
when you do online transactions you can
for instance use a credit card your
credit card company might want to give
you a really big limit your credit card
company might be like okay I'll give you
a twenty-thousand-dollar limit you
should probably you know for the credit
card that you're going to do for online
or that you're going to use for online
transactions choose a lower limit so
that way of god forbid the card numbers
ever stolen you know the
limit is thresholded but also when you
do transactions using credit cards your
liability is limited to fifty dollars or
even less some of them 00 it's now 0 so
so that's one thing you can do you can
also use what are called virtual one
time credit cards so some banks like
citibank will let you download a package
which will effectively every time you
want to do a credit card transaction you
can say generate a new credit card
number for me and you can then enter
that virtual one time use credit card
number into the site that you're
interacting with and that way if that
number happens to get stolen it's ok
it's only valid for one use so that's
another option I know I should mention
that you know this list of about a dozen
or so things that you can do to secure
yourself online I you know I am I'm a
big fan of some of these practices
myself I also owe a lot to the the set
of security Jedi's on Google security
team I kind of pulled them and ask them
hey if I'm talking to a bunch of folks
what what can I tell them and so I
really thank that team for helping come
up with this list on in general in
addition to doing these things I mean
there's there's something to keep in
mind not just not just online but
probably offline as well and that is if
it sounds too good to be true it
probably is so if you receive an email
from some prints in Nigeria right that
once helped transferring money it's
probably too good to be true so in any
case I'm going to I'm going to summarize
to help protect ourselves from
cybercrime online there's a number of
things that can be done I'd encourage
software people to learn more about
security to organize appropriately
within their companies to do everything
they can in their software code to
prevent vulnerabilities I told you a
little bit about Google is good what
Google is doing when you search with
google you're going to be protected from
being sent off to web sites that might
infect your computer and if you use a
browser with malware protection like
firefox 3
Google provides them with a list that
can help defend your computer there as
well and then I spend some time telling
you about a dozen things that you can do
to be vigilant my hope is that if we all
employ a number of these measures then
we can all work together to help allow
the internet to continue to continue to
grow you know and allow us to do
commerce collaborate and communicate in
perhaps ways that we haven't even yet
imagined Thanks and it looks like there
might be questions I'd be happy to
answer questions hi if you guys could
actually line up in the middle aisle for
those of you that want to ask questions
we'll have a mic okay for you it's very
good in fact I'm and after I after I
take these questions I might ask some
questions of my own and give out a
couple copies of my book but let's take
your questions first yes being subjected
to do a cyber attacks from from nations
unknown and i as i understand it to the
recent incursion into the nation of
georgia was preceded by massive cyber
attacks how does that how does that
relate the way you're talking about is
there any on that macro levels any
really in any defense to that are we
vulnerable to that the next time there's
a 911 type incident that's question okay
so i'd be happy to answer the question
so there's many many threats online
right i've talked about some things that
are kind of within the purview of
software developers and and end-users
and google to help solve there is of
course the issue of a massive
cyberattack so there there's an attack
called the distributed denial of service
where what the bad guys do is they
compromise a whole bunch of machines
they'll use a botnet like i talked about
earlier except what they'll do is they
will once they compromise all those
machines and say have compromised a
hundred thousand or more machines they
will then tell those machines to start
generating tons of traffic and requests
and data packets on the internet to
effectively flood llege
its servers and what happened that's
exactly what happened in the case of
Estonia the bad guys launched a
distributed denial-of-service attack
with regard to cyber attacks in general
you know these things are possible you
know when the when the internet was
designed it was designed as a trusted
Network initially except what happened
is it became very popular and successful
faster than anyone could have imagined
including Vint Cerf who was so kind as
to write the foreword for my book let's
see deanzie galil rhoda endorsement
which is which is great but the issue is
that the internet is still susceptible
to distributed denial-of-service attacks
and the the department of homeland
security as well as the number of the
government organizations have started
taking a lot more interest in these
types of things so I I can't say that
there is a absolute easy defense against
this basically to defend against
distributed denial-of-service attacks
you need to make some changes at network
layer infrastructure at your routers and
what not currently one of the best
offenses is actually just to / provision
to buy bigger routers that can handle so
much traffic that even if someone
generates that they won't be able to
generate enough traffic to overload it
but clearly we need you know we need to
deploy better defenses there's been a
lot of research into techniques like IP
trace back but you know those those
defenses haven't yet been in fully
deployed so there's much work to be done
to deal with network layer distributed
novel service tax Gary
Thanks sure so my understanding is that
there's two major problems either
they're trying to take over your
computer and use it to process
information or packets or software or
they're trying to steal your financial
information and it sounds like for the
financial information it's a couple of
credit card companies you're talking
visa master discover JCB amex that's
pretty much 99% of credit cards in the
world why what are they doing since
they're the ones that lose the money so
what um what the what the what the
credit card companies have done is they
have created a set of standards through
a group called the payment card industry
pci and for any merchant that takes a
credit card number online they require
that merchant to be PCI compliant they
basically have to follow a certain set
of rules you know and pass audits in
order to to continue to have the right
to take credit card numbers so PCI
compliance has been having some effect
from but one thing to keep in mind is
that is that compliance doesn't mean
security you know just because I can
convince an auditor that I'm doing
certain things doesn't mean I'm secure
it just means I'm complying with the
certain set of rules if there's for
instance say a novel attack that comes
out you can you can still be taken so so
so PCI compliance is a is a step that
the credit card companies are taking to
help ensure that merchants are you know
attempting to be responsible with regard
to taking credit card numbers I have two
short questions the first I think might
just be yes or no question is
bookmarking your financial websites any
form of defense against sort of
keystroke logging attacks since you
wouldn't actually be typing in your
institutions name or right so answer
that vm you know bookmarking your
financial assistant websites will not
defend you against you know certain
types of attacks like keystroke logging
right the the idea what it does defend
you against
is say for instance you know you should
if you always use those bookmarks and
only use those bookmarks then if you
supposedly get an email from your bank
right and there's a link to suppose a
link to your website in the bank you
know if you if you don't click on that
link but instead go to your bookmark
you'll know you'll hopefully so long as
you haven't been compromised in some
other way get to your bank's website and
it's actually your bank I had mentioned
things like changing your router
password make sure you do that because
you know if you don't do that and you
still use the bookmark you could still
end up at the at the wrong side okay
second question is also i think pretty
brief one is there a difference in
security level between sort of the free
or open-source security software
antivirus software and you know the
Nortons of the world so I'll answer that
and now actually a paraphrase from a
section in one of Gary's books you know
open source versus closed source isn't
it doesn't usually give you any security
guarantees one way or the other right um
if you need to make a open source vs.
closed source decision it's something
that you should decide based on the
business model of your company right if
I decide to make some software open
source so that supposedly other software
developers can see the code and
potentially look for security
vulnerabilities in the code you're
hoping for a lot you're hoping for if
they find the vulnerabilities you're
hoping that they tell you and that they
don't exploit it and even if you have a
close source it doesn't mean that your
software isn't vulnerable to attack it's
pretty easy to reverse-engineer binary
code that is closed source so if you're
even if you're you're doing closed
source you should make sure to have
security audits on your software done so
you know open source versus closed
source is actually orthogonal to
security Neal thanks for spending this
evening talking to us about this Steven
ball for class of OA Columbia Business
School questions so we've been talking a
lot about what you can do as a user to
protect yourself I think the other side
of the table is as the web continues to
grow
exponentially small businesses large
large enterprise businesses or other
startups and in between what are some
things that they can do as additional
nodes enter the Internet to build trust
and enjoin kind of the trusted side of
the community so the question is what
can small medium and enterprises do to
help say ensure security on their on
their websites you know it used to be
the case that what security for a
website meant was going to say verisign
and getting a certificate for your for
your web server so that you could have
an authenticated connection for a user
those days are long gone companies need
to do a lot more you know kind of the
root cause of the problem is typically
in an application code that that you
build for your website and so it's
important to do a number of things it's
important to as I mentioned earlier
instrument or software development life
cycle so that software that you're
running that gets put on your website
you know is built using a process that
facilitates security it's important to
as I mentioned earlier it's important to
train your engineers to make sure that
they understand how their software can
be attacked by a sequel injection
cross-site request forgery cross-site
scripting clusion cross-site scripting
there's a whole host of these types of
attacks I should also mention that you
know the security of software is
something that you know you can't
exactly build software and then decide
to make it secure afterwards security
actually has a you know you know things
in common with quality right you can't
decide to build a product and say I want
to make it a quality product after that
you kind of have that the quality has to
be inherent in the product that you
build just like the security has to be
inherent in the product that you build
so I'd say that it's important to take
those to take those steps there are
other things that you can do for
instance you can if you're a website and
let's say that you've identified that
you're deployed code has some
vulnerabilities and it might take you 60
to 90 days to fix those vulnerabilities
because you know you have to fix it you
have to write the code for that you have
to test it you have to deploy it one
thing that you can do in the interim
instead of having your web
be vulnerable to those issues for some
amount of time is you can deploy
something like a web application
firewall so it's a little bit different
than a network layer firewall because it
looks at your web traffic specifically
and it can help defend against those
attacks as a stopgap while you're fixing
your software so that's another thing
that can be done this is concerning the
malware so you said that Google is
looking at websites and providing
warnings that's that's a good step you
can use certain browsers some of us
don't have choices because the corporate
standards and that sort of thing when
you look at anti-spyware they use often
use some artfully vague language about
protecting against malware in general
how effective is that against malware
anti-virus software oh so so how how
effective is antivirus software against
malware so I think antivirus software is
is good to run with regards to how on
how it helps you you know how it helps
with regards of protection I'd say that
you know it's a good defense but
antivirus software needs to get better
so if you're if you're evaluating a
piece of antivirus software there is an
important question to ask the important
question to ask is given a unknown
program an unknown binary if I provide
it with the anti to the antivirus
program what's the probability that it's
going to successfully detect whether or
not it's bad um that's the metric that
you're interested in there are there's
other metrics that are used in the
community so for instance some some
folks attempt to study and have iris
software by looking at you know an own
set of malware and then running it
through a bunch of scanners and figuring
out what's the percentage that it
detects known malware and you know those
percentage ends end up usually being
pretty high but the percentages of you
know what's the chance that it's going
to detect again if the unknown provide
the unknown binary are typically lower
so I think that there there is progress
that needs to take place with regards to
to having better antivirus technology
yes so just to add something there the
first thing that you do if you write a
piece of malware is you buy a copy of
all of the antivirus software and you
run your mouth where at your house
against the antivirus software and see
whether it gets by and if it doesn't you
fix it so you should you should fully
expect that decent malware will not be
trapped by most antivirus software
unless it's using some kind of
heuristics in which case it might not
run programs you want to run to so it's
a typical securities kind of a hard
thing to get right it's all lots of
trade-offs and that's one of the tricky
ones the second question I had had to do
with key keystroke loggers I've noticed
on some site so Nitin specifically like
ING direct they have numerical passwords
where you have to click on the numbers
is do keystroke loggers monitor mouse
clicks is that a security measure do so
so depending upon the sophistication of
the key logger some some older
keyloggers typically just log the
keystrokes more sophisticated current a
key loggers will do things like observe
when you are at a particular website and
they will take a screenshot when you
happen to be at a bank's website like at
a and with regards to mouse clicks yes
they can also record mouse clicks you
know pretty much once a malicious piece
of soft words on our computer you can
see everything so keystroke logging
malware has also been getting more
sophisticated back in the 70s shortly
after Bart opened they realized that you
could change the value of Bart cards
using a piece of audio tape and a iron
set on permanent press within the last
month they've talked about the way to
hack the MTA card in Boston the fast
track that's probably on your windshield
if you go over any of the bridges in the
Bay Area what's your opinion about the
value of publicizing these situations
especially after the owner of the
product or software was told about it
confidentially and appears to have
chosen not to do anything about it so I
think that it's important for I think it
is important to talk about attacks and
to focus on a tax because if you don't
spend time thinking about attacks then
it becomes very hard or you might lose
sight and build the wrong defenses right
that said it's it's also important to
follow a responsible disclosure protocol
you know to work with vendors to give
them the opportunity to fix things
before you publicize things I think
security researchers deserve the
recognition and acknowledgement for
their for their work and bringing to the
forefront certain security
vulnerabilities but it's also important
to them that they should give that they
should give you know appropriate time
and sometimes the discussion gets in a
muck of you know the security researcher
wants to deploy things faster than the
company can can fix it but I think it is
important for responsible security
researchers to do whatever extent they
can to work with the company to fix it
and not just point out problems but also
help point out solutions and and work to
help provide solutions so one quick
further thing to add there with regards
to some of these cases especially in
Europe part of the idea that the the
people that had done the bad system
tried to foist on the world was blaming
the people who found the problem for the
problem fortunately there are some very
smart judges who said that's utterly
ridiculous now that's like putting the
little boy in the emperor's new clothes
in jail in state instead of saying hey
how about if we have some actual clothes
on the Emperor and I think that's
probably what you were looking for right
most most security people believe that
so you know yeah I have reference to the
other part it is extremely important to
not try to you know quell the security
researchers because they're not the
source of the problem the product was
the source of the problem so fix the
product now honey look good talk I'd one
question about
the going to a malicious website and
having malware automatically downloaded
and installed on your computer wouldn't
this be a really easy thing to fix at
the browser level why do the browser's
you know download install software so
the question is with regards to malware
drive-by downloads wouldn't this be easy
to fix in the in the browser and it's
actually a little bit more complicated
of an issue than that for instance the
way that some of this code works this
malware drive-by download code will work
is it will include like an active sex
object that happens to be on the client
computer that may have a whole bunch of
legitimate uses but what the you know
what the code will do is it'll mount say
a buffer overflow attack against that
activex object so while that activex
object typically provide some useful
functionality it can be taken advantage
of and so actually in that case the
problem wasn't in the browser it was in
this activex piece of software that was
elsewhere on the computer so he's
activex the only way that you could get
this drug by malware no well so I would
be great if activex was the only way but
there's flash there's a whole bunch of
other plugins that are typically used to
render web content and a vulnerability
and any one of them can be can be
potentially taken advantage of okay
thanks hi you mentioned that Google now
finds out the infected websites or the
malicious websites and can prevent a
user from accessing that web page but
google also knows the other websites
which are linking to that particular
page and then the websites that are
linking to those websites and there is a
like a degree of separation from a good
page to a bad page so can google also
point out like since you have all that
information can google also the leg tell
that you can like give a school or some
kind of a level of separation from a
malicious website so so i think either
doesn't go there I I think part of the
problem here is that lots of legitimate
good websites are getting infected so
for instance you know the New York Times
might get infected I don't mean to pick
on New York Times for any reason but New
York items might get infected lots of
people are going to link to New York
Times New York Times is you know pretty
much a good site except they had a
couple of their pages hacked
does that mean that I should penalize
people that link to New York Times
probably not right so that the problem
is a little bit harder than that you
know thanks for the excellent talk a lot
of small businesses are hosting their
website so in this is PS and so if those
websites get affected by malware or
whatever they might not be aware of that
but Google might pick that up and label
that as you know a bad one and my
question is that for those legitimate
business will get labeled what is the
resolving procedure to get the website
out and how do you do with false
positives if you have any okay so i
should mention that first of all the
when Google blacklist a site there are
almost no false positives that are
extremely rare Google is very very
careful to make absolutely sure that a
website is infected if it if it's going
to get blacklisted so so Matt Cutts who
was also one of our early employees here
at Google has a very nice blog and if
you go to his blog and look at one of
three sentries it talks about it talks
about that particular shoe and and how
you know and a false positive rate in
such things yeah you know so that answer
the second part of your question the
first part of your question was what you
know what should the websites do the
websites should go to stop bad word org
and at stop bad word org for instance
there's instructions where if your
website confected here's a bunch of
remediations that you can try so so I'd
encourage you to go to stop at org check
out that website as well as if your
website happens again affected and
you're having trouble join the
discussion list and engage with the
community there to help identify and
resolve the problem thanks thank you
very much to everyone I'm sure there are
still a lot of questions and what we'd
like to do is maybe continue the
discussion we still can have a drink and
you know grab something to eat thank you
very much for your attention can they
run off one but sure yes sure so if
someone yeah please if someone can can
someone tell me who what was the first
what was that
aim of the first worm that was ever
written on the internet Gary you don't
the morris worm correct written by
robert morris give him a hand a for
extra credit what is robert morris do
now well he wasn't uh I'm sorry so so
who are you asking are you asking me or
asking them well he is a professor right
or in time professor right so yeah so I
get a copy of my own book wonderful he's
teaching people that itude it is junior
yeah seniors very good news so with that
I'll hand things back over to sunita and
maybe I think Janna I'm very happy to
continue discussing any new will still
be around and please continue to have a
great time have some drinks have some
food once again if you can have take
just a few seconds to fill in the the
feedback form before you leave there's a
box over there any other bottles so it's
just you know as you leave and we wish
to see you again soon and hope you
enjoyed the evening thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
