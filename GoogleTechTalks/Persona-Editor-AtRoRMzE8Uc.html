talk about a new kind of tool called a
persona editor all right and I've been
pitching this tool for five years and
nobody really understands what I'm
talking about but one of the things
about being ahead of the curve is that
if you wait long enough history catches
up with you and so we're gonna talk
about a number of trends and different
things that are going on and why this
tool is ready today and what I'm
basically doing is I'm open sourcing the
ideas I'm putting it out there for
anybody and all you programmers off they
want to copy it it's on YouTube that's
great and because the tool really needs
to get built okay and I call it a
persona editor okay and one of the
things about where we're at right now is
that we're entering into an era where to
AAP eyes are becoming apparent going
back to amazon when you can pull data
out of amazon that was great but that's
reading the data okay what we also need
to be able to do is to write the data
back end and by creating this kind of
two-way street you end up with a level
playing field which then prevents lock
in right so this is a big chess game
that we're going on here with all these
giant behemoths and big co platforms and
a small little guys as independents want
to be able to play along with the big
guys and to do that we need a level
playing field and we need to AAP is in
fact let me quote from a former Google
googler who just happened to be talking
about this in a video interview thing
was yesterday literally in two clicks
and suddenly and to the extent which we
don't actually realize they've just diet
it's just this site works and it feels
right and what I see is in a year's time
people will expect that and though the
whole diggity invite Ariel spam folder
approach is going to be dead and people
are wondering why not you would still do
that and I think there's there's a
massive sea of things we can build with
this and then you know those pieces are
in place the pieces that aren't fully
there yet the activity stream stuff that
we're still iterating on and saying okay
can we move these and actions between
sites in a way that's consistent we're
getting there we've got some ways of
reading them from science getting books
good ways of writing them to sites yet
or round-tripping them but it
is getting closer and a lot of that is
the similar process of saying what do
these things have in common oh there's
if there's a larger common space than we
thought and keep growing it all right so
that common space that Kevin was
referring to is the essence of open
standards you see friendster didn't
invent making a friend orkut myspace
facebook they've all built on these
common notions of people of services of
content all right and so I've actually
been studying this stuff for a long time
and I'm a tool Smith and for me having a
Swiss Army knife this perfect tool
that's designed specifically for this
open environment that's what I'm here to
talk about ok so the beginnings of this
premise of this tool is that that we
need to AAP is so as kevin was saying is
that we're just now getting to the point
where these two AAP eyes are there in
fact OpenSocial is one of the examples
of to AAP is all right that i can just
as easily write data into the system as
take its pull it out okay and we're not
being prejudiced to what this data is or
how it's used it at all it's literally
could be profile information it could be
your list of friends it could be your
photographs that could be your blog post
whatever but when something goes in it
should be able to come out and vice
versa and with that as long as you
adhere to those standards we then have a
true open web okay so so what I'm here
to do is to talk about this new kind of
a tool as I said I've been pitching for
years and if Google wants to buy me and
whatever I can see all the venture
capitals in the room and hi megan smith
and and all you guys and so but the key
thing is is that tools today only do one
or two things right and we could analyze
the history of how we got here and all
these people who were copycatting
director and photoshop during the 90s
and in fact it got to the point where
tools became a bad word if you went into
a venture capitalist who said i want to
make a tool they say sorry we don't do
tools anymore right there now cups
services or whatever but but most of
these tools that are out there they
offer you this great thing you pull you
bring your data all into it and guess
what your loss
dance there's no way to get the data
back out all right so tools today or
just another form of lock-in all right
so we need tools that are explicitly
designed for this open web all right so
this this persona editor looks like an
outliner now you all familiar with an
outliner right back in the 80s outliners
were actually a category of tool you'd
sit there and type a head in you hit the
carriage return hit the tab and you
would indent in and then you would type
something it was like sometimes they
were called thought processors and you'd
write an ID and hit the carriage return
right an idea hit the character turn and
then you'd have this whole category in
hierarchy and you'd go back and add
things in all right so I was part of
building a tool called a web outliner so
if you can imagine outliner online like
a google app but at any node of the
hierarchy it could be a link it could be
a media file it could be a reference to
another outline okay and so that's what
I meet when I use the word outliner
that's what I'm talking about all right
so now let's imagine these outliners
being able to hold every kind of data
there is and the outliner itself is a
normalizing effect that can pull in any
kind of open web data and it makes it
equal so I could pull in my amazon
account my facebook account my blog and
my ebay stuff and I could ever have them
all lined up together and then I can
drag and drop between these different
outlines or create a new one all right
so that's really what we're talking
about here now once we have to AAP is
and so realize that ideas have to time
with the movement of the marketplace so
as the marketplace starts evolving these
two AAP eyes are appearing you want to
hit it right it's the metaphors surfing
where you're hanging ten right exactly
as that wave comes in you catch that
wave right and that's the idea of
developing this tool okay so the idea is
that with one of these two AAP is we can
synchronize all this data now the way
people think of tools today is that this
data comes into your tool and stays
there but if you can imagine with two
api's the tool can be a utility so you
could pull the data in do something to
it and send it back right from where it
came or send it to all these other look
patience and that's really the essence
of this tool so now imagine there's
always different kinds of data right and
in this hierarchy here I've got friends
and feeds and media and content as I
double click on media I dive into images
and within images I have my word press
gallery my flickr gallery and then i
double click on flickr and I dive in and
I go into my sets and so at that
particular node in the hierarchy the
node recognizes that these are
photographs and puts up little thumbnail
displays because it understands what
that data type is all right so now the
very cool thing about this about having
it be built into a general-purpose
outliner is that when you think of
something a structure and the active
term here is personal knowledge base
right as i'm organizing my stuff
whatever it is only you know how you
want to organize your stuff all right so
if you say this is for Monday and this
is what I'm going to Argentina and this
is blue that's how you want to organize
your stuff everyone organises their
stuff differently all right so you use
this hierarchical outliner to structure
things the way you think of it right but
now with this notion of having any kind
of data type in Argentina I could have
photographs I could have phone numbers I
could have a web feed I could have
statistics i could have any kind of data
all under argentina and that very next
hierarchy i give any other kind of
combination of data alright so that's
the idea of using tagging and think of
categorization with the outliner means
that you have a completely flexible
model there are no constraints to what
you want to do right and that's a key
thing about building a tool quick story
I don't know if you all know what my
first life was I created a company
called macro mine that was macromedia
and we developed a tool called director
so director use the timeline notational
system and we didn't know what people
were going to do with that tool all
right so some people did marketing some
people did video games some people did
interactive art but that was the point
it was a general purpose tool this is
what's missing in the open web today
all tools do one thing the closest we
could come to it today might be Twitter
in that it does one thing but it can be
used a lot of different ways but most
tools only do one or two specific things
this tool is designed to do like 20 or
30 all right okay so so here I've got
this new kind of tool and all these
nodes of the hierarchy can represent new
kind of structures and I can create
these mashups on the fly now the only
thing that's similar to that today is
Yahoo pipes which can take all these RSS
feeds and you set up some rules and you
can build up these mashups but they're
only based upon RSS feeds so if you can
imagine that just going out to
everything alright alright so as I've
been pitching this to people one of the
cool things about this because I've
literally been pitching this for five
years right when people hear it they
echo back to me what they think they're
hearing and I got some feedback from the
guise of Yahoo and they said oh so what
you're doing is you're combining static
data with dynamic data and I'm
absolutely right on what a great way to
put it you don't mind if i quote you do
you see any way I'm giving Neal samples
and Cody Sims credit okay anyway so so
that's the idea that there's all this
different kind of stuff all in this one
outline all right all right now I'm glad
that we have some interns here today a
camera cut over to the interns okay and
so we're gonna start off slow and simple
okay oh let's just pretend like you're
proxying for venture capitalists because
we would hate to confuse them too much
right so we need a solution today so we
can fund you today to build a product
for today and the problem we're going to
solve is CD players don't only play CDs
from Tower Records but yet when you buy
a song from itunes it can only play back
in items so just imagine a tool that
allowed me to create a playlist of songs
from itunes to rhapsody from from amazon
alright so that's the idea of this this
editor right
and now imagine this playlist of all
these things I happen to have used
reggae as an example but I've bought all
this music from all these different
sources and I can combine them together
because one of the key things as I said
earlier is we're normalizing the open
web so once I can load things into this
outliner I can then drag and drop all
these songs assemble a playlist and do
what I want to do right this is the way
it should have worked all along right so
now let's look at how the outliner would
display these three services ok so
there's itunes amazon and rhapsody i've
used the structure of itunes itunes has
playlist artisan songs i dive down into
the artist you can see the artists in
those songs right but amazon does it
slightly differently they call them mp3
albums whatever but the point is is that
it all flows into this standard outliner
okay and I can drag and drop to build
the playlists okay so the idea here is
that any of the nodes of this hierarchy
of the outline could be anything so in
this case back here I've used the top
node to represent the service I've use
the next node to the next level of the
hierarchy to represent the structures of
the service and then the third level to
be the actual data okay okay so now
let's use an example of photographs all
right so here the challenge is is that
I've got all these different photographs
a whole bunch of flick or a whole bunch
and Facebook whole bunch in WordPress
and I want to organize things around the
way I logically think of them my family
my work and my fun okay so I dragged all
these things in and I organized it on
family working fun not I've got it all
organized now I can keep them in sync so
as I'm uploading things to Flickr and
uploading things to Facebook whatever is
there categorized and tagged the right
way they would then reshuffle themselves
and send themselves back to flickr and
facebook under these structures i set up
called family work and fun you see
that's what the human being comes in and
puts structure around things right
that's where tagging comes in we as a
collectively as an industry very much
drop the ball and tag it we got to the
level of the flickr tags and technorati
tags and delicious but we don't use
those tags to connect ourselves together
that's the whole point of the web the
open web is to connect things together
right all right so how do you pull this
off again this is for the baby spooning
the venture capitalist version of this
idea right oh what's that oh well it's
called outliner it's called to a api's
it's called the open web have you heard
of the open web yes but I need to patent
this technology and I need to control it
and own it and I go uh sorry I get the
shadowed up there and sorry no way dude
no one owns it everyone can use it and
anybody can improve it is is the first
quiz of today's lecture can you tell me
where that quote is from it's a book
called the world of ends by doc searls
and Dave Weinberg okay moving on so
getting a little denser the outliners
are the perfect metaphor for a tool all
right and is this is a kind of an
abstract notion of how the hierarchies
can be seen there's this top level stuff
the categories of subcategories and so
you can just imagine that any kind of
data any structures can be filled into
that you indent the node you promote the
node you can create structures the way
you think all right everything is a URL
well thank God I'm here at Google and I
don't have to explain that we could have
a debate over is it URL or you are I but
I think you get the point right it's all
up in the cloud everything is in the
cloud and when the entire BBC archives
or the new york times or NPR and all of
those books and all that information is
all there now we're ready to start
building these incredible new kind of
things right that's where we need a new
kind of tool all right so now let's get
more specific so here is an ID hub so
there is a system put up by janrain
called RPX and what they do is they
propose that yes we love open ID but
there's a whole bunch of people with
Yahoo IDs and whole bunch of people
Google IDs and Microsoft IDs so we
shouldn't force them or expected looking
at
jover to open ID so an ID hub is an
interface where you can come in and log
in with whatever the hell I do you have
alright so imagine an outline of my ID
hub alright so there's my yahoo my
google my face oh there's my facebook
double click on facebook open up oh look
there's my profile there's my friends
there's my feet right you see so
whatever the ID is that's that node and
that double click and open up and this
example shows facebook ID being opened
up okay now all the principles of
editing all the principles of WYSIWYG
cut copy paste crud send message
synchronization all that is applied to
this kind of data so if i want to go
copy west taylor command C and go over
somewhere else and command V I can do
that and that whole profile thing went
with it okay okay so once this stuff is
in there I can then sort and search and
filter thank God I'm it google I don't
have to explain that and I could manage
my data right so it's all in there and I
can back it up and move it around and
and do also some new kind of structures
hit new you know all that kind of stuff
and I can manage my friends so again
I've got this list of all these
different people and in this case I got
those different services and I double
click on facebook and sure enough
there's my friends and the node
recognizes that those are profiles and
puts up little thumbnails of the faces
right so the tool is smart enough to
recognize what the data is that it's
rare that it's rendering okay here's one
of my favorites which is my blog
archives so this blog here was from 2001
to 2003 this was 2004-2005 this is my
current blog I've got them all over the
hell you know the place I've got artwork
I've got post and I want to organize
them all in one place and so this is
what an outliner and I've got an account
over on Vox and I'm doing other blogging
elsewhere and what all of those blog
posts in one place so that later on I
can go retrieve them and organize them
so one of the cool things about the
synergy of this strategy is that once
you understand the outliner and you're
comfortable with an outliner and by the
way when you're in internet explorer
that's an outline right the the file
system is an outline all right when you
go into the finder in the Macintosh
that's an outline all right so these are
things that a reptilian brain
understands people understand outliners
all right and so what we're doing to do
is we're going to use these outliners
for a lot of different purposes but it's
the same damn outliner okay so let's
start off with the personal knowledge
base so here I am organizing all my
stuff across however I want to organize
it and I'm using the example of food
because unless it's not obvious I'm a
foodie okay so I got all this food and
some of the food is about photos and the
restaurants and here's restaurants in
San Francisco and then over here in the
Yahoo world I've got restaurants but
these are actually reviews of
restaurants and these are photographs of
reviews of restaurants right so I'm
going to map them over to this logical
structure called food and in that
logical structure their restaurants
recipes and nutritional information
right now once I've got that logical
structure I then want to map it into my
knowledge base and again we could have
debate we could have entire
googletechtalks on knowledge bases and
what kind of knowledge base do you do
and is it bubble blower bubble blah
right so this is my version of a
knowledge base this leads to what I call
a persona and this is where one of the
benefits of the tool come in all right
so let me explain so here I spend all
this time and I'm gonna go visual here
so sorry microphone oh sorry all right
so so over here was this raw data I
organize it into logical structures I
didn't take those logical structures and
I map them into personas and what do I
mean by a persona well there's me the
chubby software guy who comes down to
google and rants and raves let's see
that's this guy okay and then there's me
the dad whose daughters on the swim team
you know and there's a
swim team website and there's me the
legendary party guy who helped reinvent
partying in the 80s who had the extreme
Posse and flash mobs in the 90s who's
the legalized marijuana advocate in the
arts and proud of it and don't drink a
drip of alcohol okay so I got three
completely different personas of my life
now some people keep their personas
completely compartmentalize they don't
mix and match them but if I had a
photograph over here and I want to use
it over there I got literally log in
under different username and password
and assume a different persona why is
the tool called a persona editor because
the same knowledge base and all this
data so here's the raw data the logical
structures of the data then can be
mapped into my personas and more times
than not you're not going to want to
come to my website to see about my
persona you're going to want to have it
be a widget and appear inside the swim
team's website inside a Facebook inside
of wherever the hell okay that's the
essence of the distributed web you don't
expect people to come to you you go to
them all right so what this persona
editor does is it allows me to edit and
manage my personal knowledge base and
then map this stuff into these more or
less arbitrary buckets hello sir so
you'll have to rewind for the first 20
minutes but okay alright so we're just
about to persona why it's called a
persona editor and so I've got these
logical structures that I map into these
widgets these widgets happen to be me
the dad me the guru and me the party boy
okay okay so here I am managing these
personas and now I can cut copy paste
and edit and drag and drop between the
personas so that's pretty cool yeah i
think all right and once I have these
personal knowledge bases to me you know
the history of technology is about
consumer stuff that leaks over to
enterprise and enterprise stuff that
leaks over to consumer and knowledge
bases is something that's been around 10
20 years of the enterprise world because
every Enterprise wants to
get a handle and their arms around all
the stuff that's there but most humans
just scatter their to the wind and
they're all over the place and the world
gets more and more complicated and along
comes Twitter and things get more and
more complicated and so but we do need
knowledge management of our own stuff a
great example would be a family that
everyone's buying different cds and
music all right and dad goes gosh
shouldn't we have a server down in the
basement it's all our media collection
everybody in the family shares off that
media server that would be a great
example of the family knowledgebase okay
so I've actually been working on this
tool for a while and we've mocked up
some user interfaces and how it would
look I've got a working example this I
was showing in a second but here is an
example of normalizing the web so Dave
we were going over all the different
ways we're going to use the outliner we
were talking about using it for personal
knowledge base now we're going to talk
about for normalizing the web the open
web because there's all this disparate
kind of data and so here I've got an
example of a yahoo account two people a
gator accountant and always on account
they'd line up and by the way this is
done five years ago way before tweet
deck all right so over on the left hand
side is the internal account then those
three in the middle are the external
accounts that I'm rendering and then the
right hand side is whatever node I've
selected that's the dive down into that
node because one things about outlines
because they could be really deep have
lots and lots of stuff underneath the
node and silver on the right-hand side
would be the particular node I've got
selected and then along the bottom would
be this tray that would hold all these
different accounts you can see I've got
three up right now but I could well have
30 or 50 different accounts that I'm
working with so all those accounts will
be along the bottom okay so now we're
going to get some other pretty exciting
stuff so if I've got a normalized web
and I'm managing this personal knowledge
base and I can render any kind of data
into the outline now let's imagine I
could build these new kind of dynamic
structures structures that stay in sync
Dave one of things you missed as I was
ranting about to AAP is I showed a
recent Kevin Martin
he was some about that we can read stuff
we can't necessary right it yet
opensocial is one of the first ones to
do that but we'll win for the whole web
to be able to do that to have to api's
to have a level playing field so now
let's imagine we have all that stuff and
we're now going to build a new kind of
dynamic structure and I'm going to use a
college reunion as an example you young
interns don't know what it's like but
when you have a graybeard like me and
Dave you yearn back for the old days
those old college roommates and you
wonder whatever happened to so-and-so so
let's imagine that this was a college
reunion and okay so this is like over
there is a display of what it would look
like in the outline but now let me show
you to rendered in that you I I just
showed you ok so here I am oberlin
graduates and I just came back from my
college reunion and I've got some
friends in facebook some friends in my
space a whole bunch of photographs and
flicker and the College website put up
an XLS file of the statistics of the
class of nineteen eighty which would
mean that soon a 30 year anniversary for
me graduating school okay alright so um
so here's what I'm gonna do I'm gonna go
crit new I'm gonna hit new all right and
now what I'm gonna do is I'm a drag
faces of friends from Facebook and
MySpace all over into this oberlin class
reunion structure all right and when I
do that it comes up and says well you're
going to track this guy Aaron how much
of Aaron stuff do you want to track
right you want to track those photos you
want to track this we want to check that
and you're going to see these activity
streams and this stuff I'll offer this
kind of stuff soon okay alright the next
thing I do is I drag some photos from
Flickr into this system and I also drag
this xls file of the class statistics
now the next thing I want to do is that
because the key thing here of the two
AAP is is that though i'm over here in
this tool and i'm pointing at all these
external things and i'm bringing it in
here and then create this new structure
I now want to send it back from whence
takane having it over here in my tool
does not achieve the goal that's just
another lock in strategy
this tool has to be like utility so that
i can send it back to facebook send it
back to myspace of course the trick
would be you can these systems you can
understand this whatever the hell it is
can open social render this dynamic
community probably OpenSocial of all
these things probably OpenSocial be one
of the first ones that could all right
but the idea is that it's a round trip
it's a two-way experience all right so
now once everything gets put into this
outline that this outliner becomes as
unifying principle around what I call
digital lifestyle aggregation that was
something I figured about seven or eight
years ago and social networking and
Twitter and friend feet are parts of
that equation there's a tool called plum
there are lots of different tools that
glue lots of new tools to kind of treat
this all this dla this digital lifestyle
aggregation in different ways and that's
a good thing we don't want to have one
way to do things okay so but the idea of
the tool is that as director what's
multimedia so will this tool be to the
open web now back in those days those
tools were proprietary there was no such
thing as open source and I I'll pay
penance for helping it to create one of
the greatest lock and strategies ever
all right so I've been flag you lating
myself and whipping and trying to make
up for that and that's a lot of what
this is about is open sourcing these
ideas and hoping that a lot of people
all of those programmers in the room
today well pick up these ideas and run
with it all right so it's a tool that
does a lot of different things it's like
a Swiss Army knife right so that's this
is this prototype and I think I can just
show this right now if we don't mind
okay working prototype so I go here and
this is how I choose all the different
accounts all right and by the way one of
the things of the business model would
be that you'd let them play with let's
say eight or ten accounts for free
forever but when you really start using
the tool and it becomes very productive
then you let them have unlimited number
of accounts right so I go over here and
I say oh look here's this account and I
say oh look here's this account and oh
look here's that account right so these
are little hierarchies and remember
earlier I showed you the blog archive
right so this would be my blog archive
right there because remember within one
account I might have blogs and photos
and friends and all this different kind
of stuff right and as I select this over
here you can see there is that node
being selected but if I selected here
for I RSS feeds there's my art set now
this version of this prototype was using
this source code to something called the
web outliner and I can go over here
switch over to this tab and sure enough
oops this is an outliner I can hit the
carriage return and create hierarchies
that I could dent in and into these
heart any of these nodes can be an RSS
feed can be a media module so this is
all kind of a working functioning thing
and go back over here I go select that
guy you go copy over here so this isn't
would be my internal file so if I was
building something new I'd be dragging
over here and putting into that that new
area there okay so that is the prototype
continuing on well now that we've got
that far let me close with what I'm
working on now so five years that was
I've been pitching this one of the
reasons i'm leaving because nobody
 understands what I'm talking
about okay but what I have figured out
these dashboards and we all saw the
federal spending dashboard and now
spent last week right River that Kundra
now has a dashboard that will track
every single IT contract in the US
government and you can go in and see
what was the original proposal what
they're charging you incredible levels
of transparency and it's really great
that they're using the term dashboard
because the dashboard is a generic kind
of term that could be applied to
something like that which is literally
like an enterprise erp dashboard but I
also consider the about me page in a
blog tool to be your personal dashboard
and your profile page and a social
network to be your dashboard and the
contact us page in a commercial website
to be a dashboard so if we could kind of
normalize dashboards and say well
everything's a dashboard in one sense
and each dashboard gets an outline all
right so here's the outline schema so
just like micro formats are machine
readable tags that can be read now
imagine this outline that's machine
readable that in the top node is the xrd
thing which says well this is what's in
this dashboard the next one is my ID hub
so in the case of an individual person
it's all my little pet username password
things but for a company it might be
something completely different the third
hierarchy is a social information so
those are could be your customer list it
could be your friend list it could be
whatever the fourth one of your feeds
this enables distributed computing this
enables distributed architecture let me
give you an example so we know the power
of fate of facebook connect and what
they call dynamic privacy and as long as
they've got the tether and they're in
control of everything then great I can a
drunk teenager can put their naked photo
up on a Friday night as they wake up
from their binge on Sunday morning they
could retract the access privileges and
then everyone who's adhering to the
rules of Facebook Connect would take
that photo down okay but how do we do
that in a distributed manner all right
so imagine that over here in my list of
social information was the list of all
the people that I've granted access
to this particular photograph and then
down there and number seven is the list
of the actual photographs and then what
number five is about is the list of
those actual rolls this is a family roll
these are the rules of this role these
are my colleagues this is my whatever
the thing is that you want to create a
group of the access of you publicly
display that in this hierarchy and that
way anybody can come along look and say
oh okay these are the people get access
these are the photographs you guys
execute and these are the roles he's
back and you can do that for friending
you could do that for lots of different
kind of stuff affect I think I've
alyssia right so we could do that for
instance some one of my favorites is
aggregating musical tastes all right so
I like describes your musical taste one
way Pandora does it another way last.fm
does it another way right but don't
doesn't view the user want to have one
thing that's my musical tastes right so
if those three services would support
this kind of outline structure we could
have some kind of normalized way to of
course there's always give me
differences but there's some common
overlap between the three aggregating
groups is another example where a yahoo
group is this a google group is that and
facebook it's something else but it's
all about reggae so why can't we have
some common way to connect these things
together right so that's the notion of
these dashboard outlines so of course
the point being that then that's your
dashboard outline your file that's
literally the virtual thing that you
then move around from facebook to google
to whatever thank you very much didn't
50 minutes all right so now the the
torrent of questions usually usually I
say is please interrupt me at any time
but wasn't too much interruption but
does that make sense at all or what so
it's a crazy kind of tool idea and I
figured as I was leaving Silicon Valley
at least do some drop llings you know
droppings along the way on the way out
to say I think this kind of tool that
when I pitch this to Microsoft Angus
Logan as we were leaving the meeting
said some are could this be the tool for
windows live yes it would edit every
kind of data that's in
knows life so I are you planning to
start building this okay so yeah so
everything costs money and so the way I
tell the people in Ohio as I say look I
wouldn't be moving to Ohio if i had
money so it's gonna be one of those but
you know it's one of those swords like
he came to tell him with seven dollars
in his pocket and look what he built
right so yeah I really want to build
this it's gonna cost millions a dollar
so without somebody giving me the money
and though I would love to I even pitch
SI p on this right so I mean I'll pitch
it to anybody to build it right but it's
one of those kind of timeless ideas that
could probably wait another two three
years and not be ruined right whereas
right now I'm going to be building this
digital city and in cleveland or
northeastern ohio so but of course that
digital city will require one of these
tools but you know there's like all this
kind of day-to-day stuff to to do first
but it wouldn't be just an OpenSocial
thing it would be a web based app and
open social be one of the output formats
that it would support question five
years ago do anything today oh no
they're exactly the same as they are you
think that they would get a clue you
know but they don't because he
understand venture capital and this is
not to fault them but they're standing
at the table at the crap table and they
got the dice and they're throwing the
dice and they're going for twitter or
youtube and that's all they're
interested in now there's a misnomer out
there in the real world certainly in
Cleveland the venture capitalists are
about funding companies that help
workforce development and create jobs
and that's a misnomer that's not what
venture capitals are about they're in it
for the money and they would rather put
a hundred bets on a hundred really
stupid ideas that one of them turns into
a YouTube then put a hundred investments
into sound business practices that
company may not go public it may not be
some wild success but you know it
employed 72 people and makes a profit
that's not what venture capitalist are
interested in as long as you understand
that then you can understand their
rose-colored glasses
and the filters that they put up they're
only interested in playing the inside
this game now it gets really weird is
that every work oh absolutely but i but
i get to do that because they're okay I
was the third how I was the third
software company that kleiner perkins
ever invested it okay exactly but so
well yeah so but but but here's the
thing so they could say they could talk
to good talk like i could tell you all
about the VCS I've met in Cleveland all
right what's interesting is that in the
area workforce development we're got
every government whether it's state
federal state county or municipal all of
them have as a responsibility right
after like security and power is
workforce development to keep their
citizens employed and to have jobs and
so if you ask them about how they do
that they sincerely think that by giving
money to venture capitalist that that
will generate jobs and in every major
city in America there's
government-funded venture capitalists
and they all open up their newsreaders
in their newspapers and they read about
kleiner perkins in Sequoia so they may
talk the good talk about how we invest
locally at all that but at the end of
the day they're still doing just as
stupid investments as everybody else and
there's like 25 entrepreneurs standing
outside their door begging them for
money and if even go to the right
country club or you're not in the right
church or synagogue too bad because it
is an insider's game your friends
facebook oh alright so okay let me turn
it around to you then so how does if I
imported stuff from bebo into bottle
blah how is that security promulgated I
mean is there does that person who is a
friend of a friend and Bebo have any
control over what their profiles done to
them over in this
I don't believe so right right now in
OpenSocial each social network where
your application is running have their
own terms and conditions above what you
can do that profile and I you need to
read into these but I doubt that like
taking my orkut profile and pasting it
in facebook without me knowing about
this is a good practice but it is
technically possible right mean those
are those that's a social contract and a
legal contract but technically
OpenSocial enables that to happen right
right but and I didn't remember being in
this very building but you could pull up
right okay well okay so this gets really
into it because in fact not to brag but
two years ago when I first heard of
OpenSocial and it wasn't invited to the
campfire but I'm not complaining I
brought this up right okay all right now
so so we add one of our data sharing
summits put up a big grid on the wall
and what we said was let's at first at
least compared and track the policies of
these different services and that by
hopefully putting a public attention to
it and Kevin literally wrote down all
the things that Google did and there
were multiple columns for google but
that's the first step of creating a
social contract right and Dave and I
know we were tried to talk to Facebook
about this very subject right so first
you have to get the issue out there and
talk about it now I'm proposing one way
to solve that all right so that over
here in the access controls the in
theory this the industry would said I'd
say a family access control is this it
means XYZ for you the user to define
your family you're going to need a
struck called family then you know and
then you're going to check this and
maybe there's a master registry that
checks out are you part of my family
there's some other guy named Mark Cantor
down in in LA all those details of how
those security levels get up but
certainly
I can tell you in the future it won't be
the separate data silos these separate
worlds that each define their own set of
access controls that would be one of the
things the OpenSocial foundation would
work towards distributed access controls
because right now we've got a great
example of how to do it in a day to silo
with facebook now what's fascinating
Dave I mean in the past year since this
has all been happening they are
continuing to push the envelope I mean
this is a company there was a line that
Jerry Yang used to say is that every day
I wake up and I worry about the next
three billion hits right so clearly
Jerry Yang was sleeping late right i
mean he fell asleep right mark
zuckerberg i'm not sure if he ever
sleeps I mean this guy is on a
torrential rate that's never been seen
before the amount of innovation and
things that are happening so just when I
think they're done and they can't
possibly be more open they push it
further but it's still tethered so we're
seeing the definition of this compromise
which to me being on the outside is a
really good lesson into how to have your
cake and eat it too and all those things
that they're doing okay fine that's
great that you're doing it now how will
we do it open you know truly open right
so that's in one sense there said in the
agenda it's very interesting and and I'm
wondering what I don't you think even
going to do another f8 right I mean that
would have been now that's when f8 was
yeah and then I think what happens is
they just they look we're doing these
things every other month so i have a why
do once a year so it's kind of
fascinating to see those kind of
politics unfold and i'm still trying to
figure out where each company to these
companies and what their agendas are
something like a six apart or janrain or
and then you can see the dupe go down i
mean you know it's like you really do
need revenues so that's why i'm going to
cleveland
you saw you saw they announced how much
they were making off of what yeah yeah
it was interesting there's a little bit
here a little bit there is it was good
distribution wasn't just one thing but I
started off earlier saying that I think
that the Facebook really is the only
company that Google fears and they're
the only ones that can touch google in
the sense that the target the way we
think of targeted advertising today will
get disrupted by some other way to do it
and I think they're the closest people
to get there it's funny what speaking of
VCS in Cleveland so they funded this
company that claims they have a patented
process for targeted advertising for
music it's like oh my god and we're in
the Law Offices of this big fancy law
firm and I wanted to lawyer guy I said
well do you understand that there's like
25 companies and have this well no we do
our research didn't find that well you
know you didn't do too good of a
research well you know because there's a
thing in patent law that if you did too
much research right so you don't do the
research so you can tell the client we
haven't found anything oh my god and
these young kids all their money is
being put into the patents and there's
you know by definition they're going to
be out of business me before they can
even start and that's that's typical
example of venture capitalist so anyway
so that's it so that's the pitch we got
it on video Google hi google got youtube
hi Chad hi okay it was that entertaining
all right thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
