laura from developer relations is away
at e3 so he's only here in spirit we're
pleased to kick off our tech talk series
about serious games and games in
education with this talk by Ben Sawyer
Ben's name is synonymous with serious
games he's been well a well-known
advocate champion and developer in the
space for over 10 years he's co-founder
the serious games initiative games for
health project and digital millwood game
design and development firm in addition
he served as a serious game summit chair
at GDC we're pleased to have him here
and we're looking forward to getting his
perspective on the state of serious
games and the needs of large and small
game developers alike thanks thanks Pat
and I'll see mark soon at e3 so I'm glad
he's here in spirit but knowing III I
that spirits probably a fairly low level
right now in terms of what he's about to
go through so he's familiar with it so
the title of this presentation is games
everywhere and within it is this sort of
evolutionary thought pattern that I've
had as I've watched web services and
other types of cool web applications
come about and really spent some time in
the trenches trying to build some of
this stuff and what the larger role for
those could be so I'm going to go pretty
quick because there's a lot of
information to cover and I know that
you're all eager to get back to other
endeavors but one of my first slides is
always this one I promise all my game
development friends that I don't throw
commercial entertainment games under the
rug when I talk about serious games I
think it's important part of being human
is to be entertained and to entertain
other people but from a serious side I
think games have this pretty well solved
entertainment for that matter but it's
important to remind ourselves that just
sitting by on a Sunday afternoon and
engrossing yourself in a game like spore
or call of duty or any of the other
great games is an important part so just
a little bit more about me I did find
this book one day and I read it it
didn't help me too much but it was kind
of neat to think that somebody actually
had this put into a book that's the
first computer i ever spent a
amount of time programming I worked on
some earlier computers before then every
6 year old should be given a lightsaber
on their sixth birthday i dug that out
those are my two kids we also we're a
family of Lego fanatics we actually have
a Lego basement where we keep them all
and and build furiously into the evening
those are some of the projects that I've
done here's a sort of number of games
that I've worked on either as a producer
or a designer what's important about
this is just simply to establish that
not only do I talk about this stuff but
I actually get in here and work on the
design and development of it and I use
both to inform the other the other thing
is that there's a decent diversity of
work here stuff for the military stuff
for STEM education corporate training
for Cisco a walking game for humana that
is about ostensibly exercise I came to
help university presidents better manage
their universities and a number of
conference activities that we do to try
and build this sort of rising tide and
best practices in the serious game space
I also require this slide of all my
speakers whenever i can at my
conferences it's basically what i'm
playing lately again i play a lot of
different kinds of games on the lifelong
gamer and you know it's important as a
designer to play these types of games to
really get in there and by requiring
this slide of my speakers many of whom
will sometimes be academics or analysts
it's what keeping everybody honest I
sometimes find that people who like to
talk about games spend more time talking
about them than playing and this is a
way to sort of say that's kind of a bad
way to be a games analyst or researcher
so these are the goals that I have today
it's just shining the spotlight on
beyond the sort of conventional forms of
games to deepen your understanding of
serious games in the serious game space
to link to this future of games and
serious games to the pervasive web
services that were really sort of seeing
built by companies like Google and to
elevate games in my opinion to a larger
strategic opportunity especially for
large organization
and some of the key points that I'll
make is that the games are really
heading everywhere if you spend a lot of
time looking at games both on the
commercial entertainment side as well as
a serious game side you really start to
see just an incredible explosion of
different types of games for different
types of markets or different types of
purposes in games as a result of that
should be this sort of strategic
opportunity and the evolution and the
larger utility of game design and
engineering patterns the things that we
actually the processes in idea is that
we take from games are starting to seep
into other walks of life even things
that we wouldn't ostensibly call games
but overall we need some better
infrastructure if we're going to see
this idea that games could be everywhere
in every day parts of our lives then
where we are right now now why would I
why would I spend 10 years of my life
sort of pursuing this idea of serious
games well these are some of the reasons
I think and others like me think that
games have a role in solving our
problems does it mean a game is going to
be the ultimate solver of all of life's
problems probably not but if there's no
there's no reason to leave it on the
wayside the problems and the challenges
that we face today really require that
sort of you know to beat an often-used
phrase to death you know all hands on
deck and video games are probably the
most powerful media form that we have
going right now and to think that we're
just going to leave them alone just for
just for play seems seems sort of wrong
and it's proven through some of the
existing work in the serious game space
that games can play substantive roles
we've seen games that have proven in
research studies to help people with
their health to help people with their
learning to change their opinions to
collect data from people in new ways
that we couldn't do before to sell
products and to do many other types of
things that we do in everyday life and
we need more accelerants that's the
other reason I'm here we need more
people sort of thinking about how this
idea of games and gaming everywhere can
lead to solving some of their problems
and thinking about the types of
investments that you need to make at the
infrastructure for really all of our
sakes
so there's my explanation so what do we
mean by games being everywhere so right
now games are a huge category of
entertainment I often say to people if
you want to understand what games are
doing within media go talk to a
television executive and ask them or
some of their audiences they're not
watching television they're playing
farmville they're playing World of
Warcraft they're playing call of duty
they're playing video games then there's
this whole non entertainment sector the
place where I spend most of my time and
i will show you some of the areas that
games are creeping into there's also
this whole idea of Technology Transfer
the technologies from games that are
spawned out of this industry are ending
up in all kinds of different places or
are technologies that have in general
would have come about but come about in
a faster pace because me and my friends
who play games spend tons of money on
things like 3d GPU chips and then we
have the spread of this design
philosophy and then the rising culture
so let's look a little bit at that from
a games everywhere standpoint we're most
used to the first column you know games
at home this is where we play and we
right now we're seeing games and are not
just being played on our PC but we have
game consoles and now we have tablets
and now we have phones a lot of my my
two kids play games on the phone when
the console is not being used and then
of course we have the whole mobile
explosion going on and then work where
people are playing games mostly on PCs
but it's increasingly on phones and then
potentially on tablets to the extent
that tablets make it into the workforce
and that person is playing actually a
forklift safety game in that picture so
in the serious games initiative we took
some effort to kind of build out this
taxonomy of serious games because one of
the things that was happening was that
the serious game space was sort of being
defined as a couple of specific areas
you're too oh yeah that's at games for
training stuff for that that's that
stuff for the military using video game
engines and so what we did was we went
out in canvassed and then reorganized
the entire serious game space across the
top by the types of areas that an
organization might use like health and
advertising and training and education
and production and even work and then
down the left-hand side looking at the
various industrial sectors government
defense healthcare and then creating
this sort of matrix and you know without
going into detail of it the idea is to
show you that there's a lot of potential
and this potential goes beyond commonly
used area commonly cited areas like
learning and training just to make sure
that we weren't just kind of putting up
conjecture we went out and this was this
was about two and a half years ago we
went out and I said let's find at least
one example for each of those squares of
a project that was either in development
or was part of a research grant or was
actually a shipping product so you can
see it like well over two thirds and
that was that was over a couple of years
ago and many of these areas already had
multiple entries multiple examples of
the work so this is this is not
something that's confined to a couple of
squares but let's look at the technology
transfer so the video game industry
globally hardware and software depending
on what you look at 70 to 80 billion
dollars in the next couple of years so
if you were to kind of backtrack through
there their revenues and sort of figure
out what their R&amp;amp;D level is it's
anywhere from 10 to 20 billion dollars
being spent and these key outputs coming
from it graphics visualization AI
synchronous networking a lot of
anti-fraud stuff now in World of
Warcraft and other types of games not
just looking for credit card fraud but
people doing things like gold farming
sort of asymmetric behaviors that they
want to stop things that they feel will
corrupt the gameplay let alone or
stealing potential money or accounts so
how do you find those types of behaviors
in their data set is of great interest
to people who are looking for similar
types of activities and their own data
sets and you can imagine who they are so
the psychology of games interface
virtual humans and this rapid innovation
that's what's going on I mean the
the Darwinian environment of the games
business if you're in if you're you can
have a string of hit games have one bad
hit and your studio closes or your team
is dissolved it's brutal so the stress
is you know both good and bad in terms
of what we get out of it and I've often
sort of compared the video game industry
as like a private version of NASA except
we're getting a little bit more cast off
to the rest of us be then I would have
thought and unfortunately though it just
doesn't include tank right so one of the
other areas the way to look at
technology transfer when I evangelize
this in places like DC and stuff is ago
okay well maybe you're not that
interested in games you just don't
understand it's deeply and passionately
as I do I go but you probably have like
a lot of deep passion in this town for
robotics especially if I'm over in
Virginia and they go yeah well
absolutely robotics where we were
investing you know hundreds of millions
of dollars in robotics I go well then
what is this grey warden inside
Bioware's dragon age game he's of
non-player character he's in a 3d world
he has to move around objects he has to
talk to people is to have some sort of
visioning as to what's going on in a
dynamic environment I mean is
essentially a robot this is a virtual
robot and the types of things that they
have to work on in Game Developers spend
their days working on like pathfinding
are the same things that a lot of people
work in robotics work on so the idea
that you could actually get game
developers who've never worked in
robotics together and roboticists who've
never worked in games and probably find
that there's a lot of common challenges
and common approaches or different
approaches that could help each other is
something that really hits home to
people who haven't quite thought about
it that way so we look at games is a
computational form of media and it must
communicate effectively or to the player
or it fails and when you fail in the
game space it's pretty brutal just go
read reviews of bad games on hardcore
gaming websites it's it's it's it's
choice language and then games in my
opinion democratize the power of
simulation they take something that we
call simulation and they sort of pare it
down and make it more accessible
and so this is sort of like will rights
career in a nutshell right this is what
he's done and he's done it quite
effectively and we've seen the kinds of
opportunities that come out of that you
know whoops sorry with a little pop-up
problem okay so he's done that and shown
what happens when you can get millions
of people to sort of think about zoning
and cities or the way the power of the
scale of the universe what's that worth
even though it's not as much depth as
say what might go on in a university
simulation lab what's the what's the
upside and byproduct of say ten million
people having some level of experience
with that and there are these crucibles
and petri dishes of human behavior
inside games of course what's also great
about them is they're measurable we can
measure everything inside the game the
World of Warcraft economy is a perfectly
measurable economy which makes it
somewhat better than the one that we
have in real life and the foundational
outputs and the R&amp;amp;D and games as I set
up utility piece on beyond that so one
of these like sort of more amorphous
ways that we see this happening is in
this area that we now call fun where so
this is um things like a co-op which
give out these like sort of mission
 go take a picture of yourself
doing something silly and upload it and
get your friends to give you points for
it go by somebody lunch today go give
someone a book you've never done before
and they sort of couch it in the terms
of a game and they sort of think about
it that way or four square right you
know you you build enough points and now
you're the mayor of your favorite
restaurant and now your friends are
competing with you to see who could be
the mayor of your local bar so they're
adding this notion this spreading notion
of games into application software or
into everyday sort of web activities you
know the question there though is does
fun we're really mean score everywhere
that's sort of the low level approach
that we're seeing in this term and Jesse
shells speech at the dice conference
which is made you know gone viral
through the web and I was there a lot of
it sort of talks about this notion at a
sort of low level of score being
everywhere and there it's a psychology
of score and what that might do but is
that really games every
and I would say it's part of it but I
think there's a lot more that we can do
there and we'll see we'll see where that
heads another way that you can look at
understanding the sort of power of games
is some of this is research at Stanford
that hope lab did on one side you have
passive exposure to the game remission
so this is basically watching the
cutscenes in remission and then on the
other side you see a brain scan at
somebody actually playing remission and
you don't have to be a neuroscientist to
see how much more of the brain is being
involved in the different areas
especially some of the emotional areas
of the brain and where that might lead
us to believe whether or not games are
doing something special as we're playing
them to the and special with the
relationship between the information and
our ability to retain it or do something
or think about it I think there's
certainly going to be a lot more work
here at our games for health conference
we had three sessions on fMRI imaging
and games and what they were trying to
find out and learn about it but this
gives you a sense that there's something
fundamental going on when people play
video games when you look at the culture
of games these are blurry screen shots
off a YouTube of commercials in China
for coca-cola Kinky Friedman had the had
a book titled the Elvis Jesus in
coca-cola which he claimed were the
three most often used words in the
English language so it gives you a sense
of what coca-cola's and from a marketing
standpoint you know coca-cola tying you
know coca-cola picking your brand to
associate itself with is sort of a
testament and this is in China which is
sigh this is probably their most
competitive market right now and World
of Warcraft is a phenomenon in China and
these are two commercials that they ran
to basically associate the co crammed
with World of Warcraft that's pretty
powerful we've all heard of a ver gaming
the idea of using a game like you know
mms impact man or skittles but where you
play pac-man you're supposed to have
this sort of casual association the
where we're going now those we're seeing
the ascendancy of games as a cultural
force and now you're seeing marketers
want to cozy up to it the way it cozy
cozy up to the hit song of the deck
and this is sort of a sea change that
we've seen in the last five years so we
have this like sort of possibility gap
that comes out of all this this is a
slide that I use to talk about this
which is you have sort of Moore's Law
Metcalfe's law on one axis and then you
have overtime on the other and what I
tell you about games when I talk to a
lot of people who do learning is that
when you look at the computing power you
need to do most of the e-learning
technologies that we use today to
deliver what we ostensibly call
elearning it sort of Peters out about
circuit 2002 for a computing platform
that's why netbooks are probably getting
so popular because most of what students
are doing on them are accessing websites
and message boards and maybe some light
java and flash applets and mostly using
like things like blackboard and Moodle
but the video game world tends to try
and ride that cutting edge even
farmville which is low end on graphics
is extremely high end on terms of how it
scales its application framework and how
it uses Facebook to generate
collaborative play so it may be low on
them on the Moore's law but it's high on
Metcalfe's law and so we have this
possibility gap and people like myself
are trying to mine that possibility gap
and see what comes out of it and this is
why I think you also see organizational
CEOs sort of looking at their their
learning platforms their software
platforms and then going home to their
kids playing xbox and ps3 and going
something's not right here they don't
quite know what it is but they see a lot
more engagement in power and just action
on this end computation even it doesn't
they don't have to be computer
scientists to see something's going on
there and then they go back in and they
watch a bunch of people staring at
spreadsheets and they're kind of
wondering wait a minute you know where's
my IT investment so we have this notion
of games everywhere and you know I just
paused for a second to say you know i'm
not going to claim a hundred percent
it's beneficial obviously i believe in a
lot of it but you know i try to catch
myself as much as possible but i also
want to think about how do we grow this
and really what are the best practices
so i'm not going to claim to have all
the answers here but i'm definitely
following them from a question
standpoint but I said that I thought
game should be a strategic resource to
large organizations
so here's just looking at games from a
strategic resource from a personal level
so I like to be entertained I liked I
like to take care of my health or I like
to think I do sometimes I need training
i need to learn a new computer language
or I need to like right now I'm obsessed
about gardening so I'm trying to
understand and learn how to garden which
gardening in Maine is a lot harder than
gardening here I've already lost two
crops to frost who thought frost
happened in May and mainline what could
I think education collaboration
production I like to make things and I
do like to work because I sometimes like
to get paid but organizationally we can
also see similar things you want to keep
your employees healthy you want to
advertise your products and services and
be known for them and get business as a
result of it you need to keep people
trained up you need to keep them
educated and you want to do things like
science and research and RD and
production and games as work and like I
said before with the serious game sucks
on ax me we've seen examples in all of
these different areas either on a
personal level or scaled to an
organizational level and so much like we
look at other media like books and
movies and music and video as being
potentially strategic resources whether
they be on a communication level are on
something deeper why shouldn't games be
part of that sure they might lose out on
certain problem solving areas they
should you know and maybe maybe a book
is a better way or a website is a better
way to community communicate or achieve
a certain application output but there
will be times and I think over time will
will hone what these are when games or
properties from games apply to what
we're doing will will be potentially the
best fit so these are some of the
agencies in our government that of
looked at games they've either done
projects or held meetings to
specifically understand them better so
again these are other groups large
organizations trying to understand
strategically where this could be useful
these are countries that have actually
set up on video game serious game funds
with the dollar amounts
and there may be more these are direct
strategic investment now some of this
just to be fair is that they're worried
that their commercial games industry
their commercial entertainment industry
may not be advanced enough or have a
market opening given how mature that
business can be at times and so they're
trying to figure out how do they
diversify their development force into
markets that may be more blue sky but
they're also looking specifically at
also getting some of the residual gains
for rethinking their education and
training systems in their own neck of
the woods so they've decided that these
are so much strategic as well and these
are some of the large corporations that
have done things with games or had
similar meetings trying to figure out
where these mean and and I don't mean to
imply they're endorsing any of this i'm
just saying they're kicking these tires
as much as anybody trying to figure out
what this means or to do things of
course if you just took a ver gaming you
can probably go through about two-thirds
of the fortune 500 have done some sort
of a bird game at some point and
foundations and NGOs are also doing
quite a bit of work so let's move
forward to design pattern evolution so
what's fueling in my opinion some of
this activity sure in some ways it's
capital availability and people with
specific problems that have proven to be
hard and thus require that all hands on
deck strategy but games are this new
part of the equation however I think
it's also due to the evolution of many
different types of games especially
computer and video games so this is sort
of just a simple chart you know over
here on the Left we have sort of
physical games card games classroom
games board games these are the games we
grew up with before computers and then
you have board games going all the way
back to like ancient Egypt Senate sort
of a kind of mancala type game looks
sort of chest like as well being sort of
the oldest sided board game then you got
sort of role playing games this would
have been in the 1970s all of us
hunkering around tables trying to roll
dice and play Dungeons and Dragons and
you had some
wargames there's sort of grog nards
fumbling around with these like sort of
hexagonal chips and tryin rolling dice
and using look-up tables but thinking we
got computers and they could do things
that we couldn't do you could play the
computer so now you didn't have to have
friends to come over well you didn't
have to have friends either right like
the old joke I think there's a joke by
Dimitri the comedian turned Amitri
Martin who said board games our way of
finding out which one of my friends I
hate the most I think we've all been
there but with the computer games now
all of a sudden you get an explosion of
gaming because you don't need the
logistical requirements of games plus
the computer doesn't let you cheat at
least it's not supposed to and sometimes
that's invigorating from a game
standpoint not being able to cheat so
now you get into that I really want to
beat it I can't just cheat my way
through it and you get this wonderful
evolution where the first kinds of
computer games you see are more sort of
stolen from these earlier games and then
they start to evolve to the point where
you're playing things are you like I'm
not sure I could have been playing this
before a computer great example Tetris
it's not it's not a game that really
would have worked until the computer
came along now in the serious game space
what you have is sort of the
re-envisioning of how games can be
applied to other problems like education
and now we're stealing more from these
internal computer game design patterns
than we were from those original
classroom games that gave us things like
the first wave of things like you know
oregon trail or read or rabbit but it's
it's kind of interesting i would argue
that these complex card games you know
things like pokemon and yugioh magic the
gathering these came about because the
the computer games have become so sort
not just popular but how to expanded our
ability to gain to juggle multiple
factors and to think and in an even
larger form about game design and now
all of a sudden people started
reapplying some of those ideas back to
sort of offline games and of course now
with these complex card games you have
this sort of hybrids right you play them
both offline and online trying to gain
the benefits of both
when you look at design patterns and
video games the the important thing to
understand is just how varied they are
and from an e-learning standpoint these
are it's kind of hard when you see the
e-learning sort of paradigm it's we will
take your content and pour it into our
templates but you can't do that with a
video game because the time management
game is not the same way you solve some
other problem so each of these becomes
its own little miniature template that
you have to kind of fit perfectly the
round the round peg into the round hole
and so these are just you know non
common ones but what what gets
interesting is we started to study
design patterns and really understand
how much this really meant to the
evolution of games in the serious game
space and the idea of moving games
everywhere we started looking at a lot
of these alternative design and
engineering patterns because in the
serious game space we don't have to
worry about the fact that interactive
fiction has no competitive value in
commercial gaming it's safe for a few
fans of the genre but let's say you're
trying to teach like lawyers right who
read lots of case studies you know maybe
that's the way to work with lawyers
because it's in a modality that they're
most that in law school that they're in
that their most used to we don't need a
big fancy 3d courtroom we need something
that might be more akin to the textbooks
that they're using but maybe interactive
fiction is a way to put interactivity
into that and bring some of those
properties that we might believe in to
it so now we spend a lot of time going
and looking at a lot of these
alternative areas so that brings me to
places like Google Maps and looking and
say who's who's using google maps to
make games because my next client might
be a UPS who says i need a logistical
game and i need it to run in my browser
well maybe Google Maps is the best way
to do a logistical game it's got all the
data right there all I have to do is
graph the game on top of it if your ups
no problem you'll find my email so you
get things like fantasy sports and audio
only so a lot of these become new ways
to solve problems and what's interesting
on the web is you could find small
communities for all of these either the
antiquated ones or the emerging ones and
they're all moving
tech within that genre forward another
way to look at these design patterns and
to summarize them though is and this led
us to a sort of breakthrough and
thinking about how you move games
everywhere is this notion of how long
you play a game and how long its
lifespan is its game arc and what's
interesting here is you have the
shortest short play short life span
games so bejeweled you know match three
games these sort of the femoral viral
games that go around like the Paris
Hilton stamping license plate game or
four years ago there's a Dane headbutt
game from the World Cup there's sort of
getting email hahaha click it and you
play the game for 30 seconds or a game
like boom blox by EA and Steven
Spielberg sort of like Jenga on steroids
you play these games maybe 15-30 minutes
at a time you might play for a couple of
hours over its lifespan or even just
just five minutes and then they're done
you're not going to pick them back up
then you have these like sort of long
play short life span games like Grand
Theft Auto or red dead redemption which
is a current favorite that's about maybe
80 hours of total gameplay but you play
it in long blocks these where you hear
about Madden weekend or Grand Theft Auto
like people calling in sick it's because
they're going to spend about three days
staying up till their eyeballs bleed at
night to finish the game and then that
experience is wonderful as it may be for
them is over but they've basically
called in sick they've gone offline and
then you have you know the danger to all
marriages and and other long-term
relationships of value the long play
long life span game so this is a you
know don't bother me we're going on a
raid I won't be around this weekend I
can't watch the kids I'm going to be
busy or civilization for you know a game
that I just keep coming back to you when
I go into a sieve game and you know it's
like six or seven hours of effort maybe
over a couple of days and I just keep
coming back to that I think it was them
was it Cory Doctorow or somebody similar
said I was born to like write and play
civilization but are any of those really
conducive to the way we work in our
lives other than on our entertainment
and leisure time
they're not really the short play short
life span game might work a little bit
for a part task simulator but it's
probably not going to incur a lot of
bass a lot of deep information the long
play short life span game you know 80
hours of gameplay that could probably do
it but how many how can you can you go
into a k-12 classroom and just say we're
going to disrupt you know the syllabus
and No Child Left Behind scheduling for
six days well everybody plays this game
you can't go into a modern-day
corporation say oh yeah we're just going
to take the sales staff offline for a
week it just doesn't happen anymore you
can't certainly can't do multiply long
life span games like might as well just
fire them and then so then you come back
to this short play long life span game
and I said to myself I swear were these
games and a lot of them were sort of
these fantasy sports games and this was
pre farmville so you could kind of put
farmville in there too a lot of the
social network games and its really
interesting you play this game for about
15 or 20 minutes to set up your squad
two in the morning then you go to work
you think about it all day but you're
basically productive you're thinking
about in the back your mind then you
make some more changes before the game
starts so that you could set your roster
and then the game commences and then
there's so you know if it's basketball
it's an 82-game season if it's baseball
it's 160 game season and so you have
this really interesting version of a lot
of game play in little amounts of time
over a long arc which is for
organizations doing planning or thinking
in in these longer terms how do we
launch a new product how do we do how do
we redo our sales strategy how do we
think through a big problem this might
be the way that we can get in and be
useful for them so this is a way of
looking at almost every kind of game
made and sort of organizing your
thoughts about where how it works to the
way people work and live so now we get a
little bit more into serious games so
often this is what I'm told I sit in the
audience like this and someone else
comes up and I start cringing given what
I've shown you so far and I just want to
make sure that we got that that this is
wrong when I look at some of the games
they're done there's a
sony camera game for exercise there's a
heart visualization inside the unreal 3
engine down in here this is folded which
is basically people folding proteins
it's a Productivity game they're not
necessarily yes they might be learning
some things but that's not the point of
this this isn't to raise and new
biochemist it's to say I don't care what
you do in your regular will walk a life
if you can play this game and fold this
protein better than someone else that's
what I care about I care about the
answer exercise isn't really necessarily
involve learning unless you want to be a
learning scientists and argue about to
everything it's really about getting a
heart rate sustained for a certain
amount of time so that you burn calories
and improve cardiovascular health here
you've got a safety game you've got
sales training medical training for
surges at hospitals from mass casualty
events stuff done on portable platforms
the person holding the computer actually
used a video game by Peter Molyneux
called the movies to basically animate a
movie about the french riots and put it
up on the web because he was disturbed
that the media that was reporting
coverage from the french riots was
getting the story wrong and he wanted to
get out his story he had something about
a million downloads i think on youtube
and otherwise so he had used this game
to build his film so this is a game as a
production environment we've done some
work at my firm as part of our games for
health project with the Robert Wood
Johnson Foundation to look at the idea
of what happens when video games and
health records come together so not only
reskinning a health record to look more
like the Avatar creation screen in
something like the sims or second life
or indie games like kudos but also
thinking about how the devices that are
building these health games and making
things like Dance Dance Revolution and
Wii Fit available how should they talk
to our help record so that they can
actually do something more than just be
this game or be the self-contained
executable that's tracking our health
this is where the sort of world of web
services starts to creep in even more
and where it's also clear that it's not
creeping in yet except in our brains and
on
our cute little story boards we can
divide up the serious game space even
more we can look at how gamers use games
to do something interesting besides play
them how third-party people like
teachers will take a game and build a
syllabus around it they don't recode the
game they just take something like
civilization and adjusted as a lesson
plan in their history class dealing with
the things that civilization probably
gets wrong but also accentuating the
thematic rule sets in civilization that
really do dovetail nicely with what
they're trying to get students to
understand developers will do things
they'll add non entertainment modes of
play to their games like what you see in
some rock band like the drum trainer and
other types of things and then we'll
also see just the baseline technology is
taken these commercial off-the-shelf
related serious game space we spend a
lot of time looking at user-led
innovation and how the things that we
just are shipped as commercial games are
actually serious game projects they
either could be mods of famous games or
they could be actual games that have
come out on the market like yourself
fitness or brain age or my life coach or
some of these things like the movies
that allow people to create their own
animations and we've all seen some of
the wiimote hacks all around YouTube and
what people are done with those
controlling robots and everything else
so again really looking long at a wide
gamut of activity we've even seen
hardware repurposing I forgot to include
the photo of the military robot that is
controlled by an Xbox controller so
taking that that controller and reusing
it so we've seen a lot of opportunity
there on the abra gaming side like I
said before there's a lot of simplistic
understanding of what our gaming is this
is a chart that we use to build out the
space a little bit more so we look both
at using games but also this whole area
where you get game association basically
brands sort of using games so like a
couple of years ago on TV all I would
see is this Volvo commercial where the
entire volvo car was inside dices rally
sport for the Xbox I don't think they
were using not to go after the typical
vulval consumer there they were using
that to say hey we're hip we're cool
we're
we're not just the staid old car and if
you want to finish the race maybe you
need a Volvo at least finishes in one
piece so we looked at on games in
production these are off the shelf games
that either include modes where you can
do things like the project gotham racing
i guess one of the programmers was a
real video photography buff and so he
added all kinds of things like motion
blurs and f-stop and all kind of
basically you could practice all the
different types of camera settings that
you would in like a photography class
inside this video game taking pictures
of high speed car races and there's
artists who use of the Unreal Engine to
create art so we're seeing all these
kinds of media mashups we're seeing them
various types of usage segments around
work so we've seen things like direct
earnings and games using games to either
express or assess opinions like
prediction markets and opinion research
and we're seeing people who work to play
meaning they put effort into their play
there a guild leader they're writing
walkthroughs they're basically training
other players or they play to work so
that'd be like you're sort of gold
farmer or your professional gamer so it
goes well beyond the sort of you know to
our fun on a Saturday afternoon and we
can look at work in other forums so
exercise is a form of work and we can be
sort of casually involved in it or we
could get really personally invested in
it we could get really actively engaged
and we can move up these sort of
different levels of activity so you can
go from just joining a guild to leading
a guild and if you've ever looked at a
constant Stein coolers work mapping the
sort of management skills used to lead a
guild and and then watching it map
directly on top of a middle level
manager and an information oriented
company it's like one to one except one
of them is a fourteen-year-old kid so we
can look at this progression of working
games I'm sort of going quite quickly to
make up for time but there are different
levels that we see we see people moving
from a sort of novice level of work to a
sort of mastery level of working games
then we have this sort of number of
commercial off-the-shelf activity we're
seeing things like sports
pre-visualization package
is we're seeing this sort of brain game
sort of cognitive health stuff we've
seen stuff taken from games for
architecture markets as well as teaching
and education and you can look at this
as sort of a sort of moving force you
know on one end we have sort of
instructors and utilizers people are
more interested in and indirect
education now on the other end we have
these game developers really sort of
working on entertainment but also
education in terms of like if you're
gamers aren't educated on how to play
your game if they're if they're they
don't level up through that mastery
they're going to reject your game and
then we can sort of see these non
entertainment users and these
entertainment and gamers and we could
see that serious games sort of morphs
beyond just its most core attitude
towards these other types of uses of
games depending on which way it's moving
it's being pulled from what directions
being pulled from the most as a result
of this you know you've probably seen I
hope a big picture argument that games
are evolving in this sort of Cambrian
explosion of many different parts of our
life games are also changing the
commercial games level to where new
markets are evolving do the platform
changes and other trends so what are
some of those shifts so we're seeing
organizational video games requiring
different approaches and sort of
creating a different need for games so
that would be you know where I spend
most of my life really trying to
reformulate what games are going to look
like in web browsers because it's really
hard to think that we're going to have a
lot of video games working at the edge
of the network inside these large
organizations they can't secure it they
don't want to manage it they can't even
put GPUs at the edge of that Network
enough depending on what we're trying to
do so you're seeing these supporting
elements also supporting elements like
Xbox Live PlayStation Network the things
that wrap around a game not just the
game itself and these are becoming even
more important at times than the games
we're seeing how mobile devices in their
proliferation are requiring a whole new
take on how cross-platform developments
going to work and we're seeing this
interface novelty the things like the
Wii things like we fit things like Sony
new move platform or project natal
changing the way we use games and
creating new opportunities as well as
free bit free game models advertising
supported models digital download
pricing spurring this growth in what I
call good enough games by changing some
other element of the value proposition
of a game creating a wii controller or
creating a free game with a with in-game
transaction models you're seeing gamers
around the world sort of get into games
that normally might have been rejected
under the old critical sort of aspect oh
is this the latest greatest thing
they're being brought in in different
ways and they're finding different ways
to sort of decide that a game is really
cutting-edge Wii tennis is pong on an
old sort of level graphics platform but
it is phenomenally fun because of the
way that controller works and so we're
getting this sense of good enough games
I'm starting to see a lot more gamers
not too worried about having the latest
and greatest just is it good and why is
it good and that axis of why it's good
has just become so much more
proliferated but this games a service is
kind of interesting because as you get
more into the idea that games become
services you start to see the struggles
sort of playing out in front of your
eyes in the games industry which is the
more that a game is an always present
always available cross-platform plugged
into your social network and all kinds
of other sort of elements of your
digital life the more it's like a
service and the more it's like a service
the more it sort of has to live in the
cloud and so where we see is where most
games are but where I think we're
heading and this battle over processing
is kind of interesting there's call of
duty modern warfare this is a game you
need an xbox control you know or a
playstation to play because the graphics
are so rich but when you look at where
games are going the those games will
always be present but they're being sort
of drowned out by a lot of these other
games running in browsers running on
lighter weight mobile platforms
and that is really really interesting
because it's that those types of games
that are going to get games everywhere
because we need different types of games
this is a chart that just shows the
organizational interests and the games
industry interest and you can basically
if you look at that just starting what
the language is used you can see these
people are at odds and the game industry
or all of us gamers are going to have to
kind of adjust if we want to see games
really become useful for these large
organizational interests these could be
formal organizations or informal
organizations groups of us around the
world trying to solve a problem or need
so they have this sort of different
games because an individual's tends to
want to be close to the hardware has
lots of time and an organization wants
to be close to the web they have
security and they don't have lots of
time and then both of them are dealing
with this on-the-go pervasive access
question so we get this sort of usage
gap that goes on in the serious game
space which is that when we look at the
commercial off-the-shelf game market for
things like exercise the game existing
isn't is interesting but and you look at
the sales but when you go and look at
the usage it's not quite there in other
words there's more we fits in the world
than there are people playing wii fit or
staying on Wii Fit like an adherence
principle so what I have to spend time
in is thinking about how do I close that
gap because the wii fit or other next
generation Xer games are going to be
incredible tools for health but they're
not going to be incredible tools that we
can't hook them up to health records if
we can't hook them up to reminder
systems they can't if we can't hook them
up to all these things that i've learned
in studying behavior change and that
people in the behavior change industry
are using so until we can connect those
two pieces together we're not we're
going to have more of that gap so you
think about what types of behavior
changes we want to we want to work on
improving study habits health
productivity habits raising people's
self-esteem and where you get that is
where do those traits come from they
come from the surrounding elements
sometimes even more so than the game
itself even if the game is tremendously
graded involving you in something and
getting you to think differently or act
differently as a result to play or even
during play but when I think about it
here's our
game but here are the surrounding
elements or some of them that I can
envision putting around a game that I'm
looking to actually have be far more
effective than just from an
entertainment standpoint and what I'm
saying is is that if we probably have to
look at simplifying some of our games I
think this is actually what's happening
anyways and then adding complexity and
services and robustness and these outer
edges and connecting these two things
together and that will make our games
even more effective and create the need
or the ability for them to be real deep
solutions in other areas the funny thing
is when you do this you're basically
applying all that leverage to the outer
side of things these things tend to be
reusable irregardless of the game and so
you get a sense of providing more value
for the dollar so you can potentially
drive down the costs and the risks of
your game as a result of that and
increase points of sale and reduce
piracy even so with these new models
have new needs and so what creates games
everywhere so there's sort of two paths
one is the browser and not just the
browser from four years ago but browsers
that allow us to run rich web
applications that render out in HTML
form like neptune's pride a really kind
of interesting strategy game built on
top of quit Lords of Ultima this is EA
doing sort of the same thing this is an
HTML rendered game store in Johnson who
was involved in civilization in spores
is Bill tag wit level project for
strategy games and he's level and he's
building this out I've seen the work
that's been done here where you
basically ported quake 2 with html5 over
to on top of wit and created basically
the quake 2 running inside a browser so
quake 2 is kind of like the hello world
a 3d engine game engine so if you can
get it to run on anything this people
spend their time doing this there's also
this remotely or Roman rendered secure
gameplay model this is where we render
the the game inside a server area and
then basically pump out encrypted MPEG
and then back basically a remote
basically a joystick at the long end of
a long long
long wire now there's there's two
companies kind of working on this there
may be some others you know there's some
issues with latency but a lot of a lot
of games as we've seen very successful
games don't need don't have latency
problems who cares if your farmville has
a little bit of latency you still gotta
wait a day for your crops anyways and
we're seeing games meaning people the
other fork is to meet people where they
are so not just move to a new platform
but to think about where they're working
so there's a game in gmail I me ma'am
i'll be at a demo there's a serious ax t
which is basically embedding a social
economy on top of email so embedding
itself into Microsoft Outlook and Mail
app and other types of mail programs to
create a new type of social network game
in organizations the nether net which
was a startup that went bust but has
open sourced all its code as a toolbar
is a browser-based game using a toolbar
and then there's ribbon hero from
Microsoft but we need this game App
Engine something that looks like this
that includes things like YouTube and
Google Maps that takes these api's and
turn and allows us to turn out rich
games within this context so that we can
push them everywhere for all kinds of
problems I thought this was really cool
because they use you to basically for
the cutscene inside this browser-based
game and then you know DDR hooked up to
google health and so I start thinking
about all these different pieces of the
web services that surround the game I
start thinking about how web browsers
and different types of consoles even
have web browsers and you know you start
to see WebKit showing up more and more I
start thinking about these types of
ideas where I'm just playing with what
would that whole stack of technologies
look like and how would they interact
and how would they create games that
could even involve moves where I could
do anything because humans are in the
loop to judge the game not just the
computer so I look at google wave and I
say wow I could build really rich
role-playing and decision making games
in a corporate environment in that law
that short play long lifespan mode and
how could we apply that so I think about
things like fold it in citizen science
you know a citizen science game on top
of Google Wave using google maps and all
these technologies that could be really
really interesting and could be the kind
of tool set that we could use over and
over again so what's needed in order to
get there we need to drive down the cost
of the surrounding infrastructure in the
first playable a lot of organizations
have trouble green-lighting games it's
hard to say i'm going to do this to my
bob for my boss and so we need to drive
down that ability for them to get
something up on the screen with where
everybody in the organization yes that
is what we want and it's going to work
we need specialized engines not just
general purpose and we want to think
about how these games can move
everywhere in our infrastructure both
our personal life and our work and our
entertainment and the other kinds of
causes that we take in life so that's my
sense of games everywhere thank you so I
believe I'm around for a little bit to
talk I know it's maybe not questioned I
can take some questions and then I'm I
know I'm going to be meeting with Matt's
team who's working on some game ideas
within their group that sound really
interesting as well and so I'd be happy
to provide perspective or anything while
I'm here today so III tomorrow
but wonder if you could talk about
badging reward systems seems to be all
the craze is their longevity in that
name in which thing in badges such as
for scratches and Foursquare yeah so I
mean you should certainly look at Jesse
Schell speech at dice I mean he sort of
really put that forward in a big way and
talked about some things that a lot of
us have been thinking about i think that
there's a need for sort of a system that
could allow us to bring those those
ideas to almost any application or frame
of work not just one that's embedded
inside a particular application i worry
about whether or not we end up in a
situation where everything's badged and
everything has a score and what does
that mean it probably means some of us
have to be more creative it's hard to
say what's going to happen when badges
and score are everywhere a lot of gamers
don't necessarily respond to score I'm a
lifelong hardcore gamers sometimes I
respond to score sometimes I respond a
narrative or just moving through levels
but it's clear looking at Xbox Live that
it's kind of like a learning management
system it has a lot of a lot of
similarities in fact it has a lot of
things that it exceeds learning
management systems at so there's a lot
we can learn from I think we're in the
early stage
sure so I the question was i I didn't
necessarily mention second life in
virtual worlds those sort of close
cousins two games what I found at least
in the moment the current virtual worlds
have lots of opportunity I'm finding
that many of the ones second life aside
are fairly weak environments compared to
what my game development friends and I
could build so I'm sort of puzzled as to
why that's come about I think part of
its because they the people who built
those were sort of thinking more from a
a gotomeeting standpoint as opposed to
rich environments for for activity the
other part of it though is that I think
some of that area has has fallen victim
to social networking applications and
games where the virtual world really is
a little bit more virtual but is hot
much more highly social in asynchronous
the video game industry has really been
obsessed by synchronous communication
and activity and it's only when we start
to explore asynchronous stuff which is
really the way we work a lot more that
we're starting I think see a lot more
opportunity in that vein and that's
that's been kind of interesting to watch
the games industry deal with that spore
is called a massively single-player game
and it really is a big asynchronous game
and I think that that may actually hold
more value to us going forward so I'm
glad to see that actually
see and strategies for monetizing games
yeah the one of the things that I think
we need a little bit and that's helping
this is are all these different business
models around not only virtual
currencies but like small transaction
games anything that sort of provides the
ability for the value for the gamer to
be just get involved the attention
economy so to speak and that's been
quite helpful the problem is is that we
don't really have a lot of robust
systems for individual developers to
kind of play at that to build that
infrastructure as easily I think as we
do we'll start seeing you know again
more of this Cambrian explosion because
it's the smaller indie groups the
university's the organizations that have
problems that are turning to this and
they they're the ones that are sort of
lacking the infrastructure so perhaps as
we see those platforms come into play
we'll see more of this thanks so
everyone's welcome to come over to
Charlie's a few of us are going over
there to have lunch and you can bring
some your questions over there we're
going to finish up now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
