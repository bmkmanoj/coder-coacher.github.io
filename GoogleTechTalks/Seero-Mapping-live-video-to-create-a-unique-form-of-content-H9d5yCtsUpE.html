Malik it's my pleasure today to
introduce Dan rummel of 0 I met Dan at
one of our geo developer series if you
don't know what that is I recommend
googling it there are great series of
videos Dan's here to talk about 0 which
is a Geo broadcasting platform which is
a word I'm pretty sure they made up but
I'm sure they're going to define for us
so without further ado here's Dan
alright so also we have Dave and Justin
my two other co-founders here so if you
have other questions beyond technical
stuff they can they should be able to
answer those if they can't then they're
in trouble so anyway so yeah cero using
live video and mapping to create a new
breed of content so I'm just got a quick
outline of what I'm going to talk about
here so first I'm going to do a quick
demo and let you know what the heck 0 is
and what we're doing get a taste of what
it looks like then I want to talk about
why kind of why we picked the Geo web
why we're working in the Geo web and how
sero fits into that then I'm going to
get into the tech stuff talk about some
of the features technology and ideas we
used and then have some time for
questions at the end if there are any so
let's go to the homepage here real quick
so this is what the home page looks like
and so let's see it usually what we like
to do is let the site speak for itself
in terms of describing what it does so
here's this the one guys yeah so here's
Justin and Dave hi i'm justin and i'm
dave and this is cyracom the world's
first geo broadcasting plan
you're watching an archive of the live
broadcast that we shot earlier Marquis 0
archives or live broadcasts and stores
your GPS course along with it we're
driving Golden Gate Park to give you a
little walkthrough of how 0 works as you
can see on the map to the right we're
moving along john f kennedy drive
towards Ocean Beach check out the local
information under the mat right now
we're still going a factoid about the
Dutch window on the west end of Golden
Gate Park which we're passing as we
speak the star on the map indicates its
exact location as you're watching you
can also learn about the broadcaster and
their profile below or chat with
like-minded people we made 0 so that
people could showcase exciting
destinations around the world live and
on location you could bring viewers on a
cross-country road trip in your right so
poor Dave and Justin not only did they
have to record that about 50 times
they've had to watch at about a hundred
so so yeah so that's the basic idea is
we've got a mechanism to broadcast live
over the Internet over cellular
connections and a mechanism to capture
GPS information from any device that you
have on your um PC or whatever laptop
you might be broadcasting from so this
is what the broadcaster profile page
looks like we've got the live video in
the map obviously some factual
information about the area chatting ooh
I gotta sign in to chat I'm not going to
do that but and then you can share and
then also flag content so down here we
also have some pretty simple stuff you
can import a google calendar to let
people know when you're live that's kind
of one of the issues right if you're
live broadcasting then people have to
know when you're going to be going up
live also we've got a survey and then a
bunch of other local feeds from where
you are so as you can see the sights
really built around location and we
wanted to make it you know really
open-ended give you the freedom to
explore wherever you want and look check
out the content that you want so for
example here I'm navigating over to one
of our
try as I want to go to Angela and one of
our content partners open road TV we can
just go and find one of their videos our
next stop is a place that blacktop back
roads don't reach if you notice so
that's Doug McConnel I don't know if you
guys ever watched Bay Area back roads
but they have a block open road TV
really great blog and they do all this
very location based kind of video
content really high quality well
produced stuff and so they wanted to use
zero to kind of promote their content
but as you can see right when i click
that video this without a page reload or
anything just brought up all new
information about this new broadcaster
and all it well looks like it's a little
slow to update the rest of it but but it
updates all that broadcaster information
so yeah so that's a basic touch as to
what 0 is doing oh actually why don't I
go into the back end here let me sign in
real quick
so on the back end we've got well I'm
Justin there's Jen i'm dave and this is
your calm so this is our live
broadcasting module it's a flash-based
web-based broadcasting i won't go into
that too much because it's pretty
self-explanatory we also do allow you
kind of as a supplementary thing to
upload geotag videos and then here's the
profile and archive section where you
can do all the basic editing of of your
information and you can also you notice
when i reloaded that page Dave's video
automatically started playing so you can
actually set up your own playlist as
people come and visit your page you can
automatically spoon-feed them content
that either is previously recorded or
previously uploaded so that's kind of
again supplementary to the live content
because it's you know not everyone can
be on the internet when you're doing
something live so and then of course a
whole bunch of other stuff this is the
archive section looks like we did a
bunch of tests broadcast there so then
we're integrated with Twitter Google
Calendar stuff and then here's where you
edit your survey and the weather feed as
well so let me just jump back to my
powerpoint so this is just kind of a
little text map of what 0 is about
there's a lot of stuff in there but
really the big ones that pop out or the
live video the mapping and all of the
services that go along with mapping
sharing and of course exploring we
wanted to make use you know use the the
ability of google maps and i'll show you
later in google earth use that ability
to explore wherever you want and find
content in a very open-ended fashion so
next I want to talk about why why are we
building this site in the Geo web why
are we using this as our foundation and
to do that I want to take a look quick
at the idea of exploration and media so
exploration what is expirations when you
physically get up and go somewhere and
you you really experienced something
through your own eyes and its really the
purest form of experiencing any event or
place so I just listed some ways that we
go exploring you know
have our feet bikes ships planes trains
and automobiles and that's all great
that made it very fast and easy for us
to travel but it still takes a lot of
time and expense so thankfully people
are really smart and they said well if
we actually sacrifice actually going
there and use technology to give us a
window into those places then we can
bring the efficiency of that really high
and let more people do it and let people
do it much more easily so we've got
radio movies and TV and of course the
internet right and so that's great right
you have this window where you can view
the world you can watch travel channel
you can go kind of exploring within this
framework right so but what's different
with media is that because there's that
framework because you're looking through
a window that's very well well
controlled it provides an opportunity
for the content to be filtered as well
as distorted and manufactured so what
that means is that you're not getting
content from every which can be good and
bad in terms of filtering right I don't
really want to know what's happening in
Wichita Kansas if a new like grocery
stores opening up that's fine I don't
need to get that information but it
could also be bad in the sense you know
some governments are censoring
information for political reasons of
course every time you turn on the news
today you might see a distorted news
broadcast but again that could be good
sometimes because sometimes really just
need to hear something supporting your
candidate or trashing another candidate
and I think actually the greatest thing
is through these mediums in television
and movies you can manufacture stuff
there's CG these days you know great
movies like Lord of the Rings Jurassic
Park things like that they're just
fantastical we never see in real life we
can kind of you know experience other
worlds different things but of course
that can be you know taking advantage of
you can convince people of things that
aren't true necessarily so that's kind
of how media is different and what
happens is is when we're especially when
we're today barrage with all different
types of media we kind of become
desensitized to those media sources and
connected in a way and that's you know
when you see fantastical things like
Jurassic Park you say well afghanistan's
not that bad because there's not
dinosaurs running around right well of
course we're all smart we know that
that's not reality but still the visual
image has become much less effective in
today's world and the media in terms of
motivating people and conveying
information is a little tamed down and
not quite as effective so you know as
humans I think we're word you know
evolving beings and our culture is
changing all the time and so I really
think our culture has very recently in
this you know almost suffocating
environment surrounded by all kinds of
media we've been trying to reconnect
with those mediums and so you you look
at I think the earliest one is probably
radio call shows or calling shows where
you can call into the radio and all of a
sudden you hear your friend on the radio
hear yourself on the radio and that
medium is all of a sudden validated more
for you also we've seen a boom of
reality TV you know it's kind of the
same thing you see your friend on on
there someone from your hometown or from
your home state and all of a sudden that
medium is a lot more valid it's you can
relate to this person you can connect
with this person to some degree of
course some reality TV is just
completely outlandish you can't believe
that these people are real that's part
of the interesting thing and then of
course there's the internet which is
even easier to connect with because
everybody's you know putting up their
personal web pages or blogging and
claiming their own little piece of land
on the internet right and saying you
know I'm a part of this this medium I'm
in this whole media experience when you
browse the internet and then I a friend
of mine said you know we were talking
about why there's so many trollers out
there that are in comments forums and
different comment threads just trashing
a ton of people and saying stuff and
you're just like why is this person
doing this well they're interacting with
the medium and getting attention through
a validating the medium that they're
spending so much time on and becoming a
part of it and looking at you know the
huge explosion of social media I think a
big reason that's been so successful is
because
it's grounded in your reality because
your friends who are already on there
automatically give you some relation to
that and so you're connected to that
Network that's already there so it's
very easy to take that medium as being
valid and interesting to you so okay so
I was going on and on but how does that
really all relate to the Geo web well
what's the first thing that you do when
you when Google Earth came out were in
Street View came out anyone was the
first thing he did he went and he looked
at your house right and then the next
thing just looked where did you go to
school and then where'd you go to
college that's a dorm that I lived in
this is where I used to work and that's
where I am now and so every time you
open up Google Earth or a street view
comes out or on Google Maps you
instantly have a point of connection
these this medium know is all about you
already it doesn't know about you
specifically but it knows every where
you've been where you are now and
probably where you want to go so it's a
great foundation to really kind of
connect people with whatever else there
is to explore so we think that's one of
the reasons that you know Google Earth
has been downloaded so many times and
and the Geo web is really starting to
take off is because people can really
connect to that so syros foundations
relating to that we're free net service
so we kind of threw that idea we're not
you know blocking people of course some
people who are putting up explicit
content or copyrighted content we have
to deal with that but generally we're
going to let people broadcast what they
want so that allows for a you know more
inclusive medium the live video limits
distortion it gives you a much more raw
picture of what's happening at that
event or that place and you know kind of
brings down that kind of surreal feel of
a lot of the movies and stuff that we
see today and of course it's part of the
Geo web which breaks down that that
limiting framework that you know
television you have to sit in front of
your TV and you're limited by that
screen on your TV and what's on the TV
Guide so you it's really open ended in
terms of exploring and finding new
on time so yeah so now I'm going to get
into the tech stuff so some quick things
just to get all the way cuz I know some
of you will probably ask us we are
running on a lamp stack and it's PHP is
the P in that we're using Amazon Web
Services ec2 and s3 ec2 for media
clustering and things like that because
we have to stream stuff and our media
protocol is our mt p which is the
standard for flash video streaming so so
we've had some interesting challenges
when we started putting this together we
wanted we really really wanted to
maintain the usability of the UI and the
intuitiveness i'm sure you've seen lots
of google mashups map matchups where you
zoom out too far and all of a sudden
there's just a big crazy ridiculous
cluster of icons and you can't navigate
anywhere you click on something and the
different window opens up or you can't
really make any sense of the data so
that was one thing we didn't want to
have happen we wanted to be really
careful about how we dealt with that we
want to be able to handle lots of
dynamic geodata right people are going
to be up broadcasting save that video
delete that video different things you
know joining the site we need to be
adding broadcasters to our broadcast
your map and also we want to be as
inclusive as possible so imagine I mean
you saw when I was kind of around San
Francisco there's a ton of content
around San Francisco mainly because
we're hanging out in San Francisco a lot
and a lot of our friends are in San
Francisco but we wanted to make sure
that all of those videos have a chance
to be found on the map and so those are
kind of some of our interesting and big
challenges that we had so the first
thing we did was we said obviously we
need some kind of clustering right we
needed to take where there's a whole
bunch of stuff we need to when you're
far out you need to get a quick view of
what's going on and we need the person
be able to relate to that as well so the
idea we came up with is let's custom
cluster based on what people already
know so people understand the country's
the region's the cities of towns and
then eventually once you get close
enough you don't need those landmarks
and you just cluster based on grids
in a second will will go and take a look
at that a little closer in more detail
and you'll notice that that's how the
clustering works it's not based on a
purely gridded system or just randomly
showing a few sparks videos when you're
zoomed really far out it actually
connects to actual cities actual
countries or states depending on what
zoom level you are and of course that's
done server side and I'll get into a
little bit more of that so sorry about
the headers overlaying this computer
doesn't have the fonts that I had online
but so we decided that we would do the
clustering using KML files by creating
tiles of KML files such that the viewer
window would then know well I'm at this
zoom level so I need this tile it's very
similar to the way you know Google Maps
loads its image layers right you the
window knows okay I'm from this latitude
to this latitude and this long to do
this longitude load these different
tiles and so we took the same idea to
KML and we server-side create these KML
files such that they tile out to create
the map of what you need at that zoom
level so then the request for those
files are managed on the client side
through JavaScript it basically knows
what the viewport is and loads those
tiles and importantly it only loads at
once so if you go back to let's say
you're at the United States view it'll
load that whole tile and then if you
zoom go somewhere else and then zoom
back out there won't reload it again
from the server because it already has
it so that's kind of nice minimizes
requests and some processing so also
what comes out of that is we can easily
do dynamic data a lot of geo data that
you have you get a whole bunch of it all
at once you know you have like terrain
maps or something like that and you can
just batch process the whole thing but
our data sets interesting because it's
growing some pieces are getting taking
out and so this way we can actually
dynamically update only the tiles or the
KML files that that need updating so
here you can see in the diagram if
something's clustered down to this into
this tile and then we know every tile
above that instantly because those tiles
are indexed or follow
them that indexes them very easily so
let's take a look at that just go to the
homepage so I'm just going to switch to
videos here and so here in I'll go and
one more here in North America you can
see as I click on California then I get
all these California actually get the
top ten in california since there's so
many in california and as I everything
is you know Colorado the same thing for
our broadcaster camo and so this is all
being loaded you can kind of see as
individual tiles get loaded actually I
can probably make one disappear for a
second and then you'll notice all those
load together so that group there is all
on one tile and again these are all
based on on on States at this level and
if we zoom into California here let's
just zoom in this way
so I start to zoom in and you'll notice
all of a sudden California broke into
there's Los Angeles San Jose and San
Francisco if i zoom in even further on
the bay area then we get san jose
fremont san francisco again believe
Oakland Modesto we keep going keep going
and you notice how for the most part not
much as being left out of course when
you get really far out you don't want to
have a list of you know ten thousand
videos all coming up in California that
would be kind of a pain to look through
and take forever to display but so you
can see even as we keep going in the
videos continue to break out so I'm at
this level we're basically clustering on
a grid so these two if i zoom out they
should probably cluster together I lost
where they were oh they didn't actually
close together still separated but uh
let's oh yeah you get the general idea
that and again the tiles are still
functioning in a similar way let's see
if I can get someone to disappear here
so there those are gone and then that
kml loads and it's pretty snappy because
it's already loaded at once it's just
one server request which is pretty nice
and so then that's also reflected on the
broadcaster side just click a video here
and here you notice since we've got a
lot going on in the page will just pause
the video we had to really make sure
that the map was was really well done in
terms of not being too overwhelming so
and that's loading the same kml tiles as
the homepage was so that's the nice
thing I've also doing it you do it once
and you can reuse it a lot of times you
don't have to query the database and
also Google does some caching on their
side so it actually pings our server
even less yeah so let's see what is next
so another thing that we're really
trying to do is get KML feeds out there
to the people people put all their
content up there on our site and we want
them to be able to share with other
people and let other people explore
their content so we're utilizing network
links so that way you don't have to you
know download a new KML feed you can
just keep the same file or keep a link
to the same file in your Google's API
and it will update as you update your
cereal content of course then we can
also put in updates if we want to change
the format or we totally rebrand the
site or something like that we can do
that on the fly and of course we include
that in our sitemap so all of your
content is then index in into Google my
maps so let's see quick demo of that so
we've got this really great guy oops I
did what I wasn't supposed to do we've
got this really great guy Craig Stanton
and he's this crazy kind of adventure
guy and in when was it it was 2006 I
think 2006 I could be wrong on that he
hiked all the way from Mexico to Canada
along the Pacific Crest Trail and so he
was really anxious because he has a map
on his website in his blog where he has
his blog is actually geo tagged so
everywhere he goes on his hike he geo
tags his blog and then that comes up on
his site and so he was really pushing us
to get this out in a hurry because he
just left on a trip for Japan and so
this map is actually kind of mimics what
could be on any one site so there it
loads and then you have a direct link
back to the video a little thumbnail and
so yeah so you can see all the videos
he's put on 0 for the Pacific Crest
Trail and we can go to his web page here
it's not loading
I'm just going to skip right to his map
here and so he landed in Japan I think
two days ago and if we just turn on the
videos layer then you can see that these
little icons popped up here and that was
his last video post from Craig and do
you know where he is he's at the shoe by
intersection Shibuya and so we can just
click that and take people straight to
his section a few minutes the council
help engine and people just go
everywhere hundreds maybe even thousands
of people cross which intersection every
time
go down perfectly civilized over
bro
we really like greg was really fun he's
a good guy he's uh he's been beta
testing for us for a while and Ben had a
lot of good input so let me go back to
this and I think I have to jump ahead
fast here so oh I wanted to do one other
things show you want anything quick so
another thing that we just released
couple days ago is our serial live KML
so you can actually watch live
broadcasters in Google Earth before I
show you this I want to talk about a
little bit how we do it and it really
shows off some of my favorite well my
favorite part of KML and I really could
see a lot of powerful applications for
it beyond what we're doing we're really
not doing anything that tricky and I
feel like other people who have a lot
more time on their hands could do some
pretty amazing stuff so why don't I just
zip to this and we'll talk about how we
do it so what we're using is a network
link and I'll network link control so
there's these tags in KML the update
option and there's the create change and
delete and then also the cookie and so
what we do is let's say there's three
broadcasters larry-curly- and-moe so the
first time you load this KML layer you
the cookie that you get back from the
from google earth is empty and so then
you basically execute three times you
create larry-curly- and-moe nothing too
fancy and then of course you include all
the information for that KML file then
then comes back the next request which
is only four seconds later they've moved
a little bit so you can go ahead and
change things about Larry Curly and Moe
dynamically in that KML file without
reloading the whole thing a standard
network length the way it works is I
know how many people do any KML
developing or anything only a few of you
okay so yeah so standard network link
what it does is it refreshes every you
know four seconds or five seconds and it
refreshes the whole file and overwrites
it races everything you had before and
then over rights again so that has some
strange effects work and remove things
and then put them back and i'll show you
when i do the demo that it would be
harmful for us to destroy everything on
the map so so basically then the next
thing you can do is delete so let's say
curly signs off then in that
network link control you basically fire
off a delete for curly and he'll just
disappear off the map and he'll be done
so maybe I'll just talk about that a
little more as i do this demo so oh by
the way I forgot to mention so there's
Craig's videos also loaded in Google
Earth it's the same camp mal feed that
Craig had before it looks like it's a
little slow on the server there but but
so yeah so that those all work in Google
Earth of course so I'm going to turn
this one on and oh this one okay so with
this feed and the new feature that you
can actually load flash Oh looks like
you just went not live huh
so now let's zoom in here and so Dave
here is actually broadcasting right now
under my account so there we go so this
is that's in this room right here and we
can zoom in a little closer here but so
what's happening here is this serial
live connection is a network link into
which loads a foundation file which is
basically nothing in it but styles and
things like that and then this hero
updater that's a network link control
and kill the audio so that's a network
link control and what that does it says
okay what what needs to be added to this
layer right now and the really nice
thing is is that we can then update the
information let's get a window that I
can oh oh where am I going
so I've got a little script on my phone
that will hijack the GPS to feed here so
normally you just be you know walking
around or driving around and your GPS
would naturally be updating but so you
notice the little guy started to move
there and he's actually going to move
behind the thing so we can't see him but
so what's happening is the network link
control is going back to the server and
saying okay well what's changed about
this guy see if I can get one where
don't have to and if we were to just
reload the whole KML file I can't give
them to you clicking too much so there
he goes so if we were just to reload the
whole KML file this info window would
close and we wouldn't be able to
continuously watch the video as as he
moves around so you see zipping around
doing kind of a circle basically the
script takes me in a little circle hiked
about half a mile so so by using this
functionality of KML in Google Earth
we're able to really present a dynamic
experience with the video and as well as
with the movement of the broadcaster so
it's kind of tough on this small screen
because everything's so pinned together
but so he's almost back to where he
belongs and so then the whole time you
can watch the video that's really the
point of that so yeah that's that and I
think
so see I'm going to have to skip way
forward
so looking forward where do we want to
go with this we see a lot of potential
in terms of adding other layers giving
people more stuff to look at on stuff
like Google Earth and you know we've
been throwing around ideas how we want
to do that whether we just display
popular videos all the videos or just
recent videos of course we want to add
widgets so people can embed this in
their own sites we've had a lot of
people request this already that they're
they've got some blog about a road trip
they're doing or they've got this guy
adventure biker he's down in Florida and
he does these crazy adventures on his
bike and he wants to blog about that on
the next to all of this content and so
one thing that we'd like to do is make
it easier for people to create their own
Maps so we're thinking about making a
Google gear embeddable map so you don't
have to know anything about the API
basically just get an embed code right
from the site you can plop that down and
automatically centers on your content
and people can browse that it will and
of course some people are doing some
really cool stuff with Google Maps and
flash and we kind of want to integrate
the video and the map into one little
widget that will display your content
display your live content all on your
site and of course we are looking at
mobile applications or mobile
applications on cell phones and things
like that right now we're kind of got an
initiative going to get a Cymbeline
symbian application out some other
companies have done live video from
symbian cell phones we think we can do
the same thing and then also take
advantage of the location-based services
and those cell phones to kind of make
the broadcasting equipment needed much
much more mobile much lower cost so
right now Dave he's got an o qo which is
our favorite little device to broadcast
from it's basically a mini computer that
can run anything and you know you don't
want to haul around your laptop pull a
justin TV all the time where you have a
laptop and a webcam attached to you if
you can just pop up at some event it can
be much more spontaneous that way so and
of course we're watching Android as well
because we think a lot of the api's and
services there will be really in tune
with what we're looking to do so yeah
any questions
right now
in the video
mhm
like there were single markers to know
right
right so we are working on it kind of
goes along the lines with the working
with the google maps and flash we want
to build a I don't know what to really
call like a post-processing geo editor
so you have some video and let's say
it's something like that you're going
down some path or even cuts from one
place to another then we can import
input the metadata for those waypoints
after the fact so let's say you record
it with your just digital camera then
you can upload it and then use this
editor to say well at five seconds into
the video i was here at Google and then
30 seconds and i was in san francisco
and then 40 seconds and i was over here
so it's kind of a whole new form of
editing to actually take you along for
the ride with that video so yeah we're
working on doing that and it seems like
the best way to do that is through flash
because you can you don't have to have
the video talking to the through proxy
to the JavaScript and stuff like that so
once once we get a little more familiar
with the flash google map stuff then
you'll probably see something like that
um you know Pamela Fox last night was
talking about the difference between
Google gears that run maps map 'let's
and there's another one that's kind of
in between my maps layers or something
like that and you know they all kind of
blend together my understanding is am
applet only runs at maps google com yeah
we're thinking about doing something
like that it's as I understand it's kind
of like a layer for google earth but
it's it's browsable in the directory and
so yeah it definitely would be something
we'd be looking into it's just got to
kind of focus on a few things and and go
with those so
I just one
travel yeah so the question was we
basically the concept of channels is
kind of the way we look at it right now
I mean we just opened up the site for
public access two or three weeks ago so
we're still just building a base of
content so you you know filter it by
travel or something then you're only
going to have a couple videos here and
there so but once we get a little
critical mass it's definitely something
that would be very interesting in the
broadcast section we already have a way
that you can title your video and we'll
add your live video and then we'll add
that you can tag it as well of course
then there's challenges is if we go
mobile on two cell phones nobody likes
typing a bunch of stuff on their cell
phones too so so yeah we're tackling
that kind of issue but yeah again it's a
critical mass thing that hopefully we
have have to deal with that in the
future yeah if you if you watched right
now so what's happening actually I can
go to this feed in here and you'll
actually notice let me just run this
little script again
so so there I am let me I couldn't even
zoom in a little closer here so you'll
notice this guy we are capturing heading
of this bra of this broadcaster as you
move around now right now I'm just
running a script on my phone to do that
but you know we do capture we using a
nmea compatible GPS devices so you get a
lot of information from that and this
little marker there does indicate the
direction that you're traveling so of
course when you're sitting still if
you've used GPS it'll kind of spin you
in a little circle sometimes but oh
where you're looking yeah that's a
difficult problem yeah that's always a
tough problem I don't think we're going
to solve that one anytime soon because
you'd have to have some kind of new
device that really can tell where you
are looking and I don't know of you know
we want to try to get to as many people
as possible and so mobile phones and
stuff aren't going to have something
that's integrated with the camera to
really figure that out I'm not really
sure but if you have ideas I'd love to
to hear how it might be able to solve
that problem maybe in the real world we
could have an algorithm that compares to
street view and then figures know which
way you're heading or which way are
looking
next shape was processing a lot of
criminal videos or yeah yeah the I think
yeah you can kind of see it there it's
even worse on the cell phones I don't
know if you guys have seen some of the
other companies that are doing the nokia
live broadcasting it can get kind of
worse and that's got the kind of like
sideways waviness too because of the way
it stripes the the video out so i think
in time technology is just really going
to start to get better and better and
you know the bandwidth is going to go up
hopefully soon in terms of wireless
bandwidth and that problem might just
solve itself rather than just by being
able to push more data rather than then
having algorithms to solve our problems
to resign
hang else all right thanks a lot</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
