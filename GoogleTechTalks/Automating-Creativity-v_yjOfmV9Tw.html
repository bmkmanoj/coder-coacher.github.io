subjects the first part is about
creative machines before there were
computers so machines that were made to
generate language or music or art work
and the techniques that people use to do
that and then in part two I'm going to
talk about some some new methods that
have become available with computers and
how we can go beyond the sort of things
that before shooting back then
especially my own research in combining
knowledge bases with digital semantic
vector spaces so the two houses of the
talker are quite different and I change
typefaces halfway through you can solve
any solution so in 1817 Sir David
Brewster invented the Kaleidoscope but
other people before that had noticed
that if you put two mirrors at an angle
that you can get the symmetric patterns
but he was the first one to build the
two kaleidoscopes that we understand and
it was a huge hit it became the fad of
London he wrote to his wife you can form
no conception of the effect would be an
instrument excited and landed all of
your thoughts infinitely short of the
reality no book no instrument in a
memory of man ever produced such a
singular fact there exhibited publicly
on the streets for a penny and I am the
pleasure of paying this some yesterday
these are about two feet long and a foot
wide infants are seen Kingdom in their
hands the coachman on their bosses are
busy using them and thousands of poor
people make their bread by making
himself when Brewster invented it he
intended it as a kind of labor-saving
device for artists not not as a toy
particularly and he he said there's
there's a few devices that can so easily
do what a person does but about a
thousand
that's faster so they were at the time
you know many artists were employed in
making symmetrical patterns for the
covers of books or to decorate to
decorate buildings and I think partly
because of the invention of the
kaleidoscope that making that kind of
parents fell out of favor but once
people realized that the process could
be automated to change ideas of what
made something but the kaleidoscope
forms a kind of pattern that we're gonna
see over and over again in the other
devices to start you first up you have
some beautiful elements maybe the beads
or colorful pieces of glass at the end
of the kaleidoscope
second you have some sort of rule for
combining them in this case the symmetry
of the mirrors and the third thing and
that rule imposes some order on it and
that we perceive the finished product is
beautiful because it follows these rules
has some sort of source of randomization
so these these different devices all
followed that same plan where they do
some randomization they have some order
they have some beautiful pieces that
they're really usually how the
climatescope is useful when we consider
that in this busy and thousands of
individuals are fully occupied with
composition of symmetrical designs and
there are especially any profession in
which these designs that enter it's a
necessary part so as to employ a portion
of the time of every artist we should
not hesitate in admitting the instrument
must have no small degree of utility
which will bridges the labor of so many
individuals there are few machines
indeed which was higher above the
operations of human skill they were
creating a single hour what a thousand
artists could not invent in the course
of the year and wow that works with such
unexampled rapidity it works also with a
corresponding beauty and precision this
is from Brewster's book about the
classical so the climatescope was an
early example but bye-bye
the earliest example we have of
generating generating new artwork new
ideas from rules is something that is
called Gino myosin so if you think about
what the very first computation device
was the first advice that somebody
created to help them to do mathematics
it was probably a box drawn on the
ground with his stick and some pebbles
and those pebbles and box form kind of
external memory where he was where the
person using the publiced was able to
keep track of numbers and other people
could verify that he wasn't cheating
when he says ok I'm taking this many
sheep and giving it to you and that idea
of representing concepts as as an
external representation probably gave
rise to the thought that this could
generate new ideas rather than simply
representing ideas that were already and
so it's for Juman see maybe you would
drive to drag a stick along the ground
and they would hop up and down randomly
as of Dolf and looking at the pattern
that it formed you would you would
recognize ok this this pattern is
populous this atom is fortuna minor and
from that you would put together a
fortune you would you would tell the
answer to a question that's asked now of
course the answer that business
generating has almost nothing to do with
the question that's it but for thousands
of years all throughout the Middle East
in Africa people were using these
techniques and and being satisfied with
it so it makes us we should be a little
bit wary when we make artificial
intelligence techniques that are
convincing to people
that's the definition of passing the
Turing test that that you can convince
people that this is up thinking being
because people were doing that in 2000
BC right convincing people that machine
was generating new ideas just just
convincing people maybe isn't enough for
actual cognition here's another version
of the device now built out of brass you
can see this inscription above the dial
those are the same patterns that we saw
before
and the inscription says I am the
revealer of Secrets so it's personifying
the machine and saying I I will tell you
the answer to your questions it really
shares a lot here's a new I'm another
device this one's called the Eureka and
this is a device for generating music so
then you become well in the 1830s and
for hundreds of years before that one of
the assignments that they would give to
school children was to create lines of
Latin poetry in the examiner that that
was used to mail you and so writing
these poems was something everybody was
familiar with and at some point in the
1600s that they published a technique
that you could use to automatically
generate as many of these as you could
you could always follow the same
grammatical structure for your six works
where you have adjective noun verb
adjective noun or something like that
and constraint of the meter would also
be imposed on those words so by picking
a word randomly from each of these lists
you could
cause a new line of poetry which was
both grammatically and metrically
correct and in 1830 John Clark built a
machine that would do that as it
generated these these lines of poetry
it would also play god save the queen'
on a music box and make a new
kaleidoscope image display so I put a
lot of effort and the 3d modeling
program Brice is that old ray tracer
like to make this this is an
illustration of how the interior of the
mechanism works so you have these
barrels one for each work and the height
of these pegs as it goes up and down
encodes the letters of the word that are
being spelled out and it'll spin around
randomly to a new new angle and then
these wedges drop down and depending on
the height the wedges are able to drop
to a greater or lesser distance and if
you deliberately did this to trick
people who are watching machine because
as you watch it instead of looking like
it's coming up with one word at a time
it looks like individual letters are
being are coming down one at a time that
it's spelling it by word and we have a
letter to the editor where he where he
defends his machines and no it's not
composing word by word it's using
mathematical techniques to make words up
letter by letter so here's the animation
you can see the Farrell's spin around
and it turns out it's actually playing
God Save the Queen but we have to turn
it off
inscribed on visits as eternal truths of
character sublime conceived in darkness
here so the unrolled the mystery of
number and of time is here displayed in
characters of God transcribed each line
composed by this machine record
fulfilling thoughts as their eyes align
once lost from there again be seen of
that one's phone perhaps forever flies
so the thought is that these the this
could generate new poems and if you
didn't write it down no one would ever
see that poem again William Thackeray
joking for punch magazine said several
double-barreled Eureka's were ordered
for eating heroin Rugby School so that
they could turn out as many of these
poems as they needed economist William
Hodgson wrote it is truly a curious
machine though I cannot say much for the
sense of the verses the inventors spent
fifteen years upon it five years more
than are needed to make a boy into a
person making machine that's still less
perfect Clarke is a strange simple
looking old man
Babbage said the other day uses greater
curiosity it's this machine this idea of
doing random recombination of terms was
was used earlier by Raymond Loewy in
1200 he wrote the ARS Magna the Hart's
Magnum was an attempt to generate new
arguments arguments for the existence of
God especially and in the book he has
these on paper dials that you can turn
the lab is like a Papa book and you can
prove well suppose somebody believes
that anything that is great in magnitude
is good and believes that anything that
is virtuous so by establishing a view of
these points that they already believe
you can then
prove that his other bags of must also
be too bad government so all these facts
are true about them and he convinced
himself that this was a really useful
tool and to go back the things he
believed and so why not to convert this
was well you've all seen wind chimes
wind chimes generate a kind of melody as
different notes on the left you have a
musical kite
celebrations in China as the moon goes
through these makes different tones here
in the large image shows a only part and
as the wind blows across the strings
bates incentive ibrid color image called
it a vast floating with tree himself a
really alien kind of sound and this was
referred to as romantics
the romantics a scientific instrument
that this was how many understood nature
creating artwork that each of us was up
and only part other time being animated
by the forces of nature and creating
here's his collar enjoyed and many
others living fantasies traversed by
indolent impassive brain as wild and
various is the random chaos swell and
what if all animated nature be but
organic hearts diversity frames there
trembling cop his organs plastic invest
one intellectual breeze at once the soul
of each and God of all also invested way
of generating music and in this Huey
liberalize to choose which from among
the tables of measures would be played
and then rolling it to the next
measures and you can actually use this
now to hear a voice or composition that
nobody else has ever heard before if you
want and along the same lines we have
the component by Deidre Winkle was an
inventor in Amsterdam in 1821 he was I
because I stayed at home all the time
but I was a big clever inventor and
another inventor at the same time his
name was Mansell was much more outgoing
and he would travel around Europe
showing off his inventions he bought a
Mechanical Turk which is a chess-playing
automaton supposedly but it's actually a
fraud someone's hiding inside operating
everything emails the theaters tinge to
this this frog he was as much a showman
that's it wasn't in that anyway he
visited link up at his house and said oh
I'm certain
and in goes our metronome then they've
invented which is this a metronome that
we used today and basil had also
invented a metronome but it wasn't it
wasn't nearly as good and so Winkle
minkos mentioned was probably stolen by
mail so he marketed all over Europe we
still have that meant no one else's
and a lot of all we know about Winkle is
from the lawsuit but he felt saying this
is my invention
anyway and another invention the one
that middle was most part of was the
admitted or Caspian a music box that
would fly from horns and drums and
flutes all playing at the same time an
orchestra automatically and Winkle
thought I think I can outdo that so what
he invented was very Pony and just like
missiles when you turn it on it would
play a tune
but then after it finished it would
start improvising on the gym and play a
new improvised based on the genitive
just like the way that it was able to do
this was these barrels here each
containing multiple versions of each
pair of measures and so it would play
through through that one version of the
measure and then had a random spinner
that would I got a loose a loose band
that went disengagement but it's been
randomly and then engage again and so I
could choose a different a different
tone for the next section of the song
and so he was able to do mel salinas
actually composing the music as it went
wrong it was very impressive to to the
people who went to go see it for
Schilling in London they said already in
mechanical sense has succeeded in
binding down dominance of genius and
carpet manufacturers and fancy workers
no longer consult the tastes of artists
but applied to the cleitus our musical
composers to be taught to take their
inspiration from such an instrument as
it's now exhibiting so these these are
all generative systems that they could
they come up with new material whether
sublime and in the 1800's they also
started to find ways of automating so
here we have a logical piano build by
Stanley Johnson comments you would input
something like a equals a B meaning that
a implies B and maybe a host a C so
nicely and then it would tell you all of
the possible combinations of maybe
Sandy's image those facts works
so you could have ABC and not B but you
can have a not being seated and John
Bing said well okay that's that's great
but you're missing most of the important
parts of solving logical problems first
you need to state your statement in the
language of data then you need to throw
those statements into a form fit for the
engine to work with third there's the
combination or further payment of our
premises after such production and
finally the results have to be
interpreted or read off so what he's
proposing here is making programming
languages and a compiler right the hard
part is interpreting the team lives
language and turning it into a farm data
computer space to work with in 1830 to
build something that I think people here
at Google especially appreciate it was
the first search engine he was a
policeman for the Russian police which
even in those times was a basket
bureaucracy and they collected
information on every person and he
invented a machine that would enable
them to search through all those records
to find someone who met certain
characteristics so what it did was it
had a holes punched out for all of the
times that were true about a person
maybe they're their hair color or their
eye color their age and so forth and
then it would run this this rotating set
of pins across each page and when the
pins were able to fall through all of
the holes at the same time the paper
would slip down over the pins and be
pulled out but otherwise it would not
catch on the paper and so he was able to
able to automatically select from this
set of untracked he'd open source the
dock
he showed it to the Russian Academy they
didn't care
today's him you got this remember offer
insomnia Pathak remedies and inventions
but he wrote machinist intellectuals
would limitlessly strengthen the power
of our thoughts as soon as distinguished
scientists through this process and
compose the tables necessary for its
application in various fields technology
so visual arts also the Japanese wanted
natural forms in their artwork on the
left drop Oriole oil paint on longer and
press a piece of paper across it and
messed up the pattern so the naturally
generated forms would like looks like we
drank and the raku pottery that the
difference temperatures a mixture of
glazed wood to create different patterns
that the artist didn't intend exactly
what it would look like he wanted the
natural processes to get to affect it
here's some similar examples jared
Tarbell created the program upper-left
with juices techniques similar to city
generation in games to play out these
patterns Tim knows taped markers to the
bottom of digging relevant as the wind
blows it makes random pebbles so all of
these machines they all share them same
source of randomness the source of order
and and they use the same technique
basically to read these pieces and so
today when people do generative art they
often visit the first thing that occurs
but we've got a lot more powerful
techniques that are available to us now
and hopefully we can come up with things
that exhibit more attributes of created
this is human technologies which was by
Kurtzman like you and when I was at NYU
I use this makeup image super resolution
algorithm basically what you do is
supply three images the photograph on
the upper-left painting version of it
and then the photograph we didn't want
to convert and it finds tiny patches of
the photograph and mapped as those
patches to similar matches in the lower
left and so copies the similar match
from the upper right to the lower right
and creates an image it also makes an
effort to print the patches that are to
match up at the edges so that it's
smooth similarly you can use you can
create it on the Left plan that you want
to go with the image and then create a
new blend and generate a new version
with the target
more recently something that's right
it's it's generated from patches of the
image on the upper right rearranged
according to the correspondence between
those images this is just working with
patches dungeons you know small events
learning where you got the effective on
the water you see this lighting effect
it's brighter at the top yeah let's go
do this without without the same three
three minutes where you're able to take
a correlation between features in a deep
neural network and use that to to create
an image and in the style of another
painting
so this is starting to learn from images
is starting to pick up elements of style
that we can't characterize exactly if
this is her Amy loop by bill McCarthy
pareidolia is the tendency to see faces
in clouds or tree stones here the system
randomly places triangles on top of each
other but it has a base recognizer of
get an image recognition system and when
it sees something that looks like the
face it keeps that and keeps working on
it we can swim back to the actual
attempt and tries to prove the quality
of the things detection so this is
feedback effect where where you're able
to observe while you're creating and
modify it to make it look more like what
you are trying to imagine that's an
important part of creativity which a
friend of mine at work gives some of the
tools that people that have heard and
generated this from the image on the
lower right it it elucidated is image on
the upper left you see there's a lot of
dogs faces in there that's because the
training set contains far too many
pictures of dogs but again with the deep
dream software it looks at the image and
it tries to recognize and when it pulls
up an object is being recognized and it
enhances whatever it's awesome to be
seen to so bring out the images that are
implicitly but all of these systems they
don't add some of the things that we
really want our artists to do they don't
they don't seem to understand what they
do
and understanding you know it's a loaded
word but as a teacher as a school
teacher we had pretty specific tests to
know what ersten was understanding
something if they could summarize
whether it's in they could interpret it
compare two versions of it answer
questions about it or integrated with
other knowledge that they have then that
show that the student kind of
understanding of the concept rather than
just rote memorization so that is the
sort of thing that I'm trying to build
into the system I'm going to describe
the ability to exhibit these attributes
and understand so knowledge base is one
way that people try to encode understand
that every object exists in that this
knowledge graph and has labeled links to
other objects in the graph so an
automobile is a type of road vehicle
which is a type of transportation device
and then it's other things like the
orange link have other meanings like an
automobile is bounding the garage door
so you have these ontology name
relations between the content and and
then an engine for performing deductive
reasoning on these facts so knowledge
bases were going to be artificial
intelligence all through the 80s but
eventually people realized that they had
some pretty significant for us so one of
the things is you need to encode
everything that you want to say in the
language that knowledge base understand
this is an example of saying um thermos
is capable liquid so you can ask the
question what is a big turn thermos you
can also use other logical connectives
so what is capable of holding the liquid
and it's not a container
and for my pizzas I built a system which
took seams and used scene labeling
techniques to recognize when all the
objects were in the image and then
constructed a reading back loop of the
things that were embassy and then places
assertions in the knowledge base about
what objects were back so saying things
like there there's a there's a tree in
the image the tree is next so built and
then there were fast in the knowledge
base good reason about these so you
could ask a question like is there
anything breakable in it and it would
say well there is a car in the image and
cars always have windows and witness it
made of glass and glass it's breathable
so yes there is something break for you
you are able to ask questions about
Deborah beans um which made me think
about how children are created creating
artwork themselves so here we have on
the upper right of the sort that my
program was able to recognize and on the
other sections of the image you can see
children's drawings of what they see in
this picture these are the youngest
children four-year-olds and what you'll
notice if you look at this is that that
one of the children are drawing has
almost nothing to do with what you see
in the image in terms of the layout of
the shape instead we've recognized
objects image and they the script that
they have in our head for how do
problems objects so this kind of know
how to draw a building a building is a
rectangle with a triangle on top of it
with the door in it and so they use that
to represent the bill on the road with
its markings is not drawn from the
perspective you're actually seeing an
image but it's turn some of its the way
that you could have
um all the children begin to incorporate
anyway she knew she knew there were four
round and so if you had to draw those
four wheels but there was no way
depending on the way she finds so
they're just randomly sticking off the
sides of the project the building was
here on the right he noticed that there
was supposed to be perpendicular to to
the road but in two dimensions how is
that perpendicular supposed to go so the
point behind us is that these children
are are not drawing when they see
they're seeing something they are
understanding it represent leave this
concepts and then creating those
concepts on the paper now older children
the 10 and 11 year olds began to be able
to use perspective but still are making
mistakes based on what they have
preconceived so it would look at the
image on the left create the scene label
and you see in the center and then say
okay this green area that's building so
I'm going to place some template
drawings of buildings and the sea this
is a road in purple and it's a very very
simple way of making but the nice thing
about it was it could answer these
one is on the left whether the building
has made up what are some of the parts
of buildings what lives in trees
summarize the scene these are the sorts
of things that you could post about like
I said there's some big problems with
know if they're created by hand rather
than from big data
so they take enormous amounts of Labor
and it's hard to know they're always
incomplete
they don't use natural language they
can't handle spatial reasoning very well
so these are some reasons that that
knowledgebase it's never really took off
but in the last few years
cementec vector spaces have started to
be used in those have a great deal of
information containing and invisible so
you can see this is a projection into
three dimensions 300 dimensional vector
spaces are words and words that are
similar there are close together in
space so there's clumps of words that
that have similar meanings is another
example projected into five dimensions
with color and size of the dots you can
see a lot of structure but besides this
structure similar words being grouped
together there's some really amazing
properties left you can see though
man/woman uncle and some interesting
thing about this vector space is that
words which are analogous to each other
are related with a geometric structure
there's a parallelogram between them so
that if you take the vector from man to
woman and you
quiet to the word uncle at the end of
the vectors can be very close to the
word and this works for all kinds of
different all kinds of different
relationships between words so singular
to plural different forms of the verb
exhibit is parallel structure the
relationship between different countries
and their capitals are all approximately
you can add together terms together
which is the combination of two so track
blisterin c gives you some terms which
are similar to check currency the
capital of Vietnam determine Airlines
and this this parallel property lets you
solve these analogy so Paris - France
Italy equals wrong approximately it's
the narrative you're able to find in the
semantic space the purpose of like all
of the New York Times data for to train
to train this within new techniques that
they developed it so it was incremental
updates right so this idea of doing
analogies it seems kind of like well
that's a useful trick if you're trying
to solve SAT problems but but not so
much in the real world but it don't miss
Hofstetter has been several books a
little bit of intellect robot but mostly
his later books about how analogy is
really the central idea in cognitive
that when we understand something when
we see something new we always
understand it by analogy with things
that we've experienced
and that this flexibility of
understanding concepts by analogy really
is what makes people able to form poetic
connections to to understand situations
which aren't precisely encoded by five
rules that we are in son here's a nice
each concept in our minds owes its
existence to a long succession of
analogies made unconsciously over many
years initially giving birth to the
concept and continuing to enrich over
the course of our lifetime furthermore
at every moment of our lives our
concepts are selectively triggered by
analogies that are framed minutes
without let-up in an effort to make
sense of the new and unknown in terms of
holding on the human ability to make an
analogy sighs at the root of all our
concepts concepts are selectively both
by analogies in a more traditional the
analogy is the fuel and fire of thinking
an analogy in the original meaning of
the word is proportion the proportion
they're talking about is something like
3 is to 4 as 6 is to 8 I did that those
numbers have the same relationship I
think the the quantity that's trying to
be optimized as you build were Tyvek is
similarly that that kind of a
relationship where the probability of
finding a particular word in the context
of king divided by the ability finder
networking the contents of queen is
approximately the same as the
probability of finding it in context of
context and following through this
mathematics you can see that this is
equivalent to the function that they're
actually trying to minimize as they
create this this vector space one of the
interesting things about these vector
spaces is that many of the operations
you can think of doing them on them
we're giving the same results so if you
can't do that or you take average
factors where you take the average of
them and you multiply it by something
some important you'll still get the same
results if you take the element wise in
maximum or they'll make wise minimum
either one is still going to give you
something that has attributes of both of
the terms that you're a burden because
some of the elements of the vector will
come from the first page of opinion and
some will come from the second battery
opening and so it's very robust to to
these different operations that you do
our vector is somehow composed of the
meanings of the vectors that going taste
so this can actually be used for
creating poetry hopefully not lose sense
for to create these I took I took list
of adjectives they started with a list
of nouns that started with a and took
every possible combination of those and
put it into the vector space and then i
put in the word on the left as my input
and I said find the nearest neighbors of
this so what you're seeing is the
nearest neighbor to the word robot in
the factory space probably were only a
Edwards so a robot is an anthropomorphic
automaton songbird is an arboreal artist
storybook amazing adventure look at the
word goodbye antagonistic aromatic so
it's combining both meanings of the word
divided here I did it's somehow captures
some of the concept of the word divide
and is using a poetic play on words to
represent it there's some some more of
the same using chemistry terms so
chemistry is academic alchemy chemists
are atomic astronomers that worked me on
amber ambiance you know neon if you
collect to see so it doesn't actually
glow amber but our idea of a neon sign
is what's captured in the newspaper text
about neon so that's the kind of thing
that that shows up these were I'll say
there are among the top five results
that come back I'm not sure that they're
all the very top but I didn't need to go
through and select the best here some
movie reviews so i put in the word Lost
Ark and it came up and said what is the
nearest noun to the Lost Ark there's
very common now and the most common now
to keep up with this movie and then I
said what if you haven't to do together
with the worth looking would be closest
to the lost it said practical movie so
if you keep going in fizzes the article
archaeologist adventurer screwball
comedies slot for Crystal Skull from
Marion Ravenwood whip cracking movie
that's its description of the Lost Ark
as you keep following this process at
star wars the prequel trilogy science
fiction lightsabers 20 lines flowers not
complete will decide by lightsabers
so some concept that we have for these
movies is encoded in the vector
represent another thing that I attempted
with this was to make these dimensions
meaningful so those 300 dimensions if
you try to ask what does this dimension
represent it's nonsense it doesn't it's
not close to any cluster of words but
you can reproject this vector space into
whatever bases you want so you can
choose the vectors that you want to be
the phases of this so that each of them
is meaningful
say say it said adjectives and more
intense as the two ends of each vector
and as long as you guarantee that that
the vectors you're choosing are
approximately orthogonal and throughout
the ones that there are two parallel to
something else and adjust the rest of
they're actually or thought of you can
be projecting to this new basis and have
the individual elements of the vector
space
represent something the meaning of and
when you do that you get something like
a thing explain our traditional Monroe
where you can define a term in terms of
maybe the 300 simplest English words
that would that would explain that term
right there the more activated this each
element of the vector is the more that
word is would show up in the definition
so here's how you can use that semantic
vector space together with your
knowledge base to get out new ideas that
are contained in this here's a kind of
metaphorical drawing where you have you
have a knowledge base and it's got a few
of you cities a few stops and you know
always you can get from this stop to
that stop but it's it's and it is
missing many of the places you'd want to
go online on the right you have a
handmade map and that has many many more
terms in it but it's more approximate
your abacus and you you can't be be
absolutely sure that everything is
accurate on so this program that I've
written called displacer uses both of
these methods that knowledge base and
has mended vector space to enable you to
get from any spot in the vector space by
use of the knowledge base to what you
want to go and get some examples so in
the site knowledge base we've got many
concepts represented and relationships
between but nowhere near as many as we
would like to have as many represent in
the center we have two English
and on the right that better days so the
question I'm going to ask is what are
those parts of a backhoe in the
knowledge base we don't have that
information it has the parts of many
machines represented but it does it has
the term but that's all so back and
converting using word the back to
digital did three hundred dimensional
registers and find the nearest neighbors
to so the nippers or shovel and then
take those back into English and firming
look into the knowledgebase notice has
no stuff what English terms correspond
to each costing at Nauticus and then you
ask the question physical parts of these
objects are black and it comes up with
engines are parts of dump trucks wheels
immersive contrast the shuttle blades
are parts of shovel it doesn't come up
with any answers for backup because it
doesn't have any of that information
then it maps that back into English and
then into the vector space and now we
have a better engine wheel and blade and
now people to do that acknowledge we
have the vectors for the objects are the
machines and we have the mattress for
the parts and so we're able to say what
on a backhoe corresponds to the blade of
a shovel and the answer thumbs up with
is the excavator well you can't see that
it's in them at the faces but what on a
backhoe corresponds to the wheels of the
truck it says the tracks correspond so
by forming these analogies we're able to
find facts about the world that were
never enter entered by hand into and
we're able to do that act query time so
when we have a query we go out and we
say what are those similar terms what
are the answers we can find about those
similar terms and then how can we find
the m11 different answer what we're
actually
and 200 and in the knowledge base
it has famous people 37 female but using
displacement we're able to correct
recognize the gender of 90% of the necks
and it might even be higher than 90%
because sometimes also we only used us
going so it might be another thing that
we can do is estimate the probability
that the analogical guesses are correct
so we're able to to say what is the
capital city of the country and and for
some of those we have something l what
the answer is so we say when we're
trying to estimate this based on the
capital cities of other countries how
accurate is our result and then we can
apply that probability to another
actually so one of the facts that had
the knowledge base was that it didn't
come was that Berlin was the capital of
Germany because sank is such a non
project
it was still West Germany mister but it
was able to correctly estimate the
Berlin is the capital of Germany because
it was able to form these analogies from
others one thing you'll notice from this
list and you know nobody's ever tried to
optimize this so don't think too much
attention to how how about these
qualities but animal-type makes on time
like cows has moved accessible this sort
of thing it did terrible at because
that's not information that shows up in
the newspaper very often also a
surprising result was I wanted to see
how how many tables would need to
average to find its and interesting
thing is that there's the the lowest
distance from the trim that answered the
best estimate comes from very few nearby
neighbors if you average the four or
five noisy neighbors results you get the
best estimate of the trends as you go
out further the analogies are more
stretched less less similar and so you
start losing information so that means
there's less computation it can be done
faster that's just nice this is a new
system and I think well maple is to do
many of the things that we want to do
with knowledge bases but to do it to do
it even in cases where the knowledge
base is incomplete this is my book if
you're interested in the first half of
the talk get that book on Amazon the two
papers listed here the top one is coming
out this November which is talking about
displacer the program I described at the
end and the my thesis so that concludes
my talk if anybody has any questions
there's a meeting of three in here so my
pitch is over
Thanks
