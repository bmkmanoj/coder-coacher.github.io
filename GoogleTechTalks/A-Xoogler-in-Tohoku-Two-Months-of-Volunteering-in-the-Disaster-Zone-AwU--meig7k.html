Avantia prefecture on Monday night so I
haven't had a whole lot of time to
prepare for this if it's a little
confusing or not as cohesive or
comprehensible as it should be I'm sorry
so let's go as none asana introduced i
was at Google for actually I was only at
Google for about half a year in mountain
view before that i was at yahoo in
sunnyvale for about three and a half
years and i was on the google map so as
on though what was called that japan
product focused team working
specifically on google maps and a little
bit in local search but i didn't
actually do a whole lot because i was
only here for about half a year and i'm
here today to talk about my experiences
in the disaster zone as many of you
probably know that tsunami occurred on
311 but my story actually goes back to
march eleventh two thousand nine as fate
would have it March eleventh two
thousand nine was the day I left Google
that was my last day at Google and I
left because I kind of wanted to
experience life outside the office I had
been in Silicon Valley for four years
and I was starting get tired of staring
at the computer screen all day every day
all night so so I hit the open road so
to speak this is a picture that I took
in Nebraska which i think is a beautiful
place there's not much there and
eventually sorry to backtrack a little
bit i want to tell the story of how I
got to where I am because I think of it
as one journey so bear with me this
isn't you know this isn't you ought a
Prefecture later that year I ended up
buying 60 acres of land which is
something I always wanted to do this is
in Northern California and then I
started building a little little Hut
called Hut 1 point 0 because I'm not
very imaginative this is really tiny I'd
never built a structure before and this
was a custom design that I sketched
together it's only six feet
eight feet so it's about two meters by
two and a half meters very very small no
finished pretty quickly it's my little
kitchen is pretty comfortable I had my
own little solar setup because my
property didn't have any electricity at
all I did a little gardening garden one
point O had mixed results that's corn it
which grew okay but I had no water which
is which makes things difficult this is
my water tower for irrigating my garden
since you need a you need water pressure
for irrigation to work and if you don't
if you're not connected to the City
water system the only gay to get way to
get pressured is to lift your water up
and so I built this little water tower
which kind of worked the problem with
Hut 1 point 0 was it had absolutely no
insulation and even though I'm in
California I'm at 4,200 feet elevation
that's about 1400 meters so in the
winter it goes down to as cold as minus
10 degrees Fahrenheit it's probably
minus 20 25 degrees centigrade so it
gets very cold so of course if one point
no it's not good enough you upgrade a
two point oh that's the actual google
sketchup the snapshot of google sketchup
document that i used to do the design
again I have absolutely no architecture
background or anything but you know when
your software engineer doesn't matter
right you just you just build it and if
one point no doesn't work you build two
point oh and if two point Otis and where
you build three point oh next thing you
know well anyways so I got some friends
and we started building it this is you
know it's what we call the raising
literally raising it from the ground up
and my friends were only there for a
weekend so I did the rest of the work on
my own which took a while i was hoping
to get it done before winter but it
snowed before i even had the walls up
but I just kept working on it a little
bit at a time it's me working inside and
by January of the
here I got it to a point where looked
mostly like a home the shiny material on
the outside is insulation in that shiny
thing that you see sticking up is the
chimney that's hooked up to a wood stove
so this winter I knew I wouldn't freeze
because i had insulation and a stove
this is the kitchen inside that black
pipe is actually the chimney there's a
wood stove underneath and the stove pipe
is coming up so it's quite warm I have
my own little desk and I got a mifi
device so i could get online even though
i'm in the middle of nowhere verizon in
the US has 3g coverage and there's no
one else around using the network so
it's really really fast i got about 2.2
kilobits per second and i can actually
watch i can actually stream video the
problem is the mifi plan only comes with
3 gigabytes per month of bandwidth so
you know it's fast enough to watch
videos but I don't have enough bandwidth
and yeah so by februari I called it home
and it was it was actually quite
comfortable but I was also starting to
think about what to do next and that
brings us to march on march 11th i was
actually in the middle of what I called
Project 31 and the goal of project 31
was to spend an entire month 31 days on
my property without leaving so and you
know not using and there are some other
goals that I decided not to burn a drop
of gasoline to only use electricity that
can generate from my solar panels to
only use water that could collect on my
property so that's basically snowmelt in
rainwater and to go in with 31 days of
food so I didn't go grocery shopping or
anything and I was in the middle of that
when March 11th happened and that gave
me an interesting perspective because
obviously on March 11th in the areas
that were heavily affected they lost
everything they lost all infrastructure
namely and I was already living without
infrastructure so in a sense I felt sort
of a connection to the people who are
affected but also it was a connection in
the sense of well I'm living in a
obviously it had a roof over my head I
hadn't lost me family members but in a
sense I was living in a physically
somewhat similar situation it was cold
on my property as cold as it gets in
until Hoku and you know I had since I
started with a lot of food and my food
supplies were starting to run short I
was kind of short on food as well so I
felt a certain kindred but I also felt
like I could do something like I had
experienced something similar that I can
that perhaps I could come in and because
I knew how to live in an environment
that had no infrastructure that I could
do something so basically what it comes
down to you if you have a lot of time
like i do i'm unemployed or funny
employed as we call it and i had certain
skills you know i had a SD japanese in
english i have some carpentry experience
sucking buildings I know how to live in
a place where there's no water or power
I know how to set up solar panels and
stuff like that so it seemed like I had
a set of skills that had developed over
well over most of my lifetime but
especially in the last two years that
were relevant to the situation so I
decided to go volunteer the hard part is
finding a volunteer organization that
will accept you fortunately last year
had come across this organization called
All Hands volunteers I found them last
year after the Haiti earthquake because
I wanted to see if I could go volunteer
and about the only organization credible
organization that accepts unskilled on
experienced volunteers was all hands
back then they were called hands on
disaster relief but now they're called
All Hands I won't talk too much about
them if you want to learn more go to
their website unfortunately they're
Japanese website is still in progress
but the main way they operate is that
the organization provides food and
shelter and in return that volunteers
provide labor this is very different to
most other organizations which I won't
name that require sort of participation
fees and often expensive fees to go
volunteer often you know some of them
will charge up to two thousand dollars
two hundred thousand yen ignoring
exchange rates to go and volunteer and
participate and in that is fundamentally
different because when you have your
volunteers pay to go they are also your
donors and customers versus when they
don't pay they're just volunteers
they're there to work and so there's
less of kind of this conflict there's
less can during All Hands volunteers
work very hard and if you don't work
hard they ask you to go home and they
can do that because well you didn't give
them anything or at least you didn't
give the organization anything you give
your labor to the people who eat it so
they provide shelter and food but that's
not as nice as it sounds this is one of
our bases in North not tell it is a it
is um sort of a rehab center that is
also that was also opened up as a
evacuated center and if you could tell
everyone gets literally enough space for
a sleeping sleeping bag so you know
there's very very little space everyone
sleeps in sleeping bags pretty much and
some people do this for weeks and weeks
and weeks and as for food the dinner
budget is 200 yen per person which is
not much at all I actually had to cook
for people on one of the projects and
it's pretty challenging to come up with
with a meal that is substantial enough
to feed you know hungry
workers but also healthy and nutritious
for 200 younger person but but we manage
and sometimes there isn't enough food
and we go hungry but I'm going to talk a
little bit about the actual work we did
I'll just kind of blaze through it and
then they want to try and leave as much
time as possible to questions at the end
we initially started off with a lot of
debris removal and this is sort of a
before and after picture this was a dry
cleaners and this was and this
particular room was only about maybe 2-3
hours worth of work and then you know so
you get a sense for how quickly manual
labor can get through this kind of thing
and the reason we do this by hand
obviously is because you can't do it by
machinery for debris that's outside the
city hires dozens and dozens of heavy
machinery to come and pick it up and put
it in dump trucks but as for anything
that's inside the city doesn't do it
it's up to the individuals and business
owners to do it and obviously it's a
daunting task if you were faced with
something that looks you know it's
what's on the on the left you know you
probably know wouldn't know where to
start but when you have five six people
you know it goes pretty quickly this is
another example this was debris on the
outside but it was kind of a tight spot
and there's farmland around so we
decided that it was probably better to
do it by hand another project we started
fairly soon that I helped coordinate was
to clean up a school obviously public
you know working in individuals homes is
great but when you work on public
projects you can potentially effect or
impact more people and this is that this
is one of the campuses of Takata high
school in because aunt Agatha and the
school was hit pretty hard and they
decided that they weren't going to use
the school as a school anymore but
we talked to them and said well what if
we cleaned it up and and they said well
if you clean it up we'll probably use it
for instance at the time a lot of
gymnasiums thi khong in in elementary
schools that were being used as schools
were being used as storage depots so you
know these kids would go to school and
their gym would just be filled with
boxes and so they won't have anywhere to
have their there you know to run around
or play basketball or whatever they
would normally do so our idea was if we
clean this school up that or the gym in
this school up they can move the
supplies to this school so that you know
in schools where there are actual
students they can use their gymnasium
for what they're intended for ya so this
particular school they got water up to
probably yay high and that's that's all
in mud yeah and this is this is a the
mud zedler anywhere they got where there
was flooding the tsunami left mud behind
or sand and oftentimes with it there
would be debris dead fish and so on so
forth and this is one the classrooms and
so before and after picture it looks
like it's one big picture but you know
on the left is that before on the right
is after and as you can see you know we
got it pretty clean this is one of the
hallways another job that we started
doing because in Ofunato there wasn't
there were relatively few debris jobs
left as an people had already done a lot
of the debris removal themselves and the
next step in the recovery process is to
rehabilitate the homes and the first
thing you have to do or one of the
things you want to do is to take up the
floorboards and wash them and clean out
the space underneath the floors and this
is normally work that this is work that
would normally be done by carpenters but
the reality is that the carpenters are
overwhelmed there just isn't enough
carpenterie skill to go to every home
that was affected and do this work and
we don't want to take work away from
carpenters so we work very closely with
them and make sure that we're helping
the Carpenters instead of taking jobs
away from them and we also wanted to
make sure we did it right we didn't want
to go in and create more work for the
carpenters who might come in and do the
actual repairs so we worked with one of
the local Carpenter's and he taught us
how to do it and then we continue to do
it or at least try to continue to do it
that way and so here you can see Jim and
Jen two volunteers pulling out nails we
pull out each individual now so that we
can pop up the boards without breaking
them another problem is there aren't a
whole lot of building supplies so even
if they wanted to replace the boards
they may not be available so in many
cases we would try to reuse the boards
so that I could clean it and put it back
in and not spend more money on buying
new boards and then there's usually a
little bit of cutting involved and then
here you can see the many layers from
the back you can see that there are
still boards and then underneath that
there's insulation boards on top of the
insulation boards they can see brown
layer of salt or sand then underneath
that is what we call the crawl space and
that is also filled with mud and does
this work okay yeah so here you can see
the floorboards and then here you can
see the insulation panels and then
underneath that is what we call the
crawl space the insulation well there
are different kinds of insulation one
fairly common type is what's called
fiberglass insulation and it's basically
like a sponge and so it absorbs a lot of
water very easily and retains it it
doesn't dry we're still pulling up wet
insulation three months later because
you know what's underneath the
floorboards it just doesn't dry and it's
starting to smell bad wet an insulation
also just doesn't work well as an
insulation so we have to pull all that
up and of course this is dirty work and
stinky
work that a lot of carpenters don't want
to do anyways so they're happy to let us
do it as well and then once all the
floor boards that are up you know we
kind of clean it up and that's kind of
how it looks incidentally this is a
traditional Japanese home the way it's
built there are many floor beams and
many floor joists it uses a lot of wood
and most traditional Japanese homes or
what's called zydeco ho it uses the
traditional Japanese method those homes
actually did remarkably well there's one
house that was flooded up to the second
it's a two-story house and the tsunami
came up to the second floor roof but the
house is still standing I mean when you
think about the forces that are applied
in that situation it's just it's
incredible on the other hand some of the
newer methods don't work quite as well
this is uses a strange variant of
certain American to by construction
method and you can see that the floor is
caved in and we saw this a lot and in
these cases we have to take off the
floorboards and then cut off the entire
floor section and get it back down to
just dirt so they could come in and
rebuild and then once we're done with
the floors someone used to go in and
clean up the all the mud that's
underneath mud and often debt fish or
now it's usually dead and rotten and
maggot infested fish which isn't very
pleasant and the only way to do that is
really to crawl underneath and this is
also work that as far as I know no one
else is doing except for individual
homeowners the volunteer centers don't
send people to do this because it's
dangerous potentially and also very
dirty work that obviously not everyone
wants to do the carpenters don't want to
do it and I've had carpenters tell me
that they couldn't find anyone to do it
even if they were paid but we have
volunteers who are crazy enough to jump
in there and and some of them enjoy the
work some of them just won't come out
but you know it's it's it's that's the
great thing about about this so here's
another guy thought this guy is he is
two meters and three centimeters tall
and he was having a good time here's
another guy who lock under the floors
often times in Japanese homes there are
these access hatches and when the
tsunami came in the hatches often got
blown off in stuff gotten underneath in
this particular hell is a large block of
salmon from a nearby Factory got into
the crawlspace and the homeowners got
some of it out but we didn't get the
last of it and that until we remove the
floorboards and fortunately in this
house the fish were underneath the
floorboards so you know once we had the
floorboards up we could just shovel it
out but if it were under a hallway or
under you know an area where we can't
take off the floors someone would have
had to go in and crawl underneath and
sort of shovel it out so it's pretty
nasty org and then you know after we do
the floors and are you the fluorescent
or actually before we also need to do
the walls there's insulation again
fiberglass in in the walls it's still
wet it's still nasty and if the moisture
stays in the walls they can start to rot
the wood or cause mold which is which
could be bad for your health and the
rock could also damage the home further
and also if there's drywall it if it
gets wet it's not usable anymore so they
need to replace it anyways so we spend a
lot of time removing drywall and once
the walls are off this is kind of what
it looks like those big x's by the way
are fairly unique I think to Japanese
construction you don't see that in the
u.s. a whole lot but that is precisely
why most of the structures withstood the
earth
like you know because before the tsunami
there was a magnitude 9 10 earthquake
which is the fourth largest in recorded
history and the one thing that's really
striking when you go to the disaster
area is that most of the homes look
perfectly fine there's basically no
earthquake damage it was all tsunami
damage but in if the same scale
earthquake were to happen in California
the results would be a lot more
catastrophic and I used to live in San
Francisco so it's something I used to
think about a lot so yeah walls come off
whichever way you can and it's kind of
nice because once you've done the walls
and you can start to kind of see through
these homes and it's done right the
homes start to look like as if they're
under construction and not homes are
damaged and that's kind of what we want
to do because we want a carpenter to
come in and start to rebuild immediately
because we've done all the cleanup and I
think it's also good for the homeowners
because you know instead of seeing what
that tsunami did they can sort of start
to see forward right they can say oh
this is a home that could be rebuilt and
you know that's that's very rewarding
work yes and this is not wallpaper it's
mold we saw a lot of that and then we
also work pretty closely with the city
this is again in open auto and they've
asked us to clean out drainage ditches
and canals which are filled with with
debris and muck and it is it's actually
not just aesthetics it's not just to
make it look nice as the rate you know
it's almost the rainy season there and
when it starts to rain and the water
can't drain it's going to cause flooding
so you know it's really important for
the drainage ditches and canals to be
cleared and this is work that the city
of the city's construction department
had requested to volunteer center in
open auto but the Volunteer Center
couldn't quite produce the
the people required to do it so they
came to us and said hey guys can you do
this and we said sure and so basically
every day now we have at least eight to
12 people you know working in the canals
and again that you know these are often
too narrow to be done by hand or by
machinery just so or to be done by heavy
machinery so it has to be done by hand
and you know you can do a really good
job by hand is another example looks
pretty good and then eventually we
started saying what why stay in Ofunato
you know there's the whole coast was
affected and why can't we go somewhere
else and and the reason why it's
difficult to go somewhere else is
because it's actually very difficult for
an organization like all hands to
foreign organization to go into
community and start doing work i'll talk
a little bit more about that later but
so there's a lot of sort of upfront
costs and a lot of friction in doing
that and also they just need you know
staff member and stuff like that and it
becomes logistical II challenging but
all hands in the past has done what they
call satellite projects where they send
a small team to different communities a
sort of far away from the main main
operation and in our case we went to
llamada which is located about 60
kilometers north of open auto it's in
you ought a in llamada forgot to get
them something like half of the more
according to to to the city officials
more than half the homes in the town
we're just more than half the buildings
in the town were destroyed destroyed or
damaged and like in Kesennuma llamada
had not just the tsunami but also fire
afterwards that burnt on for about 24
hours and this is what the downtown area
looks like
it's absolutely devastated and it's also
you know it's a small town and so they
don't really have the they're not as
famous as places like Oakland authority
because then toccata or comma IE she so
my impression was that they didn't
receive quite as much support and so it
seemed like a good place for us to go
and and we were made some introductions
so I took a team of between 8-12 people
up there because the living conditions
were pretty crude the I had to stay the
whole time but the other volunteers
rotated in on four to five day rotations
and you could see a little bit of the
destruction in the background basically
that used to be there used to be a
seawall I went all the way across and
snow longer there it's my one action
photo and we were working with a Shinto
shaman and this is one of the shrines
that he he oversees and this became our
campsite the shaman is on the right he's
a chain smoker but he's like 87 years
old and still pretty healthy so yeah and
the conditions were pretty you know it
was basically like a camping trip we
were doing all the normal work that we
do we were gutting that is doing the
floors and walls in the shamans house
and then we're also helping remove
debris from one of the shrines but you
know at the end of the day instead of
going home to a nice warm shelter we
went back to tense some of them leaked
when it rained but it was also kind of
fun because we had a campfire and you
had to cook our own meals and the worst
job was at the fish factory so a lot of
the coastal towns obviously you know
have big fishing industries and so you
know they have a lot of fishermen but
also factories that process the fish
sort of canneries so they would smoke
the fish or cook
stuff eminent cans and and obviously
they're right on the coast someone that
tsunami hit all the fish got washed out
of whatever containers they were in and
scattered about we were finding fish
like clumps of fish maybe you know two
kilometers inland now that were just
washed in but it was obviously the worst
at the factory itself and for some
reason well they couldn't dispose of the
fish because at first they were trying
to bury it in the ground but then they
ran out of space to bury the fish that's
how much fish there was and they wanted
to dump it in the ocean but that would
have been illegal and it took a while I
think for the government to kind of
authorized you know a disposal method
and ultimately now they're dumping it in
the ocean but they need to make sure
that it's two separate fish from
non-fish you know because fish it's fine
but there's also plastic cardboard stuff
like that in there and again this is a
job for for humans with hands I was
there on Monday morning and I had to
throw away all the clothes I was wearing
and when I got back to base I stepped
into the office and everyone started
yelling at me to get out because I
smelled so bad and i know i had to sudan
too so it's not like i was touching the
actual stuff but that's how bad it
smelled and it is a lot of fish
everything in this picture that's brown
is fish you know so and it's about and
you know maybe about 30 to 50
centimeters deep it's been sitting there
for three months now so it's obviously
rotten if oh I'm sorry you guys are
having lunch next
but you know this is what it is so
there's no other it's infested with
maggots the really scary thing is the
maggots are also dead I don't know what
kills maggots because they're pretty
Hardy but but there would be a lot of
dead fish and a lot of dead maggots and
a lot of living magnets so so yeah it
was it was pretty gross and you know you
kind of just have to go in there these
the guy in the orange suit on the left
is Satoshi he's actually the
representative or the VG Cho of the
Japanese legal entity so he doesn't have
to be out there but now it's this is
kind of what he does and then the guy on
the on the right Chris he's a longtime
volunteer he showed up I think a couple
of weeks in and he's staying there for
as long as necessary so he's there for
three four months doing essentially this
kind of work every day and I have a lot
of respect for them because frankly I
can't I can't do that every day here and
you can see sort of the actual work here
where they're pulling out plastic and
it's you know slippery and slimy and
stinky these are actually local
employees I think but the reason we got
called in was because they couldn't they
were willing to pay people to do it but
they just couldn't get people to do it
and at the end we said okay we'll do it
and you don't have to pay us but you
know maybe you could do some favors for
us some other way so yeah everyone who
works all of our volunteers who work on
this site you know obviously we don't
get paid the organization doesn't get
paid but but again it's really rewarding
because you can smell this fish from the
other side of town we lived maybe you
know three or four kilometers away from
this plant and we can smell it and wait
if the wind blows just right so it's
stinking up the whole city and you know
it's it's it's it's good to actually
make it go away
you know like ofunato is not supposed to
smell like rotten fish um okay so that
was sort of the work to a time check
real quick okay I want to talk a little
bit about sort of the challenges that we
faced especially as a foreign volunteer
organization the biggest challenge was
earning trust that you know the Tohoku
region itself is known for being
isolated and in Japanese we say doneesha
DISA do you know they're they're very
reticent when it been in contact with
foreigners in and on my second day on
the project i went to evacuation centers
and talked to you know individual
evacuees and said is there anything we
can do to help and some of them won't
even talk to us so then we'll just sort
of scoot away and look at us
suspiciously and there is a reason to
that to some degree there were a lot of
organizations you know in the weeks
after the volunteer after that tsunami
and not all of them had good intentions
or all of them had ulterior motives you
know some of them were religious
organizations and also the you know
apparently I don't know about this time
but after the kobe earthquake apparently
there were organizations that claim to
be volunteers but then you know set
goals later on so people were people
were really reluctant to accept our
assistance it was also difficult to
establish a good cultural understanding
within all hands the organization they
had all there it's a new organization
they started after the the indian ocean
tsunami this matra Coast tsunami and
they've only worked in places like
Indonesia or Haiti you know these are a
third-world sort of developing countries
where there's very little infrastructure
the government isn't nearly as competent
as it is here and so they were able to
just go
and do whatever they wanted because the
helpless simply needed but in Japan
that's not really the case the
government is very much intact and even
though they are criticized they think
you know did a lot and also most
communities still had the skills and the
and the expertise to do a lot of the
work that we were doing on their own so
it wasn't so much that we were needed it
was more that if we could help things
might go a little faster and it was a in
and also i think in japan you have to be
a little bit more careful about your
presentation about how you appear so you
know when we're doing gutting work that
is when we're going into individual
homes in removing drywall if you worry
just about the end results you might go
in with a sledgehammer and start
swinging it around but obviously you
know that's not going to it's not going
to fly in japan if it looks like what
you're doing is careless or you know if
it looks dangerous people will become
reluctant to accept your work so you
know we had to remind volunteers
especially volunteers who had worked in
places like Haiti where they were
slinging sledgehammers most of the time
that you know they had to just work a
little bit more carefully and also
Japanese homes have you know that very
nice wood a lot of it is exposed and so
it's just generally more delicate in the
level of craftsmanship and skill is much
higher so there's a lot to be careful of
so you know there's that was kind of
challenging at first and communication
of course unfortunately we have a
desperate shortage of Japanese speakers
there most of the volunteers are do not
speak any English at all in a handful
speak a little bit of English or sorry
speak no Japanese at all a handful speak
a little bit of Japanese and a very very
very small minority maybe I would say
less than ten percent speak both
languages so making sure that there was
a bilingual person on each job site
because we
would be working we would split up into
seven or eight teams in work you know in
a single day we would be in seven to
eight different places you have to make
sure there's a translator on every
single site which means we need eight
translators and sometimes that that was
very difficult it still is because we
simply don't have a bilingual people but
on top of that when it comes to Japanese
in English or a lot of east asian where
some anyways in the case of Japanese in
English it's not just a matter of
translating the language there are
different styles of communication and
you guys might face some of that here as
well where for example you know in
English for Westerners you just say
things whereas in Japanese or if you're
Japanese you don't just say things you
know if you say something it's it's
really significant if you want to just
say something you look you know you look
at someone funny in that sort of imply
that you have something new that you
want to get across so that's that was
one of the difficulties too there were a
lot of cases where the American Western
staff members would come to me later and
say well if there was this problem why
didn't the Japanese people say anything
and I would say they did but it turns
out that they may be suggested something
and of course in English the suggestion
is just a suggestion whereas in Japanese
if he suggests something there's more
weight to it and you know they didn't
necessarily give suggestions the weight
that they should have and so there are
sort of miscommunications like that and
that's a very difficult problem to solve
working with local governments um that's
also challenging most of the town's
these days have their own volunteer
center and in open auto we basically
almost have a parallel Volunteer Center
organization because local volunteers
can come to us as well or they could go
to the Volunteer Center and I think even
though we went all the way up to the
mayor to receive kind of
permission to operate in the sea it
seemed to me at least initially that the
Volunteer Center kind of resented us
because we just sort of step over them
and they got an order from the mayor to
work with us but we never really you
know it seemed like sometimes the
relationship wasn't as friendly as it
could have been and and and and that's I
think that's changed a lot in recent
weeks where now you know where we send
people to to their projects and they
send some of their volunteers to our
projects so that relationship is
becoming much much better but i think it
was difficult to to get there and it's
you know they're they're sort of this
rule there are a number of rules when
you do anything in Japan that has to do
with the government you have to talk to
the right people in the right order or
otherwise someone can get mad at you and
shut you down and that's actually
happened we actually got yelled at from
a politician India's aunt Agatha and he
threatened to you know prevent us from
doing any further work in because n talk
with us so it's you know that's a real
problem and in yeah meeting needs you
know whenever it comes to volunteering
people say make sure you do you know
what make sure what you provide is
needed and again is sort of a foreign
organization who has that has
experiences working in very different
circumstances I think and I say this
because no I sometimes I feel like all
hands as an organization kind of has one
direction that is different to
necessarily what is needed and again
because the staff are mostly foreigners
they can't communicate with the locals
very well I mean so they kind of do what
they think is is good and for the most
part it is but you know I think
sometimes other needs that could be met
aren't being met but again it to a large
extent it falls on the Japanese speakers
like myself to try and fix that
logistical oops you know I show you
conditions on our base where people are
just sort of packed into a tiny room and
it's very difficult it's still pretty
difficult for us to find a good base
because any decent housing is going to
evacuees for example in de cuisine
Takata we were going to use a campground
and but then they decided that the
campground was going to be used for
temporary housing or they were going to
build temporary houses in the campground
so we can use that space anymore and we
have two bases and one of the bases
there's no shower and you know we do
stinky work all day and it's sometimes
difficult to find a place to go bathe
and lastly there you know it's very
emotionally challenging it is very
challenging you at an emotional level
you obviously see a lot of destruction
and in my case the destruction didn't
affect me until much much much later on
probably not until the last three weeks
in all honesty when you first get there
and you see the destruction and you see
things like you know trucks and cars on
top of buildings or like boats you know
for four or five kilometers inland their
houses it or just upside down it's in is
strange it is to say it for most people
I think it's actually a little bit
exciting you know when you ride in a bus
with these people and there's a sense of
excitement people are taking pictures
even though that's a little bit frowned
upon but eventually at least in my case
I stopped being exciting at some point
and I started seeing the destruction for
what it is you know at some point it
sunk in finally that these are people's
homes you know businesses people's
communities in someone's home town and
once that gets through it actually
becomes a lot more difficult and the way
all hands works is it's borderline crazy
when you think about it
I don't know of any other organization
in Japan that has people doing the work
the kind of work we do the physical
labor out you know in the middle of the
destruction for months at a time you
know the self-defense forces I believe
are on a one-week rotation a lot of
volunteer organizations rotate like
piece boat is one of the big ones they
rotate people on a weekly basis I talked
to some policemen who had been sent from
Chiba Prefecture and they were also on a
one-week rotation so everyone else only
goes for about a week at a time but
we've got people there for you know two
months and longer and you know I I
myself know that I've certain reached
the limits of what I can tolerate
emotionally okay sorry I'm running a
little bit late just very briefly there
are some things that I thought worked
really well you know I already talked
about the traditional this is just
generally things that seem to work well
in the region not so much what we did
right but more things that worked for a
change in the traditional construction
methods again a lot of them withstood
that's the earthquake just fine and also
you know didn't get washed away in that
tsunami and I suspect that a lot of
those houses they'll start to study and
then learn how to milk build those
obviously the water went out but there
were quite a few wells in springs and
that people were able to use to draw
water and I thought that was really cool
because obviously when the water mains
shut it down you want that another
pattern I saw was you know how available
high ground was because n toccata
suffered far more casualties I think
close to 2000 compared to if not toes
400-500 because you cos n Takata is flat
it's very difficult to reach high ground
and if the only high ground is the top
of a building and that tsunami goes over
the building there's nowhere you can go
you know if not though on the other hand
it's a lot Hillier you can run maybe 50
100 meters and find a high ground so I
think a lot of people were spared
because of that
the other thing is how spread out the
infrastructure is in you cos n Takata
again because it's flat all the
infrastructures especially all the
businesses the big stores the
supermarkets you know they were all
wiped out where as a no if not oh there
were a couple of big supermarkets and
one of them was far enough inland that
that was still working so today no
cannot oh you can buy just about
everything in me cos n Takata there are
no stores having said that I've seen a
couple of prefab businesses they're just
prefab buildings that just pop up on
some flat ground and I thought that was
really nifty and exam tacops I think
there are a couple of convenience stores
that are like that and debris removal
the city is very very well the city and
the workers are very very efficient at
doing debris removal they work very
quickly and that's different to most
other countries and here are some things
that I saw that they needed so again
like I said you can talk out though
there's still no food so I last time I
heard something like 8,000 people were
still depending on food aid and so you
know that's 24,000 yields a day another
common need is water a lot of badly
damaged houses still don't have running
water and the government won't provide
water for cleaning but obviously if you
want to move back into your house you
want to clean things so people are
taking you know dirty dishes dirty floor
boards down to the river literally down
to the river to clean them and there's a
shortage of money of course construction
supplies and carpenters there just
aren't enough carpenters to go around
there's also the recovery plan i think
is still in the works so I talked to
homeowners who were eager to start
rebuilding but couldn't because they
weren't sure if they would be allowed to
rebuild or what they we need to do
differently because the government
hadn't come up with
fine yet I viously you know that's
that's a very difficult problem to solve
so it takes time but it is from what I
saw it is delaying the recovery process
and housing I think something like
eighty percent of temporary homes are
either completed or under construction
but there are still what is it like
83,000 people living in evacuation
centers and the temporary homes are very
nice but they're also not very
imaginative they're all single single
story which is an efficient use of land
one of the problems is there isn't
enough flat land to build temporary
houses on so they need to stack them up
but they're not really doing that so
it's not an ongoing problem technical
challenges I practically gotten this to
the sooner I do have a couple of
requests for the Geo people and I know
how hard this is because I used to work
with you guys the the satellite the
updated satellite aerial photographs
that Google did has was very much
appreciated on the ground you know
obviously it's good to keep it updated
though because things do change pretty
quickly but I suspect a lot of that was
done manually so but if you keep that in
mind local search it's what I used to
work on so I know how difficult this
probably is but there are a lot of
businesses that were washed away that
are now opening up in a temporary
location and it'd be really cool if
those were actually indexed obviously
you know you need a good data source and
all that but i'll leave the challenges
to you and also temporary houses you
know a lot of people are going to be
living in temporary houses for a while
so i'm trying to figure out how to map
those is probably sort of a problem that
you guys might be thinking about i just
wanted to show one case where the
satellite imagery didn't really match
reality so this is this is this is
reality here in the background you can
see pretty much everything's been wiped
out and on google maps it still looks
okay and it's not so
basically the base of the arrow is where
the picture was taken in looking out in
the direction of the arrow and where the
circle is is the area that you saw in
the background and obviously it looks
very different and and the reason why
you notice this is because that big road
that used to tie two communities
together and that road is no longer
there so every you know every five
minutes a car comes down turns around
another car comes down turns around and
you know they're probably using someone
else's GPS systems but you guys might be
able to do a little bit too to help that
another big problem is photos there are
a lot of photos that got washed away and
are currently being recovered but
there's no good way to match them up
with the owners and right now you know
people aren't washing the photos by hand
putting them up and we've the activation
centers people go and look at them and
it seems like a problem where maybe a
little bit of technology would help you
know google has book scanners and stuff
like that that might make you pasta a
lot of storage there are obviously
privacy concerns but a little bit of you
know scanning storage maybe a little bit
of artificial intelligence might go a
long ways possibly and also MPOs are
very bad at technology while I was
working with all hands I ended up
building a database for them because
they were tracking projects for
different jobs on paper and in the so
you know there's probably some
opportunities for engineers like
yourselves to work with MPOs and and
solve their technical problems and
finally we can do to help you can
volunteer with us especially if you
speak Japanese in English I we're short
especially if you're bilingual you can
also do any money so that's it I it is
now noon but if there are any questions
I would like to answer them
yeah you pay for your own transportation
but once you get there they supply food
and shelter and going as a Google serve
project sounds like a great idea there
have been other corporations that have
sent large groups to us but also
individually if you like to go for
longer that would also be very much
welcomed if you could get the time off
because there's a lot you can do in two
days but when you stay longer there's
even more you can do because he come you
can you can affect the organization and
become you know more influential thank
you there's
yeah I haven't been to an evacuation
center in a while but when I went there
on my second day on the project you know
I was going around talking to people
asking if there's anything we could do
and many of them said no we lost
everything there's nothing you can do
and there's nothing for them to do in
some cases too because if they might
have lost their jobs or you know there's
no reason to go back to their homes
because there's nothing there and I
think that is a problem I've met at
least one local evacuees who is also
trying to organize events for evacuees
yeah I didn't mention this but that's
actually a very big one you know the
emotional well-being of the evacuees
especially the elderly and the kids
that's that's a huge huge problem that
probably isn't getting as much attention
as it could so yeah from what I saw I
think that sounded pretty true that
during the day especially the elderly or
the jobless there didn't seem like there
was a lot they could do and obviously
that's you know it's bad for their
emotional health mental health too right
uh yeah actually the city many of the
cities seem to be doing that we saw a
lot of the city would hire say people
from the construction industry and have
them help with debris work or in llamada
I saw a group of fishermen who also
can't fish because they lost their boats
or maybe for whatever reason who are
also doing debris clearance along the
harbor
and stuff like that so that is something
i think that the cities are doing I
don't know if and I mean this is error
in the area that where I don't know much
about but I did see a little bit of that
yeah it's kind of difficult to go on
record to criticize the government um i
guess it seemed like well they were very
quick to restore a lot of the
infrastructure i mean again compared to
many other countries the roads were
cleared very quickly the debris is being
cleared very quickly and and for the
most part I think the government has
from what I saw I think the government
has been given the circumstances has
been pretty effective they're not
perfect by any means and I don't know
enough about Japanese politics to be
able to say whether one party would have
done better than the other because I
know I know there's a little bit of that
going on inject the one thing I will say
though is that there are still areas
where I think the government isn't as
creative as they may be could be and and
and I don't say this so much about the
government actually I would say this
about the volunteer centers which
actually isn't run by the government
it's run by a separate organization that
kinda runs like the government though
and and and they and that's one of the
challenges for us to work with them is
because they only accept certain kinds
of work they you know like they only do
debris work but they don't do mud
removal
they don't do a lot of the carpentry
jobs they also don't work when it rains
so it's not really a downside but it's
been very difficult for us to say hey we
do things a little bit differently but
we still want to work with you because
it's kind of you work within their
framework or it's you know it's very
difficult to work with but again I think
it depends on the community and also how
we actually build up the relationships
so I don't really want to generalize
there and and again I haven't worked too
much with the government's so you know I
can't really yeah probably shouldn't say
a whole lot about it
um All Hands is actually launching a
food distribution program unfortunately
I haven't been involved with that so I
don't know all the details so again this
is sort of mine just my impression may
not be accurate the situation in because
n Takata at least is that there are
there are no markets the all the
supermarkets are gone so people can't go
and buy the supplies that they want and
the supplies that they want our supplies
that you would need to cook a meal right
it's vegetables and meat but what gets
sent is relief supplies in most cases is
canned goods instant ramen candy a lot
of candy so it's not necessarily
nutritious or what you want to eat every
day and the I think there are at least
some fresh vegetables that are or were
being sent there because we received
some probably because they couldn't find
a good way to distribute it and they're
allowed there are a lot of challenges to
distributing relief supplies for example
you know you have to be fair if you just
get one box of onions you can't do
anything because you can't give it to
one person not another or you know they
need to have really really efficient
distribution systems or otherwise
vegetables would go back especially you
know now when it's getting warmer so I
think I suspect that's what's going on
is that what's being sent is really
supplies isn't really what people want
any more people are tired of eating you
know instant ramen and you know sweets
and I think that's what's being sent our
organization receive all hands received
like 20,000 rolls of toilet paper and
they're sitting in a warehouse because
there's enough toilet paper it's not
really a need but yeah so I think there
might be it think it's probably a little
bit of everything mismanagement miss
distribution but also just generally
it's very difficult to
the kinds of foods that people really
want I don't think I'm really qualified
to give estimates All Hands was
initially planning on having a project
up until july until mid-july and then
recently extended i believe until the
end of sep tember the japanese
government I believe announced that the
emergency phase was going to last until
mid-july but the rest it really depends
on the community in Ofunato for example
I think I've already said this but
there's not much debris clearance work
left in other communities that are very
well maybe there are other smaller
communities like velocity just north of
wolf not so south of llamada which was
hit very hard and I heard that they
didn't have nearly enough volunteers so
it really depends on the community my
impression is that there's more support
going to naggy than you ought to
partially probably because the number of
victims in Miyagi was about double what
it was in yacht a no but one thing I
didn't really say is what matters isn't
really the number the absolute number of
victims or houses what really makes a
difference at least from my observation
was the percentage in places like
llamada or echoes in Takata where you
know half or more of the town was
destroyed regardless of how many people
died it's going to be a lot difficult
for them to recover that in wolf not oh
we're only about a third of the city was
destroyed and so if you go to for
example Kamaishi which receives a lot of
volunteer support there about three
percent of the population
were killed or missing and llamada the
percentage is actually four points on
percent so you know I think that's
another metric that people can go by to
decide where support is needed most
other questions no okay sorry to go over
time but thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
