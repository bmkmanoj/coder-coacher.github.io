I'm a generic Google is that they like
to I said like for us to have a doctor
David Levy to talk to us about not
having time to think David earned his a
PhD in computer science in Stanford
University it's a small trade school
down the street from here in 1979 before
most of us were born and then a funny
thing happened on its way to his next
career he had a diploma in calligraphy
and bookbinding from Roehampton
Institute in London which is kind of
funny for me because before I met David
I didn't know that bookbinding was
something you had to learn I thought you
just put paper and staplers together or
something
but but no anyway for for more than 15
years
David was a researcher at Xerox PARC
where his work centered on exploring the
transition from paper to plastic no from
paper to print to digital media as a
professor in the University of
Washington information school since 2000
he has focused on bringing meditation
sorry
mindfulness training and other
contemplative practices to address a
problems of information overload and
acceleration and during the years the
year 2005 and up to 2006 he was the
holder of the Papa karak comic who chair
in education and technology at the
Library of Congress and this is where
Google is better than a Library of
Congress because we don't make people
who are chair for a whole year we are
nice anyway my friends I'll give you
debbie levy
thank you I'm delighted to be here I
really want to thank Ming for inviting
me only my second time here on the
Google campus I'm here to talk about a
topic that probably needs no
introduction does anybody know not know
what this talk is about no time to think
does that register with some of you I
presumably that's why you're here this
is a concern that has been growing for
me and has only gotten worse in the six
or seven years that I've been in
academic because what I have found is
that the acceleration that the culture
is experiencing is expecting I think in
a profound ways even the way we we are
educated and the way we learn and it's
been after it after 15 to 20 years as a
researcher at Xerox PARC
a think-tank it was really very stunning
and terribly upsetting to me to become
an academic and to find that I had less
time to think that than ever before the
place I want to start is with a quote
this is a few years ago I was reading
the biography of Barbara McClintock who
won a Nobel Prize for genetics a
wonderful biography by Evelyn Fox Keller
called a feeling for the organism and in
that book fox keller asks the question
what enabled Barbara McClintock to see
further and deeper into genetics than
other had people had before it took a
decade or more for her colleagues to
begin to understand what she had
understood what she had seen and to
finally win the Nobel Prize and the
answer that fox keller gives is that
Barbara McClintock took the time to look
and to hear what the material had to say
to her and she took the time to be
deeply connected to what happened to be
the corn plants that she was studying
and there was this one story at the end
of the book where McClintock goes to
Harvard to give up to give a lecture and
she explains to the students that these
budding geneticists it's really going to
be important for them to take the time
to
to look and to think and then the
students say where does one get the time
to look and to think the students argued
that the new technology of molecular
biology is self propelling it doesn't
leave time there's always the next
experiment
the next sequencing to do the pace of
current research seems to preclude such
a contemplative stance I was really
struck by that because this is a story
from 25 years ago and if there is that
sense of of the driving quality of the
technology 25 years ago and not enough
time to look to listen to think well
then what what would McClintock think
we're she a lot to be alive today now
the way I want to go into this is to
start with by looking at one particular
very famous article from computer and
information science how many of you know
the article as we may think by Vannevar
Bush okay so some of you do this is been
of our Bush first of all who lived from
1890 to 1974 was very famous in his day
he was trained as an electrical engineer
he was the vice president of MIT his
main research was in adalah analog
computing before digital computing was
really invented but when he the way he
became famous was that he was President
Roosevelt science advisor during World
War two and he was responsible for
creating something called the office of
scientific research and development
which was the attempt to bring
scientists military people and academics
together to solve problems that needed
to be solved in order to win World War
two and he was so famous that he
appeared on the on the cover of Time
magazine in 1943 this is not what he's
remembered for what he is most
remembered for today especially amongst
techies like us is a seminal article
that he wrote in the Atlantic Monthly in
July 1945 the article was called as we
may think and the reason this article is
so famous is that he imagined what we
now call hypertext and here it here is
are the some of the central quotes from
this very famous paper
he says consider a future device for
individual use which is a sort of
mechanized private file and library a
device in which an individual in which
an individual stores all his books
records and communications and which is
mechanized so that it may be consulted
with exceeding speed and flexibility
this is before digital computers are
anything but you know giant walls of
switches and he's actually imagining
something like this being produced out
of microfilm and what you see to the
left is an artist's rendition of what
Bush was imagining which he called the
Memex but then he goes on to say this
device permits associative indexing the
basic idea of which is a provision
whereby any item may be caused at will
to select immediately and automatically
another this is the essential feature of
the mimics the process of tying two
items together is the important thing so
there is there it is right that's the
moment July 1945 when if you like
conceptually the link and hypertext are
are born and all of the people who who
who have been famous for the in this
evolution of hypertext all the way up to
Tim berners-lee and the web acknowledge
that this is the the seminal place where
these ideas began for the for the
technical community so so this is very
well known especially of people who were
born who are older than manga's let's
say what is not so well known and the
part that i want to concentrate on from
this article because i think it tells us
a lot about the situation that we find
ourselves today what's not noticed so
much is exactly the larger argument that
Vannevar Bush was trying to make why did
he suggest the creation of this device
he called the Memex and his argument
goes essentially like this he's writing
in July 1945 the war is coming to an end
he says a devastating war is coming to
an end in which science and technology
have allowed people to deploy crew
weapons against one another and he knows
all about this because he and his
organization helped develop some of
these cruel weapons the survival of the
human race depends on its ability to
quote grow in the wisdom of race
experience that's a kind of archaic term
but basically he's saying we need our
survival will depend on our developing
wisdom if people had better access to
the record of human achievement they
would be better able to review their
shady past and analyze more completely
and objectively their present problems
in other words he's saying if we could
make better use of the human record we
ought to be able to survive as a race by
developing wisdom because we have the
time to think seriously about the really
hard and important problems that's his
argument it's a it's an argument about
the importance of deep and targeted
thinking but then he goes on to point
out that there are certain obstacles
that today today meaning 1945 are
preventing people from making the best
use of the record and here's what he
says he says there's a growing mountain
of research but there is an increase
there is increased evidence that we are
being bogged down today as
specialization extends the investigator
is staggered by the findings and
conclusions of thousands of other
workers conclusions to which he cannot
find time to grasp much less to remember
as they appear yet specialization
becomes increasingly necessary for
progress and the effort to bridge
between disciplines is correspondingly
superficial so in 1945 he's identifying
information overload and the
specialization of disciplines as a
central problem that's going to get in
the way of using the human record for
human prospering survival in the growth
of wisdom and that's why he wants to
create the Memex what he's saying is
that if we had better tools we ought to
be able to automate the more routine
aspects of research and this would free
people up to develop a to to to engage
in more creative thought it's a
beautiful idea
he go he distinguishes two kinds of
thought one kind he says is kind of rote
and repetitive and routine and another
kind is mature or creative and he says
for mature thought there is no
mechanical substitute but creative
thought and essentially repetitive
thought are very different things for
the latter there are and may be powerful
mechanical aids
I mean look here we are looking back
more than 60 years later and we can
recognize you know the world that you
are so deeply connected with and and and
working on here at Google which is the
realization that we can automate and
semi automate many things in very
powerful ways but this is Bush's claim
there's still room for the human mind
and for a different kind of thinking
which he calls mature or creative so
here's here's the question that this
talk is meant to pose what happened we
have this visionary work which in some
sense is has direct influence on the
development of hypertext on the
development of the web and yet the sense
of information overload has only grown
in our culture and it's clear that we
have less time to think than ever before
so what happened what happened to this
beautiful vision which which has so far
only partly been realized and what can
we do about it and that's what I want to
spend the rest of the time on in his
talk talking about and the way I want to
move on is I want to contrast some of
what Bush was saying with another
thinker who was writing at almost
exactly the same time as Bush and who is
not as nearly as famous as Vannevar Bush
and this is a man named Joseph paper who
was born in 1904 and died in 1997 who
was German so he was on the other side
of the war he was a Catholic philosopher
and theologian so Bush was an engineer
and an American and Peter was German a
german theologian and philosopher and in
1947 so two years later after after
Bush's paper
of course people wouldn't have known
about at all because it wasn't part of
his world two years later people wrote a
little book called leisure the basis of
culture which is still in print and he
starts off by saying you know a bush is
actually when he writes in 1945 the part
I didn't tell you is he starts off by
saying what our scientists gonna do now
that the war is coming to an end we've
used all this scientific thinking and
manpower to help win the war but what
kinds of peaceful peaceful ends should
science and technology devoted civil to
and that's what he then goes on to talk
about human flourishing the better
management of the record more time to
think and so on in a curious way people
is making a related argument because he
says what should Germany do now that
we've been defeated and after after all
of the huge moral lapses of the war the
question is what should Jeremy nee
devote itself to he can see that Germany
is in the middle of a giant
reconstructive effort where people are
working very very hard to economically
reconstruct a country that has been
destroyed as a result of the war and his
answer is people need leisure which
sounds totally weird so let's look at
let's look at his argument here he says
first of all the world of work is
becoming our entire world it threatens
to engulf us completely and the demands
of the world of work become greater and
greater till at last they make a total
claim upon the whole of human nature so
he's worried that Germany in this frenzy
to reconstruct itself is going to devote
itself to this to to work and nothing
but work and then he asks will it ever
be possible to keep or reclaim some room
for leisure from the forces of total
work and this would mean not merely a
little portion of rest on Sunday but
rather a whole preserve of true
unconfined humanity a space of freedom
of true learning of attunements of the
world as a whole in other words will it
be possible to
keep the human being from becoming a
complete functionary a worker so he's
worrying that were you know all work and
no play makes Jack and Jill a dull boy
and girl right and he's really worrying
that without this notion of leisure
which I haven't explained to you I
haven't explained to you what he means
by it that without this that people are
gonna end up becoming less human less
fully human and then he goes on to say
what he means by leisure by leisure he
doesn't mean you know go watching the
Giants a Giants game or playing a round
of golf or or playing video games not
that he necessarily would have been
against any of those things but what he
but he says leisure is a form of
stillness that is the necessary
preparation for accepting reality only
the person who is still can hear only
the person who is still can hear and
whoever is not still cannot hear leisure
is the disposition of receptive
understanding of contemplative beholding
and immersion in the real we the notion
of leisure that he is using here goes
all the way back to the Greek
philosophers its leisure as quieting and
stilling the mind becoming receptively
available to the world rather than
charging around and and and trying to do
things to the world and I suspect that
every one of us has some leisure like
activity in our world for some people
it's reading for some people it's
gardening for some people it's cycling
if we have time at the end I'm sure some
of you can tell it can tell the rest
what you actually do that has this other
quality which is that it brings you to a
greater sense of of well-being and
mental stability and opens you up to the
world and without this you can't hear
right you're so busy imposing things on
the world that you can't actually hear
incidentally Pieper points out that in
at least in English the word school
scholar and scholarship all come from
the Latin Scola which comes from the
Greek word which means leisure in the
sense in other words school and
scholarship are
contemplative activities in which one
learns to engage with the materials and
then he goes on to say and this is where
he really in a very interesting way
connects up with Vannevar Bush because
he also wants to talk about the nature
of thinking and he points out that the
medieval scholastics distinguished
between the intellect as ROTC oh that's
a latin word and the intellect as
intellectus ROTC oh is the power of
discursive thought of searching and
researching abstracting refining and
concluding let me say that again ROTC oh
is the power of discursive thought of
searching and researching abstracting
refining and concluding it's that use of
the mind to do that kind of thing
whereas intellectus refers to the
ability of simply looking to which the
truth presents itself as a landscape
presents itself to the eye this has some
very interesting similarity to what Bush
is saying ROTC oh is the more
connect-the-dots
balance your checkbook solve a problem
that's in some sense easily solved by
going from A to B to C Bush Bush calls
that repetitive and routine intellectus
is the more creative form of thinking
which you can't make happen but you can
quiet down enough to allow things to
allow things to arise in the mind and so
here's my here's at least the punchline
for the first part of this talk it looks
to me like the web and all this amazing
suite of digital technologies that we've
created to date are the best tools for
ROTC oh the world has ever known for
searching and researching abstracting
refining and concluding and you know
what I mean because you're right here at
the center of the revolution what
happened to intellectus while we're so
busy moving you know googling and
clicking and and and and assembling and
all of that what has happened to what
was both bushes and peepers idea that as
we move forward out of World War two
trying to solve the larger world
problems where is the space
time in which to get quiet enough to
think in deeper ways okay so now I'm
going to try to tell you to suggest to
you at least how it is that I think some
of this has come about that we've lost
sight of one half of the equation of
thinking it's it's such a simple truism
of our lives today that everything is
accelerating you know we've had books
like James glicks faster the
acceleration of just about everything
you know Google faster and you'll you'll
find plenty of this stuff what
historians and social scientists though
have pointed out that this kind that
this acceleration that we're
experiencing today is not new that it's
been going on for the last couple of
hundred years as this particular quote
says the general sense of a speed-up has
accompanied modern society at least
since the middle of the eighteenth
century basically with the rise of the
Industrial Revolution in in the in the
beginning in the early 19th century what
you have is a new set of technologies
you have steam power that allows our the
entire economic system to speed up once
you can mechanize things with steam
power you can speed up the mining of raw
materials you can speed up the
manufacturing of goods the Industrial
Revolution of course you can speed up
the distribution of goods to other
places through railroads and and
steamboats and and all of that so the
the serious acceleration begins with a
new set of technologies what I've become
aware of is that there have been certain
periodic points over this last hundred
and fifty years where there have been
crises of acceleration before Mars is
not the first crisis if you like of
acceleration one of them happened in the
late 19th century what happened there
was that by that point the railroads
were in existence you know serious
manufacturing industrial manufacturing
was happening
people began to realize that they didn't
have the management structures and
skills to keep up with the rate at which
things were being produced or and to
keep up with distributed organizations
if you think about it the railroads were
one of the first large-scale distributed
organizations how do you coordinate
across all the different railroad
stations and and so on and so that
there's a crisis what beniker has called
a control crisis in the late 19th
century where people start freaking out
and saying we don't know what to do
because we can't manage things at the
speed at which they're happening and out
of that crisis is born the modern
corporation the idea of hierarchies of
job descriptions of new document'
technologies like the typewriter and
hanging vertical files and carbon paper
things that of course are now legacy
technologies that we think where were
the you know the killer apps if you like
of the of the late 19th and early 20th
century you also get the development of
new genres of documents like memos and
executive summaries and charts and
tables so that so that somebody's
sitting at the top of the organization
can actually monitor and try to control
what's going on so out of that first
crisis in the late 19th century we get
the modern corporation and which which
we still have with us something
interesting that happens in the twenty
in the 1920s things are it's possible to
manufacture more goods and to move them
faster and by the 1920s industry leaders
begin to realize that they're able to
produce more goods that people actually
want or need what are you gonna do right
I don't want to buy another refrigerator
I don't want to buy another car you know
and all that and so what's the point of
keeping of going faster and faster and
producing more and more if it's not
going to be to be bought if you look at
the literature of the of those days what
you see is it isn't a discussion a
dialogue going on among industry leaders
where one side is arguing well let's
slow down people don't want all this
stuff we'll just you know we'll crank
the factories slower
however the other side says no of course
we got to figure out how to move more
goods and services right and they and
that's when they figure out that you
ought to be able to stimulate people to
buy more and that is the rise of
advertising modern advertising begins in
the 20s as a way to keep the economic
engine moving faster and faster today I
think we're we're in another crisis
which I I have called an information
environmental crisis and I'll explain
more about that in a few minutes
well I think once again we're at a kind
of critical point where it's beginning
to look like how much faster can we
really go how much faster can we go as
organizations how much more can we take
as individuals how much do people want
to need and of course this this next
crisis is being precipitated by the
brilliance of the work that started with
people like Vannevar Bush and continues
on with with all of you we know only too
well that digital information could be
manufactured very quickly it can be sent
around at the speed of light and we can
use email and all kinds of other digital
technologies as control mechanisms so we
have the possibility of doing more
faster than ever before
and the question is is that what we want
to do and is it going to work
the problem that I think we're beginning
to notice and and I'm here this is a
quote from a Norwegian anthropologist
named Thomas Eriksson who wrote a book
called the tyranny of the moment in 2001
we're beginning to notice a distinction
between fast time activities and slow
time activities he says when fast and
slow time meet fast time wins this is
why one never gets the important things
done because there is always something
else one has to do first naturally will
always tend to do the most urgent tasks
first in this way the slow and long-term
activities lose out in an age when the
distinctions between work and leisure
are being erased and efficiency seems to
be the only value in economics politics
and research this is really bad news for
things like thorough farsighted work
play and long long-term love
relationships it's also really bad news
for thinking because thinking is a slow
time activity you can that's what Bush
was trying to say you can only speed up
aspects of it thinking is a slow time
activity you can't speed up its creative
aspects you have to be receptive and
available for them to arise and so in
Vannevar Bush you know when he thought
he had the solution couldn't foresee I
mean he couldn't foresee an awful lot of
what's happened he couldn't see this
foresee that digital information would
explode the way it has and he couldn't
foresee that we as a culture would be
spending more of our times
metaphorically googling if you like and
less of our time actually creating the
space and time in which to reflect ok so
let's talk a little bit more about the
nature of thinking
I've argued so far that we have a kind
of distinction between routine Roxio
like thinking and more mature
intellectus thinking this this
understanding is thousands of years old
and it's something that scientists and
artists and writers have known as you
can see from some of these quotes here's
Barbara McClintock the the the
geneticist when you suddenly see the
problem something happens to you that's
that something happens that you have the
answer before you're able to put it into
words it's all done subconsciously
something's cooking or here's the
mathematician Gauss who reported solving
a theorem not by dint of painful effort
but so to speak by the grace of God as a
sudden flash of light the Enigma was
solved or the composer Tchaikovsky who
described how the germ of a future
composition comes suddenly and
unexpectedly and takes root with
extraordinary force and rapidity and
even Lewis Carroll talks about how when
he was writing Allison London Wonderland
and looked and through the looking-glass
that they're made up almost wholly of
bits and scraps single ideas which came
of themselves we all know the experience
of being in the shower or the equivalent
and suddenly something arises and what
I'm trying to suggest to you which is
stuff that I know you know because
you're all thinkers is that there there
is it's that our best thinking is a
mixture of ratio and intellectus we need
both and we need to be able to put in
the time to think things through but
then we hit a point where that kind of
linear thinking isn't gonna isn't gonna
work and then we have to let go and open
up for something else to arise there is
another kind of thinking though that
that we all are are quite familiar with
which goes by various names and
sometimes called mind chatter I remember
the first time that I really noticed my
own mind chatter I was I was in my 20s I
had woken up in the middle of the night
you know to go to the bathroom to get a
drink of water or something like that
and I heard my mind going it was going
no no
and then this happened in that and you
know what about you know si yeah what is
that
and I made me wonder if that's part of
what was happening in my sleep would you
know bla bla bla bla
does anybody not know what I'm talking
about here you know mine chatter so
there is that there is another way that
mode that the mind operates in and for
most of us it's going it's going right
on the boundary between conscious and
unconscious life and sometimes it takes
a kind of attempt to quiet down in focus
which is one of the things one does in
meditation to really begin to notice how
much of your your cycles are being
stolen but by this kind of mind chatter
so the larger point then is that
thinking takes time creative thought
can't be rushed
but although creative thought can't be
rushed it can be nurtured there are ways
that we can learn to quiet the mind to
tune it so that we can become more
focused so that we can reduce mind
chatter and so that we can be available
to those subconscious processes that
that are where some of the deepest ideas
actually come from we can't make
creative thought happened in other words
but we can prepare the ground and the
question is where in our culture are we
created the ground where are the
opportunities at the moment for us to
actually engage to reap to return to
this kind of creative activity it's one
of the things that as I said at the
beginning that has been driving me crazy
about being an academic is that I feel
that I am just going from you know
multitasking email to meetings to you
know you know what it's like and it's
very very hard
except for this year when I have a
sabbatical it's very hard to sink down
into these deeper reflective processes
okay so as I as I move toward bringing
these remarks to a close I want to offer
you a way that I've been thinking of
framing the current crisis which is as a
kind of information environmentalism
we all know that that the environmental
movement is about 40 years old now it
began with Rachel Carson's famous book
Silent Spring thank you and for 40 years
now a huge amount of work has been done
that's finally got us to the point where
we realize the extent of the crisis and
the fact that we have to do something
about it but right at the beginning
forty years ago was the dawn of the
understanding that unchecked
urbanization and industrialization were
hurting the planet and the argument
began to be made well that there are
other kinds of spaces environmental
spaces that have to be preserved for the
health of the planet like marshlands and
old-growth forests and healthy oceans
and so on today I'm suggesting we may be
at the beginning of a parallel
understanding and movement as we come to
understand that information overload
media saturation the claims that
ruminative and mindless thinking are
taking on us is is potentially of a real
crisis proportion and that we need then
we may need to discover the kinds of
spaces instead of marshlands and
old-growth forests
maybe we need silence maybe we need
forms of sanctuary
maybe we need opportunities for creative
reflection and engagement that would
that would parallel this earlier
movement and and and if this is a useful
metaphor then we might think about the
kinds of activities that have been
involved in the last 40 years in the
environmental movement research you know
what is the nature of the problem how
widespread it is is it how much of of
the polar caps are actually melting
public debate you know even today the
debate goes on among some people is
there how serious is global warming is
it human-made education and
consciousness-raising you know kids
learn in elementary school they go out
and look at their local ecosystem and
they
and they do recycling legislation and
policy setting technology development
changes in silico social practice like
like like recycling these have all been
part of what it's taken us over these
last 40 years
to get to where we are today where we
still haven't we still know we have a
major problem but at least more of the
world is taking it seriously and so is
it possible I'm suggesting that we are
at the beginning of a similar set of
activities how serious is this crisis of
thinking and overload
how do we get it up to the level of
public debate what are the consequences
of it for productivity and creativity
and I mean look at some of the
legislation like the don't call lists as
an example of something that largely
solved one particular targeted problem
which was the you know telemarketing or
weird inner spam legislation hasn't done
the same but then we have our spam
filters what else do we have to do if
we're going to to honor the vision that
Vannevar Bush had for us so I'm going to
suggest four directions I'm almost done
I have another five or six slides I'm
gonna suggest four directions for for
research and social activism the first
one which almost sounds like that may
not sound like it's an activity but I
really believe it is is that we simply
need to become more aware of the nature
and the extent of the problem we need to
take it seriously I mean that's been
part of the problem that we face
collectively with regard to invite the
global warming you know at some point we
have to say it's it's more than just
something I talk about around the water
cooler you know I'm so busy I don't have
enough time to do this and that this
wonderful billboard I took this picture
driving up 19th Avenue in San Francisco
between 10 and 15 years ago I thought it
was such an amazing ad that I actually I
lived in Palo Alto at the time that the
next day I drove back up just to take
this picture it's an ad for kgo radio
and it says don't drive around
empty-headed
and it shows this guy with the top of
his head off and I think what it's
trying to suggest is you don't want to
be empty-headed so fill up your head
with sports and news and weather and all
of that and I use this just as an
example of the messages that we're
getting from the larger culture which
are profound
don't be empty-headed don't quiet down
keep going to the extent that we can
begin to see how powerful these messages
are and begin to realize that maybe they
need to be moderated in various ways I
think we'll be on our way to doing
something about it something else that I
think we can work on is to design
physical environments that are
contemplative in various ways I haven't
seen enough of the Google campus but you
have some lovely spaces here already and
I know from discussion with mang that
there's the possibility of creating some
new kinds there is something about being
in a quiet beautiful environment that
has the tendency to bring us back to a
more grounded kamar position and that I
think encourages our ability to to think
and to be more ourselves this is an ad
that appeared in The New York Times
Magazine three or four years ago and
it's for an IBM ThinkPad ad IBM ThinkPad
computer and it says in deep Halcyon
repose and then it gives the dictionary
definition of Halcyon as peaceful and if
you look at what this ad is suggesting
it's clear that you can take your laptop
anywhere but you might want to take it
to a place like the stacks of the
library which is one of those places
where traditionally people have found a
sense of peace and repose so so so that
so advertisers of course are on to some
of this stuff but but there's plenty of
room for us to think about how to change
our physical environments in order to be
more creative and more effective
not only should we be able to think
about our physical environments we
should be able to think about our
virtual environments as well I mean in a
way you know the open the the opening
page of Google is actually uncluttered
that's a very interesting statement
right but most of our our computer
activities where the you know the screen
is filled and it's trying to catch our
attention from all kinds of directions
what would it look like to create not
just sanctuaries from cyberspace but
sanctuaries in cyberspace that's a
that's a whole topic that has really not
been approached yet this is the this is
the beautiful reading room at the
Library of Congress meg mentioned that I
was I was the holder I held a chair
I held a chair for an entire year at the
library Congress this I would go into
the reading room which was just steps
from my office pretty much every day and
I all I had to do was to walk into that
beautiful room and I felt myself relax I
felt myself be more relaxed and more
alive and more and more connected so I
would go in there to work and to read
but one of the things that I realized
about the reading room is that visually
it's very busy it's got this magnificent
dome it's got sculpture it's got
inscriptions all over the place and yet
at the same time it's quiet it's it's
emotionally and intellectually quiet
there's got to be a secret there well
you know because maybe we don't have to
maybe we can have visually busy
environments provided we understand how
to make them calm and and and how they
can help ground us so there's a secret
there and I just wanted you to see this
I mean many of us have these Bose
headphones I have a pair look at look at
the copy add the ad copy use it as a
concert hall or a sanctuary they're
trying to say something they're right
there they're calling to us to recover
this and how do we how do we get that in
our physical environments how do we get
it in our virtual environments the last
thing I want to talk about is related to
those is the
there's the potential to design
contemplative information practices how
do we you know how could we do email or
for that matter instant messaging or
pick your favorite online activity how
could we do those in more contemplative
ways well I did I did an experiment I
taught a course at the University of
Washington I created a course called
information and contemplation and by the
way the syllabus is online should you be
interested and I gave students the
following assignment I said I want you
to keep a log of your email behavior for
a week but because we were already
meditating we were we were spending part
of each class paying attention to our
breath and the thoughts that were going
through our minds and what was happening
to us emotionally we had that as a
shared vocabulary and I said what I want
you to keep it a log of when you do your
email is exactly those things to tell
you know say when you went online what
was going on for you emotionally what
was happening in your body what was
happening with your breath and keep
track of that and at the end of a week
look back over your log and then write a
one or two pages talking about what you
you discovered and every single student
discovered by doing this form of
mindfulness practice that there were
certain things that that were happening
for them around email that were actually
not what they wanted at all people often
found that they went online when they
were feeling anxious or bored and that
they got more anxious when they were
online longer you know a common
experience for me is I just have to look
at the inbox of my you know my email
inbox and what do I see there I see all
the things that aren't done so that's
interesting right I mean it doesn't tell
you how to solve the problem but at
least tells you that there's some kind
of disruption emotional and maybe even
body disruption happening another
example of what a student discovered she
realized that and obviously there's
there's no email in in in that
particular box now but imagine you're
looking through your entire inbox you
know and your eye is just glancing down
well think about all the different kinds
of things from your from all the parts
of your life that show up in your inbox
so in this course of 10 seconds you can
be in touch with you know your partner
who wants you to pick up the
dry-cleaning a meeting that's been
scheduled that actually you don't really
want to go to I mean you can go you can
cover your entire life in a scan of you
know of 10 or 15 seconds with all the
emotional stuff and all the distracting
qualities that come along with that
and so this this woman this student
realized that that was in itself
disruptive and she started thinking
about how could she better filter in
segments so that she wasn't that her
entire life wasn't pounding on her every
time she looked at her inbox the larger
point is not that any one of these
people is going to come up with the
ultimate answer to email but each one of
us if we bring some more thought and
reflection to our practices like that we
can actually make some discoveries from
ourselves about what's not working and
how we could do it better okay
just to let you know a little bit about
what I've been up to four years ago I
organized a conference on information
silence and sanctuary which was
wonderful I've been getting I've been
lucky enough to get funding from the
MacArthur Foundation for these events
then two years ago while I was at the
Library of Congress I organized a
workshop on mindful work and Technology
I taught this course on information and
contemplation and in june i'm organizing
another conference that will be at the
university of washington called no time
to think if you want to see a little bit
more about it here's the URL for the
site depth washington ddu slash iql so
part of what i've been trying to do is
to bring scholars researchers artists
religious leaders together to look at
the nature of this problem and to raise
consciousness and hopefully to begin to
create some kind of larger research
agenda okay so i i've told you pretty
much what I wanted to tell you let's go
back to the great man himself the the
inventor of hypertext
this is the last parrot
paragraph of that famous article the
applications of science have built man a
well supplied house and are teaching him
to live healthily therein they have
enabled him to throw masses of people
against one another with cruel weapons
they may yet allow him truly to
encompass the great record
that's a lovely phrase to encompass the
great record and to grow in the wisdom
of race experience he man human beings
may perish in conflict before they learn
to wield that record for their true good
yet in the application of science to the
needs and desires of man it would seem
to be a singularly unfortunate stage at
which to terminate the process or to
lose hope as to the outcome this is to
remind you though this is the vision
that Bush had which is I think a vision
that in a lot of ways Google has as well
which is to really do good by organizing
the record and the part of it that
really if you want one summary slide
it's this I think the next challenge
ahead I mean there's always more to do
in organizing the record but the next
challenge is to balance ratio with
intellectus to figure out how we can not
only do a brilliant job of searching and
research searching and researching
abstracting refining and concluding but
how we can create the space and time for
thinking for reflection for
contemplation and to actually assimilate
and work with all the information that's
available to us today thank you
do we have we have time for questions
is that a hand guy back there No
so I'm only learning about you just now
and heard about Xerox PARC and I'm
wondering if you would draw any
parallels between bush and Douglas
Engelbart
and and as I'm just now reviewing Bush's
thoughts I see how he is thinking about
helping an individual think and making
the tools to help an individual think
and I see Engelbart's focus more on
helping communities of people work
together any any thoughts - - that
that's a that's a that's right you're
absolutely right I'm Douglas Engelbart
by the way who I think there's a there's
a picture in building in the downstairs
somewhere of bang with with angle Bart
is another one of the luminaries in this
story about the development of hypertext
in the web he at ed SR I at the Stanford
Research Institute he developed a few he
developed the first type of the first
working hypertext system and in 1948
what year was 67 or earlier did this
amazing demo with Windows on the screen
he was the inventor of the mouse by the
way Park the mouse was not invented at
Parc and you right now and by the way
angle Bart read as we may think and and
there's a still and there's an there's a
letter that ain't where angle Bart
writes to Bush and it's not clear where
the bush ever responded to him but angle
Bart got really jazzed winning with when
he read this article I think he was in
the Navy at the time but you're right
Bush's seems to have been had a much
more solitary in the individual working
with his or her workstation and and and
Engelbart's vision was of a much more
collaborative environment you're
absolutely right what's in it what's
also interesting is if you look want to
look at another one of the roots of the
web htu ELLs
the historian had this idea for what he
called a world brain he didn't have the
a sense I'm not sure he had a sense of
what the technologies would be but his
was an idea in a sense organizing all of
world knowledge whereas Bush didn't
quite have that idea he had more the
person at his own individual workstation
putting links together and so on
so that was very good point yes hi David
who's gonna dispute you I mean serenity
calmness it's all good stuff right but
and I thank you for the good words about
the Google homepage at the same time I'm
wondering how we can design spaces that
do support contemplation and and this
sort of sense of peacefulness and so on
in particularly in light of the sort of
phenomena of flow and disruption of flow
because we find that even tiny little
decrements in late increases in latency
or decrements and performance can
actually really affect one's ability to
do work and you know very well that you
know jitter in the response time
actually really reduces your ability to
and engage it to a flow state so the
question is if it's just a matter of
slowing down we'll just give every break
modems and we'll slow everything down
and that's probably not what you want
now so so what is the nature of the
design of sort of these kinds of places
that support this kind of space for
thinking dan I I don't actually know the
answer to that I mean that's why that's
the kind of research that actually needs
to be done but I think that what what
it's going to take is gonna it's gonna
take park-like experiments which you
know we we but we both know what that
was like for many years it's gonna take
experiments where people really do try
to build environments and and see it and
see what happens right I mean I don't
think you know I don't think it's one
size does not fit all
you know there's work I'm sure you know
some of the work I mean there's work at
Microsoft
Eric Horvitz and some of his people have
done stuff on how do you minimize
interruptions or how do you develop a
model of the user in such a way that you
figure out what the right time is I mean
I think that's interesting work but I
don't think it goes far enough to
unbecoming of some of these other states
see I think I so long as we as we simply
import the model of efficiency of
efficient
effectiveness which is I'm you know now
that this allows me to do this little
piece but we don't take seriously that
there is another mode of relating to the
world until and until the designers who
are going to design for that are
themselves experiencing that I don't
think we're gonna get we're gonna get
good answers so we actually need you
know we need the work that manga is
doing in bringing Norman Fischer in to
get people trained in excuse me not
meditation but emotional intelligence we
need people we need people who are
willing to talk with one another about
the flow state experiences that they
actually achieve maybe on the hiking
trail and it has to be legitimate to
talk about that in relation to what
happens in the office so I I mean I it's
it's it's it's the right question and I
don't have the answer but I think I see
especially given them about the kind of
background that we share with park I
think I see how one could begin to
actually investigate that that kind of
thing hi my name is Jonas and I asked
came from meditation which I lead on
Wednesdays here and it's a wonderful
thing to do I come from Europe I came
from Sweden and I live in San Francisco
and I've observed and it become very
clear to me over the years that I miss
something because wherever I am in the
city
there's not benches to sit down I can't
sit down and just observe what is I have
to keep moving if I want to sit down
anywhere I'm probably loitering
according to the city law or something
and I really want to have a ticket for
loitering in u.s. I'm trying to get this
I'm not sure how I need to do that but I
think it's a very interesting concept
because if you're sitting down and being
quiet and just enjoying life and not
running around you're essentially
loitering in this culture or the
American Way maybe in the way I perceive
it I observe it I can't sit down and I
can't be calm and quiet about consuming
I can go to a cafe but it's gonna be
mostly inside and I gonna sit there and
I have to consume to stay there and I be
bombarded by people consuming and it's
gonna be TVs on and there's always
something trying to steal my attention
if I walk on the street it's gonna be
people asking me for signatures and if
I'm voting in California or I don't know
I never ask me if I vote in Sweden I
would like that but um yeah this is a
very interesting thing because it's
built into the culture and also into the
architecture of Sirius a lot and I would
be very happy if something could be done
to think about these things on a broader
scale and I don't know if you have any
suggestions well first thank you thank
you for those excellent observations I
think I think it is in some sense built
into our culture that you know that that
leisure is loitering or a certain
certain kind of of leisure is loitering
on the one institution that I think that
I that I think still is carrying some of
this other relationship to the world in
our culture as libraries you know it's
so interesting because here you know we
all know look at what's happening on the
web with digital libraries but at the
same time public libraries are
prospering in this country and in San
Francisco built a new one in Seattle
built a beautiful new public library and
is retrofitting you know the branches
and and all of that the library and
especially the reading room remains a
kind of protected space in in this
culture and it's a place where people
can go it's not acceptable to use cell
phones typically in a place like a
reading room and very often there isn't
even Wireless there you might actually
be there just to think or to write you
know or to read a book so I that's the
place I'm excited about you know as I
think about how do we move these ideas
more broadly into the culture my
interest is in is in targeting public
libraries as a space I mean they they've
been hit very hard with you know needing
to show performance metrics and all
those kinds of things and yet the public
wants to have those those secular open
contemplative spaces so last question
so I had a pretty similar question are
there any cultures or countries that you
think are better or worse at this kind
of contemplative thinking and like you
know what what features of the culture
would be correlated with that maybe like
Internet use or by the car use that's a
really great question and I don't
actually have a good answer to it
because I'm not that familiar I mean
there are countries like is it Bhutan is
it that has you know taken on which is a
Buddhist country that has taken on a of
Gross National Happiness right which
presumably enemy would be interesting to
look at how technology is being used
there I don't know I think there are
cultures that are even more frantic than
ours I mean I've spent a certain amount
of time in Japan and at least the parts
of Japanese culture that I have seen
suggests to me where we're gonna be five
to ten years from now where we're you
know there's even a term in I forgotten
there's a term in Japanese which
essentially means death by overwork I
mean it that that's how seriously the
the notion has been taken but but you
raised a very very good question I mean
it would be wonderful I mean put that in
the put that in the hopper for a kind of
research direction that somebody ought
to fund which is to look across cultures
at how people are doing in maintaining
this other dimension of life and maybe
even you can say you know III hope it's
clear to you and since I'm wrapping up
now I'll use this as my last sentence or
two I hope it's clear to you that what
I'm really saying is we have the
opportunity to figure out how to do this
with the technologies as well it's not
it's surely it's not about pulling the
plug but I think we've been so focused
on this more faster better everything
has to be faster and more effective and
efficient in certain ways that we've
lost sight of the fact that we've cut
out an entire dimension that is not only
central to what is it to who we are as
human beings but that's central for
doing creative work and that's probably
the argument that ultimately is going to
win because we want to do creative work
and we want to do good work and I don't
see how we can do it adequately when
we're running faster than is healthy for
us so I think at that point I
stop and say thank you all</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
