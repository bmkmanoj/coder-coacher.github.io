that we have Hubert here today Hubert
and I were supposed to talk about this
talk and schedule it and co-ordinated
for I think two months and he sent me
tons of emails and phone calls and
everything and then just last week we
finally connected and got it done and
and he asked me a couple of things like
so so what are you doing at Google what
what are your challenges and there are
two main things that I could that I
could come up with was what we have lots
of distributed teams and we have more
and more teams where we actually have to
coordinate several teams and from my
experience here at Google it's two
things that we're not actually very good
at that we try to do and we try to deal
with but we don't have that much
experience and we always struggle with
it and that's where he says well fine I
I think I have something I can talk
about this so this will be the main part
of this presentation today of this tech
talk distributed teams and coordinating
multiple teams she would also told me
before it's okay if people ask questions
during the tech dog if you have
something don't wait until the end but
ask it right away okay and was that okay
Hubert okay thank you and nothing he
working good okay and yes please like
mark sets and by the way if you can't
tell mark and me apart he's got a German
accent I've got a dutch accent so okay
like Mark said please questions during
the talk which means i'll try to work up
to the end of my slide deck near the end
of the hour that brings a challenge
because lots of talk lots of questions
means that we might be at slide 5 at
five minutes to two and that's not the
intention i got about 20 slides and
Simon you had your supper if you think
it takes too long then you zap the
person who talks too long could you be
helpful and be my timekeeper would you
be willing to do that ok thank you ok an
hour talking about planning controlling
large a child teams I'm not going to
read this all out I'm an agile coach for
for rally and which means that although
rally is a tooling company I change the
people told tools don't change people
that's what coaches like myself do and
that's what I do pretty much worldwide
I'll use that experience in in the talk
okay and few words to to introduce what
I'm talking about and one of the words
that is is really really hard to explain
and yet once you experience it is it's
so great is rhythm if you're in agile
projects then all of a sudden you're in
time boxes you're asked to deliver
working software every two weeks every
four weeks and we'll see later that when
i talk about releases again you go into
a time box of every three months
releasing software you got your daily
stand-ups every day same time same
people same location it's all about
rhythm in agile and the question is
often why do we do that my experience is
when you use it in agile projects HR
methodologies than the rhythm creates
the pattern people don't have to
remember what they were doing or
supposed to be doing they're just doing
it they're there on time for a release
meeting or for a planning meeting or
they know when they're getting closer to
the end of an other release and need to
be in the middle of testing so that's
why to me rhythms are key I think you've
seen all all of you have seen this
who've you know agile we know scrum but
half half of you okay who's been working
with extreme programming practices okay
also a whole lot of people you must
recognize that the methodology here it
is scrum but the structure is applicable
to all methodologies you start with a
list of things to do the backlog then
you run into your planning meeting you
planned just enough work so you can get
into your next iteration your next
sprint two weeks every day you stand up
meeting and then at
end of the two weeks you got your
increment you're potentially shippable
product from talking to mark over lunch
and over coffee I understand that that
happens more and more here at Google do
you do you recognize this okay you're
not just telling a story that's great
thank you and so with this model in mind
and then talking with Mark and gaining
experience with customers small and
large around the world and what's the
problem here well one of the things that
could be a problem is at planning two
weeks ahead planning only small steps
well if you see a toddler making small
steps then you know that sometimes it
doesn't end up where you want to end up
you want to end up over there but with
only two steps two weeks at a time
planning you might get scope creep you
might get loose focus off of what you
really want to deliver that's why I've
been introducing more levels of planning
and the paper I wrote about it is called
five levels of planning to manage the
larger project if you hit a project that
takes three months six months 16 months
and that's no longer just a single team
but five teams or 15 themes in it you
need to add a bit more structure to
what's on the wall now and I try to
capture that in a picture I will never
make money of drawing and but I hope it
explains what what I mean if you when
your software team are sitting here
working in their iterations that's the
small focus that's the two weeks but you
need to look further ahead further ahead
on the path towards ultimately your
vision where do you want to end up you
need to look at a lot of detail in the
activities that are very close by that
are nearby your next iteration your next
sprint maybe to you got a lot of detail
further away less and less detail if you
read my cone is his book on user stories
he starts talking about epics big chunks
of work not too much detail but it's
sitting there we know it's gonna hit us
a further and further away less and less
detail you sent the essential part of
the picture is and you still have that
mapped out you still have a vision set
up somewhere see that's why I needed
this thing because I can't jump that I
you still have a vision that big idea
where are we going with AdWords in the
next six months we're shoot a product
goal what can we put up on the wall as a
reminder for developers for our
marketing people this is what we will be
doing and how do we get there what's the
roadmap for the product this is not for
a project this is not for a single team
this for the whole product where this ad
words as a whole go to how often do you
do it it depends a lot on the company
that how fast moving are you I
understand and my experiences with
Internet companies is that once or twice
a year is probably low frequency for you
you probably do it three four times a
year but still it's that big stick in
the mud somewhere in the future is
typically work that your product owner
your product manager does it's the
people who who are responsible for
Adwords or whatever product within
Google you're working on my I often get
questions yeah but who is a product
manager or product owner answer is
simple the person who gets the bonus at
the end of the year if the product is
successful that's a product owner so
product owner initially on its own if
it's really a truly new vision is
probably on its own and then he starts
pulling in architect type of people
maybe some team members but it's a very
small group working on the road map once
that been taken through the mill has
been
prove the project gets the go-ahead the
new release for Adwords or has gotten
the green light then you start working
on your release plan once that's on the
way sprint plan and then your daily
stand-up meetings and if you look at the
picture from a distance what's happening
is initially very very very little
detail it's just a big thing of vision
statement will see that in a moment it's
just a few sentences it's a few drawings
a roadmap maybe a couple of slides
little detail and that's good because at
this point it may not fly maybe you do
not get the approval to to go ahead with
your new release or with with your new
product once approval is there you can
start add more detail let's investigate
let's pull the team in and let's start
working on the release plan let's create
a backlog let's add detail spend money
in it because it takes time and
therefore money sprint plan even more
detail is added takes even more time
money but you all do it at the right
time you do not try to map out all your
Sprint's all your details at very early
stages of a project and that's the big
difference with with a waterfall or a
big design up front project ok bit more
detail before we jump in there few words
on the product backlog the list of
things to do like I said and the higher
the priority of a feature of a component
that you have to build the more time and
money you will spend on it to create
detail to split it up to no longer have
an epic no longer have a place holder
but have a lot of detail in it something
that's far away that might happen in the
future that's typically big as a
placeholder if you talk sizes and things
at the top features that will be built
in the next iteration of
only three to five days in size it's
really really small something that's far
away that's goes to three releases out
seven eight months away could well be
over many year in size can be really
really big it's just a placeholder and
as soon as it starts bubbling up it gets
split up probably kept together there
are relationships in all those features
that come out of the big one so it's
kept together and it will always be in a
release but they do get more and more
detail the product backlog if you are
working with screw more agile methods is
something that that lives all the time
this is your change management system by
adding features by removing features by
changing the content of features that's
how you change your product that's your
change management in action okay why are
we doing all this why are we planning in
the first place and how is it related to
the title of the talk planning in larger
groups in larger projects let's look at
a few of the things first of all create
a few of the whole it's amazing how many
teams are work with where the developers
have no idea what they are working on
yes this method that component is
javabean where it fits in the hole no
she do create that vision statement a
big thing then they know what they're
doing and why they're doing that the
effect on teams is just magical it helps
you load the team properly give them
just enough work you don't overload them
you don't underload them that's what
happens in it in a planning session you
create a good flow of features what
should happen when are the dependencies
are their business reasons to do
something earlier or later discovering
dependencies and risks everybody will
say yeah every PMI manual and training
tells you this
sure and why does every PMI manager do
it on its own you create the best
insight in your dependencies in your
risks if you work with the whole team
the whole group of people who will be
building the product get them there
you'll see some pictures in a few
minutes you need to confirm your
estimations our favorite topic
estimations don't we all want to have
perfect estimations at the beginning of
a project well at least we think that
that is what management once I start
start in January first with the project
let me try to predict what's going to
happen in August 2008 three o'clock in
the afternoon on the 24th it's an
accuracy that's not necessary that that
doesn't make any sense so confirming
estimations is about where we add detail
when we create smaller and smaller
features when we split up those big
things into smaller and smaller features
we look again at the estimates and we
increase accuracy and we confirm our
estimates that's what planning is about
confirming priorities and ultimately
committing to the delivery saying okay
we have now looked in so much detail at
those features that we have to deliver
now we can commit we know what it's all
about you can estimate them with enough
accuracy we as a team we can commit plan
driven often does do this ones or a
couple of times if I can't say that cuz
I'm on TV but if the problems arise you
will re plan in a plan driven project an
agile project if you would work with me
dude all the time every time almost
every day you look at your planning is
she where where you're going keep
planning let's see how that works it
starts at a high level like I said the
big stick in the mud somewhere half a
year a year away the vision statement
and happens when you get big changes in
your product when you foresee we were
talking about really
to it's now released but at some point
somebody gets an idea oh let's do
release 2 for Adwords or maybe now
release 3 is on the drawing boards I
don't know that's when you create a
vision statement what what should go in
there the ways of doing this the most
often described one is the elevator
statement from Jeffrey Moore from his
book crossing the chasm where the idea
is if you have your skyscraper and step
into the elevator in the morning CEO
standing next to you you think bingo now
I'm going to get him interested in my
new project and then you start mumbling
and you try to pee sentences together
and the door opens he's out and you lost
your opportunity no good so just be more
created in what he called an elevator
statement to sentence saying something
about what's the product who should aim
that what what's your target market what
does it do why is it so unique what
needs does it fulfill and how does it
differ from your competition it's a way
of doing it the other one comes from Jim
Highsmith in his book agile project
management is literally draw a box a
product box like you would buy office of
the shelf or even surreal in that in the
supermarket at the front you get all the
splash screens is better as this has no
longer menu bars runs twice as fast in
half the amount of memory and then at
the back you get the details what's
needed for this product what's in it how
much memory does it may need what are
the exact features if I work with teams
the product box although it sounds a bit
more goofy works a lot better people
like it they have good fun creating a
vision through to a product box and any
tips you could start for your product
backlog because you start really
mentioning features for your new product
of your vision
starting to get encapsulated into
feature so if you want to try any of the
three the product box again my
experience your mileage may vary is it's
a good way to do with the third one is a
difficult one metaphors I've been
experimenting with it a metaphor
compares your new system to something
that's totally non related an example I
helped building an internet bank in
Scotland and the metaphor there was the
new internet bank is a railway system we
go from station to station with our
train we go from collecting initial
information about the customer and and
the mortgage he wants to buy then the
next station will doing we'll be doing
is risk analysis is you really good for
his money third station would be
printing all the legal documents fourth
station release the money etc a metaphor
that kept us as developers and managers
very well aware what would happen if you
would add a product which stations we
would hit with chase stations would get
a change hard to come up with if i run
this exercise in the training session
and the metaphor usually sort of sizzles
it takes more time to do it still a very
powerful way and to describe your
product the overall goal is of this
exercise is not only to get that idea
about what you want but also to move
your project into the project portfolio
get approval or at least the first steps
of approval if you're in the management
team you'll typically see a handful
dozen projects in this stage and some
make it and get to the next step and
some don't the product owner like i said
with his peers he seldom alone and first
epochs start appear on the backlog and
there are some estimates around it not
too much at the moment
then we go to the road map because an
approval the green light go ahead with
it and we have to create a road map
let's first look at one instead of
reading out the slide again this is a
road map an old one for our own product
for rally and what does it look like of
course the releases with the dates
release is always for us for a lot of
companies planned against the day today
it drives the content of what is in the
release a number of very big statements
about what's in there so if i look at
this last one for all the users we will
create more flexible requirements
hierarchy and do something with
configurable editions and then per user
a little bit more detail and again if
you use to working with with screwing
with agile methods then you see your
backlog appearing here we adding detail
to that very first statement it could
well be that your vision statement is in
the top gray box and your roadmap is
underlying do that for half a year a
year head back to the previous slides
again product owner works on it but now
you get experts drawn in now you need a
bit more technical detail and estimates
become important because based on this
road map you start to estimate what's it
gonna cost what type of people do we
need and when what's it looking like you
increase the accuracy there's clear
ranking of your features what happens
when again to give people the
development team the management team the
view of the whole what will be happening
when I don't have to worry that they
forgot something it might be six months
away but it will be developed at some
point we create a big overall picture
so that's what what's in there seeing
this one approval is there again we have
figured out that we roughly have to
write people now we can start working in
detail now we pull the team in now we
start working with a delivery team on
the release planning now we have
features remember the bubble chart that
are all small enough to be pushed in a
certain iteration we know what's going
to hit us at the start of every release
cycle every 3-4 months and we'll be
doing this exercise with the whole team
and extended with product owner
architects specialists customers maybe
this is for me a whole group exercise
the team needs to have an idea of what
stories what epics are on the backlog
they need to prepare for it and need to
look ahead stories are written estimated
etc and and what you do is move your
stories into the right iteration within
the release and take this literally
where's my picture take this literally I
right all my stories on post-it notes
with them all on the whiteboard or on
the wall this these are great walls you
have here and ask the whole team the
whole group please move them around
please move hope you can see the lines
between the iterations please please
move a story in the right iteration
thinking about dependencies about risks
about technical feasibility and the
picture here is a really small team only
a handful of people I've done this with
up to 50 people all working on the same
release all working against the same
wall and to make it more exciting even
asking them not to talk at the same time
you get the release plan in roughly five
minutes then
I'll come to that in a moment very good
question so work with the physical
things please not one person especially
another guy behind the laptop and
projecting it behind him because he's
got the power he can steer he can decide
you want a whole group to decide
everybody's there everybody moves
post-it notes if they fall out over it
somebody take supposed to know put it in
another iteration this colleague comes
up and puts it back again and you know
you got something to talk about that
that's what you want that's how you find
dependencies etc yeah flyman limon y a
very good question if part of your
team's is overseas I like to have them
all there I like to bring the people
together and release planning we're
talking three four times a year I think
usually it's financially feasible the
benefits outweigh the costs of course it
doesn't come cheap to fly people in of
course tickets hotels etc but the
benefits of having everybody working on
it and finding problems the benefits of
team building of people getting to know
one another far outweigh the costs you
can't do this every two week in an
iteration plan I wish but that's just
too expensive but four releases in my
experience oh yes absolutely do it I've
run release planning once with everybody
flying in to a customer site and
customer site was in Tel Aviv was in
Israel people flew in from America and
France I mean in eight hours we had a
full release mapped out with 50 people
the next time we had to separate the
teams and use a video link it took a day
and a half and it was disastrous to
facilitate for me it was really really
difficult so bring people together big
advantages so I thought they stood up to
200 people you can scale this this
scales you don't have to other people
against the same whiteboard no that's
not true but in in four or five breakout
rooms
then bringing them back together again
absolutely scales and gives great
results I've never overrun a day it took
day even with the 200 people and a lot
of facilitation a lot of preparation
it's not easy it's not simple and but
the effects were enormous okay what I
have here is the full release stories
per iteration a blank iteration they say
we're not sure that is all fits we want
a buffer we want a hardening sprint and
then some stories didn't make it into
the release to do with the third one is
a difficult one metaphors I've been
experimenting with it a metaphor
compares your new system to something
that's totally non related an example I
helped building an internet bank in
Scotland and the metaphor there was the
new internet bank is a railway system we

then some stories didn't make it into
the release daily sprinting as we as we
call it and every day we have our
standard meeting the 15-minute same
place same time and where people check
in with one another answer the if your
Instagram the famous three questions
what did i do yesterday what did i do
since the last meeting what am i
planning to do next and what's stopping
me from being successful only those
three questions and now you move on to
the next one could be a bit of a
discussion there somebody mentioned that
is blocked I'm still waiting for the
test results from the team in india you
get some questions what test results why
are you waiting is a technical problem
are they falling behind until the team
understands for
What's Wrong can maybe offer help or can
decide we have to take this problem of
line and solve it elsewhere that's the
standard meeting only product owner
product owner and delivery team are
there and are talking other people can
come in architects executives other
teams cannot talk you do group talks the
group talks to one another it's not a
status meeting it's telling one another
what what you're doing and replanning
yesterday I worked on those Java tests
and it's not going forward at all I have
to spend all day today again and
colleague looks and says oh that means
that I get delayed as well I better
reshuffle my activities so even the
daily planning meeting is about the
daily standard meeting is about planning
little preparation for it little
formality I've got plenty of teams who
just stood it this over the morning cup
of coffee around the coffee machine or
around there burn down charts or
whatever metrics they use and just talk
there quickly through this and moving on
again that's in the small that's a
single team we were talking multiple
teams and probably not all in the same
building if you do it in the large same
recipe every day same time same place
this could probably be over video link
or conference call and the team leads
product owners are probably one or two
team members get together and answer the
three same questions but now from team
to team yesterday my team finished up
all the user interface testing and
everything is accepted product owner has
seen it and today we will be moving on
to the database layer making it up as
I'm going along which gives the other
teams in the other locations information
that hey there is a GUI we can start
using the GUI for our own tests we it's
still planning
every day again works wonders that same
internet bank that I was talking about
the largest team that I run with had
just over a hundred people hundred ten
people and seven teams and for a year
and a half every day we had this
standard meeting scrum of scrums
meetings or all the teams came together
total about 35 people in the room and we
hardly ever over n 20 minutes for the
meeting I will always knew what are the
others doing where do we need to
readjust where do we need to change our
plans for the day because the other team
is ahead or behind on their plans and
takes a bit of organizing takes a bit of
an chairmanship but it works wonders for
your teams I've seen it done being done
over dial-up links people just calling
in and you have to be able to not forget
about them if there's just a phone
sitting somewhere in the corner that of
course is not your colleague in in pune
so I've seen tricks like putting
pictures of putting using wiki's using
make it personal and that's again why I
like to have people together on a
regular basis for example for release
planning session so you see the faces
you know what your colleagues in pune
are doing in the private lives quick
check-in on the team level every day
again and again and then at the end of
iteration you do you them or you your
inspection of the product what did we
build and and what does the rest of the
world think of it you're creating a
feedback loop by showing what you've
done you created for the product owner
so feedback is given and if you have
multiple teams bring all the individual
results together try to make it one big
flow of a demo even if it takes an hour
to demo its if you have five or six
teams there
the protocol and step through it also is
get a big picture again create a
feedback and maybe here you look at
results like metrics how do we do that
we really do what we plan to do that we
have the right velocity as we estimated
that you inspect what happened around
the product and within the team you
inspect how it was done how did we work
together why did we miss that one
deadline why did we go so much faster
than the other one what how did we cover
up for the DBA who had an accident and
didn't show up for a week how did we
manage to resolve that what can we learn
from it that's the retrospective this is
something that I've never done and would
think twice about doing it over a video
link or an just a phone link it's this
is about people looking at one another
and being honest with one another very
hard if you don't have them all in the
room which is one of the reasons why i
like to group people different teams
around functionality and not around
roles the worst possible way of
separating your teams is if you have
your test team in one city and your dev
team in another one and the GUI
designers in yet another city doesn't
work try to create whole teams around
the whole piece of functionality and
then the only thing you have to do is
still enough work is bring the
functionalities together and integrate
them but please no separated teams over
different locations imagine the tester
settling in Pune and your dev team over
here in and they have to talk about the
book 12 hours team time their friends
who's going to work that late or that
early doesn't work testing is not about
running a script testing is about
communicating and solving a problem and
that means talking so therefore
retrospectives keep them
around co-located themes and because you
had a little question so far 145 darned
if I would try it I wouldn't be able to
make it on time but today it worked
other questions discussions thinks you
would like to know yes
yeah okay question is how do changes get
incorporated in into all this planning
and the fact that let me go back a few
slides quite a few the fact that you
have a road map or a release plan does
not set the lower detail in stone if you
run a sprint an iteration and your demo
a review shows that you're on the wrong
path the product owner looks at at what
you build and says is close but no cigar
I wanted different I want more this less
that then going back into the next print
the plan can change the priorities on
the backlog can change even if your
release plans had something different if
it's minor changes if it's just a couple
of features swap places don't worry too
much if it's a total different plan if
your product going to really move the
direction of the project significantly
step back into release planning and
create a big picture again but there's
nothing stopping you from changing your
product backlog and having a different
direction in your sprint plan as long as
you look back and say are we
significantly different from the release
from the desires then we have to talk
then we have to think are we doing the
right thing cause otherwise the toddler
steps you move into another direction
that what you wanted to go to that
answer your question
are going to note that what you release
in each iteration meeting
but can you explain that yes yes maybe
what goes on in the hydration go chase
yes and that's why yes so if you change
what has to go into an iteration you
have to replan and see if that still
fits absolutely yeah okay more questions
so estimating between ethics and actual
stories so you mentioned that the epic
stories that there is estimation that
starts how is that estimation different
than the estimation for the stories
themselves where I assume for storage of
probably using secure point system 12
because I know what my team this idea of
having a larger story that get be
composed trying to estimate to give
people some idea of what these larger in
the epic stories mean how they differ in
their estimations okay how to deal with
differences in estimations oops once I
can kind of get my flight back okay how
to deal a difference that in with
estimations for stories versus epics and
the principle is the same at epic level
story level I do have comparative
estimating story points like you
mentioned this one or t-shirt sizes or
even just saying this is as big as the
previous release or whatever and
comparative estimating the benefits come
from the fact that when you start
decomposing your your epic your big
thing into smaller smaller is easier to
estimate your stories rules of thumb
part between 10 and 20 days delivery
days and versus epics couple of months
by creating more detail you create more
accuracy the way to estimate it is still
in story points if that what what your
team uses that answer your question
it's hard to capture everything seems
like it's epic right yeah it's not it's
not usually a sentence or a specific
yeah I'd to give you an example the
question is about what an epic and how
to handle something that is larger story
of full paragraph and when I had in that
internet bank as a big blob sitting
somewhere at the bottom was adding
insurance functionality to the bank
initially they wanted current accounts
and selling mortgages and personal loans
at some point they want to sell
insurance that insurance functionality
was just sitting in the future with an
estimate of a man years work attached to
it and it had only a couple of sentences
sell insurance for when you get sick or
and unemployed for mortgages no more
detail and it was only when you started
to split up that you saw the impact on
the full system on all the stations that
I described so I wouldn't even be too
worried about the completeness or the
perfectness of the description here that
comes when the detail increases okay
other questions
okay and question is what tools are
useful here and four different different
stages in the projector we use different
tools for the actual planning what I
showed you on the screen I like the
post-it notes because it's physical
because it gets people on their feet and
it works easy and everybody can do it at
the same time so the tool is directed by
the fact that you need to collaborate
having that set if you're running teams
in two or three locations all over the
globe post-it notes don't work anymore
if you need to report up into your
manager or program director or whoever
then you start using tools small teams
could be an Excel type tool larger teams
get something professional get something
we sell one rally sells one and get a
tool that that helps you to report real
time and collect all the information
about the stories about the test the
test results the progress to burn down
that all can be helped by a tool it
depends on the scale of your project
single team for people don't go into any
overhead of massive tooling flip chart
on the wall really works and I've got
teams like that even significant teams
that answer your question okay thank you
more questions
so okay three the question is how often
to fly teams in if they are not
co-located and three to four times a
year the release planning is for me the
key moment to bring the teams together
the frequency is low enough to be
cost-effective and and it's important
enough to related apologies to related
to the previous question what happens if
your directions change from sprint to
sprint that doesn't happen too often
apologies and usually there are small
adjustments so there is no immediate
need to fly teams back in again for that
release stage that's where the big
changes take place you want everybody to
be aware of them you want everybody to
contribute to them make sense okay more
questions the role the question is that
what's the role of an architect in the
team are you are you an architect type
okay then I can stand here and an
architect helps to solve complex
problems complex in terms of it could be
cutting edge technology and it could be
so broad stretch over multiple teams all
over the globe he's the person who
oversees it all he helps I've been
working with with Jeff sadlands and his
definition is an architect is able to
code can help coding to work through a
set of problems and then steps away
again just like a tester works with the
dev team to work through a book and a
steps awake and I'm going to do is own
thing again so to meet somebody who
oversees complex issues oversees the
whole from a technological perspective
that work for you I shouldn't have asked
about architect here because you got
your hats it said God tests sorry okay
more questions this process or a project
that is population is nature and art and
question is how to use this process for
operational processes the my question to
you would be how predictable is your
operational process if it's truly
unpredictable you're managing real-time
problem system goes down somewhere in
the world that you have to run and go
fix it this little you can use of this
some of the things might help
retrospectives to look back at how did
we do in the past month etc and but it's
not really plan a ball if you work from
a maintenance list from our customers we
have got a whole list of wishes and
whole list of books that are not through
the critical that's a backlog that's a
list of things to do you can estimate
them you can decompose them you can
create a sprint around it so it's where
are you on that spectrum from totally
unpredictable to totally predictable and
that determines how much of the scrum
process you can use that help okay
more questions how we doing on time it's
about one o'clock okay thank you for
being here and good luck
