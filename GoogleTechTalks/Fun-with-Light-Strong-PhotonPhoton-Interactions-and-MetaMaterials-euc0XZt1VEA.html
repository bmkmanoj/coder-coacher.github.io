fall in Washington University in San
Luis right so today is going to talk
about his research in photonics and the
title is talk is fun with light
so this welcome dr. Zin thanks for
having me the title of my talk is a fun
way the light which is about some
interesting tricks we can play on light
specifically I will be giving two
examples the first one will be in the
condom regime and then the second one
will be in the critical region so please
feel free to stop me anytime to begin
with let's take a look at the super cool
gadget that exists that exhibit exhibit
novel light phenomena that is a light
stable so here's how to use the light
stable but you can see the lightsaber is
very unusual in many ways in particular
the light plate can strongly interact
with each other
we certainly don't see this every day in
fact light does not interact with light
at the low energy density so why is it
that that's because the light only
interact with that at very high
intensity when the intensity of light is
so strong the vacuum even the vacuum can
be excited and they'll generate create
virtual in x1 and the party song pairs
these particles are charged so they can
interact with other light and that's to
achieve the indirect light light
interaction since this only occurs at
very very high intensity of light so we
know it's very difficult to make a
lightsaber
how difficult it really is there are
many many ways to estimate for example
if we assumed the light blade is kind of
optical sorry tom
then it requires the peak intensity to
be roughly 10 to the 30th to you watt
per centimeter square so this is just a
number to understand how large this
intensity really is let's compare with
the intensities from other examples for
example a light bulb the light bulb is
about 1 watt per centimeter square as
another example ended us on the service
of the Sun the intensity is about a
thousand watt per centimeter squares as
another example in year 2005 the global
energy consumption rate is only about 10
to the 13 what the final example this
compared to the world's most powerful
lasers to be completed next year it
takes 190 to join the lasers and that
the facilities occupies three gigantic
football fields and the total power from
this 192 lasers is only 10 to the 14
watts to be focused on a target of
millimeter size so now you get it idea
it's indeed very difficult to make a
life stable on the other hand it
certainly is interesting to see if one
can induce light light interaction at a
much lower power level in particular is
of fundamental interest to achieve
strong photon photon interaction and so
let me introduce what it is a photon the
photon is the contact means that this
great part of the electromagnetic field
it carries energy and the momentum it's
just the energy wave packet and because
photons are the admit information
carriers so the capability of creating
strong
photon interaction bone is born to have
a lot of applications so here at least
some of them will come back to the list
later on when we have more recall
knowledge since we are talking about one
photon making friends with another
Photon
so I should also mention how to generate
single photons in the first place let's
take a look at the laser light the laser
light is the superposition of states
with different number of photons so with
the medicinals like it can be it's a
superposition of zero photon state one
photon state to four thousand state and
so on the square of these numbers
indicate the probability of finding in
the state in the laser light so that
means one can view the laser light as a
stream of photons the laser just emits a
stream of photons if we put a very thick
glass in front of the laser to attenuate
the light then the attenuation laser
output contains either 0 photo or 1
photon and this can be used as a single
photon source but unfortunately because
it's only attenuated so most of time you
see the output has a 0 photon and only a
small fraction of its attempt you will
see contains one photo action ok so
sometimes people demand an undemanding
and the push-button single photon source
every time you push the button then you
generate one and only one photons for
that purpose one way to for that purpose
is to use atoms for example the basic
idea is that when an excited atom jumps
back to the ground state he emits one
and only one photons and this can be
used as a push-button single photon
source of course the practical
implementation is much more elaborated
this
just shows a basic idea with no special
knowledge now let me discuss the stone
photon for our interaction using photons
to control photon of course is always a
very fascinating subject in physics
there have been many many successful
demonstrations for example in atomic
physics people have shown that they can
use one laser beam to switch on or off
of another laser beam by using atomic
tests another example is to use
nonlinear crystal which typically
requires 10 to the 10 photons for the
non-linearity to be effective on the
other hand we know that sometimes we
really need a complete solid state
system at a single photon level and that
can be implemented on chip this kind of
system is highly desired for many many
practical applications in the following
hour introduce such a system shown on
the screen is such a system this is an
atom and this is a one-dimensional wave
guide for all purpose the
one-dimensional wave card is like a
water pipe for photons the photons are
confined within this channel and the
propagate within this photon pipe the
atom in this case is a two-level system
that means it has two energy levels low
energy level and high energy level the
real implementation can be can have many
possibilities it can be an atom an iron
or other more complicated
implementations in the following hour of
genetically just called atom and I use
this symbol to represent represented
such a system it turns out that very
strong photon photon interaction can be
achieved in this one-dimensional system
in the following hour give
use some physical intuition why this is
it possible the strong photon photon
interaction is possible is result
results from two simple physical
mechanism the first one is it's
one-dimensional nature and then the
second one is the correlation induced by
an atom so let me introduce the first
one let's take a look at the wave
scattering in three dimension so if an
incoming wave comes in and the skater
and bombarding upon an atom the atom
gets excited and then decay to the
ground state that the K wave which we
call spontaneous emission that the K
wave can go into any direction allowed
and therefore in the forward direction
it's only very weak interference between
the the decay wave and the incoming wave
so that's why in whatever in laser the
spontaneous emission in three dimension
is typically counted as a lost mechanism
and it's a huge problem in LED for
example if we restrict everything in the
one-dimensional channel then the
situation will be very different here
the decay with the spontaneous emission
from the excited atom can only go back
to this one-dimensional fourth on pipe
so in every body this wave will have a
much stronger interference with the
incoming wave in the forward direction
so this is the first mechanism the
second mechanism is the correlation
induced by an atom so has a two-level
atom the two-level atom is a system that
can only have one excitation in this
regard the two-level atom is like a
chair we know that a chair can only
accommodate one person
so if Homer sits on a chair then part
cannot sit on the chair so in this sense
there's some kind of competition between
these two people
another example is that so we know that
a single chair in this sense can
and competition between people you can
easily imagine that hard would happen if
there was only one chair in this
conference room then everyone will
compete for that chair and create some
kind of in direct correlation between
people so I just introduced two simple
mechanism that allow us to generate
strong photon photon interaction in one
dimensional system now I will apply
those physical mechanism first some
mathematic matrix which I were not going
to to describe the property of the
system what we are interested is the to
4000 scattering result for example in
this one dimensional system if we send
in to green 4000 the each one is a
resonance with the atom means he has the
energy that's the matter two-level atom
then what happened for the output photon
we are interested in the energy
distribution and we are interested in
the spatial relation let me step-by-step
introduced the result we send in to
Queen Photon and then they have exactly
the same energy as a two-level atom and
here I proud in energy and the two green
photon has energy here though the in
posted I denoted it by two green balls
we are interested to see what's the
output for this to four thousand it
turns out that the two photon can if
their energy can have a spread within
some narrow range and a better
distribution for example the output
photon can become the increment to green
photons the output can be an orange
water or light blue photon and obey this
distribution we use this diagram to
represent the whole process this diagram
says that well we stand in two twin
photon
when he goes out he can be one great
photo and the one light blue photo one
or in the photo and the one light blue
photon alternatively the energy of the
two output photon can be one red and one
blue
this means the output state is the
linear superposition of all possibility
the two output photon can be one in
orange one in light blue or one in red
or anyone in blue and the such we call
this an entangled State
this means the output photons are
entangled
what is entanglement in tango is a is
some kind of long-distance connection
between physically separated two photons
and that this property has been
exploited especially in quantum
computation it has been shown that this
property can help to exponentially speed
up a certain class to compute the
solution of a certain class of problems
and it has also been shown that the
entanglement can be exploited to
transmit information in an absolute
absolute X the cure way so using those
ideas and you I just gave you some very
simple physical systems by using more
complicated system such as a multi-level
atom and the interferometer then one can
do this trick at the single photon level
for example you send in two twin photons
and that they can become green and a
light blue or if you send in two ready
for that they can combine together and
output a high energy photon in in purple
color or they can do the frequency
conversion from low to high or from high
to low and the more recently we have
shown that we can also do frequency
conversion at the single photon
that means you sending one careful
photon and that the output becomes one
red photon oh yeah because the energy
the active energy or the additional
energy needed is supplied by the atom
yes yes that's right exactly
and for this is more tricky you need to
put it in sonya interferometer for this
to be possible so i here i just all
right
some interesting possibility people can
do edit a single photon label so I just
I've just shown you that the output
photon their energy are entangled the
energy are entangled in prize their
spatial correlation are also correlated
because these two properties are
connected by Fourier transform so I will
give you some cartoon to describe this
property so here shows an ion trap and
what we are after is something called g2
function and the hot g2 function
originally I used some very plain
English to describe hot g2 function but
my friend assured me that people in
computer science
Northwest correlation function so g2
function is the second order correlation
function to investigate the temporal
poverty of the output photons so let me
describe what it really is here shows an
ion trip and I'm sure these are not
important and entropy is just something
that can check a single iron so here and
is cheb here and in reality is the
magnesium iron but that does not concern
us if we send in a stony attenuated
laser in this way then first of all we
send in to 4000 and that it gets
scattered by this iron and the go into
four is about this direction if we put a
register here and they can recall the
arrival time of these two photons and
the compute the difference between the
arrival time then we get
for this room for one sample if we
repeat this many many times
then eventually we can plot some figure
like this so here is the probability of
the of the two photons with the arrival
time as a Tau here for example this
means that if one photons arrive here
then the second photon we our neighbor
arrived at at the same time so you send
in even you send in two photon at the
same time after skater the two photon we
our neighbor arrive that register at the
same time instead there is always a
large probability that the second photon
will arrive slightly later and another
probability is a rough even later and so
on so it turns out that
three-dimensional experiment can be
described by this one dimensional
computation here shows the experimental
result and that these are just different
energy of the fourth input photo and
here is the theoretical result they face
very well the notable feature here
rather is that they are always entire
function so that means for this
three-dimensional experiment or for the
one-dimensional
experiment that you detect at the back
wall side even you send in two photon at
the same time you will enable register
the two photon arrive at at the same
time and this actually is the one chair
effect it's because the atom is like a
chair
it can only process a single photon at
one time so if the second photon want to
be scattered in the same direction it
has to wait until the first photon has
been processed so that's why you will
never see that photo and arrive at the
same time this is the typical g2
function you see in any active
Connor objects textbook
however in the forward direction the
situation is very different because in
the forward direction in addition to
these chips if in fact there's also
interference the one-dimensional
interference effect and the death brings
in new phenomena here I only show the
result for this atom if you send in two
green photons which are on resonance
means they have the same energy of this
two level atom then if you send in to
water and you detect in the forward
direction
you were almost for sure fight the two
photon arrived almost at the same time
and their probability distribution as a
function of the difference
Robottom difference looks like this and
the terminology is that these two
photons are bouncing they always like to
arrive together on the other hand if you
send in two photons with one energy
larger than a two-level atom and the one
energy slightly than the two-level atom
even you send in the 2008 at the same
time you will find out in the forward
direction they were a neighbor arrived
and at the same time later they will
arrive with with a large poverty when
there's something time distant between
them so this means by manipulating the
energy of the input photo you can
manipulate their spatial correlation you
can make them arrive either together
almost for sure or make them separate
arrive at some distance time difference
almost for sure so these things can be
exploited for further and the tool and
have some application in this in this
field for example the entanglement can
be further exploited and that they can
help in the contemn computing and
quantum communication or you can form
all kind of quantum logic gate for
a number gate that you can for example
black completely black single-photon but
if you send in two photons then the gate
we are dead pace this pair of photons
and you can also achieve out on low
power or optical switches that you can
use one photo to switch on and off
another photo or you can make some novel
out Co electronic devices such a single
photon since this transistor it has been
exploited so this concludes the first
part the quantum trick we can play on
the photon if you have any question I
can take in any culture
Oh yep yep
I mean either this or the previous one
so okay this yep so this means that no
if you send in two photon at the same
time then they were a neighbor arrived
your register at the same time so yes so
what do you mean by using in at the same
time that is in a time scale of the
single item spontaneous decay attempt so
as long as you send in two photon within
that time scale then to the then they
can be counted as a arrival at a same
time
and as I said he actually the photon is
better to be recorded but the wave
packet energy worth taking so people
usually can send in the wave packet at
almost executive status in fact the
certain principle the damage is beyond
that it's much smaller than that yeah
okay so now let's take a look another
super cool gadget the following will be
in the crazy cold light region this
create this super cool gadget also is
Davis novel light phenomena and that's
Harry Potter's invisibility cloak by
using an invisibility cloak
here Harry can make its body invisible
and this kind of device and becoming the
Invisible Man I believe is in everyone's
dream the good news is dead
theoretically this is possible at least
at some wavelengths in microwave it has
been shown and the prototype has been
shown by a group in Duke University this
sort of device manipulate light in
Cresco ways and that's the story I am
going to talk about next
here's another example of optical
illusion we have a store in a glass of
water and that the index of the water is
roughly 1.3 if somehow you feel that
glass with some kind of strange material
with index to be - 1.3 then what happen
is that you will see the store pending
in the wrong way like this so the
research about the cloaking device and
the strange material with negative
refractive index is called made her
material which is a very active research
area nowadays specifically what is
metamaterials metamaterials artificial
materials that can exhibit extraordinary
xlx or magnetic properties beyond those
available in nature this field was
pioneered by basado and the Sir John
Henry
the notion of metal makyo actually it's
kind of intuitive so here I used this
slide to describe this kind of notion
imagine that you have one second atom
and that the silicon atom has a specific
energy State
if you put many many so you can add them
together in a face centered cubic like
this and the distance between each
second atom is about five angle so very
very small then strangely at a much
larger length scale at the micron
language scale the this collection of
atom becomes transparent with some make
holes copy quantity call in ten in
preventive index it's about three point
five so which has almost has nothing to
do with this
so people have using this kind of notion
and then come up with the following idea
this they thought well if it's possible
that I can create instead of the
electronic energy level which is too
small and very difficult to engineer if
we can design some kind of I can feed
some kind of small object with
artificial electromagnetic State and
they're not only that this this smart
object is made using normal material and
you have to come up with a
three-dimensional crystal structure to
arrange them in the correct way such
that this three dimensional crystal can
exhibit exhibit something you can see
with some optical properties that it
does not exist in nature so this is the
basic idea of how to construct made her
materials it has been proven to be very
fruitful and so in some other ways
metamaterial is a way to engineer
refractive index now firstly effective
index here is a nutshell what is
the effective index the effective index
n is that it's magnitude is a measure of
how much the speed of light is reduced
so for example if you have even C is the
velocity of light in vacuum and the
absolute value of n is this then the
velocity of light the phase velocity of
light in this medium is T divided by n
everyone knows this recently people have
found out that well the refractive index
actually can all can also be negative
and that each side determines which
direction of the light to turn enter the
interface for example if this is air and
this is some kind of medium if you send
in an light in this direction then the
reflected beam can go to several
directions depending upon the size of
the refractive index of the medium if
the sign is the positive then the like
normal material then the reflective pin
will go into this direction so what you
see is that unless the light beam coming
in and then in a normal direction and
coming out on the other hand if the
index is negative then the pimp will
bent in the wrong way so what you will
see is that if this is such much
material then you send in a laser beam
you will infect it to the wrong
direction and coming out this also shows
the what the story look like in such
medium if we look more deeply then the
reflect in the effective index is also
the response to the EMF of the material
specifically the index actually is the
square root of two quantities one
quantities major the la election measure
the response of the material to the
electric field and another quantity
majors the response of the material to
the magnetic field
specifically this number measures how
large is actually a typo you have in
your material and that this quantity
majors how large the current roof you
have in your material so using those
kind of basic idea we can describe the
cloaking device of something that
special they had spatially varying
refractive index profile for example
here is Harry and that this is the
bedrock and this is your eye and what
you see is the bedrock so that means
people have been trying to construct
such cloaking device that this for
example this is Harry's part body and
this is something the cloaking device
with a special profile of the index n
such that the break room like it's
rerouted I passed the party and get into
your eye - for your eyes to see the
backlog so this is the basic idea of the
cloaking device here shows the prototype
which is made at Durham University here
I show the prototype of metal material
with negative refractive index I would
like to mention that this material also
help to realize something called perfect
lens or super lens which is some very
special lens can see very very clearly
by press p.m. the diffraction limit in
the following our focus on something of
our own research that we can make some
metal material with very high index what
value is high so let's take a look at
the index of normal material the victim
is one area roughly one and no water at
room temperature is 1.3 and at the
diamond is roughly 2
point four and a second is a roughly 3.5
and these are all and that you is you
can there are very very few transparent
material with index more than this
number so if you have you can conserve
some material with index higher than
this number then you can call it high
index metal material in the following
I'm going to introduce high index meta
material which is also broadband in the
isotropic this kind of meta material is
a desired in many fields and has many
applications for example using them to
fabricate as a platform to fabricate
then it has application in for example
the photography and the imaging where
house the more you can see is the
inverse proportional to the effective
indexed it's proportional to 1 over N
and also you can use it to stop
the broadband slower light so we know
the velocity of the light is a C over N
so if you have some large n then you can
stop light people have been trying to
stop light for a long long time
so I believe someone in the audience
probably have the force they please use
the Force to put it back people have
been trying to process the light but
light servoz servoz too fast so it's
always desirable to slow or even stop
light and with broadband material then
you can stop light not just at a single
frequency or narrow frequency but at a
fairly broad frequency range and also
using this kind of material you can form
a compact filter because of the linear
side of a filter roughly the resonance
is wrong for you one is the one is
roughly 1 over N and also you are
enhance the sensitivity in
interferometers you will also increase
the cross-section of an object if what
you are in after into say radar sensor
so in afar in our first give you a
simple example to show how to form a
one-dimensional also highly effective
index metal material it turns out to be
very simple here we have metal plate put
in the periodic fashion and then the
distance the periodicity T and then the
distance between of the gap a are in the
tip sub wavelength region here is the
wave length so you can also think in
this a venetian bright venetian pride is
like a Venetian problem if you shine
light in this direction then this cape
each cap we have like a capacitor and
which is also like electric dipole
moment so in the tundra in the end if
you shine light in this direction then
connectivity this excitation give you
very strong electric dipole response and
this exists exactly this type of
response give you a very large
effective index it turned out that for
this system with periodicity and the gap
size a the refractive index is P over a
so if you arrange dates for the T is the
30 and the a is 1 then you can get
something with a reflective index equal
to 30 which of course does not exist in
nature and moreover this number is
frequency independent is entirely
controlled by the geometry here we know
that a dielectric slab here I showed
some numerical evidence that is indeed
high index meta material here the D over
a is 16 and that if you shine light on
it here is the comparison for a real
material with n equal to 16 and then you
straight light on it the transmission
spectrum are almost the same and if you
use this material to do the wave guiding
you can see they are almost the same and
here shows the FTT t some kind of brute
force simulation you can also see that
previously are almost the same and the
moreover this has been experimentally
verified by some group in German so that
one dimensional high index meta material
but sometimes for many application a
three-dimensional object is desired the
stay for three dimensional
generalization however does not work you
will sing well is it using I have made
hope I put metal cube in this cubical
latest in periodic way and if you are
trying
electric field in this direction they
will have type electric type or response
and the many many of them together this
should give you a high index meta
material however it turns out this this
kind of arrangement has only have an
index equal to roughly one point 4h
fairly low if you look more closely you
will find out well the epsilon which
measures the electric response indeed is
high because you have this dipole
response but the magnetic response
actually is small it's only about point
one is a ten times smaller than the
vacuum so why is it is so let's look
more closely if you take one unit cell
out of this 3-dimensional structure then
if we put we will import electric field
then this metal cube will have induced
charge positive and negative this
induced charge give you electric dipole
response and so that's why in this kind
of system you expect to have large
epsilon because you have large
electrical response on the other hand if
you impose magnetic field for such
system then because of lenses law they
will have induced current in the
direction and that is exactly because of
this current loop counter parents this
effect to to give you a small you little
strong diamagnetic response to reduce
your meal because in its epsilon times
nu so this is enhanced but this is
reduced so in the end you don't gain too
much out of this if you realize this
then you also realize that epsilon and
the MU actually can be contoured
independently for example for the same
metal cube if you cut out the middle
regime and you still impose in actual
field because the area is roughly the
same so you still get roughly the same
amount of induced charge and therefore
the electric response for such system
will be roughly the same as this one
however if you impose magnetic field
because the area in the middle regime is
much reduced so the current loop is also
much reduced so the
you will not be affected that much so
you would expect that this system has
still get high episode but ammu will not
be affected too much if you understand
this well you say I can place further
I just cut even more then if you still
impose in extra field then because they
are the area under the sight of these
fingers they are also induced charge so
in the end the the net electric dipole
response is still roughly the same as
this one roughly the same as in this one
but as you can easily see the current
loop the area is further reduced so the
MU is not effective that much that means
in this direction the episode is
increased in this direction the MU does
not change very much and still close to
1 so in beauty um then together then you
get high in metal material out of this
construction of course this construction
is highly anisotropic it only works in
this direction if what you are after is
some isotropic material then you can use
several copies of them to form one unit
cell for example if you use this these
are just existing copies they just
oriented in different directions if you
use these two then you can form a two
dimensional made her material with high
end if you use the three copies of them
together using this as a unit cell and
put many of them periodically then you
get a three-dimensional metal material
with a very high refractive index if you
want to further increase the refractive
index and you get my point then you know
how you should to you just cut this so
that the structure becomes finer and
finer then you can get even higher
refractive index so here shows the
result here indicates roughly how fine
your structure is as you can see from
here to here
then the N from 20 to roughly 30 and
then the MU for these structures are
almost unchanged close to one so for
this structure the N is roughly 5.5 it's
a transparent or depend isotropic and
this kind of material does not exist in
nature and there's no fundamental limit
for this not only fundamental limit is
it how fine you can make this structure
if you can make it finer then the index
can go even higher and that this
mechanism after me to emphasize this
mechanism works from microwave up to
roughly medium parade so in this short
talk I described two interesting tricks
we can play on light the first one is in
the quantum regime and I show you how to
make strong photon photon interaction at
ultra low power level and that they have
many applications the second one is
about some trick we can play uncritical
light it's about metal material and the
in particular I introduce you how to
generate metal material with ultra-high
reflective index and with that I will
stop my talk here and I take any
question in my head thank you
the effective index yeah okay second
infection oh no no no what I show is the
recross FD she's easy thought here
already you use dead
you mean one-dimensional C dimension yep
so for three dimension because this
structure is smaller than the wavelength
and that the result already taken to all
kind of path or reflection it's taken
into account
oh yeah sure
so okay yep so the question is I
mentioned high index meta material has
anyone look at the metamaterial with
index more than one the answer is yes
and the construction is like this maybe
I think about it you use metal wire and
you put many of them together metal wire
and that is connected then for certain
direction they've their optical response
is like there are a material with index
smaller than 1 and that of course is an
isotropic we don't have an isotropic
metamaterial within smaller than one yet
yep so here I have to Emma set C over n
is the velocity of light it's the phase
velocity of light so the phase velocity
of light can be much faster than C
there's no fun for example if I have
it's a typical product if I have a fresh
and they assume it doesn't attenuate it
come a far way and I then like that does
not contradict any physical theory what
cannot exceed C is the group velocity
its consists of many many wave together
so it's a wave packet the wave packet
can carry information and it cannot go
beyond C by each phase can go beyond C
so in smaller one the phase can larger
can be faster than C but you can be
proved that the wave packet the group
velocity is smaller than C you ok
so listen if you can observe the face
then actually tell you something the
information so the answer is that you
cannot observe them how do you observe
it's always the global velocity yeah and
that incidentally there so they bring up
something else so in recent years people
have been observed something called
faster than light experiment but those
also does not counsel it with any
physical theory basically what is
involved is the more like the path
shaping you have a path or the path of
is not does not stop abruptly here so
the tail can come into your system and
then you somehow you can amplify it then
a
and it looks like the way of coming in
before it spear coming in you observe it
so instead if you analyze it carefully
there's no no consultation
