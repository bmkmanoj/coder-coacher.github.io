special guest Joan Smalls joins an
expert on software development dating
back many years till Marnie we worked at
Microsoft and design EBA has remember
the XLT it's also working at juno online
services on the internet client and a
little bit more recently co-founded fog
creek software and is co-creator of
stackoverflow.com he's also got a
popular website has been translated into
over 30 languages he's written four
books about software development and
he's here to talk to us today about
something else he's an expert yeah which
is communities in the dynamics and the
anthropology of communities and I would
say we are so thrilled here google above
the existence of stack overflow and
that's something that's really one of
the fundamentals of how we do developer
support and how we
relations is going out of participating
in the conversation there are several
compa so with that I'll hand you over to
Joel thank you John thanks
so this talk is called can I walk around
yes i'm not sure what I'm what I'm
attached to this talk is entitled the
cultural anthropology of stack exchange
anybody take anthropology in college I
had I was the worst class I ever took it
was class called cultural anthropology
because I found it to be unbelievably
boring and there was all this stuff
about Trobriand Islanders and there was
a tribe somewhere that exchanged
blankets called potlatch blankets this
is a canadian thing and there was kind
of a lot of stuff that i found
unbelievably irrelevant and boring and
then i discovered that this turned out
to be my day job actually studying
studying anthropology especially as it
applies online so the stack exchange
network is 266 million page views every
month 25 million global monthly uniques
it's one way we have accounting it we
have another way of counting it or just
50 million uniques I like that way
better but let's go 25 million different
people visit every single month if we
were a country we would be up there with
some of those reputable countries with
governance
really good not really an impressive
list if we were a state we would
probably be the third largest eight and
we're about to break about the past
Texas so that's why the only way you can
study this large group of people is kind
of the tools of anthropology the tools
of cultural anthropology studying of
people and what they try to make and how
they create from the smallest group
which is just a group of people that
come together to do something
temporarily temporarily and then disband
to you know larger city side like groups
now when I started programming a long
time ago that's me now just kidding we
had these tape drives it now we thought
we thought the computing was about
computing like getting a number getting
a result like solving a problem using a
computer and you know you felt like you
were lucky if you could somehow managed
to create computer software that at the
end of the day you know ran the payroll
you know at least once every two weeks
when the payroll was due and if you
actually got payroll numbers or tax
reports or whatever then you then you
felt like you had it you would
accomplish something but then people
invented time-sharing in the 60s and and
and I actually got my start sort of in
this generation and so this is a little
printing terminal called the deck writer
and they were very popular and it would
hook up with a it had to be a 300 baud
modem because any faster than that and
the printhead couldn't keep up even
though there were faster modems probably
already being invented they came up with
a decorator later version of the
decorator that could do 1200 baud and
and multiple people were online at once
for the first time instead of doing the
batch jobs and that meant that all of a
sudden you had the possibility of
communication but 300 baud was still too
slow to put large amounts of text so you
didn't really have conversations email
hadn't yet been invented until the first
terminals came out the first what they
called this was called a smart terminal
because it had the ability to move the
cursor
if a vt100 was sort of a classic of this
era and they could go up to 1200 baud or
even 9600 baud later and so actually
that starts to be about as fast as your
eyes can read I would say most people
read it about 2400 baud and it started
to become reasonable to imagine doing
things like sending email so email was
invented and the first versions of
online support groups in the first ways
that people communicated in groups
online we're just extensions of email at
Google Groups to this day you know you
can trace it all the way back to use net
and use net you can trace all the way
back to this idea of just sending around
mailing lists where there would be some
stupid demon that would just receive
email and another at one address and
send it out to people according to a
list right a mailer demon so using that
was really interesting because when I
used to use net a lot in college now
it's almost completely gone except for
distributing illegal things but it was
this is a fairly late version of using
the Usenet software TRN the threaded rn
rn sensor read news and up in the
right-hand corner you can actually see
the thread and the idea of the thread
being that you know conversation can
have a parent and multiple conversations
can have multiple parents it's all
wonderful for computer scientists not
for regular people but one of the things
that I noticed about usenet was a very
interesting phenomenon I know it's going
to be hard to see this in the back but
you would get these conversations that
showed artifacts of the software okay so
this is kind of introduced is a
conversation on talk politics that
mideast which i participated in for
about a month until it went into a loop
and then in never got out of but an
interesting thing to notice is when you
hit our to reply to a message in in in
the RN program the first thing you have
to know about usenet is it's not
client-server it's it was a totally
distributed system meaning everybody
just connected to each other and sent
each other any message they hadn't
already seen and every node would didn't
have enough people hard drives we were
expensive and so the average use net
node would have maybe three days worth
of archives and throw away everything
older than three or four days they would
keep enough so that you could go away
for the weekend come back on Monday and
not have missed anything but they very
rarely did anybody have a big enough
hard drive to keep a whole week worth of
usenet
or two weeks so which is one reason why
it was so hard to assemble the Usenet
history because it was never in one
place because you when you're applying
to a message if there's a probability
that the person who's seeing your reply
does not have access anymore to the
thing that you were replying to that
makes it hard to have a conversation and
so people started quoting the message
that they were replying to and then the
software said hey let's let's make that
a feature of the software to make that
easy so when you hit hit R which meant
reply you got this thing and still
happens in some email clients where the
message you were responding to every
single line got a little greater than in
front of it saying this is what I'm
replying to and what people did when
confronted with this software is
interesting they would then go
intersperse their own comments in
between the other people's comments and
it was very easy to follow it was going
on because the greater thence were the
original message and then you could have
your nit picky little answers
interspersed on every single sentence
and so here you have clearly this is
nonsense this is clearly nonsense this
is nonsense this nonsense etc you what
you would do is you would pick about
pick apart someone's argument by picking
apart every sentence of their argument
which is a certain type of culture it
was very popular on Usenet the nit picky
culture still still exists on the
internet and turn places today i believe
and and the bloggers later we invented
this and they called it fisken if you're
a blogger but this particular style is
an artifact it's an accidental thing
that happened because the software
happened to behave in a particular way
and what's interesting is until you
start noticing that the culture is
acting according to the software then
you may forget to design the software in
a way that makes the culture work so
this is at Moscone Center actually and
it's just a sort of an architectural
image that shows the concept of if you
build something in a certain shape the
people will go into that shape and that
happens in architecture all the time
sometimes it's accidental you happen to
have a nice curve that's awesome for
skateboarding and you'll get kids
skateboarding well this is a little bit
more intentional where if you build a
table that looks like it might be the
right size for a chess board
got an eight by eight grid hundred and
you put two things the shape of humanoid
chairs on either side then old men will
come and sit down and play chess
whatever you build somebody will find a
way to come use it in the way that you
built it sometimes completely not
intentionally this is the Spanish Steps
in Rome where you'll see people come in
and just sort of hang out sitting on
those steps it was built because there
are two roads at different heights and
they need to be connected can't be
connected with the road it would be too
steep so they built steps but actually
that turns out to be a really good place
to sort of sit down if you're a teenager
or a backpacker and get your hair
braided by gypsies because it's just a
sort of perfect physical environment for
that and then you can copy it so in
Times Square they built the staircase
don't go anywhere in hopes that
backpackers and gypsies would come sit
down there if you don't know if you're
not paying attention here sort of what
happened on software we had usenet and
then we everything move to the web and
they said well let's not use nntp
there's our protocol anymore and they
started building these web versions of
usenet and the web versions of usenet
which are still out there all over the
place today there's a software called v
Bolton PHP vb there's a whole bunch of
these packages they're actually just
copying using it they work in the same
way except that they have the smiley
face that rolls to the left and the
right when you enter a rolling smiley
face command but other than that the
they are functionally equivalent to use
net which is an accidental design that
actually literally came from email so
look nothing has been sort of innovated
here so if you want to be utopian I
don't know why I have this picture here
I guess this is a utopian picture you
have to you have to actually design this
stuff a little bit intentionally that's
what we started to do its stack exchange
I feel like we're about ten percent of
the way there and I just want to show
you some examples of how we've done this
at stack overflow and in Stack Exchange
over the year over the four years that
we've been out and in business all right
so one thing which we focus very much on
is what is your first impressions does
anybody know this is a picture of
anybody Occupy Wall Street it's already
starting to be historical but they're
still there and there's a lot of clues
obviously besides the well it's on Wall
Street so that helps if you saw that
little thingy there
like this this fellow here who one of
these days is going to cost me after one
of these events I don't know who it is
but he's got a Zapata t-shirt which is
awesome I don't know if he knows who
that is he probably knows he's got sort
of it just like it's kind of like a
Kaffir but it's like interesting colors
bright colors here we have a person who
loves a ninety nine percent with really
really expensive headphones that's okay
it's just all kinds everybody is like
trying to sort of put out their signals
as to who they are what they believe in
because they want to attract more people
like them to their cause right so what's
the first impression that we got AI sent
Jeff Atwood out and I said when we
started this project four years ago more
than four years ago I said go look at
some Q&amp;amp;A sites that are out there
because here's my idea it's different
and what he found was a yahoo answers is
the big one answers com is also pretty
big this is Yahoo Answers what's your
first impression of Yahoo Answers this
is that screen show the home page I took
at some point what do you I use to clean
out my coffeemaker what is your favorite
plant of all time anyone up for a food
drink true/false survey what are you
listening to what kind of questions are
these I mean their questions right they
have question marks sometimes what are
you listening to what is the last thing
you ate can I die from car carbon
monoxide no no it's okay
is the clue all the way at the bottom I
keep forgetting to do my homework that's
the clue the secret clue does anybody
know the secret yahoo answers it well
it's like they're 12 they're latchkey
kids it's really really active in the
afternoon when kids get home from school
especially girls because this they have
no permanent identity here this it's not
like Facebook where you set up an
identity and then people can be creepy
you can be totally anonymous and then
you could just be another person
tomorrow when you ask a different
question so Yahoo Answers became a chat
room for teenagers and when you look at
the website you would be deterred from
using yahoo answers for any purpose
other than talking about how to you know
what you're listening to here's answers
com again what kind of attorney is
needed for advice on getting someone you
know committed to a mental institution I
like that question that's a good
question so never mind what supplies his
us get from Ghana I don't know cares
another clue what are some examples of a
welcome address for jas prom jas prom
anybody it's not JavaScript that's what
I thought there is no JavaScript prom
this is a this is obviously a kid that
is so young that they don't even get
that this prom that they have at their
school called the J as prom it's not
like a universal internet thing it's
just specific to their school or they
don't get to be the Internet is a
universal thing either way once again
what's going on here is this is for kids
what is the rights of McDonald's that's
that's a good one ask vil amazon bought
this little site called SQL and then
proceeded to ignore it how can I start
making the right choices in my life what
is the 21 largest states what is the
interval sort of met this is actually a
question at least that makes some sense
and the answer is like this is homework
we don't do homework questions here
so again what's the first impression on
stackoverflow the first impression on
stackoverflow is if you're a programmer
you get that these are program or
questions you're like oh look it's full
of programmer questions if you're not a
programmer you don't understand a single
thing and you leave which is a good
thing this is what we want here's a one
of our sites in the network of 90 stack
exchange sites for Jewish life and
learning again unless you actually went
to a yeshiva and studied sort of
extensive extensively into the details
of Orthodox Jewish law you probably
don't even understand the questions
because they're written in a special
language called yeshiva English which
has pretty much replaced Yiddish it's
English but I mean every all those words
or he would take this one is it possible
to have comments on the shabbos directly
after pesach in English that would be is
it possible are you permitted to eat
leavened bread on the Sabbath which
immediately follows pass over so I can
translate that to English but it's not
in English why isn't it in English
because you're trying to push away the
people that don't speak achieve English
because this is not only is it a site
for Jewish life and learning as
advertised it's actually kind of
Orthodox right and we actually kind of
don't really want conservative on
educated Jews hanging out here that's
not my decision I mean ok I found it a
conservative k boats I'm as strong but
but I also went to yeshiva and I get
what's going on here cross-validated is
a site about statistics comparing two
methods of sampling from bi-rite again I
don't understand it but if you're into
statistics you immediately recognized
you immediately say okay this is a real
statistic site like this is for people
that actually do statistics understand
it and know it now Asheville does have
sections so to be fair I tried to go
into the Asheville math section and see
what was going on what they had going on
in their math section write an algorithm
to find the number in between 7 100
which is actually visible by ok apply
for apartments online ask what does that
tell you ask 13 hours ago it's span what
else what does it tell you though nobody
cares like nobody's cleaning up the spam
here so nobody goes here right justice
still spam and nobody's cleaned it up
what is the size of a plot in the
Caribbean I like that question these are
the full text I think 40 maybe 50 ok ok
so here's my problem i'm 20 years old
didn't really attend high school and no
only super basic math meaning plus
alright so if you're a math professor of
fields medallist or a math professor at
Berkeley you don't go to that site you
go to this one this is our math site we
got another we got we have we have two
math sites because some mathematicians
if bifurcated this is like PhD level
mathematics again I can't understand a
single thing there I don't even know
what they're talking about I barely
understand the tags you know in terms of
knowing about areas of mathematics but
we have two sites math overflow has a
rule that if a math professor is likely
to know the answer to your question
don't ask it on math overflow because
it's math overflow is for research level
questions kind of things that most
people probably don't know the answer to
otherwise you have to go to math stack
exchange which as you can see is liberal
in just a while it allows anybody to ask
any kind of crappy math question that
they want on there so once again it's
all about like what's that first
impression that you give I this is two
random picture that i took this is you
can there's a few things going on here
you can immediately tell there's some
kids they're playing ultimate frisbee
this is Gail because it looks like Yale
there's no leaves on the trees which
means it's winter and yet they're
wearing shorts so it's either the first
day of spring or more likely they're
Californians because they're playing
ultimate frisbee and they also kind of
look like jocks to me actually based on
you know there are the sunglasses and
the backwards baseball cap and all that
kind of stuff when you see this seen
walking you're walking down on campus
and you see these kids you immediately
say oh my god i want to join that
because i am a Californian at Yale who
plays ultimate frisbee and I'm kind of a
jock or there's a million things that
turn you off it doesn't matter but
everything about a community either
draws people into that community or
pushes them away and so many people in
web design have been trying to figure
out how do we make a webpage that sucks
every single person in the known
universe in
and when you're trying to get expert
answers to difficult questions that is
the opposite problem you actually want
to drive away as many morons as you
possibly can hopefully as quickly as as
possible all right so this is that was
one big area that's some first
impressions and that's really important
thing to us it's that exchange number
two voting obviously is an important
part of stack exchange breeze through
this because you're all familiar with
this questions are voted up answers are
even voted up here's some hot questions
from the previous week people can vote
up the questions they like they vote
down the questions they don't like they
vote up the answers that they like
that's really cool because it sorts the
answers in the order of how good they
are but what it also means is you can't
have random conversations because the
quotes keep getting cold out of context
so you can't get into a back-and-forth
argument on Stack Exchange you can in
the comments but will delete that but
you can't get into a back-and-forth
argument cuz those are those back and
forth arguments are useless you're not
creating a useful artifact to the
Internet voting is mostly important
because it leads to reputation
reputation is this thing that tells you
do I trust people is this this is Colin
Powell this is what the US army calls
fruit salad that he's wearing she tells
you all kinds of useful stuff about who
he's been in what campaigns he's been on
and his reputation is he's got four
little silver stars on his Paulette and
we got the same thing I ever you hear
some top users from Stack Overflow by
reputation jon skeet you may know works
for you guys in London oh oh my god he's
here
well one thing that's interesting to
notice here I'd never notice this until
we started putting locations on this
site mark bouvelle who works for us now
Forest of Dean I don't know where that
is it's in never-never-land summer
middle-earth UK and we don't care he's
just a brain in a box of types code for
us it's awesome ruin France Chris ow
Madison Wisconsin New Jersey France Alex
Martelli he's out here he actually works
here at this office has probably heard
this speech three times but other than
Alex I don't think there's anyone here
in California very very little
participation from the Silicon Valley
guys I don't know what those little uh
badges that you were seeing when you
start out on the site you start with a
little teeny tiny badge and it this is
somebody who is they've made a name keek
matter they haven't customized their
avatar so we gave them something based
on their IP address we gave them some
some triangles and you start out with
one reputation which you get for
successfully typing your name but you
start to earn more and more reputation
as people vote you up and so volus there
has two hundred and eight points and and
also some little badges there's a little
silver badge and some little bronze
badges there and we'll also let you
customize your avatar and the accept
rate one point we're trying to encourage
people to accept answers that were good
and so we're displaying also what
percentage of answer is that you accept
and you can earn sort of more and more
points Daniel Hill Garth year it's hard
to see but his avatar is displayed with
a drop shadow and the drop shadow is the
subtle hint that if you move your mouse
over that you get like a little
customized profile that shows up so when
you earn I believe 10,000 rep you start
to get the right to customize the
profile that shows up when somebody
Mouse's over you and there's John and
you can tell me what date this is from
based on when I took the screenshot
based on when you had 400 only 400 3000
rep march and
and you're just about to hit 3,000
badges over there and that good except
rate as well but you could actually go
higher than jon skeet which is you can
become a moderator and that's an elected
position and mostly a burden that
involves having to spend a lot of time
on the site deleting bad behavior
instead of answering questions and and
then you get this little extra little
diamond that shows up next to your name
so that's all the flare people wear a
flair for all kinds of reasons it's an
important part flare that you wear in in
real life this this fellow I think eyes
got five things going on here which you
may need to notice he's got the
Confederate flag on his cap which I have
to explain when I'm outside the United
States what that means he's got a lot of
tattoos and I won't even try to explain
what each other tattoos means i'm sure
they mean something he's got big muscles
he's wearing a tank top or a wife beater
as we call it he's got a spare tank top
in case the main primary tank top fails
for some reason and a harley-davidson
Mike buckle so just think about all the
things that he had to think of in the
morning when he was like I'm going to go
outside and I'm going to project this
image of myself and you know he sort of
decorated himself Shah of Iran style in
a way just to sort of kind of festoon
himself with all this little graphics so
that's an important thing that happens
in real life we do it in sac exchange to
we've got these badges the badges are
interesting because the first thing
people say to me about badges is like I
don't really care about badges who cares
about badges and sort of stupid how do
you get people they care about badges
they're not worth anything a better the
badges probably motivate maybe one
percent of their participate
participants in our site very very small
number of people that actually say I
want to earn this badge but everybody on
the site knows about them and all you
have to do is sort of imagine that one
person is seeing your flair to actually
care about it and the neat thing about
the badges is that they they tell
everybody the behavior that we want to
incentivize even if they're not directly
incentivizing it so there's all kinds of
things that are norms of stack exchange
and we have communicated to the world
hey these are norms because we give you
badges for them and so if you were ever
wondering whether you're allowed to ask
your own question then just go look
you'll see that there's a badge that you
can earn for asking your own question if
you've ever wondered
if we think it's a good idea to ask a
question that was asked two years ago
will you earn a badge for that and so
it's a sort of way of saying hey all of
these are behaviors that we want to see
on the site reputation translates into
jobs actually and so the monetization
scheme if you could call it that of
stack overflow is to show jobless things
to people and because we have this large
audience of people that use Stack
Overflow we know what they know we know
what they're good at you know we can we
can fill positions very well all right
government every every culture of three
or more people has some kind of
government two or more people one one
person in a dog says government there's
always all kinds of kind of rules around
there where we try to push a lot of the
simple governance the policing onto the
population and so as you earn reputation
on Stack Overflow we decide basically
all right you know how the system works
and so we can let you do stuff to self
moderate so that the community can sort
of self moderate itself in many ways so
for example if you have 1500 reputation
you can create a tag if you have 10,000
reputation you can vote to delete a
question which has already been closed
etc etc so as you earn more and more
reputation you get rights to do stuff on
the site and that's sort of the mass you
know the terrorism of the population
terrorizing itself trying to think of
what Kafka story that corresponds to you
anyway but the government also another
interesting thing is well let me do a
poll in this room how many people in
this room you stack overflow in any way
shape or form ok every way how many
people have been on meta stack overflow
if you look around that's about ten
percent it's much smaller meta stack
overflow is the place where the actual
policies of the site it's the site about
stack overflow are discussed and it's
sort of the back room if you're really
deeply involved deeply interested you
may actually also be interested in going
on there to see kind of how the things
govern themselves and this is sort of
the equivalent of you know the the civic
society kind of kind of club or whatever
where people talk
behind the scenes and then there's an
even deeper level which how many people
have been on our chat system that is 34
so this is the teachers lounge and this
is where the 275 moderators on the
network hang out and there is a chat
system there anybody can go in there and
make rooms and have conversations out
there but again it's sort of the the
highest level of deep dark engagement in
Stack Overflow as you become bored with
the boring little question answer game
that we gave you this is a place where
you can actually sort of talk about
things and that's actually where the
live government has and this is actually
where you'll see live decisions being
taken and discussed by moderators about
how to moderate certain things we've
also got a blog and the blog is all
about sort of promulgating the decrees
from from a stack overflow with stack
exchange central and we have laws so let
me talk about law because every society
has its rules the government government
essentially comes up with a laws we only
have one important rule which is we hate
fun that's this is the logo of stack
overflow hates fun and and we hate fun
is all about how there are millions of
things you're not allowed to do on Stack
Overflow especially anything that you
might enjoy them I popular or they might
get on hacker news or or or read it and
that comes from sort of an observation
that there's a lot of things you can do
in discussion groups online that don't
really leave a useful artifact behind on
the Internet so a very very important
observation which I have to keep
repeating again and again and again cuz
nobody gets it but this is the most
important thing if somebody asks you
about the design principle is a stack
overflow stack exchange most important
thing you have to remember is that a
question is asked by one person it's
answered by let's say 1245 people
usually but it's viewed by hundreds of
people and hundreds of people will get
benefit from that question out of just
that one person who asked for it so if
you ask us who are optimizing for it's
not the person asking the question it's
not the people answering the questions
all we although we want them both to be
someone happy we're doing this all for
the hundreds of people you know a very
fundamental part of the initial design
direction of stack overflow is that
Google
is the user interface the stack overflow
you are on our site because you typed a
question on google i used to say search
engines google is our user interface you
typed a question on google and you found
a page and if we have inventory there it
has to be really good and that means
everything is optimized for creating
this great artifact this historical
record and the biggest problem with
using that and the old PHP would be
sites and experts whatever it was called
can't remember and all kinds of other
sites that we're out there the biggest
problem is that the inventory that they
had to give Google was just these
crystallized captured old conversations
that took place a long time ago and
there were all kinds of things that were
wrong about it first of all it was a
conversation in a conversation you see
this back and forth and you see this
ridiculous hey did anybody does any know
how to solve this problem I don't know
but did you try x yeah that didn't work
well did you try this other thing look I
already asked you if you see it and I
said am I think that it okay hey does
anybody know the answer this is now
answer number 17 hey does anybody know
the answer because I'm having the same
problem one year later and and then if
you do get an answer it's on page seven
and it's wrong and it involves some kind
of a cross-site scripting vulnerability
when you copy the code so if you're not
thinking about creating a useful
artifact and then google also has
incidental problem which is that the
older of pages the more respectable it
looks to page rank and so did these a
lot of times you would search for things
and and they would get you answers that
were just really old and that we're
crystallizing that we're not even close
to being the actual solution to the
problem so so we started optimizing
around that we said you gotta vote you
got to stop having conversations you
gotta you gotta have everything be
editable because for us it's the
artifact that we're creating a lot like
Wikipedia you know there are people
asking questions and there are people
answering them but the goal is for the
300 people that find that question later
to be able to get a good answer so we
have these things called close reasons
and people hate us because we close
questions and like this is the end of
stack overflow it's going to all
collapse because you moderators are
heavy-handed and you're closing all
kinds of useful stuff that would have
been fun or entertaining or had
thousands of page views or went all the
way to number one on hacker news
and we actually have five reasons for
closing a question specifically and
these are the 5 i'm going to talk about
them they're mostly non obvious all
right exact duplicate pretty obvious but
what remember the reason we closed
duplicates is because as long as we're
trying to create a record for how to
solve a particular problem we want to
create that record in one single place
because then you have everybody going to
that page and it can be more canonical
it can be more useful and more helpful
if you have a hundred eyes on that
question instead of 50 eyes on this one
and 50 eyes on that one the question is
just going to get better and better over
time so here's an example of an exact
duplicate question can anyone explain
monads and then that goes off to another
page and it goes into great detail on
that we don't get a lot of things closes
exactly because they really have to be
exact if you have a slightly different
question we do want to answer it okay
this is what we call off topic toilet
issue in my company not strictly a
programming problem but any help will be
appreciated I have a lady employee who
is joining the company tomorrow and I
want to convey her a message that the
bathroom facilities at the office are
out of order how do I tell her to
relieve herself before arriving in the
morning so that is technically not a
programming question
and well it may be important to you and
this is you know a respected member of
our site we're not going to answer it
sorry it doesn't long sight off topic
people generally understand what that
means to be off topic although we we
have a rather narrow definition of on
topic okay not constructive again this
is the word not constructive is not
clear what that means to people question
is not a good fit to hour format we
expect answers to involve facts
references specific expertise this
question will likely solicit opinion
debate arguments polling or extended
discussion those are all the things we
hate once again opinion debate arguments
polling extended discussion they're
great things but they do not create an
artifact they do not create a useful
resource that anybody can learn from if
you've ever seen one of these emacs
versus vim or mac vs windows this one is
web forms vs mbc developer if you've
ever seen one of these debates on the
internet they always look so fun but
they're not and they're not interesting
and what's interesting about these
debates is they get heated and the
heated then it draws a crowd because
everybody wants to see the fight because
you've evolved if there's something
dangerous going on a tiger is eating a
person you have evolved to pay close
attention to that tag you're eating the
person that is way more important than
you know the people being friendly over
there you pay attention to the tiger and
so the stuff that draws in the page
views on the internet is conflict and
it's useless as an artifact it's fun to
participate in so go to a hacker news or
wherever else where go elsewhere buy a
subscription on experts exchange and
have your debates but on our site that's
not we're trying to do and so we want
things that can be answered that are
useful that have answers we don't want
which is better X or Y we don't want
shopping questions which video monitor
should i buy that stuff believe it or
not I know you need to know which in a
video monitor you should buy and I know
that the or display adapter and I know
that the the programmers on Stack
Overflow all have amazing opinions about
this and they're great people to ask but
you can't do it on our site because
you're going to make a useless piece of
crap that's going to come up in
somebody's google results and I'm going
to be pissed off because they will have
wasted time so we closed them is not
constructive now not not a real question
is another rule neat ideas about mobile
apps android iphone
which had never been created before
thanks for the help please I mean this
is kind of a you can see how it's a
question it's got a question mark and
stuff and he's going to get a lot of
answers probably I think but you know
this is what we call the question is
ambiguous Big and complete overly broad
rhetorical you know one thing we have is
we basically say if your question is one
sentence and the correct answer would be
a book just don't answer don't ask it
because I wouldn't want to see that that
those questions on our site okay I'm
missing a bracket somewhere thank you
recognize this book is question this
this is we have a weird terminology for
that we call this too localized that's
because Jeff Atwood doesn't know
anything about localization or
internationalisation so he used that
word for another purpose which is a
question that really only applies to one
person in one circumstance is never
going to apply again once again to the
global Internet audience it's just not
going to be useful to anybody ever and
so sorry don't ask it we're not your
debugger a great question would be i am
using such and such a programming
language with such and such a debugger
what's the easiest way to find missing
parentheses that's a great question you
know or how how would you approach
finding this missing parentheses with it
that's a good question i'm sure it's in
there and i'm sure you've got a good
answer but find it for me it's like no
go away no way this is the other example
i give people that are not programmers
of a to localized question why is there
a green honda civic parked on my street
I don't know is it still there go check
where do you live um so this is Seoul
Korea stack overflow stack exchange 25
million people so is about 20 million
people in the population of soul and so
the number of things that are going on
in like one of the world's largest
cities that's essentially what happens
on Stack Exchange and as you can tell
there's certain things that are common
denominators I mean really everybody in
Seoul speaks Korean except me when I was
there but everyone else does and and yet
there's you know lots of high-rises and
lots of low buildings there's all kinds
of different cultures there's all kinds
of subcultures there's also some things
that are kind of constant when you think
about the millions of stories that go on
in a big city
that's what's really happening in Stack
Exchange I mean we started out building
software when I started building
software you know we were lucky just to
get computations we ended up building
software for hundreds or thousands or
millions or millions upon millions of
people where the actual interaction
between the people is what we're trying
to create more trying to make happen and
that's where you need anthropology so
thank you very much that's my prepared
talk I will take questions I will take a
look participation Eliza no I think I
don't think it's true that participation
yeah the question was is it really true
that participation in Silicon Valley is
low I i I've never actually like
compared it to the actual population but
but Silicon Valley does not have a whole
lot of programmers as the world as a
percentage of the programmers in the
world you know we have our own little
theories like most programmers in
Silicon Valley have other sources if you
work at Google actually there's 800
people you could ask questions if you
need help programming whereas if you
work at the Department of Forestry and
Nebraska there may be nobody that you
can ask those questions to your also if
you work at the Department of Forestry
in Nebraska probably under challenged at
work and so finding a place where you
can help other people by answering
questions may help challenge you a
little bit more please don't challenge
John ski any further yes
hey
yeah Stack Overflow more useful in a
book I was a comment and and but the
granularity is really tiny and so it
doesn't really quite scale in the same
way you know one of the things that I
said when I was starting this I had
written some books until I was friends
with the people at a press who
republished programmer books and I
actually said to the founder of a press
and then the founder of O'Reilly I said
you know what we believe is that people
are going to stop learning how to
program from books or if they already
have and that the way to learn
programming is usually going to be to
find a tutorial or some sample code or
to take over someone else's code and
just to start typing and essentially
page fault in knowledge every time you
get stuck type a question in Google try
to learn that one thing and then move on
and keep doing that it's not it's not a
very thorough way to learn programming
but that seems to be the way most of
them are learning it and the founder of
a press wanted to invest in the o'reilly
people were very insulted that i should
say that books are going away and they
made a competitive site to stack
overflow called O'Reilly answers which
is still on the web believe it or not
and has at least five pages yes
there is a badge for answering your own
question yeah is there is there kind of
interested in avoiding news and it also
kind of questions right so the first
question is is there are we really
deliberately trying to avoid oops and
secondly a lot of times we could we
could answer questions you know we
already have the answer the question
that they're actually they're actually
typing so we have a feature right now
that when you type the title of a
question will actually do some keyword
searching and it's pretty naive and show
you some other questions which might
answer your question that's done in a
relatively naive way without very much
machine learning behind it and it
nevertheless it does successfully
intercept an awful lot of questions
being asked another time we do very much
want to get rid of Dukes however there
is sort of a syndrome on Stack Overflow
we haven't been able to cure completely
where people will answer a question that
is that it's been asked a thousand times
before either just to earn reputation
quickly or because it's it's more fun
and easier to answer a question the 37th
time they just like me I can answer this
new rather than actually try to search
and see that thing's been asked before
so we do get an awful lot of dupes we're
going to start trying to attack that
with the machine learning and and and
better better machine learning
algorithms over the next year or two but
that is the the the dupes are actually
still kind of a bit of a problem we're
also starting to see problem on the
problems that happens with dupes is that
the answer has changed over time right
like the android android has changed
something you couldn't do you now can do
so there's 37 things saying you can't do
it all which are highly ranked in google
and then there's one thing saying no you
can do it now or it has changed or
whatever and those are two new actually
to rank and so one of the problems with
the lack of d do being that we're doing
is that we do have stale answers that
they just don't get enough eyeballs to
fix them to edit them so that's
something we want to work on and we're
going to rely on machine learning for
that because humans obviously don't want
to do it for us yes
actually disgusted right well the Middle
East there are no answers so you can't
discuss them at least on stack usage so
the question was how do you discuss how
well does the scale outside of the
programming community doesn't even work
outside the program community and how
well our other communities going to work
and could you ever discuss the Middle
East on our network but there are now 90
stack exchange sites i think 35 of them
have graduated from beta we have a beta
process that's pretty rigorous we don't
let them graduate until we think they're
going to be around for the long haul if
you look at the sites statistics a lot
of the growth is coming from the stack
exchange and what we call the stack
exchange network which is already
probably about a third of our traffic
and probably gets as many unique
pageviews stack overflow itself the
other the other site however a lot of
them are kind of semi semi geeky like
they're not programmers but the server
fall for system administrator is super
user for PCs you know wordpress drupal
you know database administrators tech
the math typesetting language so there's
a lot of these sites that are fair like
a lot of our traffic comes from fairly
geeky domains and it's not clear whether
that's a historical accident of like we
started with an audience of programmers
and then we say what else do you want to
talk about and they said Drupal or or if
that's because there's actually
something about this mechanism that
appeals to programmers and it works
better for programmers however we are
getting pretty far field and we have
some sites that are pretty successful
that are not geeky at all I mean it's a
parenting site there's a home
improvement psychic photography which is
geeky in its own way but the home
improvement site is kind of interesting
because it's bunch of contractors
talking about drywall application
techniques so we are starting to move
beyond that and all the growth is
happening on the stack exchange side not
all of it stack overflow is growing now
at about fifty six percent a year
because we already have just in terms of
reach like number of unique visitors
stack stack overflow has only grown
fifty-six percent in the last
because it's hard to find more
programmers at this point that are not
using it but the stack exchange network
itself is grown it like three hundred
fifty percent a year so so much much
faster and it's already I think a third
to a half of our traffic so it's it's
getting bigger faster we think that it's
sort of like a system of concentric
circles right we got the programmers and
now you ask the programmer is what they
want to talk about they might say other
programmer things and some of them are
going to be photographers but there are
no programmers who are also lawyers
there are very few because those are
both sort of all-encompassing things and
so we haven't gotten to law although we
have an announcement coming next week so
pay attention next week when we announce
something yes is a different kind of
market what I say the question is what i
say core is a different kind of market
yeah I mean I I don't want to speak for
the core guys to me it looks like
provoked blogging meaning it's sort of
like a blogging platform except that you
there's kind of all kinds of provocation
on there to write an awesome blog post
about your opinion about a particular
thing that happens to address a
particular question so I feel like they
don't because Korra is wider and that
anything is allowed on topic it hasn't
attracted experts in really anything
other than Silicon Valley startups there
there's no particular field of expertise
where you'll find those experts on Korra
yet and I don't know if they're can me
because when I look at Yahoo Answers if
I were a field medalist mathematician I
would never think to go on yahoo answers
and ask a hard math question just like
they won't go to court and ask but when
they see math overflow they will because
they see a whole bunch of other really
really hard math questions around and so
that makes sense so I think that if you
start with something that's broad and
horizontal in general you're never going
to attract the hardcore obsessive
experts for the people who this is their
job who eats their profession you can't
get vertical from horizontal on the
other hand if we can build a lot of
verticals we can at some point be kind
of indistinguishable from horizontal
because we got all the verticals yes
remember this stuff escape still have no
so for instance or so a company and I
want to have something like that
internally or
yeah stack exchange is not have is not
actually open source itself so we
actually think that the valuable data is
the is the text that people have typed
and that is open source in the sense
that it's all creative commons so we
have a public open API where you can
access any of our data we have database
dump square would take an entire sequel
database and make it available on a
monthly basis for anybody wants to
download and do anything they want with
it remix we use free whatever just don't
if you put ads on it and then remove all
the links to stack overflow and will
probably be pissed off but we may not be
able to do anything about it but the
actual software itself is sort of a
little bit incidental to our system so
it's not open source there are multiple
opens or clones of stack overflow that
you can get OS QA is probably the
biggest one which is an open source
project that kind of clones the way it
works we think again the value is in the
community and the questions and answers
that they they ask an answer jon skeet
you talk about trying to put all the
people we want sort of natural members
of the community it seems that every day
or better there is someone who has got
upset with being downloaded and said why
are you so harsh when okay i clicked
saying i understand all this and then i
posted a rubbish question right um do
you think that you all assuming that has
to change in some way is it going to
change my better education so they
really don't on a skirmish question or
are we going to put them off so they
don't even asking so yeah that's a
really good question so the question is
sort of every day you have large numbers
of people showing up on meta being angry
that their question has been closed
because it's idiotic and it doesn't
follow the rules or it's badly formed or
whatever it may be and they are very
very adamant about their right to you
know there's sort of the sense of
entitlement that people believe well
you've given me an edit box on the
Internet I have a right to type words in
that box and then when it gets down
voted or deleted they sort of say what
is going on here how do I not have the
right for my words to appear on the
internet for everybody to see and this
is a bit of an ongoing problem so we we
we beat those people down and they get
upset and complaining they say that
stack overflow is getting the moderators
or full of themselves and whatever i'm
being censored etc and then they and
then when they say they're getting
censored of course anybody who's
listening from far away is like yeah you
should
should be censoring people on
stackoverflow that's horrible this is
this is with a site as large as Stack
Overflow this is a growing problem we
have seven thousand questions a day
they're not all gems there are there is
a large category of people who cannot do
their jobs they have been hired as
programmers in they're incapable of
being programmers and the only hope that
they have somebody has told them we'll
just type whatever your boss told you to
do in just a covert flow and somebody
will help you and the bad thing is that
sort of like if you've ever done dog
training with the intermittent
reinforcement sometimes they get answers
so they keep trying then all you really
get swapped down badly enough I don't
know what the natural and state is going
to be education as you mentioned would
be helpful you know we've tried the
thing which I'm not a big believer in
where somebody new shows at the site
they ask a question you say wait stop
read all this text make sure you were
doing all these things it's the Eric
Raymond how to ask questions on the
internet it's like a book this long and
when you're done you probably won't have
a question anymore you're not one of
those kind of people that has to ask
questions but you know because the
exhaustive nature of what Eric Raymond
would have you do before you can ask
your question the truth is sometimes you
can put the best questions on stack
overflow just by not looking something
up just by saying you know what I'm
reading this documentation and it you
know and it makes me wonder Delta
thought I thought maybe I could get the
answer somewhere else already I'm just
going to ask on Stack Overflow because
somebody's going to answer it that's
going to help 100 people we're going to
have that same exact question when they
read the same documentation that i just
read so you know it's uh i don't know if
there's a great answer this stuff this
stuff that we're definitely doing to
work on it there's number one thing that
we're trying to do i would say this sort
of two things you're going to do work on
it one is in the very short term we have
a contest up on Kaggle which if you're
into machine learning go enter that
contest you can win valuable prizes and
it's a contest to identify questions
that would likely be closed just based
on their text so what we're going to try
to do is develop some kind of machine
learning algorithm that can look at a
question and predict whether or not it's
later going to be closed we actually
discovered that one of the strongest
signals before we do this cattle contest
the strongest signal so anybody want to
guess
what the strongest signal is that a
question is going to be closed spelling
errors nope late right length no sorry
books no poster I'm just going to tell
you sentences that start with a
lowercase letter is one of the strongest
features essentially if you try to do
them feeling so we're going to try to
improve that so that we can actually try
to block some questions really but all
that really does is make people
capitalize their sentences they really
want to ask you a stupid question and
then it needs to be we're going to keep
working on it um in the long run you
know one thing which worries me about
Wikipedia and that that allows me to
sort of launched into a little speech
about Wikipedia Wikipedia also has these
non-intuitive rules we have this
non-intuitive rule don't ask shopping
questions for example this is
non-intuitive cuz you might think oh
this is a great place to ask which
30-inch monitor should I buy but it's
not and or you know don't ask subjective
questions this is a really really
important rule for us and I have tried
to explain to you why we have this rule
and many of you could go back and say
well here's why Stack Overflow closes
questions that they think are too
localized you may not agree but at least
you know why we're doing that but
wikipedia has similar rules that nobody
gets and they're always confused by
these rules so for example there's a
rule it says you know we need tertiary
sources not primary sources for for for
Wikipedia Wikipedia is making an
encyclopedia and we don't allow say Joel
sapolsky to go into the article about
Joel sapolsky and correct things that I
know to be false because i am not
trustworthy who is trustworthy The
Village Voice the New York Times people
that might rid of people that have know
absolutely nothing about me and actually
the information that they have they got
from me when they interviewed me that
time so so it's a it seems like a funny
rule on wikipedia and and this rule that
there's a sort of another rule about
notoriety which is you cannot have an
article on wikipedia about something
which is not notorious enough and then
people start saying well the internet is
not running out of pages why do you have
to shut down this awesome article I
wrote about the
I've the five tires that are stacked up
in the garage at the new google hacker
space or wherever this is why can't
there be an article about this on
Wikipedia I'll make it we're all here we
all see that we can write down the model
numbers and the paint color and stuff
like that but there's no notoriety there
that's not notorious so who cares well
the reason we care is because there is
not anything published that we can go
back in a book in a library to check if
those facts are in Wikipedia are correct
so you have to have this combination of
two rules that the thing being notorious
and then all the facts have citations if
you don't have those two rules stuff
gets in Wikipedia which is not
verifiable they don't care if it's right
or wrong it just has to be verify a bolt
it just says this would be a way to
check because if there's no way to check
its it could never possibly be right and
when you think about this logically you
say aha I see I now understand why
wikipedia has to have those two rules
which sound really nasty and
anti-democratic some famous writer
Turner was a Philip Roth yeah it just
went on Wikipedia to try to correct
something about one of his own books and
was and and the editor told them look I
know you're Philip Roth I get it we
don't accept you as a source unless it's
been published somewhere so I think what
he did is he did an interview somewhere
and then cited the interview um they're
like okay that's usually the way this is
resolved but that rule sounds so
ridiculous and people just get angry
with Wikipedia and they actually drop
out of Wikipedia they say I am sick and
tired of trying to correct Wikipedia
entries that are just wrong because you
know I can't do this anymore and we have
the same fear over stack overflow we
keep closing localized questions and
people drop out of the community because
they feel like we're too strict or where
nasty or our moderators are cool then
we're going to lose them but we have to
have those rules that's why we have a
site that's awesome because we have sort
of strict rules so you know education
I'm all out of time thanks very much for
coming to hear me I really appreciate it
all even great keep answering questions
and asking questions on stack overflow
I'll be hanging out here for at least
another 15 minutes or so if you have any
more questions you want to ask come up
and ask me</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
