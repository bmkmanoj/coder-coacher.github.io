tonight this is a yes deform Ruby see
this is our second event the first one
was also here tonight's speaker jack
harrington is in at also davao
generation with ruby and i'd like to i
need to say a disclaimer that this is
going to be on google video once we're
all done and if Jack is fine with all
that and so afterwards if you miss
something you can just hopefully be able
to go check it out online at just by way
of brief introduction I'm one of the one
of the sink co-chairs my name is Greg I
work here at Google as a product manager
and I think the ruby has a lot of
promise that Google is yet to recognize
that promise I wouldn't have it's a good
a large a degree but I think in the long
run rupee will probably come one more
popular here and this is part of that
that trend so welcome enjoy dinner and
thank you for coming Jay all right so my
name is Jack and hygienic about three
years ago I'm stand right here I Eric
and myself wrote a book called
cogeneration in action what was my manic
and it was Ruby basically at the time I
didn't get to say was a ruler because
review listen as popular as it is now it
over rereleased today I could go yes
it's Ruby yes I'm sure he would buy it
by the droves it's still available on
Amazon 2995 last time I checked so I the
way I like to do these things really
informally you know if you have any
questions running like that just kind of
pop up anytime and we can have a
like this sort of stuff I don't like to
do that so my initial assertion is a
good firmer is a link right so you don't
want to write our we're good okay yes
not super lazy gotta get a program that
eventually but um yeah the idea is it
you don't want to write thousands of
lines of code for every lie every line
of code you write there's a potential
bug so the less lines of code is writing
the more intelligently you write them
the better off the application is by the
end of the day so I think we've all kind
of seen something like this you know
there is the there's time and there is
what you want to do and it starts while
planning it and then doing it and then
kind of testing it and whatnot in the
point right pretty simple sort of stuff
and in reality you get a lot of this so
I you know decide I'm buying and
whatever and that takes up a lot more
time than you figured it would then
there's always a testing in deploying
time the QA is like no it's gotten one
and that's it hardline so what gets
squished in the middle is is coated and
invariably it just comes down to just
type fast make it happen fast so so I
type stuff
the frameworks that we have are really
bad today sweetie not particularly good
framework to the sort of stuff so and
why one counterpoint argument to all
this is why even you James me why use
rails something at that but sometimes we
don't have a choice and when I wrote
this book there was no rails so there
was no kind of counterpoint say well you
just don't do Jamie so what we did in
this book is talk about how to use Ruby
a tool we like to help us generate code
that we don't want save ourselves from
typing and generally speaking i find
that strongly typed languages like C++ C
sharp or Java tend to require more code
is that kind of people's experiences
yeah so I'll turn it into Titan really
fast and getting RSI you can either copy
and paste code I'm sure everybody loves
the right macros in a language like C++
or you can use your word processor your
editors macros like you max OVI do a lot
of programming that way you can use
wizards like the back in the days I've
see there was a dialogue wizard
advantage step for you and that's what
we call passive cogeneration I'll get
more on that in a second or you can use
active code generation
so what is code generator basically
start with some sort of a specification
like as an example i just threw out
schema for our database and you run it
through some sort of black box while at
the code generator and you get to the
end code and impassive generation that's
the end of the line that's the use your
generator you gotten your code you start
hacking on it with emacs or bi or your
IDE and there's no round-tripping
inaccurate generation the code portion
here I come dotted it or effect is
transient so it's a two-way type thing
where you change the spec regenerate
that regenerates the code and you don't
edit directly although there are some
exceptions what you can do is you can
generate code that has save someone's in
it and then have that generator be smart
enough to actually go in to the code
before one the generation cycle take the
existing code grab at all the segments
and you modified in little zones and
keep those so that the next time I
generates if
puts back your refinements everybody
kind of following longer I can kind of
go in more detail sure I don't
understand the difference between
passive and active i see the same
character essentially sure yeah it is
kind of subtle so this two-way thing
means that you know if you have an
active relationship with the generator
so that turn that code file that you
generate at the end is not something you
had to manually it the generator is
always in control so a really good way
to enforce that you really shouldn't
force that is to actually have it as
part of the build process so those
generated files aren't checked into the
source code control system they've built
as part of the process unless you want
to use this safe zone technique which
allows you to edit that file make minor
revisions and the value of that is you
know not often can you build a spec that
actually has every single edge case in
it you're going to need so things like
you know special business case logic
stuff like that that can all be putting
the safe zones you maintain that by from
generation cycle in generations each
other how is your class suffice
so we're mad yeah so Coco yeah yeah
sorry um probably hack your generation I
mean you don't be ahead of the final
sprint oh yeah I guess yeah there are
right where there are zones where you
can wait repeat question it will guard
the interface builder so on so tell me a
little bit yeah donor temperatures could
that matters but most of what you get
with interface builder or objects they
call them freeze-dried objects because
they're just launching its right I'm
going to file so they don't even want
you to really see the code association
bikini that is SEO later on so our can
you headed that code later up okay so
the only a resource there is also a way
to declare classes inside interface
builder and right header person
templates furnace taking new kaligati
yeah hey this is kind of 101 s after a
lot of attention
question the next one I was I was just
saying you actually address once again
so I way of saying that back here we're
in trouble hearing so that someone else
a question if you could just repeat it
though oh I say that's hello going to do
this stay off camera oh yeah okay so
yeah i'll try to be grandiose so
maintenance held right and that's one of
the problems that i hear what about
generators all the time is no it was
great the first Burma Road this
generator and all the sort of stuff but
you know how does it get maintained in
line so what I one we kind of put out
there was you know some sort of levels
of gradation between not sort of heaven
and hell becomes a sort of stuff and at
the top is kind of a calibration I put
rails which is heaven and millions
heaven and the bottom I put fifty
thousand lines of hand coded assembler
story ahead oh okay i guess or should
well okay you know all right so then
kind of it blew it down not too bad is
when you copy and paste fragments of
code around and then copy and pasting
actually fill classes around is
significantly worse the standard
template library in c++ it's pretty much
down there and then the error is
generated by the standard
library is even worse and kind of in
between the two oh I see you have a
passive generators that so I really
don't think you should ever use them and
then the code generators I'm going to
talk about kinda sit somewhere between
heaven and hell and what makes for a
hellish go Jennifer so it's clearly not
documented well not maintained well I'm
going all that sort of stuff I won't go
through all this sort of stuff but you
get this you know CG is a design smell
or people are talking about how the
framework is bad whole idea the
generators bad basically the idea is and
I'll go on the heaven one then what you
want to do is write something that it
generally maintained by the team as a
complete package actively it's active in
the build process as well documented
people know it as and uses an existing
toolset that ever be reasonable so to
actually dig myself a little background
on me so I run a psych hold used to run
site called the code generation network
everything Avery they win their code
generation net hey great okay I'm cetera
and I ran that for guess to in some
years and as part of that it has talked
to all kinds people they're writing
generators and maintaining them and also
us up and we have a catalog about 250
different code generators and the really
really successful ones that I've seen
are the ones where they make the best
use of the off-the-shelf technologies so
there are some generators out there that
nobody uses in particular because they
take like text templating as an example
text template as I'll show is a big
portion of this thing and they actually
go build their own text template
language so why would you go and
there's a book there I think almost 20
different Ruby code text templating
systems out there so use one of those
instead of writing your own that's one
of the big things that I've seen in
successful code generators is to use the
stuff it's off the shell I think all
these a pretty much self-explanatory
again handle handle discrete tasks is
very important and they'll try and build
the entire application through the
cogeneration system just prime build you
know the small pieces of it that make
sense and can speed you up as opposed to
getting caught up on the edge piece I
feel like I'm going really fast people
okay so far mrs. Google why the Brady
act okay so here's the stuff that I see
most often as targets of cogeneration
generally right at the top database code
followed by the crud user interface
stuffs this is the backend stuff like
maintaining the waking sit like a back
end of the database application
happening the tables creating a moving
pottsville records things like that in
case of Jake's me things like
configuration employment files help is
that anything like doxygen stuff like
that where you go in scandalized code
figure out what's going on and generate
HTML from a bunch of different things
javadoc sound like that language
interface code tools like what's that
moment yes to go to me
swing right that's a good example there
and then stuff that's going to take a
specification of any kind of format I've
seen for network formats I've seen it
for file formats and go and build a
reader in the writer of that format in
several different languages maintain a
language maintain a file formats back in
XML they generate a Python reader and a
job or either or at a c++ for your
insolence so let's take kind of drill
down on one look at how to generate
database stuff so we start with an XML
smack that defines the tables the fields
relationships between the tables we went
through a ruby generation script and
that builds an SQL file he then put in
your database pretty simple when the
advantage this is it being going to take
that Ruby generator it is maybe going to
mysql and then rejigger it and have it
take the same XML so I can make an oral
script or both whatever a refinement of
that needs to use so this this one would
have you know elements inside the of the
script that basically saying freaked out
create la-di-da and this one would use
an ER be a sequel temple using a text
template system a frame of the army big
part of raleys and swollen hands up
yes great okay we're you go on taking
the ERV template that's got the sequel
code in it and use that to generate the
SQL file this is a much prefer design
because it's kind of like in a web
application separating the interface
logic from the application life I make
sense and this is kind of like in a
generator world this is like two tier
design as opposed to that which is one
tears yeah ok so then a another variant
on this is to have two different
templates and generate two different
outputs one would be the SQL file to
preload the database and the other we
say seven PHP classes that would go and
access the various value of that is it
you're always going to have the two
database schemas synced so the stuff
that's in the PHP they look to the same
fields that I set up by the SQL to get
their database so you're not going to
have this kind of impedance mismatch
where you'll be looking for fields that
aren't there again you can work this
both ways you can either have them those
PHP classes set up no touch no touchy
whatever with a little header of the top
and says don't edit this file or you can
go and use the safe zones and show the
previous day
this thing's morning yes sir yeah so I
got a question other five slides up sure
when you say generation actual purchases
while necessarily yes or do them to the
khaki record during runtime generate
run by those you repeat the question
okay uh yeah so is those cogeneration
cover with my use of the word
cogeneration cover objects like active
record which dynamically adapt to
objects active tables on the fly hi I'm
not a language purist I'm not going to
cover it in this talk I have done a lot
of that work with method missing in Ruby
and with there's a PHP 5 now supports
that as well and Python what's it well I
gotta cover it but I what I consider
cogeneration I don't know i don't think
it's regenerating code so is that what
does it do it the fire is an active
record generate SQL statements on the
fly to to Aquarius why should be passed
on the rupee ok so i guess there is that
so call up with that question
oh now I had a SQL a joke but I sort of
is like a calibration of William here's
heaven hears health okay so that's
Congress yeah yeah I guess yeah there's
a couple areas of it I don't personally
get into a get into templates all that
much award the even weirder stuff which
is to do the Turing complete templates
I've seen two people to the other thing
is a lot of people got on me when the
book first came out that they were
looking for like a sequel to the dragon
book and when I say cogeneration they
were singing pop I was looking for
something it's the backend of compiling
your book is it about the back I'm about
writing application so yeah in both use
the word cogeneration co generations
also he cared as meta programming as
well in with your meta programming enter
zip christov zarnecki book i think
called is a meta program or the
generative coding right ok so yeah same
stuff idea with with creating file
formats I mean it was the heart and
personal the same sort of thing in this
case you're generating java classes and
j unit stuff I me and which are then
tested by Jay you in it and the same
something would during both Python you
go so can people kind of see the value
in that or yeah makes sense right
so why Ruby cuz i wrote the book will
you should buy the book that's good my
kid needs shoes no seriously though one
of the cool things about Ruby at the
time when I wrote the book was that Ruby
wasn't being used in production so one
of the big values of using ruby was not
only easy to use but you're not going to
be generating ruby it ravine which
because you need production codes you're
gonna be generating single spots for me
here gob and when you're looking through
these templates is pretty easy to
distinguish what's Java with Ruby when
you actually have Ruby generate ruby or
pearl generate pearls I had in one job
it gets really confusing when you what
is this if is this if what's supposed to
be out or isn't this the generated code
or is this the generator code and it
just gets hairy so there's that's one
thing the cart is that mean you would
not recommend it
with each
I'm as I said that was a long that was
on the fourth book first came out I
should be fine but I mean again you're
running into that issue just maintaining
I mean are there other reasons people
can think about using ruby ruby has
evolved since what I wrote it so our
since one I read the book so what are
the things people in thing up let us say
it's an interactive luxury okay you can
do it so let's look at some Ruby finally
after eight gazillion slides so Wow can
we see that or then Wow right right so
there's our input file very complex is a
list of tables there's only one it's an
author and if names author has one few
of cold title that's the thing any sense
Jimmy name whatever or this in a
bleary-eyed state what do you want me so
okay and then use our incredible Ruby
generator code basically go and open up
DB for writing BB diets go for writing
then we use the awesome xml library to
go to parse through schema we use its
xpath stuff to get each one of the
tables suck out its name getting one of
the fields put them into an array and
then basically do a bunch of French you
go and get a mysql pretty
straightforward
and then the result is that which is
MySQL for creating a table with an
author with a field club title now
doesn't make any sense so we'll go on to
the next slide and show how to use er ve
to do the same sort of thing
so again same kind of table stuff in
this case we're going to get the
template create a new ERV instance with
that template and then basically just
write out the result of binding the
local variables name and field to the
ERV template which is shown look so
everybody pretty clear on that one and
all right and the result is basically
the same thing with some character
turned file formatting differences which
are not really relevant to my SQL might
as well we care about white space so we
just go for it
well yeah man there's no way to buddy
can see that I was expecting like a big
mando screen oh ok so what is the state
of Ruby code generation today we'll talk
about rails so I can talk certainly
agree about rails not in deep aqua right
so you know what is it going to bill is
going to build basically the helmet the
core elements the rails architecture
reviews can followers one of the great
things is modular so you can actually go
ahead in your own templates and
processes and go other things using the
rails generation system obviously
working a doctorate in the back of
record there's a bunch of Ruby text
templating tools we are leaving the one
that kind of comes with 1.8 you like a
thing certainly gateway my virginal way
to CSF what are smarty is a report of
the awesome PHP smarty template library
which is great radius ports and then
down the bottom I've mentioned XSL
because I've got a lot of cogeneration
XL and actually trying to be quite nice
once you get over the bizarro syntax and
the excellent Rex amilo library have any
xslt veterans there yeah yeah what's he
getting big blue eyes I'm that right it
is it is it and I'm ready sorry saying
if you're really
with that APL is not that bad we did it
right yeah right okay there's also a
builder ok so what a building that's the
XML template generator okay where you
it's Ruby syntax so you just put Ruby
objects and two it's a dsl for
constructing xml documents oh oh and
that's the our xml conflict extension
builder you have Jim wide open Munson
will check out yeah it's very slick I
wish I had well I can end of the slide
I'll try and remember talking about oh
okay so some code generation projects in
Ruby there's a JavaScript compiler or
movie to JavaScript interpreter I guess
that's kind of somewhere like Google's
done with their gentlemen a telescope
thank designed by contracts for see
there a cool actually top of the guy
that wrote that it's a precondition for
those conditions for c++ by looking at
the comments and a C++ file using Ruby
there's you know a couple of generic
frameworks Kota top away is one that
using a weapon Wow put through this
thing so how was that if I yeah it's
over 47 and 40s what 30 minutes oh we
might get out of our egg I guess that's
a good thing last item on that's one
memory argit &amp;amp; Co takapa Lake
so a bit more perspective than MDA is
model-driven architecture it's a never
by the OMG to kind of put some sort of
standards on this thing leaving their
standards are a little nebulous yeah I
know kind of there are some large pay
for products out there to do this
blanking on the name but anyway so that
some of the more formal thing dsl
domain-specific language as you mention
that's basically a way of saying that
you're going to go and build a very
small language go and generally as an
input one of these generators it's
specific to the domain if that was math
Amell so you're bringing equations out
and it automatically generates from the
equation PDF or whatever you want CG and
cogeneration and see GN is my well my ex
cite code generation network and some
cute little things okay so if you want
to look more deeply into this obviously
code generation network here place to go
my book code interconnection pragmatic
programmer is dave thomason book he
actually has a small section on using
code generation to get better
performance audio coding time was like
typing fastball and yeah generator
programming is the Christo's or Nike
book which I find my book tends to be a
little more practical and the zernike
ebook tends to be a bit more
theoretical and I've got a good grant at
a time or had extra time there's simply
a bunch of things that I can talk about
if you want her with those things so I
guess I'll open up the floor if you want
to talk about stuff make questions and
yeah sure if you so but I've been
spending a fair amount of time digging
around in active record and largely
disgusted with how I could have the SQL
generation okay and I look at it and I'm
not a real compiler guide and when I'm
not real great with the parsing and the
code generation but I look at it and it
seems like there's this crazy bitch mash
of dealing with things at the SQL
statement level and and spring pattern
regular expression pen stuff right and
then dealing with things at the domain
object level of you know active record
objects and associations and I've
associated objects and somehow get up
getting that mishmash to generate the
actual SQL that he sent to the database
right and it seems like there could be
some kind of intermediate representation
something like an abstract parse tree Oh
4s for SQL for SQL yeah that would make
it easier to manipulate
do you have anything to book the talks
about that or if you speak up now like
at three tiers of generator essentially
where the second tier is like a media
like the key code state or something
like that yeah it's been a while since
I've in the dragon book yeah I never
loved yeah yeah you tell me so I'm rusty
I but the chest was that what you really
wanted to do was to take your
specification and Trevor day to not a
parse tree better to any base on my back
and you have several different types of
notes he knows that essentially
represented a final result that you know
essentially select order to grow them
the items that you're selected because
you don't always want to do select start
so you know there's a bed that's kind of
lets you know that those are the rooms
and a few layers up from that you have
some and then you add some other nose
for the represent things you're going to
get our essential conditions and
you can have fruit flies and things like
that represented by the immediate notes
and protract and you've got a number of
different types that yet how I set it
all out it's once you work through all
the different types of things you might
want to do that by having where and
surprising suppers you can actually
represent it with I think you know
somewhere between a half-dozen that
wasn't good classes of those and you'll
build this this graph which is
essentially dependency graph that shows
what things depend on one hand so you
know this this where clause depends on
the following this one of those things
that X on moves it depends on other
things
entire where clause myself and from that
he
actually do
because data structure really represents
the truth about what you're trying to
manipulate so a define pretty rigidly a
set of balance equations against that a
destruction I get this feeling to do
that and I meant reversing and then once
you've manipulated a home line you can
actually optimize by attaching a vm
naturally subtrees and then you just
Traverse it in your you would see let's
go pack I think the fun with doing that
nut and active record right now is that
you can specify SQL as some of the
options that's it so you would need to
parse that out yeah and then that would
be master that's very yeah so let's go
it's not really they're allowed to do it
it's not backward yeah I actually think
there is ilysm there's one particular
table with your generating bigdecimal
equation in Java so doing all the work
to actually generate the code for taking
a particular equation and turning you
into much big decimal balls and that has
to do with the work of tokenizing and
into something memory and then rendering
it in the Java and that's essentially
they've got three a three phase thank so
you can kind of use that as an essential
a template for what you're talking about
basically way to take I guess you have
time and what like way you're me how you
get a bunch of objects anyone yeah all
right good and then a finder and active
record has options things like what's
the Select Clause what's the joins
what's the conditions of the order and
the grouping and you can and you can
basically take an SQL statement then
bring it with these small chunks but
they need many of those chunks are
actual it's a string that sets an SQL
code fragment that and so you have to be
dealing with things that both the level
of the main objects and at the level of
SQL code for a visual same time and and
then you try and get into the code
generation and see how am I going to
create this expression that it doesn't
more sophisticated kind of join that you
know it's someone was saying all I want
to do you know has one through instead
of has many through it's just you know a
mess yeah it's a pain to do so and well
it's real easy to conceive of how to
create that that Association in terms of
the domain objects it's really pretty to
get from map to the SQL code to do the
joint
bunch of questions coming back that guy
way back one of the things that I found
was the trails is that especially with
that director is that they the actor
director is designed for least common
denominator and there's no no
optimization for the various databases
that are that are out there and if
you're trying to move something into
production area that could be a bit of a
problem not too long ago I think about a
month month and a half ago I can't
promote was but it was a gentleman in an
attempt to teach people how to better
optimize their their code he came up
with a library specifically for my as
well as an example on how to do this for
whatever your database table and that it
took advantage of a lot of the
optimization features for that
particular database engine and this is
one of the beauties of groovy is that
you
can easily extend or replace current
functionality by reading clearing the
class and as you're reading clearing the
class you can either add methods or you
can replace existing methods and so if
you whatever they've been working with
if you find that you have a better way
to do it the first thing to do is write
the code to do it and once you can prove
to yourself that you can do it then you
can package that into a plug-in and make
it available to the community unless you
don't you know unless it's something
just for your company and then at that
point it can start to ensure itself and
once it gets widespread acceptance then
you know that that gets better for the
community in it helps other people learn
how to do what it is that you're
attempting to do it or at least identify
the problem that you've identified ok ok
welcome be like it can give you a size
estimate on reworking that for class
throughout the secret circle
oh man
I can't I mean I've been is exactly it
depends on what it is that you're trying
to do felber I 12 or 24 or school a
different one what exactly you're trying
to do there was somebody who in a few
hours yet few hours I i believe is a few
hours a day Thomas and his blog gives a
reference to somebody else who basically
extended an active record specifically
for SQL Server and to take advantage of
some of the features that were there
well my understanding is of what you're
talking about is it you're not actually
completely overriding everything you're
basically saying it in this case I'm
going to go out and do it so it's
question i like how much you are not
quite specifically because equals are
exact 44 thanks no no I get it a young
happens necessarily i'll write ever may
just find that there's one particular
you have an issue with and then figure
out a way to have say okay well that's
the case but it above and i want to
override at that point well the beauty
is that you can go we you can either do
my pieces or you can do the whole thing
it's entirely up to you and what it is
that your needs are so the kind of
cogeneration you're talking about i can
probably most people kind of first
encounter or rails as scaffolding but
and that's i can vary shape for
catfishing have much energy yeah but
it's very one way right it has it's very
packing could that be made smart like
realistically is there way that you can
so that the cogeneration tries to keep
itself instant Eve as you start to
involve those scattering scaffolding
files to the front of degenerates yeah
that's what those save zones if I'm
right over there you can actually put in
a you know there's a section on it you
know special comments that basically say
you know here's us here's an area where
you should override to be particular
things and then thinking the generator
can actually go in before it zaps the
file with a new version suck out the old
code and then put that into the safe
zone where we're here in the new code
and so thus preserving your changes in
well specified areas with MLA with Ruby
it's some idea that that's a technique
for static type languages with Ruby the
nice thing is again you can use the
disability to basically say okay I'm you
generated block right now another file
is going to come along and redefine that
class and add some methods that do
that's our thing and you don't have to
have it all in one file so it may not
necessarily I'll that that extend that
file we make another class at making
another file that can sending redefines
of glass again and that's stopped real
notice on the end of that the general
notion the first profiling to find out
where you're performing said it was
really important and then secondly using
the technique you mentioned you alias
the old method right and look for that
specific thing Madeline anything else
just pass on the remember I'm AC sharp
indeed our coming up to point o had the
particle classes to go read you can have
as many in one PDF as many files as you
want implement particular clients so you
have one file that's generated in a
while that's coming if you combine a
couple of techniques rails recipes and
talks about a definition on how to build
your own code generator city alienated
rails and then in the patio web
development book he talks about in the
controller putting in scaffolding as an
accident it's automatically generated
on the fly when you're first getting
into it one of the things that you can
conceivably do is you're sure if you
have a lot of stuff fit that is pretty
boilerplate in whilst a border playful
throughout the whole throughout the
whole thing but you might make tweaks to
the boilerplate here and there create
your own code generator stick it in the
controller so anytime that can forward
it's accessed it whatever your generator
library is set to do it will
automatically create that imply very
cool but more questions or answers this
is great sure I'm sorry go ahead every
first a lot of your source example
selection L fastening XML logistical is
that you go to a choice for expressing
what
could you repeat that question yeah is
XML the language is your of the
specification of something yeah I see
that a lot there's a couple of different
sources again with the code generation
network I've seen a lot of different
generators a lot of them work from code
so you'll comments in the code itself so
the generator will read the code parts
have the comments and then figure out
what needs to generate from that but
when you're just coming from a source of
yeah it's really nice to have an XML
file because it can be easily validated
you can have a quick external validation
script before I is there something in
particular about movie since we do which
i think is much better given the same
phone you know I mean I I guess they're
both good I do think sometimes the XML
and the xslt is like a brain teaser and
opposed to actually kind of gave the job
done it's a little bit more straight
forward to read in parent an imperative
language as opposed to trying to work
through the what's the language you're
just trying to learn house phone ask
right wait yeah it is in some times
where it's a brain teaser to figure out
how to do the xslt I like both intent to
say with each other
it responds to that I what I find the
Bexar self
it'll just take you 1 flower take the
other file and turn one and got it on
fly maybe on the client side you don't
have to send any coordinates all right
there yeah and that's great and then you
get to a certain level of complexity and
realize oh my gosh this is so hard to
know but you know where we're in my
transformation that this thing go wrong
there that's that's the point where i
SPECT going to do I need to break this
down into chunks that I can call this
usually because having this templating
language that super super powerful is
only good until I real
and actually also has some things that
it doesn't really like where they have
nice and probably know there are
variables but they can't very may I find
that problem well that's why we can
becomes like a brain teasers and thats
the rat on you know how do I get this to
recur sis so the right the right value
shows great time it's interesting that
you know you mentioned you know
interment in your meteors there or
inversion homely where do you get yet
where you get in xslt is he get you get
your initial you know table of table of
tables or whatever and then from there
given the complexity the generator you
have to have another intermediary form
which is the tokens for a job and
another intermediary former to the total
school in another xml blow another set
of templates and these sort of things so
animation before exactly exactly pretty
pretty hairy is the book of circle one
of the one of the things back to the
interview form was back was talking
about how to optimize for the different
databases rails has these connection
adapters to mount to the particular
databases but because by the time you
get to them you've lost all of the
information about the domain objects and
rails can't actually do much for
arranging so you know there's this
people trying to do bind it in irvine
variables in oracle pray and it's a pain
because you've lost a lot of a lot of
the information about the domain objects
and if you have this intermediate form
to work with
and the connection adapters and how deaf
do the generation particular to me you
know kind of database their cognate to
that seems like that's a reasonable
complete something a good project it
seems like a lot of a lot of it was
reinventing the haylor wheel yeah well
oh yeah definitely have certainly in
right with this with generating
Escamilla cavities regenerate and you're
just going by your very quietly metaphor
so that this gentleman's question so
another place for rails cogeneration in
migration trip and they put painful quad
the migration do because we're
introducing that's one of those blocks
that's how
create worry I'm size of gifts
those problem
no question just answer here okay
anybody else this is a great turn out
really good to see all this interesting
Ruby and rails more rails everybody just
for my own thing how do you go over here
for rails and how many people are just
really enthusiasts me also rails Ruby
okay hi excuse all right how are you
controlling i get that every time i do
it chillin different yes it is selling
liquor in his bad ass ok so here we go
ready so you're not on you're not on the
wall anymore huh oh right
so I used to have this is still not on
let's go there it is its warming this is
neat right projector warming still wait
so I used to have this on one of my in a
little nokia type things and now it's on
a right I wish I could show this but see
so we'll show it to the camera so we
will see it on the video there oh there
you go zoomed in already oh yeah yeah
yeah let me get that right that's
showing what's playing on on my itunes
that's it hear it that's weird Oh
anything yeah so you get a little goody
see it you can actually see like a
little pause I got so it shows you the
album art and the you know everything
you'd expect to my tunes and then you
want style us hit play
yeah so if you use a little bar that
tells you how long how far along it is
and that's just the itunes it's all
Apple skirt so you can control keynote
iPhoto you can actually use here I can
actually use all right on my old phone I
could actually do like egg you control
the mouse with my phone and I click on
it and stuff like that so pretty neat
actually that's not a live radio feed is
it oh no this is a podcast of NPR's on
point about the book fiasco the book by
the way yeah that's good anyway so yeah
and there's a whole bunch of negative
community of downloadable scripts to go
and basically it for everything this is
on windows too what's the name of the
app selling clicker stll ing clicker
it's on mac and they used to be on mac
only now some windows i think on windows
it uses javascript in vb scroll so you
can basically launch it inning probably
follow their works with phones to not
just true right right regular regular
phones yeah it's got huge bunch of the
nice thing about this is with a better
device not like a phone you actually get
like when you know comes up it'll give
you your slide notes and things like
that not that I do the last slide notes
and stuff but yeah and of course you
always you'd like them how do you do
that well had that thing whatever you
hear your presentation sucks you snuck
out this right
which certainly wasn't the case right
