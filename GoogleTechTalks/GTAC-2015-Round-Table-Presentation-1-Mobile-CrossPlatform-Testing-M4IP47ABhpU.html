cross-platform testing.
I'm Yusuke Tsutsumi, and I work at Zillow.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;Shauvik Choudhary: And I'm Shauvik Choudhary.
I'm a Ph.D.. candidate at Georgia Tech.
This came up from the minds of all these people
who were there at the roundtable talk.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;Yusuke Tsutsumi: When we first tackled this
topic, we kind of wanted to have a problem
statement to kind of consolidate our thoughts.
Here's what we came up with.
The number of platforms and devices are increasing,
which also increase the area that needs coverage.
With that in mind, what can we do to help
scale our testing across all of these new
combinations?
Excuse me.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;Shauvik Choudhary: So what are these combinations?
Okay.
So as we know, there are more than 40 different
configurations for iOS devices; right?
And around 18,000 or so different Android
devices.
And there are some Windows phones, which we
don't know how many of them are there.
But we would like to test on all these different
devices; right?
And that's the motivation.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;Yusuke Tsutsumi: We kind of tried to identify
exactly what's different about a lot of these
platforms; right?
So for Android specifically, we're talking
about vendor customizations.
Everyone wants to retheme it.
That causes issues.
There's differences in the sensors that are
being used in all these devices.
They're all different.
And screen size is also a big thing.
Everyone has their own resolution that they
think is perfect for everyone.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;Shauvik Choudhary: So what are the kind
of bugs that are out there?
Right?
What are the cross-platform bugs?
Well, there are generally UI bugs where something
doesn't look right on certain screen size.
But there are also behavior issues where some
functionality is broken on a particular device.
But apart from that, what are the other things
that people saw?
We were going around, you know, discussing
it.
And mainly, this thing came up that on older
phones or older generation phones or cheaper
devices, right, what happens is -- if this
will go next -- there are memory issues, like,
you run out of memory.
Then there are, you know, some cases where
some libraries are not supported on lower-resolution
devices.
So something that somebody brought up was
they had this video library they were using
and it would just crash or not support an
older-resolution device.
And they did not know of this (indiscernible).
And there are issues like battery issues,
low signal from carrier, Wi-Fi, and so on.
Right?
But then there were also issues that came
up which were really, you know, due to specialized
hardware.
Somebody was -- mentioned that, you know,
they had an app, and it would crash whenever,
you know, there was a phone which was a pretty
big physical keyboard, when the keyboard came
out, the application would crash.
And they had no idea why.
So that was something.
And then in Android, at least, you have to
handle the activity state.
Right.
Whenever you load up a new app, your app goes
in the background; right?
So if the -- and this is very common on older
devices, where your app might be -- or your
activity might be terminated because it runs
out of memory; right?
So when it comes up, you need to handle that
thing as well.
So this is something which causes a lot of
bugs.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;Yusuke Tsutsumi: There's clearly a lot of
issues that can happen on the platform side.
So what can we do to test all of these?
Well, the consensus that we kind of reached
is, realistically, you can't test all of them.
Testing tends to be an area where there's
a lot of constrained resources.
The best thing you can do, just like all sorts
of testing, is to focus on what really matters
most.
Here are some techniques that we thought about
that could get some good coverage.
First of all, once again, there's a lot of
issues that arise from checking the differences
between platforms.
But a majority of the things that you'll run
into are probably able to be caught on the
unit test and emulator sim level.
You don't need to move all of your tests over
to real devices because you think that's where
all the bugs will be caught.
On top of that, targeting is really important
here.
So an example here is, right, Shauvik came
up with the idea of low-memory devices having
a lot of issues.
If your app is going to take up a lot of memory,
test -- have the highest, most intense test
run on those.
Target the platforms that are most likely
to have the issues.
On top of that, test the popular platforms;
right?
Most likely, your app is not going to have
a 2% market share with over 50 different devices.
Most of the time there's going to be some
big, really large market shares out there.
Like the Nexuses or the Samsungs.
With that in mind just scale your testing
in such a way for real testing where you tend
to test on those more.
That gets you a lot of coverage.
With that in mind, you still want to keep
a varied subset to kind of poke out there
and see what other bugs exist.
They don't have to be a lot.
They just have to be varied.
That way when you find the regression in one
of those particular areas, you can actually
just expand on that.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;Shauvik Choudhary: So let's tin.
So we said that there are a lot of devices
out there; right?
But who has the devices?
Users.
So can you get your consumers involved?
And this is the idea where you, you know,
you have a pool of beta testers who have this
varied set of devices, and they help you test
these out; right?
And beta testers, you know, users bring a
fresh perspective to your app and then they
help you find bugs that you did not anticipate
before.
And there are a bunch of tools to recruit
these users; right?
And also what you want to do is you would
want to use a cross-platform test framework.
What that means is you have your tests in
one place and it runs on all the different
devices; right?
Or frameworks.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;Yusuke Tsutsumi: Yeah, that was the original
question that we were going to tackle here
is are there cross-platform test frameworks
out there?
And I think we all know that they do exist,
and they're actually pretty good; right?
Appium is a great example of that.
Everyone likes that whole Selenium protocol.
There's a lot of other alternatives, like
Cucumber, Eggplant, Espresso, of course.
Yeah, they're definitely out there.
And another question we thought about is how
do you we will with so many devices and how
do you find devices to test on?
Well, all the people who are in this conversation
agree that most likely, you probably shouldn't
buy those devices yourselves; right?
Unless you're a company that's making billions
of dollars and you're dedicating $50 million
to mobile testing, it's probably not realistic.
Take advantage of companies that are creating
clouds of real devices already, like Appurify
yesterday.
We (indiscernible) some other ones as well,
App Flap (phonetic) and TestDroid.
So there's definitely a lot of people in that
area.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;Shauvik Choudhary: So in summary, even if
you were sleeping for the whole time basically
this is what we covered during our discussion.
So the first thing was you want to use a platform
agnostic test framework.
Then you have to realize that you can't test
every combination of all these devices and
all features across all these devices; right?
So you choose a subset which maximizes on
your coverage; right?
And then you can use your audience because
they have a wide variety of real devices.
And finally, you can also use our leverage
test device clouds to keep up with the growing
number of real devices.
And that's it.
Thank you.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;Yusuke Tsutsumi: Thank you.
[ Applause ]
Do we have questions during the talks?
Okay.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; My question would be on all the solutions
provided which I believe these are like -- the
first thing, we don't have a platform agnostic
test framework yet.
This is something, if you have a test framework
which works on Android, that wouldn't work
on iOS because even if your applications'
screens remain the same on an iOS device,
the launch activity thinks other things controlling
the device part would totally change.
So this part, I don't know.
Because I've been working on mobile automation
almost past three and a half years.
That's one thing.
Subset of a thing, yeah, that wouldn't maximize
your thing, but the real problems which comes
on a lower end device that will remain because
that bugs and all you get it randomly from
different users when the report for the customer
care for your application.
Using the audience, the problem would be if
a user have a low-end phone, it's more likely
that he doesn't have access to all the other
sources where he can be a better tester because
very low-end phones doesn't support much of
the Internet things and all to be smart enough
to download the test and do the testing on
the phone itself (indiscernible) user.
Like if you are that techie enough -- most
likely.
It's not in every situation but most likely
you would be having a smartphone and you could
participate in the better programs.
Like, for an example, if your application
is on a very low-end Nokia phone, you wouldn't
have that -- like Nokia 520 Lumia or maybe
less, you wouldn't have access to Internet
at all.
Device cloud, what is the cost of device cloud?
How much device anywhere charge for a particular
-- It's a per-hour charge; right?
It's maybe $30 per hour.
And if you are using a device for eight hours
a day it's $240.
And with $240, you get a device, directly
buy the device and once and own it for all.
And another thing, these things, device clouds
is very much useful when you have these kind
of rare issues on different devices or a random
device.
Then you can have, like, one license and just
use that device.
So these are my thoughts which I am actually
facing on having this in the past three years.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;Shauvik Choudhary: Sure, sure, we agree
with that.
So this is what we came up with the best practices;
right?
But this is going to be, you know, different
in different context; right?
So you have to also decide what subset is
good for your app; right?
There's no golden number that you should test
for this, test for all apps; right?
So there's nothing like that.
So you have to go through it, ask yourself
-- another question was about device cloud,
aren't they expensive.
But again, another thing is if you buy a device
today, the life of the device is probably
two years, and then what do you do after that;
right?
So here you are renting all the devices; right?
So it again depends on your use case.
If you want to go thorough on one particular
device, then probably you can buy it.
Otherwise, if you just want to run one test
across different devices, perhaps device cloud
is cheaper; right?
Then another thing about audience; right?
So maybe the current solutions out there are
not good enough to give you a variety of real
devices, and that may be something that people
can work on in future.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;Yusuke Tsutsumi: I actually have some specific
replies, too.
So the platform agnostic test framework, you're
definitely right, there's going to be actions
that aren't necessarily cross compatible between
the two, that's an unfortunate part.
The kind of problem we're tackling is how
to scale the testing as best as possible;
right?
So the best you can do right now with existing
platforms there are some actions that can
be shared.
For instance, Appium works, as long as the
naming of the elements on both iOS and Android
are the same, you can actually perform a majority
of the actions the same way as well.
So that's a caveat.
You didn't find that?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah, I got that.
So that would be specifically to your test
classes.
Could it work on your particular test thing.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;Yusuke Tsutsumi: So you don't have control
over that is what you're saying.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah, you have control over that.
But once you come to the platform test framework,
that should be supporting both the platforms,
not specific to your particular test cases
on your application.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;Yusuke Tsutsumi: Well, yeah --
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; That's the problem.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;Yusuke Tsutsumi: That's unfortunately; right?
If you're not able to talk to the people who
wrote the app and tell them please use the
consistent naming then you're right, that's
unfortunate and you're going to have to deal
with that yourself.
I think most of the time, though, as long
as you have some collaboration with the teams
who are actually authoring those apps you
probably won't run into as big of a problem
there.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; My thing was it's not about controlling
your application.
That is controllable.
That part is fine.
But the platform, test (indiscernible) market
is not about your application.
It is a test environment which will support
the testing of single app on multiple thing.
So that controlling on different platforms
of your application, your application can
be controlled.
The UI of your application --
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;Yusuke Tsutsumi: Oh, you're talking about
actions external to the app itself.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;Yusuke Tsutsumi: Yeah.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; So your app is controlled.
Obviously that is controllable.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;Yusuke Tsutsumi: Sure.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; The other part, that his the main thing
which is not controllable.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;Yusuke Tsutsumi: Well, sure.
There's no framework we found -- We'd be with
you.
There's no framework we found that will actually
help you control actions outside your app
in any significant way.
Yep, definitely true there.
Yes, it only costs maybe $240 to buy your
device.
But how much does it cost a human being to
go over to your device, restart your device
every once in a while?
And how long does it cost someone to develop
time to actually run and the automation, connect
it, and make sure it's going to auto restart
and do all the work that Appurify, for example,
has worked on?
That's the type kind of costs that end up
overcoming anything beyond actual hardware.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I think if you say device anywhere perfect
to mobile, they charge you for the hiring
the device operations.
But you write your own tests and run it over
that thing.
So the writing the test is still on your part,
which device (indiscernible) doesn't take
care.
They only provide you the devices on higher
--
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;Yusuke Tsutsumi: Of course, yeah.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; So here if they're charging $30 per hour
for any device, okay, and you are using -- if
you are doing a UI tests on Android, it wouldn't
be run so fast as you are running it on a
PC or on a Web browser.
It will surely take time because the UI interactions,
the device doesn't -- it would take time.
And then you would be probably running your
test over three, four hours, five hours, something.
So if you run it over a period of time, it
would cost you the same as the device.
So again, these licenses are yearly based.
These are not like once you pay.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;Yusuke Tsutsumi: Sure.
So your company, right --
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;Yusuke Tsutsumi: So I hate to interrupt
this great discussion, but let's keep going.
You guys can take it offline.
Thank you so much, Yusuke and Shauvik for
presenting.
It takes a lot of courage to come up here
and talk.
Thank you.
