coming also all the remote sites so we
will kick-off see a quantum AI have
speaker series and a very pleased and
honored that we have illustris guest
john prescott who will kick off the
speaker series john is actually based
across town in pasadena at Caltech where
he is richard feynman professor he's
there since 83 and previously he got his
PhD from howard so until the mid 90s he
did more like physics cosmology
elementary particles was then switched
to quantum information and started IQ is
the Institute for quantum information at
Caltech where many interesting results
were achieved and in his career I think
you had 45 PhDs and 40 postdocs and like
I think this Rumia is becoming testimony
to it because you are surrounded by a
preska postdocs and PhDs and sergio and
our team was learned from john so I
definitely left his mark on the field of
quantum information and then just a few
days ago I was told that when John gives
or has a guest who gives a talk so and
he is being introduced with a poem and I
thought oh my god that's a high bar but
fortunately Dave Bacon and our team came
through and he put a little Limerick
together to announce John so we'll try
this
there was once a physicist named John
who threw qubits into the beyond across
the horizons I went but was I really
spent or destined to become Hawking
radiation so this is a very geeky
Limerick even for Google standards but
maybe a last thing I should say about
John I had the pleasure to witness this
birthday symposium which was just a few
months ago and that was quite a sigh it
was a lot of highly decorated
from nobel prize winners to winners of
the fundamental prize of physics and ya
was surrounded by the world elite of
physicists and is highly respected among
them so I'm very happy that you're going
to give the first tokens are serious
Johnny okay thanks a lot
Cartman and good job on the reading of
the Limerick thank you Dave I haven't
been introduced by a limerick
as I recall this is gonna be a talk
about quantum physics but it's also to
some extent about technology you know
you guys know more about technology than
I do I have this laptop I think it's
pretty cool and we all recognize I'm
sure you more than I the technology that
seems impressive to us now is going to
be replaced by the end of the century by
new technology that we can't really
expect to imagine at this stage but it's
fun to think about future technologies I
may not be the best qualified to do that
because unlike many of you I am NOT an
engineer I'm a theoretical physicist and
maybe I'm not especially knowledgeable
about how computers work but as a
physicist I know that the crowning
intellectual achievement of the past
century has been the development of
quantum theory so it's natural to wonder
about how the development of quantum
theory in a 20th century is going to
impact 21st century technologies and in
particular information technology on
quantum theory is over a hundred years
old but there are some ways in which
classical and quantum systems differ
that we are really only appreciating
deeply in the last couple of years and
those properties have to do with
information encoded in physical systems
to a physicists information is something
that we can encode and store in the
state of some physical system
like the pages of a book but
fundamentally all physical systems are
really quantum systems governed by
quantum physics so information is
something that we can encode and store
in a quantum system and information
carried by quantum systems has some
famously counterintuitive property so
physicists like to speak about the
weirdness of quantum theory and we
relish that weirdness and take great
delight in it but more recently we're
asking more seriously whether it's
possible to put that weirdness to work
to exploit unusual properties of quantum
information to perform tasks that
wouldn't be possible if this were a less
weird classical world and that desire to
put weirdness to work has driven the
emergence of a field we call quantum
information science which from my
perspective derives a lot of its
intellectual vitality from three main
ideas quantum entanglement quantum
computing and quantum error correction
and my goal in the talk is to introduce
you to these ideas if you're not already
familiar with them so starting at the
beginning we know that we can express
classical information in terms of bits
where we might think of a bit as an
object like a ball that can be either
one of two colors say red or green and
if I want to I can store a bit in a box
and then later on if I open the box the
color ball I put in comes out again so
we can recover a bit and read it quantum
information too can be expressed in
terms of indivisible units what we call
quantum bits or qubits and for many
purposes it's useful to think of a qubit
as an object stored in a box but where
now we can open the box in two
complimentary ways two different ways to
prepare or observe the state of a qubit
and if I put information in door number
one or door number two
then later on I can open the same door
again and the color that I put in will
come out of the box
just like it were a classical bit but if
I say store information in door number
one and then later on open the
complimentary door door number two then
it's unpredictable what we'll find it
has probability 1/2 of being read
probability 1/2 of being green so if
you're going to observe quantum
information you have to do it the right
way if you do it in the wrong way you'll
actually damage the information and one
reason why that's important is
appreciated if we think about copying
quantum states if I had a quantum
copying machine that would mean that if
I happen to a put information in door
number one of a qubit I could make a
copy and then I could open door number
one of the original and the duplicate
and out of both I would find the color
that I put in or if I put information in
door number two of the qubit I could
make a copy and open door number two on
the original and the duplicate and the
color that I put in would come out of
both boxes but in fact there is no such
machine a machine that copies unknown
quantum states is not allowed by the
rules of quantum mechanics and the
reason is that to copy what's inside the
box the machine has to probe what's
inside and if it opens the right door
the door that I use then it can copy the
information no problem just as though it
were classical but if it opens the wrong
door it will damage the information and
at that point it won't be possible to
make a high-fidelity copy so although we
might be able to clone sheep we can't
clone a qubit we can't copy unknown
quantum states now there are lots of
possible physical realizations of qubits
I'm going to mention a couple of others
later on in the talk but just so you'll
have something to something concrete to
think about for the moment you can
imagine a single photon or particle of
light which has an electric field and
that electric field can be oriented
either horizontally or vertically
corresponding to observing our qubit
through door number one and seeing two
possibilities or we could imagine
observing it in these 45-degree rotated
axes that corresponds to opening door
number two the complan
or to observe the qubit the really
interesting differences between
classical and quantum information arise
only when we consider systems with more
than one part so suppose we have two
qubits they can be far apart from one
another one is at Caltech in Pasadena
the other is in the custody of my friend
far away in the Andromeda galaxy but a
long time ago when these two qubits were
both on earth and could interact with
one another they were prepared in a
particular state with some interesting
properties namely I can open my box in
Pasadena and open it through either door
number one or door number two in either
way what comes out of the box is random
as probability 1/2 of being either red
or green and the same thing is true for
my friend and Andromeda you can open
either box and either way sees a random
bit so neither one of us by opening his
box can acquire any information this
generates a random bit and that's kind
of surprising because with two boxes we
ought to have been able to absorb to
store two bits of information so where
is that information hidden the answer
for this particular state of the two
boxes is that all the information is
actually encoded in the correlations
between the two boxes for this
particular state if my friend and I both
open door number one we're guaranteed to
find the same color could be right could
be green but we always find the same one
if we open the same door and likewise if
we both open door number two we always
find the same color probability one-half
of being red probability one-half being
green but it's guaranteed to be the same
if we open the same door and there are
four distinguishable ways in which a box
in Pasadena could be correlated with a
box in a Drama Doe we could either see
the same bit or opposite bit when we
both open door number one or we both
open door number two we've chosen one of
those four ways so that's two bits of
information stored in the boxes but
what's unusual is the information is
locally inaccessible we can't acquire
any of that information by looking at
the
one at a time and that property of
quantum information that it can be
stored non locally shared between two
distantly separated systems is what we
call quantum entanglement and that's the
really central essential way in which
quantum information is different from
classical information correlations
themselves are not such an unusual thing
we encounter them all the time in daily
life I normally wear two socks that are
the same color and means that if you
look at my left foot then you know for
sure what color to expect when you look
at my right foot you know Department
just tried it at work and that's a
correlation okay and you might say it's
kind of similar with the boxes if I want
to see what my friend is going to see
when he opens door number one in
Andromeda I can open door number one in
Pasadena if I want to know what my
friend is going to see when he opens
door number two I can open door number
two so aren't the boxes really just like
the socks is no they're really different
there's a big difference between this
quantum correlation and classical
correlations an essential difference is
there's just one way to look at Assad
but we have these two complementary ways
of looking at a qubit of opening of
quantum box and that means that the
correlations among qubits are richer and
more interesting than correlations among
classical bits this phenomenon of
quantum entanglement is an old thing it
was discussed quite explicitly by
Einstein in a famous 1935 paper with two
collaborators and two Einstein quantum
entanglement was so unsettling as to
indicate that something is missing from
our current understanding of the quantum
description of nature and that paper
induced some interesting responses
including one from shorting or later
that year which was especially
insightful and Schrodinger described
entanglement this way he said the best
possible knowledge of a whole
does not necessarily include the best
possible knowledge of its parts what he
meant was that even if we know exactly
how those two boxes were prepared you
know everything about those two boxes we
are still helpless to predict what will
be found when we open one of the boxes
in Pasadena or Andromeda and it was
Schrodinger who suggested using the word
entanglement or entangled to describe
that situation he also said it's
discomforting that the theory should
allow a system to be steered or piloted
into one or the other type of state at
the experimenters mercy in spite of his
having no access to it shorting or meant
isn't it odd that it's up to me to
decide by opening door number one or
door number two whether I will know what
my friend will see when he opens door
number one or door number two but
rooting are also understood that this
does these correlations don't enable us
to send a message from Pasadena to
Andromeda instantaneously no matter what
I do my friend opens either door number
one or door number two and just finds a
random bit learning nothing about what I
did and receiving no information from me
now this phenomenon or idea of quantum
entanglement did not advance very much
for thirty years after that until the
mid-60s when John Bell started us
thinking about quantum entanglement in a
rather different way not just as
something weird but something
potentially useful a resource that we
can use to do things specifically Bell
described games that two players can
play Alice and Bob it's a cooperative
game Alice and Bob are on the same side
they're both trying to win the way the
game works is that Alice and Bob receive
inputs and they are to produce outputs
which are correlated in a certain way
depending on the inputs that they
receive and if they receive some
correlated bits before the game began
they're allowed to consult those
correlated bids but under the rules of
the game Alice and Bob cannot
communicate between the time that they
receive the inputs and the time that
they produce
their outputs and for this particular
game if they play the best possible
strategy they can win with a probability
of success 3/4 averaged over the inputs
that they could receive if we assume
they're uniformly distributed but
there's a quantum version of the game
it's the same game but now Alice and Bob
are permitted to use entangled qubits
that were distributed before the game
began and by making use of that
entanglement they can play a better
quantum strategy and win the game with
the higher success probability above 85%
so the quantum correlations are good for
something they allow you to win this
game with higher probability and
experimental physicists have been
playing the game for decades now and
they keep winning with this higher
probability of success that Belle showed
us is possible in quantum physics so
these quantum correlations stronger than
classical correlations really do seem to
be part of the way nature behaves Oh
dine Stein quantum entanglement was kind
of disgusting
he called it spooky action at a distance
in a derisive tone that sounds even more
derisive when you say it in German but
it doesn't matter in physics what
Einstein things right nature is the way
experiments reveal her to be and we have
to learn to love her as she is quantum
entanglement is really part of the world
okay so in a world with quantum
correlations we can use those
correlations to do things that we
wouldn't be able to do if all
correlations with classical boxes are
not like Sox's you can win a game with a
probability of 85% and so 75% is that
really a big deal
yeah this is a really really big deal
and to appreciate why it's a big deal
we really should think about systems
with many parts suppose for example that
I have a book it's a hundred pages long
okay consists of a hundred subsystems
each of page if it were a classic
a book rather with bits printed on every
page you could read a single page and
you know one percent of the content of
the book okay
ten pages you know ten percent of
contents of the book but suppose it's a
highly entangled quantum book okay then
if you look at the pages one at a time
what you see is really just random
gibberish which tells you nothing about
the content of the book if it's a highly
entangled book if you want to
distinguish one entangled quantum book
from another you can't tell the
difference by looking at the pages one
at a time because the information isn't
printed on individual pages almost all
the information is encoded in the
correlations among the pages if you
wanted to stick which one such book from
another you have to make a difficult
collective observation on many pages at
once perhaps more than half the pages in
the book if I have a quantum system
consisting of qubits and a rather modest
number of qubits just a few hundred if I
wanted to give a complete description of
all the ways in which those qubits are
correlated with one another I would have
to write down a huge amount of classical
information more bits than the number of
atoms in the visible universe it'll
never be possible even in principle to
write a description like that down this
is too much classical information to
describe this extravagant correlation of
just a few hundred qubits and that
property of quantum information that we
can't hope to describe it using
classical information was intriguing in
particular to the Caltech physicist
Richard Fineman and it led phiman to
make the suggestion in the early 1980s
that if we could process quantum bits
instead of classical bits operate a
scalable quantum computer we'd be able
to perform tasks that would be beyond
the capability of any conceivable
digital computer the fineman's idea was
that if we can't even write down in
terms of classical bits the state of a
few hundred qubits then perhaps by
processing the qubits we'd be able to
perform attach that we can't emulate
with ordinary digital computers when
phiman was making this suggest
in the early 1980s there was an
undergraduate at Caltech concentrating
in mathematics named Peter shor and sure
like all Caltech undergraduates had to
take our core curriculum everybody at
Caltech has to learn quantum mechanics
and even if you major in music we don't
have a lot of music major everybody has
to learn quantum mechanics when you're a
sophomore and Peter did and as far as I
know that was the most advanced class in
physics that he took but like many
Caltech undergraduates he remembered
what he learned as a sophomore about
quantum physics and he drew upon that
knowledge about 13 years later to make
an amazing discovery
sure in 1994 realized that if you could
build a quantum computer it would be
able to solve certain problems like
finding the prime factors of large
composite integers very very quickly
that for a quantum computer factoring
would not be much harder than
multiplying numbers together and when I
first heard about this as Hartmann said
in the introduction this was 1994 I
didn't know much about computer science
or cryptography I was working on
particle physics and cosmology and
gravitational physics but as soon as I
heard about this I was really amazed and
stunned because I understood the
implications are quite remarkable that
the boundary between hard problems and
easy problems the problems that we
should be able to solve someday with
advanced technologies versus the
problems that we never have any hope of
solving that boundary is different than
it otherwise would be because this is a
quantum world instead of a classical
world and that was one of the most
interesting things I'd ever heard in my
scientific life and it led me eventually
to change the direction of my own
research toward quantum information and
quantum computing just to clarify what
I'm talking about I'm talking about the
scaling of the resources that we need to
solve the problem a hard factoring
problem nowadays is factoring 193 digits
that's been done by a net
work of a few hundred workstations
collaborating over the Internet in a few
months but from what we know about the
scaling of the best classical algorithms
factoring if that same hardware were
used to try to factor a 500 digit number
it would take longer than the age of the
universe so that's not something that we
expect to happen
factoring 500 digit numbers in the very
near future with classical computers now
let's imagine that I have a quantum
computer with the same clock speed as
that classical computer it can perform
the same number of basic operations per
second as the classical computer but now
on qubits instead of bits and then we
would be able to factor using Shor's
algorithm the 193 digit number in about
a tenth of a second and the 500 digit
number in 2 seconds there's a completely
different scaling of the resources we
need with the size of the input to the
problem when we run Shor's algorithm
who cares about factoring people do care
about factor because the presume
difficulty of factoring is the basis of
widely used public key cryptography
schemes there are other problems that
quantum computers can break which are
alternative ways of doing public key one
quantum computers are widely available
we won't be able to protect our privacy
in the same way that we're doing it now
using current public key schemes
alternatives exist but it's still not
exactly clear how we will best protect
our privacy in the post quantum world
that's a ongoing subject of discussion
but the more important thing more
broadly that we learned from Peter shor
zalgar in them is that there's an
interesting classification of problems
there are problems which are classically
hard and quantumly easy problems that we
can't solve with reasonable scaling of
resources with classical computers but
which we can with quantum computers and
so it becomes an urgent question what
lies in that intermediate region that's
quantumly easy and classically hard and
we still have a lot to learn about that
I think we do know that quantum
computers have limitations they can't
speed
everything it seems that spectacular
speed ups are possible only for problems
with the special structure and in
particular we don't think that quantum
computers can dramatically speed up
problems which are np-complete the
hardest problems for which we can
efficiently verify the solution with a
classical computer in the worst case we
can't do much better than brute-force
search for the answer in that case
quantum computers can speed up route for
searching but not exponentially only
quadratically a more modest speed up
it's important to keep in mind though
that quantum computers can also solve
problems that are not in NP problems
where we can't check the answer with the
classical computer and indeed the most
natural application for quantum
computers is to simulate the time
evolution of quantum systems with many
particles many parts which might be of
interest in chemistry or in the quantum
field theories that physicists use to
describe elementary particles so for
example we can ask about the type of
problem that I as a particle physicists
used to worry about suppose we want to
consider a high energy collision between
particles and we'd like to be able to
sample accurately from the possible
states of many particles that could be
produced in that high energy collision
and at least in some cases we've shown
that that simulation can be done with
efficient scaling of resources on a
quantum computer which we don't believe
is the case
classically so it may be that a quantum
computer is capable of simulating
efficiently any quantum process that can
occur in nature though that's still an
open question in particular with regard
to processes in which both quantum
mechanics and gravity are important so
quantum computers would have wonderful
capabilities we'd love to have them lots
of people around the world are working
on quantum computing so why don't we
have them already what's the big delay
well it's really really really hard and
part of what makes it hard is that
quantum systems are more susceptible to
error to the damaging effects
noise in classical systems this assist
sometimes like to speak about a quantum
state of a cat which is a superposition
of the live and dead state of a cat or
in this case the more humane case of a
awaken sleeping cat now we never observe
in our everyday lives that kind of
superposition of macroscopically
distinguishable states and we understand
why that's the case because no real cat
can be perfectly isolated from its
surroundings and the interactions with
the environment very quickly in effect
measured the cat projecting it onto a
state which is either completely alive
or completely dead that's a process that
we called decoherence and decoherence is
actually very important for helping us
understand why classical physics works
so well why when we consider macroscopic
systems we don't usually have to worry
about quantum phenomena it's because
decoherence is extremely fast for big
systems now a quantum computer when we
managed to build one may not be much
like a cat but it will like a cat
inevitably interact it's some level with
its environment there will be key
coherence and so the quantum computer
will crash unless we can find some way
of fighting off the coherence of
preventing sources of error from making
the quantum computer fail errors are a
problem even in the classical world as
we all know I have many bits that I
cherish and I would hate to lose and
everywhere there are dragons lurking who
take delight and tampering with those
bits and flipping them from red to green
or whatever well we know a ways of
protecting ourselves from the Dragons we
can encode information redundantly so
that if I have a bit that I want to be
sure to keep I can for example store
backup copies of the bit that's an
example of a simple code which can be
used to protect against errors the
dragon might come along
and flip the color of one of the balls
but as long as the dragon hasn't had a
chance interact with more than one ball
I can employ a busy beaver of the sort
we have many up at Caltech and we can
ask the beaver if he sees that one ball
is a different color than the others to
recolor that ball so that all three
match and so as long as only one of the
balls has been damaged we can recover
the original encoded state and protect
against errors so we'd like to use the
same concept of protecting information
from error through redundant storage in
the quantum world but there are some
potential obstacles as we've already
discussed we can't copy unknown quantum
states so I can't take the state of a
quantum computer and store a backup copy
in case the original gets damaged and
there are more things that can go wrong
with quantum information than classical
information it could be that the dragon
will come along and open door number one
of a qubit and flip the color of the
ball and reclose the box that would be
like a bit flip that occurs in a
classical bit but it's also possible
that the dragon could open door number
two and change the color of the ball
that's what we call a phase error in
quantum information it really has no
analogue in the classical world and
there's another way of thinking about
these phase errors another way a phase
error or an error through door number
two could occur would be for a dragon to
open door number one look at the color
of the ball and not flip the color but
just remember the color make a record of
what the color is and that record will
damage the information if we try to look
at the qubit through door number two and
in many physical situations it's easier
to remember or record the value of a bit
than to flip a bit and that means these
phase errors are particularly pervasive
and hard to avoid in many types of
physical systems
in fact if we want a resist decoherence
it means we have to somehow prevent the
environment from learning about the
state of the quantum computer during the
course of the computation if some record
is left behind of what the intermediate
state of the quantum computer was that
will cause the quantum computer to fail
if a quantum computation was successful
then it should be that if you ask the
quantum computer after it's done what
did you just do
while you were factoring that huge
number it should always answer I forget
because no record was left behind of the
state of the computer at intermediate
times so we really need to do a kind of
secret computation completely sealed off
from the surroundings if we want a
quantum computer to succeed when we're
done with the computation and we have
the result it's ok to broadcast that to
the world and tell everyone what the
answer is but we can't have any record
left behind of the state of the quantum
computer during the course of the
computation because that will cause the
computation to fail so we have to figure
out a way to encrypt the processing that
we're doing and really our enemy here is
entanglement it is entanglement between
our quantum computer and its environment
which drives decoherence and the way to
fight off that entanglement is to use
entanglement to our advantage to store
information in a highly entangled State
if I want to store one logical qubit it
is possible to do that if I have five
physical qubits in such a way that if
the dragon comes along and looks at one
of those five cubits the dragon can't
acquire any information about what the
logical state is of the qubit by looking
at that one box this is just like the
hundred page book I described earlier
the state of the five qubits is highly
entangled so if you want to know what
the information is stored in that five
cubed book you can't learn that
information by looking at a single qubit
it's not there it's in the correlations
among the qubits and we can again ask
the beaver to help us out after the
dragon has done something and we and we
don't know what we can ask the beaver to
make
some kind of collective observation on
the five cubits which we can do with the
quantum computer and from that
information learn not the state of the
logical qubit that we're trying to
protect we don't want anyone even the
beaver to know what that is but what
damage has occurred which of the boxes
has been damaged what needs to be done
to repair the damage and then the beaver
can reinstate the original encoded state
if only one of the qubits has been
damaged
that's the principle of quantum error
correction and how do we actually get
this to work well we'll see but one hero
of the story is my colleague Alexey
Kataya I first met Alexey in 1997 on his
first visit to the US he came to Caltech
and gave a talk on the first day we met
and I made these notes and it was really
one of the most exciting days of my
scientific life to talk to Kataya that
way because I learned from him an idea
which I felt could potentially be
transformative about quantum error
correction what I learned from Kataya is
the connection between error correction
and topology topology is the word
mathematicians use if they want to
describe properties of objects that
remain invariant when we smoothly deform
the object without tearing it and
likewise we would like the way a quantum
computer processes protected information
to remain invariant when we deform the
computer by introducing some noise so
we'd like to make use of physical
interactions that have topological
features physicists have known about
such interactions for a long time for
example I can consider an electron
interacting with a magnetic flux tube
and if that electron is carried around
the flux tube even though it never
penetrates inside to interact directly
with the magnetic field the quantum
state of the electron will be modified
and that modification is really a
topological property it stays the same
if we do
form the trajectory of the electron the
only thing that matters is the winding
number of the electron around the flux
tube there are more exotic types of
topological interactions that can occur
in two-dimensional media where there are
point-like particles which we call any
ons non-abelian anyons in particular
have the property that I can consider a
system of many of these particles in our
two-dimensional media and there are lots
of quantum states we can construct of
these many antion's a number of states
which is which are all distinguishable
which is exponential in the number of
particles but all of these quantum
states locally look the same we can't
see any of the information that
distinguishes one state from another by
looking at the particles one at a time
okay
the environment might interact with the
particles one at a time but that doesn't
allow any information about the encoded
state to leak to the environment and we
can process the information just by
performing exchanges of the particles
having particles swap places to get a
different quantum state which can be a
logical operation in a quantum computer
so we can imagine operating a
topological quantum computer that's what
I learned from Kataya in 1997 which we
can initialize by preparing pairs of
these particles in the two dimensional
medium antion's
and then process information by
performing a sequence of exchanges or
swaps of the particles so that their
world lines and two plus one dimensional
space-time trace out abrade in that
three-dimensional space and then we can
read out the information at the end by
for example bringing the particles
together pairwise and observing whether
they disappear whether they annihilate
or not and what makes this idea
beautiful is that the computation is
intrinsically resistant to decoherence
we keep the temperature low so there
aren't a lot of stray any ons wandering
around if we keep the NE Anza far apart
from one another except at the very
beginning when we create
pears and the very end when we
annihilate the pears then there's no way
for the information that's being
processed to leak to the environment and
if we perform the right braids we'll get
the right answer
so it's topologically protected quantum
computation so that looks pretty good to
a theorist but how are we actually going
to build the system that has such non
abelian antion's that could be the basis
of the hardware for a quantum computer
well here we can make use of another
idea which qatayef and others have
develop a trick for cutting electrons in
half you can think about it this way we
can imagine a wire which is
superconducting superconducting means
the wire conducts electricity without
any resistance and there are really two
types of superconducting wires what we
call conventional ordinary
superconductors and something called a
topological superconductor and at the
boundary between these two types of
superconductivity sits an object we call
a my Arana Fermi on what's unusual about
a topological superconductor is that we
can add one extra electron to this
topological superconductor and that
electron dissolves and disappears in so
doing it actually changes the state of
this pair of my Arana fermions at the
edge now each buyer on a Fermi on
individually doesn't change in any
perceptible way but the pair of Meyer on
a fermions does and that can be used to
store a qubit of information experiments
have been done to look for this effect
they are not yet conclusive
they'll have to be repeated and made
more invincible eminem's that this type
of topological superconductivity and my
honor fermions can be realized in
systems that experimental physicists
know how to build now using
semiconductors and superconductors of
course we'd like to be able to process
the information by doing some kind of
braiding of these Marano fermions and
that is in principle possible if we have
a network of wires we can manipulate the
position of a my Arana Fermi
by adjusting some voltage gates which
determines where the boundary is between
conventional and topological
superconductor so I can take one of the
my Arana fermions and park it around the
corner of a t-junction
move the first one over to the left and
then unpark the other one and so we've
achieved an exchange of to my Arana
fermions that would be like an
elementary logic gate in a quantum
computer so this type of experiment
hasn't been done yet we're hopeful that
it can be done in the next couple of
years and that would be a potential step
towards building one type of quantum
hardware but apart from any
technological implications it would be a
real milestone for physics to realize
this type of exotic topological
interaction between particles in some
system that physicists can control so
I've talked about hardware I would like
to mention that there are a variety of
different ways of developing hardware
that are under development many of which
look very interesting and in particular
it's timely to talk about ion trap
technology because Dave Winelands work
in that area was recognized by the most
recent Nobel Prize in Physics last year
wildin and others have over a couple of
decades developed ion trap technology
they have the ability to store
individual atoms which have an electron
stripped off so they're electrically
charged their ions they can be stored
with electromagnetic fields for a long
time and although each one is just an
individual atom we can encode a qubit by
imagining that each atom is either in
its lowest energy state it's ground
state or in some long-lived excited
state and if I want to read out the
state of the qubit that's actually
pretty easy we can illuminate the ions
with laser light and if we choose the
frequency of the light suitably then the
ions will remain dark if they're in the
green state of the qubit if they're in
the red state they will interact
strongly with delight and fluoresce so
they'll glow visibly and we can read out
a series of
zeroes and ones that way when we're
ready to read out our quantum computer
but of course we want to do more than
just read out we want to be able to
process the information so we have to be
able to perform logic gates on pairs of
qubits we got to get the qubits to
interact and in this case we would use
the electrostatic repulsion between ions
for that purpose we can do something
like this I can pick out an ion in a
trap and address it with the pulse laser
choose the frequency and duration of
that laser pulse properly so that if the
ion is in the red state nothing will
happen if it's in the green state the
ion makes a transition from the green to
the red state and at the same time
because of those interactions a
vibrational mode of all the ions in the
trap is excited and then I can pick out
another ion in the trap and address it
with the pulse laser choose the
frequency and duration of that pulse in
such a way that nothing will happen if
the ions are not vibrating but if they
are vibrating that ion wander go a
transition from one state to the other
and the vibration will stop so what I've
done is I've picked out two ions in the
trap and if the first ion had been red
nothing would have happened if it's
green then both ions make a transition
and so if I start out with a
superposition of red and green for the
first ion I get a correlated quantum
state an entangled pair of qubits for
the pair of ions the quantum computation
would consist of many such steps each
one and entangling operation acting on a
pair of ions at least that cartoon is
the way a theorist would describe what
goes on in Winelands laughs if you go to
his lab at NIST in Boulder Colorado and
look around you're in for kind of a
shock because underlying that cartoon is
a great deal of technical complexity
which might make you pessimistic about
the prospects for scaling up ion traps
to thousands or millions of qubits well
it's gonna be very very hard
Weinman and others have an idea of how
to do it but it looks very difficult we
don't know whether that will succeed or
not on the other hand there are other
ways of realizing cupid's physically
which are making rapid progress
one makes use of super conductivity
again but in a different way than I
described in the case of my ironic
fermions we can use superconducting
wires to store quantum information and
though although for practical reasons
this isn't the best way to do it and
you'll you'll learn about better ways to
do it when John Martinez is here in a
month or two the you can visualize how
we could store information by thinking
of a closed loop of superconducting wire
with a persistent current flowing and
the current can flow either clockwise or
counterclockwise around the loop those
are the two distinguishable states of
the qubit and what's remarkable about
that encoding is that the information is
encoded in a collective state of
billions of electrons and yet we can
treat it like a single unit of quantum
information and protected and
manipulated quite accurately another
possibility is to use a single electron
which has a magnetic field the spin
where its North Pole can be oriented
either up or down so that's a qubit and
what's remarkable about that encoding is
it's just one little electron but yet we
can address it prepare its state
manipulated state get to such qubits to
interact with a good accuracy using
current technology both of these
technologies have been advancing
impressively in the last couple of years
and there are a number of others a
number of other ways that have been
proposed and are under development for
proceeding with building quantum
hardware we just don't know at this
stage which of these is going to turn
out or maybe it'll be none of these and
some other idea that hasn't been
proposed yet each of these technologies
has advantages and disadvantages perhaps
the systems of the future will use
hybrid technologies where we combine
together different types of qubits so we
can take advantage of the strong points
of each of these technologies no matter
what how we build the hardware we're
going to have to do error correction as
I described earlier and actually the
best idea we have about how to do this
error correction and a reasonably
efficient manner goes back to these
topological encodings of information
that I mentioned the best idea we
is that if you're gonna use ions or
electron spins or superconducting
circuits you can by getting such systems
to interact in a prescribed way make
them behave like these topological media
that I described that support any odds
and so we can use that system to store
quantum information robustly but that
will only work effectively if our gates
are good enough we have to have a low
enough rate of error per gate in order
for these error correction ideas to
effectively protect a quantum computer
against the damaging effects of noise we
would like the probability of error per
gate to be considerably less than 1% in
order to have reasonably efficient error
correction schemes and the hardware is
advancing and getting into that
interesting regime where we can do two
qubit gates with the required accuracy
for quantum error correction to be
effective so how far do we have to go
before we can build factoring machines
that can really outperform what can be
done with classical computers well let's
say we want to break the RSA scheme is
it's usually implemented these days that
means we have to factor 2048 bit number
we know you can do that with a classical
computer it's just a question of
resources John Martinez has done these
estimates which I'm stealing from him if
you want a fact or a 2048-bit number
then you just have to cover one quarter
of the land area of north america with a
server farm that would cost about a
million trillion dollars the power
requirement would be about a million
terawatts which is about a hundred
thousand times the world's power output
today the bad news is you have to run
the algorithm for ten years to get the
answer and it would consume the world
supply of fossil fuels in a day so what
if you tried to do this with the
existing quantum technology which
Martinez has been a leader in developing
well we just do it by brute force if we
want to factor this number we need
something like ten thousand logical
qubits error-free qubits in order to
achieve that base
on the types of error rates that we
think are achievable are nearly
achievable with the current technology
we would need about 10 million physical
qubits keep them far enough apart so we
have lots of room to cool them and bring
in wires and then the current costs
Martinez estimates of making a really
good qubit in his lab is about ten
thousand dollars so we could get these
million ten million physical qubits
for if we're willing to spend a hundred
billion dollars and then we could run
the algorithm in 16 hours it would
consume 10 megawatts ok so actually this
is a somewhat rosier outlook than maybe
the current situation because it's such
a huge engineering challenge to scale
things up and we don't know exactly how
to do it but it indicates that we can
imagine in coming decades that this can
really be a practical technology you
just got to bring the cost down a bit
okay below a hundred billion dollars and
you'll hear more about that from
Martinez so there are three questions
about quantum computers that I've
discussed so far why do we want to build
one well for one thing because quantum
computers would be able perhaps to
simulate any process that occurs in the
quantum world that could be important in
chemistry and material science and from
a physicist point of view in simulating
exotic physical phenomena that particle
physicists like me or like I used to be
care about can we really build one well
we don't know of an obstacle in
principle that will prevent us from
succeeding if we use these principles of
quantum error correction and we can make
the hardware good enough then as far as
we can tell it ought to work how are we
going to do it that's still far from
clear these different approaches to
quantum hardware that I quickly
summarized for you or are all being
developed it's important that they all
be developed because we really don't
know which is going to turn out if any
of them to be the best scalable
technology but you know I am NOT an
engineer I'm a theoretical physicist so
I get excited about the potential ways
in which what we're learning by thinking
about quantum computing can be applied
to problems at the frontiers of physics
and there are many applications of
quantum information processing to
physics many of them have to do with
what we call the monogamy of
entanglement a difference between
classical and quantum correlations that
I haven't emphasized so much so far
classical correlations are polygamous
they can be shared by many parties Adam
and Betty both read the newspaper they
have the same information they become
correlated with one another and nothing
prevents Charlie from reading that same
newspaper so now all three of them are
correlated and Charlie is just as
strongly correlated with Betty and with
Adam as Adam and Betty are with one
another and the rest of us in the room
can read the newspaper and everybody
joins in on the correlation quantum
correlations are different we say they
are a monogamous they are harder to
share if Adam and Betty are strongly
entangled if they are fully entangled as
entangled as possible with one another
then they neither Adam nor Betty has the
ability to be correlated with any other
system
likewise if Betty is fully entangled
with Charlie then Betty and Charlie
cannot be correlated at all with Adam so
that's what we mean when we say the
entanglement is monogamous it can be
shared two ways and that monogamy can be
frustrating because Betty might want to
be entangled with both Adam and Charlie
but if she wants to entangle the Charlie
she has to sacrifice some of her
entanglement with Adam in order to do so
that feature that monogamy of
entanglement has many ramifications one
is in quantum cryptography if Adam and
Betty are nearly fully entangled with
one another if they can verify they are
very highly entangled for example by
playing Belle's game and winning and
then they will know that they have very
little correlation with anyone in the
outside world who would be a potential
eavesdropper they can use their
entanglement to generate a secret key
that they share a random string of
numbers that Adam has and Betty has but
which the outside world knows
little about and then with a little bit
of processing they can amplify that
privacy so that they are assured that
the world outside knows nothing about
their key and they can safely use it to
encrypt and decrypt a classical message
with information theoretic security no
attack by the East robber will succeed
in breaking such a protocol monogamy is
very important in the study of quantum
matter we might have a system of many
electrons and the interactions among the
electrons say make them want to entangle
with one another but if electron a is to
entangle with electron B then it's going
to give up some of its ability to
entangle with other electrons in the
system that it wants to entangle with
and so the system will have to arrive at
some compromise to relieve that
frustration that inability to entangle
with many particles at once to the best
degree possible and there are different
qualitatively different ways in which
the many-body state can find an
entangled state of matter which
correspond to different phases of matter
that can't be smoothly changed one to
another classifying the different phases
of quantum matter is really a problem in
understanding the types of entanglement
that can be shared by many particles and
monogamy is also important in the study
of black hole physics which has been a
subject that's been quite active over
the last year or so let me just take a
few minutes to tell you about what's
been going on actually we've known for a
long time nearly 40 years that black
holes although classically there are
objects from which nothing can escape
actually emit radiation because of
quantum effects we think a black hole if
it forms from the collapse of matter
will eventually evaporate completely
through this commission of Hawking
radiation and normally when systems get
thermalized and behave like they have
some characteristic temperature and
radiates like black holes do we believe
that such processes are microscopically
reversible in principle they could be
run backwards information doesn't really
get destroyed but it gets scrambled put
into a
form which is very hard to decode but
which in principle can be decoded so we
think black holes like other quantum
systems ought not to destroy information
just scramble it making it hard to
decode but black holes are different
than other systems in an important way
they have a highly deformed geometry
which I've tried to indicate here in
this diagram here time is running upward
this black line represents the event
horizon the boundary between the outside
and the inside of a black hole and this
green line is a slice of constant time a
space like surface but just think of it
as one particular time but because of
the distorted geometry it has this
unusual shape which means that the
collapsing matter from which the black
hole form and most of the outgoing
Hawking radiation emitted as the black
hole evaporates are at the same time
cross this single space like slice and
so if information really comes out of a
black hole in a highly scrambled form it
means the information is at the same
time as at two different places inside
the black hole and outside but remember
I told you that we can't copy quantum
information so we're kind of stuck here
if black holes don't destroy information
then it seems that they are quantum
copying machines that they were able to
clone a quantum state taking the
information encoded in the collapsing
matter and printing it in this outgoing
Hawking radiation and that caused great
puzzlement but for about 20 years we've
had an idea about how the situation is
resolved which is called black hole
complementarity it's a kind of crazy
idea it is that we should not think of
the outside system the Hawking radiation
and the inside system the collapsing
matter as two different parts of a big
system we should think of them as two
complementary ways of describing the
same system as so to speak door number
one and door number two of black hole
physics two complimentary descriptions
on the same system and that's not at all
obvious and then there we actually need
to understand why
calls better to clarify exactly why it
occurs but the idea is that this isn't
really cloning it's just we have two
descriptions of the same physics one is
appropriate for someone who falls into
the black hole the description of the
information in the collapsing body the
other is appropriate for someone who
stays outside that's the information
imprinted in the Xavier ship this idea
of black hole complementarity is
intended to reconcile three beliefs
which seem reasonable black holes don't
destroy information they merely scramble
it secondly that an observer who falls
through the horizon the boundary between
inside and outside of a black hole
doesn't notice anything unusual upon
entering the black hole everything seems
normal until later on when that party
will inevitably be torn apart by very
strong gravitational forces deep inside
the black hole and physics seems
perfectly normal from the point of view
of someone who stays outside the black
hole but what has recently been argued
is that these three things can
simultaneously be true and the problem
is this that if we consider an all black
hole which has been radiated for a long
time information is starting to leak out
of it as it evaporates that means that
the recently emitted radiation system B
has to be highly entangled with
radiation that was emitted earlier which
I called system C but we also know that
if a freely falling observer or falling
through the horizon sees not a lot of
particles but something that just looks
like empty space empty space actually
has a lot of entanglement between and
outside the black hole B and the region
inside Hey
so this recently emitted radiation has
to be highly entangled with the inside
of the black hole it also has to be
highly entangled with earlier radiation
and that's a problem because system B
can't be highly entangled with both a
and C that violates monogamy and so
we're really confused about what this
means what has been suggested is that we
should give up on an assumption to the
freely falling observers don't think
everything is smooth and nice and normal
when they cross from the outside to the
inside and the black hole in fact there
is no insight and they just hit
seething firewall the singularity where
you get torn apart is actually right at
the horizon that's the suggestion which
has been promoted recently and it's
crazy because if you just solve the
equations of general relativity to see
what the geometry of a black hole should
be that's not what you find you find in
fact the geometry should be very smooth
as you cross the horizon so we're really
confused about this the reason I'm
telling you about it is that this debate
could have occurred twenty years ago but
it's occurring now I think because the
gravitational physicists and string
theorists are more accustomed now to
thinking about their physical systems
from the point of view of quantum
information and entanglement and that's
a change which is occurring throughout
many areas of physics physics is a broad
subject we have the frontier of short
distances in which we study the
elementary particles and their
interactions the frontier of long
distances the evolution of the whole
universe and the properties of the early
universe but there's another frontier
also very exciting and very active which
you could call the complexity frontier
or entanglement frontier the study of
highly entangled systems with many parts
that encompasses quantum computing
trying to understand phases of quantum
matter in all the different ways in
which systems of many particles can be
entangled that's an area in which we can
expect great progress in this century
the Caltech we have a center devoted to
the exploration of this entanglement
frontier from many points of view and
the AI qim has a slogan which is nature
is subtle where we are playing on
Einstein's famous statement subtle is
the Lord but malicious he is not
Einstein for all his audacity and genius
underestimated the subtlety of nature
when he dismissed quantum entanglement
spooky action at a distance and what
we're trying to do in quantum
information science these days is to
enjoy and relish and explore and exploit
ultimately the subtlety of the quantum
world in all its facets and
ramifications thanks for listening to me
today
so I remember on notice thinking when
you were talking about how you have to
isolate the interior of the quantum
computer from outside observation that
my immediate response isn't he thought
as an engineer I was like man that's got
to be really tough to debug if
something's going wrong so I was
wondering so what are the implications
there for how you would program it do
you have to have like a mathematical
proof that your program is correct
cuz it doesn't seem like you could
examine what it's doing when it's
executing well of course what you could
do so the question is if what I said is
true that in order for a quantum
computer to work it has to be completely
isolated from the outside world and
we're not able to look inside at what
it's doing during the course of a
computation how would we ever debug it
how would we as are you as engineers
managed to figure out how to fix it when
it's broken and well the answer I mean
and only there's any answer that's
surprising to you you would have to in
the process of developing a quantum
computer benchmark different you know
subroutines by running them and seeing
how well they perform you can break it
off the big computation you can't
simulate with the classical computer
because that's the whole reason you're
building a quantum computer the pieces
of a computation you can simulate you
can compare such simulations to the
operation of the quantum hardware then
you can try to scale up to larger and
larger quantum circuits and in cases
where you're doing computations for
which it is easy to know what the answer
is make sure you're getting the right
answer if it's not working then you know
look at the individual parts of that
circuit and try to improve their
performance so there's no deep answer to
that it's just sort of the obvious
answer you mentioned earlier that
the quantum techniques don't work
equally well on all problems some of
them give exponential speed-up some of
the money in squared
I was wondering if you get give any
further intuition on what kinds of
problems for a different yeah so I think
the question is I said that there are
some problems that quantum computers can
achieve spectacular speed ups many
problems for which we think that's not
possible and so what's the intuition
about whether a problem lies in one
class or the other or what's a nice
characterization well we don't have a
complete answer to that I did say that
we do not expect exponential speed ups
to be possible for np-hard problems we
think that in such cases even a quantum
computer wouldn't in the worst case be
able to do much better than a
brute-force search and it can speed that
up a little bit but not a lot compared
to classical systems so first of all
we're talking about if we want to stay
within the class NP where we can check
the answer easily with a classical
computer about a rather special class of
problems which are outside P so they're
classically hard but not np-hard
factoring is a candidate for being in
their intermediate class so other
problems which are outside P we think
can't be solved in polynomial time with
a classical computer but are not in P
hard our candidates for quantum
algorithms but that's probably not
exactly the right answer and I also
tried to emphasize that we don't have to
limit ourselves to NP there are things
that quantum computers could do that we
wouldn't be able to check classically we
could check a quantum computer with
another quantum computer things like
simulation problem simulating quantum
systems with many parts and I think the
most potential that we currently know
from our current understanding of
quantum computers for non-trivial
applications involved such simulation of
quantum systems
could you say something about the
robustness of entanglement so in the
quantum when you were talking about
quantum computing it seemed like
entanglement was this very delicate
thing and you had to worry about the
decoherence problems that when two
particles interact with the outside
world the entanglement is lost but with
this black hole problem it seems like
the entanglement was indestructible and
that was why these three propositions
couldn't all be true
well entanglement is indestructible even
outside the context of the black hole
problem in the sense that if you have
systems that are entangled with one
another although they may interact with
the environment that doesn't really
destroy the entanglement
it just means that the entanglement can
now only be detected if we you know look
at entanglement between subsystems that
include the environment okay so the
problem is that we don't control the
environment very well so if we look at
just the system that we can control and
don't pay attention to the environment
then it can appear that the entanglement
is lost even though it's really there in
the case of the black hole problem I was
really talking about this issue of
principle of whether entanglement is
there or not not whether it's there in a
form that we can control or even decode
easily which actually is an interesting
question of principle is it a really
hard problem to do the decoding that
could detect this entanglement and if
it's a really hard problem do maybe the
laws of physics tell us that this
entanglement doesn't really have an
operational meaning so it sounds like it
might be very difficult for humans to
build such a computer do such computers
exists in natural settings where some
spontaneous result appears quite
naturally like for instance
superconductivity where some physical
state is just emergent from a large
group of particles and the way they
actually are doing it is a quantum
computer so we don't know how it's
happening
all right so the question is for humans
it may be hard to realize large-scale
quantum computers are there ways in
which nature does it are their natural
processes in which quantum computation
occurs so to speak spontaneously yeah I
mean it's sort of you know it was hard
for us to build a hydrogen bomb but the
Sun does it in fact it was hard to build
a fission bomb but there was a
spontaneous you know uranium reactor and
in Africa because too much uranium was
collected in one place so it's quantum
computation occurring by such a
naturally occurring process somewhere I
don't know I think my guess is that if
we really want large-scale quantum
computers which are hard to simulate
classically well I mean there are lots
of things going on in physics labs for
which that might be a fair statement
that there are states of quantum matter
one famous one is the high-temperature
superconductors which we don't
understand very well microscopically how
they work because we can't Hammond so
far been able to simulate them on
classical computers but so maybe that
system is you know by simulating itself
is performing a quantum computation in
some sense or more broadly whenever a
quantum system evolves forward in time
it is in a sense behaving like the
quantum computer but I'm afraid that's a
probably too broad a notion of what we
mean by quantum computer my guess is the
nature has a way of realizing quantum
computers the way is to allow engineers
to evolve who build them that's probably
the way nature does it
