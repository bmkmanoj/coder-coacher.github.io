Oxford University where I'm a research
fellow in philosophy and also I'm the
president of an organization called
given what we can and I'll be talking
about these types of things I should say
as well that I haven't always been a
philosopher I used to be a computer
scientist beforehand but I decided I was
interested in logic and things like this
which in my university the philosophy
department was mainly in charge of I
spent more and more time over there and
I was also very interested in a whole
lot of ethical questions and ended up
being a sucked away from computer
science to the world of philosophy but
hopefully you'll see that that's I've
got an approach to some of these
philosophical or ethical questions which
is perhaps more quantitative than you're
used to seeing from people who look at
these things so let's let's start I have
always been interested in charity and
helping other people and in particular
when I was an undergraduate I used to
get into conversations through the night
with my friends and they would say to me
you know in some heated political debate
say something like well if you think
that why don't you send all your money
to help people starving in Africa or you
know some other cliche like this but
this was meant to be a reductio of my
position that you know you can't
possibly think that because you'd have
to spend a lot of your time and effort
helping these other people but I started
to treat it more like you know maybe I
should be doing this maybe I should be
thinking about what I'm doing with my
income and maybe maybe actually that is
the logical conclusion if you think all
people are equal and so that you can
help people in poor countries for less
maybe I should be doing something like
that maybe we should investigate it and
I noticed a couple of philosophers have
written on this Peter Singer has a very
good papers on this and I'm an affluence
and morality for anyone who wants to
work up I and there's some very strong
arguments and I took these seriously and
start to think about what I could do in
my life if I really wanted to to help
people who are less fortunate than
myself
so when I was thinking about this I
divided the different ways I could think
of helping up into these four categories
one was a voluntary work one was my
career so what good could come through
my career another one was the personal
relationships that I have and another
one was donations and I thought that
that's something that a lot of people
neglect as a way that they can have a
lot of impact in the world it was also
the thing that I could most was most
amenable to analysis so I decided I
wanted to work out well what in terms of
donations could I do if I really wanted
to what could i cheap and that's the
topic of this talk really so I worked
out that over my career I'd be able to
earn about one and a half million pounds
and I encourage all of you to try to
work out what you'll earn over your
career I think this is a informative
thing to do particularly as you can work
out then what you could achieve if you
really wanted to and it's nice to know
that through through donations so it
might be that you can achieve even more
through your career I worked out that I
only really needed about 500,000 pounds
over my life if I kind of kept on my
current lifestyle which was which is
very good I have at that point I was a
graduate student and I had pretty much
all the things I really need it in my
life
I have a lovely wife and and great
friends and have you know wonderful
conversations and in see beautiful
places and travel to Europe know once or
twice a year on that living in but you
know it could take some a bit more
expensive
I could take some some travel and and
listen to some you know the best music
ever recorded and the things that I can
do would rival a lot of the things that
that a king could do a century earlier
you know it's we've got a pretty good in
the world today and so I thought
actually I have a lot of these things
which are a lot of value and a lot of if
I spent this this extra million pounds
on myself it wouldn't actually make my
life all that much better because I get
the things which are of highest value or
the best bang for your buck you might in
life you get first and then you you get
less and less effective things added on
later and so I thought actually you know
I could probably do that if I really
wanted to and carry on living it you
know it slightly kind of grad student
class kind of lifestyle and and donate
about a million pounds and so I thought
well what could I do with that and and
once you start to get a big number like
this it's worth putting in more effort
what can I do with a million pounds as
opposed to is this ten pounds I'm
donating for this fun run is that
effective or is this other thing
effective if it's on that kind of level
dollars perhaps I should use I'll try
and a pound is one and a half dollars so
try to think about these things and if
it is just these very small sums it's
not really worth doing the analysis as
to what's going on but if you realize
that over your life you could know you
can do a lot at about a million pounds I
mean if you were spending a million
pounds on a house or something you would
put in some time doing some research on
that because you might be able to get
say a house that's you know ten percent
better you know it's a good deal you
know you spend nine hundred thousand
pounds for a house that would be worth
million pounds or something like that so
I want to think about that kind of thing
when it comes to charity and trying to
get a good deal there's many ways that I
could help people with my money for
example education empowerment of
disempowered groups such as women and in
poorer countries or promoting peace I
mean the list is very long I'm going to
focus on health and this talk because
there's some really good evidence about
health and so you can get quantitative
and get into the nitty-gritty and I also
think that's plausible but health in
poor countries is one of the best ways
that we can help people with that money
and if you if you think that actually
one of these other things is even better
than health that's that's great because
it means this is a lower bound for how
much you can achieve in your life so by
looking at health you know maybe we can
do even better than that so the the
first question here is is what metrics
should you use to try to work out what
you can achieve with a certain amount of
money so one common thing that's talked
about is the percentage spent on
overheads and administration and so you
often hear something where they say that
only 10% of this organizations budget is
spent on administration I don't think
that that's a very useful metric because
what a charity does is much more
important than how much it spends on
these so there's there's a lot of
variety between charities in terms of
what they fund and I think the key
question instead is for a given donation
how much benefit to people receive so it
could be for example that
if an organization spends its money on
on on program evaluation which is
checking to see after they try something
so suppose they build some Wells and in
in Kenya and if they spend some money to
go back and find out whether those wells
are being used and whether they're still
working ten years later try to find out
the lifespan of that well to work out
how good a project it was to compare it
with other projects that counts as
overheads but it's also the exact type
of thing that organization should be
doing so there's this issue that the
overheads money is not wasted and even
if it were wasted the difference of ten
percent or 20 percent or something like
that between charities it you'll see
later in this talk is actually very
smaller the differences get much bigger
than that and so this would be
relatively bad way of assessing things
there's a lot of research that can help
us answer this question of for a given
donation how much benefit to people
receive but most people aren't aware of
it and the greatest difference here
comes from the type of intervention
performed so for example whether you
distribute malaria nets to help prevent
children getting malaria or whether you
distribute some medication to to prevent
our well to limit the effect of HIV on
your system or whether you distribute
condoms to try to avoid new people
getting this or whether you build wells
or whether you provide sanitation
systems such as toilets and seward's so
there's a whole lot of these different
things you could be doing with money and
some of them are much more effective
than others and as well see it just as
an example to get to motivate this
that's quite easy to understand if
you're providing someone with a guide
dog to try to combat the bad effects of
blindness this costs about $40,000 in
contrast it costs about twenty dollars
to completely cure someone of blindness
caused by trachoma so for example if you
if you wanted to donate forty thousand
dollars in order to fight blindness you
could either provide a single guide dog
or you could completely cure a two
thousand people so there's a very big
difference there because presumably also
having a guide dog is less good than
while being blind is less good than
having your blind was cured as well so
it seems like in that case there's a
there's something of a factor of two
thousand or so between these different
types of interventions and this type of
thing does come up quite a lot this is
not just an aberrant case
but you might wonder how can we take
this idea further and look at cases
where where this is very much an apples
to apples comparison but in many cases
you won't be able to do that it would be
safe cheering blindness versus saving
someone from dying of AIDS and they're
quite different it's hard to compare
them so we want some way to broaden the
universe of interventions which can be
compared with each other in order to
work out what's most effective within
that universe of possibilities so how
can we compare apples and oranges so
here are a couple of ways you might try
to do that so the first one is you might
think of as how many lives can we save
and that's that was the one of the
subtitle I think of this talk and that's
the type of question which is
interesting I think most people don't
ask that they they might hear something
like it only could only costs a thousand
dollars to save a life without charity
and they might respond to that by saying
well okay here's a thousand dollars but
they they don't tend to say well hang on
a second if you can actually save
someone's life literally for a thousand
dollars maybe I should give you another
thousand and another thousand I mean if
there's someone on the street who umeshu
is dying and so you know you would you
would take this more seriously in a
certain way so what I'm trying to think
of is you're trying to take these ideas
about what we can do more seriously to
look at the the hard figures for it and
and then to try to take them seriously
now a big problem with that with using
how many lives can we save as a metric
is that as this truism in public health
that no one's ever saved a life because
the person tends to die later right
we don't and unless unless you would
have become immortal that would be
really be saving someone's life in that
sense and that'd be that'd be pretty
good actually I would I would I
recommend
funding that I thought was an option but
what you're more talking about is having
someone they still die
it's just they die at a different time
and it's not just at a different time
right because it means that you have
more life right the distance between
your birth and your death is longer and
you get more years of life in which to
to do things that that are good for you
so so that's the the first issue is that
we can extend lives and that's what
we're really talking about and so you
might replace that with a question and
say how many life years can we say and I
think that's a much better question but
there still is this this bit about
what's the quality of that life
and you might imagine a case where say
you're in hospital and you're you've
been diagnosed with a form of cancer and
you're given an option of of a treatment
for that cancer which would mean that
you will live longer but that the
quality of the life will be much lower
and maybe it's a very invasive
chemotherapy and it's not obvious that
you should take that I mean if you had
ten years of life at low quality versus
nine years at higher quality quite
possible if nine years would be better
so there's cases where you want to
trade-off between quality and quantity
and it would be foolish to just to just
use the quantity here and there's also
cases where you want to compare non
life-extending treatments for example if
you cure someone of blindness actually
that does have a bit of an impact in how
long they live they live a bit longer if
they're cured of blindness but if you
abstract that away you can see there's
also a lot of the benefit comes from
turning normal years with where you're
blind in two years where you're sighted
and that's a lot of the benefit so you
wanna be able to capture both of those
things and the way that people in public
health and health economics and the
practical ethics tend to think about
this is in terms of quality adjusted
life years so this takes into account
both the quality and the quantity and
and is also known as qualities so I'm
gonna use that term of it quality
adjusted life years or qualities now to
explain exactly what that is I've got a
slide here where this is a schematic of
someone's life at the health-related
components of their life and you can see
here that that it starts at 100% quality
of life that's I mean it could start
lower than that was just just sketching
something and you can see that their
life maybe gets it goes down in quality
that they perhaps become sick during the
early part and then they recover and
then there's a sickness in middle age
which is also recovered from and then
various forms of stages of a gradual
decline towards death at about 75 years
old and you could imagine a curve like
this for someone maybe actually would
fluctuate a lot more you know you get up
in the morning you stub your toe while
you're getting to the shower and you
drop you know to zero quality of life or
something or maybe negative and and then
then you bounce back up again and and
various things you can think about your
overall quality of life this is just
to be a health-related quality of life
but you get the basic idea
it's a measure of how well you're doing
and maybe the hundred percent to be
arbitrary is well maybe forget about
that but in terms of health-related
quality of life we tend to think a
hundred percent to someone who is
perfectly healthy at that time and zero
is someone who their health related
quality is equivalent to being dead so
maybe they'd be indifferent between
being at that quality or being dead
maybe being in a coma is a good example
of zero or maybe being in a level of
pain which is so intense maybe those
levels of pain so intense they're below
zero and there are some levels such that
they're good about that and they're at
zero so that's the basic idea and then
you can see that to apply it in practice
you could imagine a kind of stylized
version of this question where we have
two lives here which I think both lived
til 60 years at 70% quality and there's
two different ways you could improve
that life maybe two different health
interventions the first one improves the
the quality of that life and then up to
90 percent and the second one improves
the the length of the life up to 70
years and then what you do to compare
which one is the greater benefit is you
just look at the area of them so it's
just taking the integral red is the idea
of that's that's the value of the life
of the area under the curve and this
you'll be perhaps happy to know is the
standard approach used in public health
it's reasonably quantitative and they
allow us to compare apples and oranges
within health which is the real the real
kind of key benefit of using this
approach it's important to say though
that they're only a rough measure so you
might have you might be feed thinking I
understand this how you'd measure this
quantity of life because you can measure
when someone's born and you can measure
which day they die but I don't really
understand how you could measure the
quality of the life it seems very hard
there are surveys which are designed to
elicit responses to this for example you
ask questions such as if you could
either live for ten years in this this
health stage perhaps being blind or you
could live for seven years full health
which would you prefer and then you can
start moving those numbers around and
you keep asking the question and and
then you kind of you can use that to
elicit a quality that's called a time
trade-off there's other ways as well
where you imagine there was a chance
you'll die you can either be perfectly
healthy with a chance to die or you can
this health state how much chance to die
would you be prepared to put up with to
avoid that health state so there are
different ways like this and they have
slightly different methodologies and so
on and they they elicit answers to these
questions but even then they're probably
still often going to be out by up to a
factor of two you might think that's a
pretty bad metric if we have some if I
had like a yard ruler which was so
inaccurate that it often got out by a
factor or two you might think that was a
very bad measure but it turns out that
in this in the universe of interventions
that we're considering a factor of two
is enough to make quite a lot of
progress and I think would often be less
than the factor two I just wanted to
flag that it is a inherently rough
measure and what's in some ways is just
surprising is that with such a rough
measure you can make so much progress so
the first question is here's what is a
quality worth a quality adjusted life
you know what's one of them worth well
it's something in in Britain we have the
National Health Service and they're
prepared to spend twenty thousand pounds
for a quality adjusted life year if a
new drug comes on the market which costs
less than twenty thousand pounds so
thirty thousand dollars they will fund
it for each breach like quality adjusted
life year if it costs more than thirty
thousand pounds or forty five thousand
dollars
they won't fund it it was in between
there look at extra considerations I bet
I have an approach like this and now
there is 8760 hours in a year so this
comes to about two pounds 30 per hour or
about nearly three dollars fifty for an
hour of healthy life and I don't know
what what you think an hour of healthy
life is worth for yourself but for me I
would definitely think that this is a
pretty good deal if someone came into
this room and and we're selling hours of
healthy life and was reputable and
trustworthy distributor of quality
adjusted health hours I would be using
all the money that I have available and
to buy them and also get some more money
from the bank and so forth I think
that's a pretty good deal we often go to
the cinema for example and spend much
more than three dollars 50 to upgrade a
normal perfectly healthy hour of our
life into an
our where you're also at the cinema and
it seems this is a lot less good than
creating entire new hours of your life
in which you could do other activities
and so on and so I would think actually
we should be willing to spend quite a
lot more than that per hour available ly
so maybe the NHS should try to get more
funding so that they can increase that
limit if actually all the individuals in
society would be prepared to pay more
out of their own pocket for it and maybe
the government should as well that's a
separate question this is just trying to
get an idea of what you think it's worth
another question is yeah would you spend
20,000 pounds to get a whole year that's
a bit harder because it's a very large
lump of life you know it's not just
fine-grained I think if you're prepared
to spend 2 pounds 30 for an hour then
you should be probably prepared to spend
20,000 pounds for a year it's just like
buying a lot of hours but if maybe you
don't have that amount of money in the
bank so it's hard to think in those
terms but here's another way to think
about it is it would you prefer to have
a salary of 20,000 pounds per annum or a
salary of 30,000 pounds per annum but be
blind one of those for the rest of your
life or you could bump those numbers up
you could say 120,000 pounds versus
130,000 pounds but we've blind or
something like that and for me I would
definitely think that this this money is
just not worth that much to me compared
to my health and I would definitely
choose the ones on the left-hand side
unless it got really really low so I
think that that I would also be prepared
to spend let's move on though and so
that's what it's worth right it's worth
at least that amount of money to us and
what does it cost which is a different
question often things cost less than
they're worth which is why we buy them
if they cost more than they're worth we
should not buy them okay
so spending 20,000 pounds on equality is
a pretty good deal I can we get one for
less than that
well let's look at a question of
preventing or curing HIV / aids HIV
being the virus aids being the syndrome
which you get if your viral load gets
high enough and there's a kind of late
stage where you're immunocompromised we
all know it's a major cause of death and
disability in developing countries and
there are many different approaches to
dealing with it and so let's let's look
at a few of them in turn so here's a
comparison between between two different
health interventions the first is
treatment of
Kaposi's sarcoma which is a particular
aids-defining illness it's a skin
condition which is you only get if
you're really even in a compromise so
it's one of the ways that people decide
whether to say that HIV has progressed
to be AIDS and the second one is
antiretroviral therapy which is paying
for four drugs which fight the viral
load and help prevent HIV turning into
AIDS as you can see the second one is
much more effective than the first one
as this is just a one grab bars a better
type crack and they're better in
proportion to the length and what we've
measured it here is how many quality
adjusted life years per thousand pounds
or per one and a half thousand dollars
and what I've drawn on there is a line
which is the the level that would need
to be would need to be at least as long
as that to be as effective as we thought
you know that the NHS use which was just
a yardstick that we had beforehand and
the NHS actually found our treatment of
Kaposi's sarcoma and it's funded in in
the US as well it's considered to be up
on the on the line but but to be
effective enough in rich world context
but you can see there's a very large
discrepancy there in how much benefit
you can produce for a given amount of
donation but it's even more interesting
if we zoom out and then consider another
intervention prevention of transmission
during pregnancy so this is giving drugs
to the mother well to the would-be
mother during the stages of pregnancy so
that the the new child doesn't get HIV
and that's a very targeted intervention
because you can targeted at pregnant
women who have HIV and so that reduces
the cost because you have to treat
everyone else and it avoids an entire
lifetime of HIV which is really good and
so the effectiveness of this is quite a
lot more effective I should say that
these figures come from a report called
disease control priorities second
edition which is a big aggregation of a
whole lot of the cost-effectiveness
figures there is a literature on this
stuff where people try to estimate how
cost-effective these different things
are they do different types of trials
including randomized control trials and
some of it they have less information
start to do more modeling and it becomes
a bit more
it more tentative but this is a this is
the estimate for this but we can zoom
out again and see more interventions so
we zoom out here we can compare it to a
distribution of condoms is a lot more
effective again as it's very cheap to
distribute them and you can avoid a lot
of cases of HIV and you can you can only
just I was gonna say you can only just
see the this cost-effectiveness
threshold actually we've we've moved it
a little bit so you can actually see it
it would just be invisible at this point
and these things are just extremely cost
effective and if we zoom out one more
time we can look at something this in
this case it's not an AIDS related
intervention but distribute distribution
of bed nets to prevent malaria it is
even more cost-effective again and at
this point actually if we hadn't
slightly enlarged it you wouldn't be
able to see the bar for treatment of
Kaposi's sarcoma and this this new
option is is about a thousand times more
effective so you can do it thousand
times more health gain for a given size
of donation oh and to look at the actual
number you can see it's it's nearing 60
years of healthy life for every thousand
dollars a thousand pounds which is which
is very effective so let's just pause
for a moment and say you know what can
we learn from from this so one thing is
that health programs and developing
countries can be amazingly cost
effective about a thousand times more so
than we're willing to spend in our own
countries on health and about a thousand
times more effective than it's needed to
be a good deal according to what we
judged earlier and when we said how much
health do you need to get for a thousand
pounds to be a good deal and so on
another thing is that our money is worth
much more than we might have thought
every five pounds to thirty pounds or
about seven and a half dollars to forty
five dollars is that's the kind of
estimate range for that most effective
one is worth a year of healthy life well
it's worth is the wrong word okay so use
this terms before but it's enough to buy
a year of healthy life so that's quite
interesting because it you might not
have thought that you were carrying
around enough money in your pocket today
is like a whole year of healthy life
for someone else but you can only get
these types of benefits with your money
efforts used on the best programs and
also only if it's used on other people
so your money's worth a lot more than
you might have thought if it's used for
others that's the catch
otherwise it would be great cuz I'd be
telling you how to get a thousand times
more value for your money you offer
yourselves which would be a you know a
roaring success of a talk but instead of
talk as to how to get a thousand times
as much value for your money
for other people which is a bit less of
a roaring success but I but I hope it's
a I hope it's still at least interesting
so these these things I talked about am
mainly focused on by policymakers and
this report was aimed at policymakers
people who has ministers of health in
poor countries and also people who run
aid programs and so forth but they're
also of interest to to all of us when it
comes to charity and trying to work out
how we can help people most with with
the money that we decide to give to
charity maybe it will also make us think
more about how much we should be giving
once we realize it can be so effective
so when we try to donate money we're
trying to help people and to help them
as much as we can if we could if we had
some option they said we've got two
programs and the second program helps
people less you know we wouldn't do that
right it seems like we are trying to
help people a lot and so suppose we
wanted to donate money to help fight
AIDS it really matters actually whether
that money is used to fund treatment of
Kaposi's sarcoma or to fund condom
distribution for example there's a huge
difference in effectiveness between
these different options and it's not
actually enough to just know that the
organization is trying to fight AIDS you
would actually want to know more because
some of the ways of doing that or you
know hundreds was effective as other
ways and you might think that actually
the organization's would be the experts
on this and would know and would be
doing the most effective one but often
they're not one of the reasons for that
is because they don't do as much program
evaluation as we would like because
they're trying to keep their overheads
ratio really good so that people will
donate to them who've been and have
sucked in by the idea of the overhead
ratio which is a sad sad fact but also
they just generally aren't aware of
these figures there's been not enough
movement to really make people aware of
these figures and to be aware of how
good these things can be often if you
talk to someone who's say funding a less
effective treatment they'll say that
they're a very efficient organization
because there's no way that they could
thump that treatment more effectively to
know what they're doing and but that's a
different question to hang on if we're
really actually just trying to find aids
maybe there are other ways to fight AIDS
which would be more effective for those
people we don't have to always use the
same intervention and so there's
relatively rare that people think of
stepping to a different intervention
it's even rarer that they think of
stepping to a different cause maybe they
would think what we're really trying to
do is make people healthier and avoid
let's say premature death or disability
in which case maybe we should be
focusing on malaria instead of AIDS and
close down our AIDS and you know start
up a Larry in that distribution charity
I've never heard of any charity doing
that but but there's a kind of mindset
you get into and if you're not familiar
with these numbers you think well this
is where our expertise is and so on must
be really good at doing this but it
turns out some of the things even if
you're expert at them and 20% better at
doing them than anyone else that there's
something else you could be doing that
even if your average at it would be 10
times more effective yeah a thousand
percent better which i think is really
interesting it's kind of the main point
of this talk so here's a few more
summaries about you know what does this
all mean I think one headline figure is
that where to give can be even more
important than whether to give so
suppose you had three options one is
that you don't donate anything the
second option is that you donate enough
to save a hundred quality-adjusted life
years by fighting and by funding HIV
transmission prevention which we saw was
one of the middle level effectiveness or
alternatively you save 700 quality
adjusted life years by funding malaria
net distribution
well it's interestingly the difference
in absolute terms between 2 &amp;amp; 3 is much
bigger than the difference between 1 &amp;amp; 2
that's what I mean by saying we're to
give that second question can be even
more important than the first question
about whether to give it all also we can
see that that we can do pretty amazing
things that we might not have thought of
so while you might have thought that
you'd have to in order to really help
people you have to go to another country
away from your friends and family do a
different career not the thing that
you're passionate about and that you
wouldn't go to live the kind of affluent
lifestyle that you are used to but it's
interesting to see that if you were to
stay in your home country do whatever
job you wanted to do you know with your
friends and family and donate 10% of
your future income which would
still leave you very affluent by world
standards that you could save at least
3,000 quality adjusted life years during
your career which is three millennia of
life at perfect health or thirty
millennia of life you know improving
their health by 10% awesome equivalent I
think that's that's pretty interesting
that these options are there for all of
us if we want to take them it's not just
a radical choice with huge amount of
sacrifice there are options with very
little sacrifice which would actually
help a lot so you can consider this
question how much good can we achieve if
we really wanted to I mean I consider
these options for me spend the one and a
half million pounds on myself have my my
great kind of grad student plus life or
grad student plus plus in this case it's
the grad student plus life we'd also
some extra you know a better car or
something in a bigger house and whatever
or I could have you know my grad student
was live you know and also donate a
million pounds to others and I chose to
do this the second thing because I had
trouble actually after thinking about
this getting all that motivated about
the getting the extra plus there
I just wouldn't actually improve my life
all that much so I traced the second
path and I still have a great quality of
life and can save at least thirty
thousand qualies which is equivalent to
saving three hundred centuries of
perfectly healthy life which is which is
pretty cool right you know that's a
that's a pretty exciting thing to be
able to do I think so I wanted to stop
for a moment because you might be
thinking how can this be right these
numbers must be wrong how can people in
you know our shoes do that much to help
people and I think that this this helps
to make it clear and this graph is the
world income distribution and I think
it's the most important chart in
economics because it's the best kind of
summary of the state of the world today
what do we have here it's it's slightly
complicated so what we have on the
y-axis is income per household member so
that's a that's that's a measure which
if you you know you look at how big the
household is you look at the household
income you divide by the number of
people in the household so that children
could count on this as well
and a child in a poor family counts
different retard in a rich family
whereas if you use a more naive measure
that doesn't work properly because it
turns out that they've got no income
because they don't work a job and so it
doesn't really come out right
but it's household income per member and
its measured in US dollars adjusted for
purchasing power parity so PPP means
that you take into account the fact that
it money goes further in poorer
countries for example it goes about four
times further in India than it does in
Main Street USA so what they do is they
effectively you know multiply someone's
actual income in India by four for this
crap if you didn't do that this effect
would be even more extreme so they've
taken that into account already and then
what we've done is we've lined everyone
in the world up all seven billion people
from the poorest to the richest and
where we look at how how much income
they have and you can see that there's
this this is extreme spike at the right
hand side and if you're looking at this
on a large projection screen then on
that screen which is only itself about a
yard and a half tall at that scale you
can see that there is an ellipsis there
that I haven't been able to fit in the
entirety of this this curve so this is
something where if you had fit in this
entire curve it would be taller than
Mount Everest at this scale so it's a
pretty extreme skewed distribution and
it's a thing as a power law for people
who are into that kind of stuff
it's what what's particularly
interesting about is if you actually
look at it you might do what I did which
is to look at this and think oh yeah I'm
somewhere in that bit where it curves
around you know I'm rich but I'm not
like the truly wealthy okay and I won't
be you know it's annoying people who
aren't this squillions of dollars per
atom and but and isn't that unfair and
and I'm quite wealthy compared to these
other people but then if you actually
look at these numbers you realize that
at at the moment particularly if you're
a young person without children or later
on in your life when children leave home
you're going to be probably pretty
wealthy on this and and probably a lot
of people watching this are in the
richest 1% of the world's population or
will
being the richest 1% the world's
population so they're in this area here
this is the richest 2% I've shaded so
what's kind of interesting is that
actually we are in this spike typically
and then there's been a lot of interest
recently about in America and Britain
other other rich countries about the 1%
and the 99% on a national scale but it's
interesting that in the global scale we
are the 1% and we often don't pay enough
attention to that but that's what's
going on here that's why it the stuff
that's in your pocket can buy years of
healthy life is because the stuff that's
in your pocket is worth a crazy amount
of money because we're all really rich
just that we tend to compare ourselves
to our peers and so we don't notice that
as much so I'll just talk a little bit
before questions about the organization
that I've set up which tries to take
those ideas and put them into practice
and it's called giving what we can so
it's a community of people who feel
strongly about improving the lives of
those people in developing countries and
it's a it's a group where each member of
the group has made a pledge to donate at
least 10 percent of their income to
wherever it is that they think can do
the most to help people in poor
countries and we also run a website that
collects and shares information on the
most cost effective charities to help
our members and to also help the general
public so if even if one thinks 10%
maybe that's a bit much for me but I
really love to find out more about this
how do I do more effective giving which
charities are they that actually
implement some of these most effective
interventions and that we've done extra
due diligence on and so forth well you
know you can go to our website and check
that out if you just search for given
what we can you'll you'll find it it's
given what we can add org and there's
there's two aims that we have in this
organization and today they fit in with
what I've been talking about in this
talk so the first aim is getting people
to give more so this square represents
something like what people were giving
previously the on average in in the US
and firstly I want to try to convince
people that they could give a lot more
than they do it's actually not that much
of a sacrifice because most of the
things that we're really important in
our lives are actually very cheap people
say this all the time turns out they're
right it's true and you can get a lot of
the value of your
life on you know not much of the money
of it
that's so getting people to give 10% in
this case and the second aim is getting
people to give to more effective
organizations which works out something
like this and so together we massively
increase the total impact and it's very
plausible that anyone who's hearing this
talk could actually improve the impact
they're going to have through charitable
donations over their life by a factor of
100
quite possibly by more than that
actually but because you've got these
two different dimensions and it's not
additive its multiplicative it leads to
a really big benefit if you're doing
both of these things right
now we have 292 members I think or maybe
slightly more now who've pledged to to
donate at least 10% of their income this
comes to more than a hundred million
dollars of income that's pledged over
over their lives which is enough to fund
between 2 and 11 million
quality-adjusted life years to put that
into some kind of context 5 million
years is the period of time since humans
and chimpanzees diverged evolutionarily
or 200 thousand years is the amount of
time however sapiens has been around so
this is quite a like a large amount of
life and we've got local chapters to try
to discuss these ideas and get people
interested in various places including
Oxford Cambridge London Princeton
Harvard Rutgers San Diego Canberra some
of the merit universities some of them
are towns and we try to get people
involved in talking about these ideas
and yeah that's that's the web address
so just to conclude we're exceptionally
wealthy living in in rich countries in
comparison to people in the poor
countries and our money can do hundreds
of times more for them than it can for
us in fact I gave a pretty good argument
I think they could do a thousand times
as much good because we think that if we
spent the money on some of these health
interventions just at that way I had
that barrier that that would be better
than how we spend our own money and then
we realized that that would produce an
amount of health which is one thousandth
as much as we could produce for other
people so it's a pretty good argument
that therefore we can do at least a
thousand times as much to help other
people but maybe you think some of these
numbers are a bit uncertain and let's
see don't be safe and say just a hundred
times as much good however it can only
achieve this if is given wisely so we
really want to spend a lot of time
thinking about where to give or at least
just spend a very small time checking a
website of people who do spend a large
amount of time spending probably more
than hundreds of hours maybe thousands
of hours now thinking about where that
is and looking at the research on this
and trying to work out the best
approaches this this idea that we're to
gives even more important than whether
to give and finally the world is an
unfair place with a great deal of
suffering as I'm sure you all knew
before you came into the room but we can
each do a tremendous amount to help make
it better and let's do so thank you
I believe if people have had some
questions then I'm gonna get a laptop up
here with with some moderated questions
okay yeah so if you're just tuning in
now that's and you're in Google
that's geo / odd Ord my surname - Dory
do Y output for now let's take this
question here yeah your example of a
lioness in particular got me thinking
about all these cognitive biases that
people have and how they ritually
overestimate what they think should mean
the impact of I could be disabilities in
their life and now you know rally that
we're much more on a head on a treadmill
and we adapt really quickly after you
know even losing a limb or becoming
blind or something like that how do you
think we should adjust these you know
quality figures for that's cognitive
bias yeah that's a great question
actually people in in public health
including here in at Harvard are looking
at these types of questions and it turns
out if you if you elicit these quality
weightings by a group of healthy people
website in the case of blindness they
say that blindness is about a year of
blindness is at about half quality like
worth I'd rather rather be indifferent
between two years of blind life versus
one year of perfectly healthy life and
however if you ask people who have been
blind particularly not just in the first
six months or so the first six months or
so probably is really bad adjusting to
that after that they tend to say it's
it's less bad than that although
interestingly it turns out that if they
then regain sight they then say it was
it was actually worse than they were
saying when they were blind so there's
there's an extra effect to that
cognitive biases think that there is
this extra aspect where it partly
depends on the state they're in and I
think we often like to think the state
we're in is particularly good compared
to other states so we can feel happy
about all our lives but it's difficult
to know exactly how to take that into
account because it seems to keep
fluctuating but I
think that maybe just taking an average
of a group of sighted people in a group
of blind people would at least be a good
first step on that if you did that then
maybe you know it would say that instead
of being half as good and having quality
weight with 0.5 the quality weight
should actually be 0.6 or 0.7 or
something I won't change the numbers
level using very much though but it is
the type of thing that if we could get
more fine-grained than this and try to
work out some more nitty-gritty
questions that it'd be really useful to
I mean an improvement of accuracy of an
estimate by 20% is certainly worth
having so it's a good question do we
have any other questions question from
Mountain View so I have two questions to
this one is could you address the next
hurdle that people have to giving so the
first hurdle is will it make a
difference in this talk addresses that
the next question is is this the
difference that I want to make so let's
say they turned out that just let's
pretend that the most effective way was
to give food to people who are starving
in some location and you can feed them
and say this was the cheapest thing that
could be done and you know it would give
the most quality of life quality
adjusted life years but then the thing
is that some people might feel that
doing this just means that there's going
to be extra millions of people who are
going to starve the next year so many
people will give because this may be the
most effective way is to you know
prevent people from dying by giving the
mosquito nets and so on but it's just a
bigger problem for another day so that's
my first question the second question is
if we really take this argument all the
way to its extreme one might say that
let's just say the US government within
the US borders then we don't have to
deal with the issue of helping people in
other countries but everything that's
done could be you know in some sense put
on this utilitarian scale if I build a
new bridge we could talk about how that
helps people anyways I mean it's not
actually it's not a good example but
there are
things like this where you could say
that well there's other things that you
do that improve people's lives and if we
just determined that there are two
things let's say that are the most
effective at improving people's lives
why doesn't government do only those two
things and stop doing almost everything
else that's not necessary right so like
cut all the welfare programs cut
everything else cut anything you know
for special needs short order because
this is the value of these two programs
when we determine with the only ones
that are negative is the most effective
results so could we address those two
concerns so if you look at these things
so one thing to say is the government in
this is the one I'm talking about it's
called cost-effectiveness analysis the
one the US government uses is called
benefit cost analysis and that's an
approach where you measure the benefits
in terms of dollars and you measure the
cost in terms of dollars so they
actually do use this in order to work
out they try to kind of pull together
benefits based on how much willing
people would be willing to pay in order
to get those benefits oh sorry so they
they do think about this in the US and
and measure things like this although
that methodology I think has quite a lot
more flaws in it it's got a lot of more
room for ethical problems to arise than
the one I'm talking about but anyway the
thing is that if you really did want to
help people as much as possible then
going with sophisticated version of this
approach is the way to do that it's just
defined to be the way that helps people
as much as possible and so therefore I
think that's a is a pretty good idea to
go with as in your particular case it'll
turn out that if there are just a couple
of interventions that they will end up
with diminishing marginal returns so
what we've tried to get here is
estimates as to how effective it is on
the margin so if you're going to save
one more life from malaria and with the
current amount of malaria mosquito net
distribution how much would that cost
but if you roll that out to say 80% of
the population and you're trying to get
the last twenty percent covered then
that can be much more costly so
sometimes there are issues where where
that will change and so what you want to
think of is for each of these
interventions you want to think of its
cost curve
would be the more sophisticated way to
do it but also even then you'll saturate
those things so for example mosquito net
net distribution there are the number of
people dying from malaria per year is
uncertain it's somewhere between about
700,000 per annum and and 2 million per
annum let's say it's one and a half
million per annum and the amount it
costs to save a life due to malaria on
average by distributing nets is about
two thousand three hundred dollars so
and how I've set up a multiplication
problem for me but there's something
around about three billion dollars worth
of money that would be needed to totally
cover that which is actually very small
compared to say the US budget so with
some cases like this that are very
effective it turns out that you can
actually completely saturate them and it
won't be the case there's just two
things that end up getting done those
the really effective things will get
done and then they'll get to move on to
the next most effective in the next most
effective and they'll get quite far down
the list so it is actually it's pretty
valuable in fact in terms of these
interventions I've got a nice chart
which I didn't present but if you look
at all of the interventions that the DCP
- looked at and you do a chart of all of
them you can find that the their
log-normally distributed and the the
most effective twenty percent if you
were to fund them all equally 80% of the
benefits would come from the most
effective twenty percent so if you do
work your way down from the top you
actually cover a huge amount of benefit
so i also the first question was about
additional issues I definitely think
that qualies and and cost-effectiveness
analysis at this kind of level is not
the be-all and end-all about this I'm
trying to just get these ideas onto the
table in terms of how you can think
about this with the kind of simple
examples and obviously you could have no
more and more hours of making them more
sophisticated and trying to get better
data and so on but in the particular
case of overpopulation that's another
thing that you'd want to think about as
to the effects of that you ideally want
to take that into account now I can say
that it turns out that there's a couple
of big points you can make there one of
them is that it turns out that saving
infant lives probably actually helps
with overpopulation it actually reduces
the expected number of people on the
planet
because it turns out that if this is a
process called a democratic transition
where people get wealthier they and
their children start surviving better
they have fewer children and it's more
than proportional so it compensates and
this is what has happened in in rich
countries and it seems to be happening
in some of the poor countries so it
looks like if you get actually child
survival to be improved
it actually would fight over population
rather than then exacerbated the other
thing I can say is even if you didn't
believe that you could try to find some
organizations and we recommend a couple
on our website which don't save lives
but just improve quality of life and so
that would be a way to do it that would
have wouldn't where that other argument
wouldn't come up and then a third thing
to say is that if you really thought
that that overpopulation was so bad that
you're willing to just let a whole lot
of people die in order to to - because
the overpopulation the badness of the
overpopulation of helping who is going
to be bigger than the goodness of
helping those people and you must think
that overpopulation is really really bad
it's so bad that a that even if we could
spend you know 15 pounds to save a year
of life that the overpopulation fact is
even bigger in which case you should
just donate money to fight
overpopulation that would be the logical
conclusion the conclusion wouldn't be
there's this absolutely terrible thing
that's so horrific that it overwhelms
these amazingly big benefits therefore I
won't do anything but therefore I'll
donate money to a group that they'd say
distributes condoms or you know educates
people about family planning and so on
and there's plenty of those groups as
well so I think that that style of
response ends up you know not quite yeah
thank you I think then I'm in the same
way that a youth life extended can be
adjusted to be a quality adjusted your
athletic started I'd like to see this
analysis I'd be really really happy to
see if this analysis to be further
extended one more thing about whether it
is also germinating or getting rid of a
problem in other words one more
adjustment that would be working
people I think then that yes if I donate
to the Somali giving extra quality
adjusted life years but I'm also
diminishing about increasing the problem
for tomorrow yeah there's definitely
potential thank you so here are a couple
of questions that have come in one of
them is you showed how giving
effectively is much much better than
giving ineffectively have you considered
the other ways of giving volunteering
personal relationships etc work was the
other one maybe they can be even more
effective for some of us than giving
money yeah I think that's a great
question
and it's it's plausible i I think
personal relationships is one that
occurs to a lot of people when they're
thinking about this is like you know how
can I be a good person in terms of in
terms of my family and friends but it
seems that once you get to these scales
it's hard to see that they're really the
best things that you can achieve overall
into some kind of neutral impartial
sense are going to be through that but
the other areas of volunteering is
potentially very valuable as is as is
work depending on what you do so for
example it could be the case that I mean
I have in my spare time set up this
organization which has done a lot of
good and so probably I've done more good
through my volunteering than I will
achieve actually through all of my
donations over my life which is which is
which is pretty cool and similarly if
you can find some really high-impact
volunteering approaches then you could
do a lot of good it is definitely hard
through volunteering for like things in
rich countries to have as much impact as
we've seen often in fact one could have
even more impact if one worked a few
extra hours and then donated the money
that might seem surprising but if you
remember that you some economics that we
have comparative advantage in some kind
of field and that's the field where we
get the most money and so if we go into
that field and earn money and then it's
it's very effective because then we can
pay someone who does the thing that
we're interested in so we get for
example an expert in computing to
instead of donating their computing
services to a poor person to to use that
to get money to pay the person
person needs and to pay some was
actually an expert in those things as
opposed to someone who's is more of a
dilettante so but it doesn't depend but
volunteering could be could potentially
be even more important if you get really
high leverage Amin and work could be
really important as well it's hard to
know in terms of improving technology
obviously there's been a lot of
Technology spill overs for poor
countries which have been very useful
for example allowing them to leapfrog
landlines and to go straight into mobile
phones in order to get connected I think
a lot of people would have thought that
would take a lot longer before that
would be useful so there are potentially
a lot of approaches there and also maybe
doing your job has various other effects
obviously depends on what it is but so
but I don't know exactly how to assess
these things they're quite a lot harder
to assess so I'm not claiming they're
less valuable really so much as there's
at least quite a high bar to beat but
maybe they could be even more valuable
than that and I think that people should
think about those things quite quite
seriously another question is the
following
it seems that core to the high quality
cost effectiveness is the fact that the
donated dollars are used in developing
countries what are the implications for
those who want to give locally for
example in developed countries it's a
good question so there are various
implications so one implication is that
you might think within within your local
area whether that's your country or your
community that you also want to take
these ideas in in light and to try to
give effectively within those areas I
don't have a particularly good data on
that but you probably want to start
thinking about it a bit because it once
you see that there are several orders of
magnitude separating the the best and
worst interventions in in poor country
settings you might think that there
actually could be quite a lot of
discrepancy between the interventions in
rich country settings and in fact there
are in terms of health at least a
similar kind of curve for for health
interventions in rich countries so
that's something where maybe also on
other forms of volunteering or donation
that you could you could get that
happening and you start to see this this
lesson that choosing where to give it
could be worth maybe let's say spending
half the time you would spend learning
to donate the money just doing research
on this problem and then donating half
them
to something that's more than twice as
effective that's quite plausible so at
least to spend say 10% at the time or
whatever on the question about where
another question though I think would be
to really think about why it is that you
want to help locally instead of globally
I've had a nice advantage on this which
is that I was born in Australia and so
my local thing would have been to help
Australians and I wouldn't care about
helping British people over over say
Kenyan people because I didn't know any
British people in people and so on and
there seemed fairly obvious that if I
could help more people in Kenya than I
could in Britain that that would be the
better thing to do otherwise I'd be kind
of unduly privileged Ingush people for
some reason now that I've moved to
Britain I still kind of am in the
situation and I also kind of feel why
would I help australians rather than
helping more people somewhere else or
helping them in better ways so it's
helped to kind of break some of that
partiality for me in terms of in terms
of this type of donation of obvious I'm
so very partial in my personal
relationships and I think that I I can
kind of help the world more in these
ways and so one would also want to think
that it's often very difficult to to
help in such extreme ways and to spend
some time thinking about the ratios that
you would end up with is that the case
that that for the most effective way you
can help people locally you could help a
hundred times as many people globally if
so then you might think no can I really
justify a hundred to one ratio in terms
of that maybe I would know I would if I
had a chocolate cake I would give it to
my friends rather than to a stranger
other things being equal or something
but if if there was a case that I had to
stop a hundred strangers having their
chocolate cakes in order to give one to
my friend maybe I wouldn't do that so so
it could be interesting thinking
quantitatively about some of those
things as well but there's a lot of
people who think that that it could be
that they're not swayed by these reasons
and so on if so that's fine I'm just
trying to give some arguments it's only
two minutes left is there time for
another question there is one anyone
locally or globally here's a quick quick
Thanks it's actually locally what is the
opinion of give wells
recommendations why don't you just
outsource all of your informations to
them because they seem to be looking for
very similar things great so for those
people who are underwear I give well is
a charity evaluator formerly operating
from New York I think now from San
Francisco and they are assessing doing
this kind of thing trying to look at
different charities and where you can
kind of help people the most for your
donations and I think that they're great
and have done good research on this when
they they started up but they managed to
launch a couple of years before given
what we can as I was had to finish my
PhD but they we kind of were thinking
about these things in a similar time and
we're in contact with each other and
we're both they're really frustrated by
the fact that there's a lot of really
good research being done that's not been
shared with the public
so foundations say the Gates Foundation
I'm sure they do a lot of really
fantastic research on where to give and
then they use up those opportunities as
well and they don't kind of share this
information more broadly and I think it
was great to share it and that was give
Wells approach to share that really
publicly I think that's their their real
big advantage and so we at given what we
can take their advice very seriously
it's it's one of those several inputs
that we take we also talk to people at
the World Health Organization the World
Bank Oxfam lots of places and try to
find out what's going on and and and
what we think about different
interventions and and sometimes we come
up with different conclusions to give
well but there probably of all of those
kind of inputs to our decision-making
process they're probably the largest and
so we take them very seriously
so definitely a you know do a search for
give well as well editor and have a look
at what they say thank</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
