Martin rizal a former colleague at son I
also had the pleasure of using the
mobility pack no longer called pack
Martin tells me but back in two thousand
when I was working at a start-up and
enjoyed it very much then and Martin
turn it over to you so good morning my
name is Martin drizzle I work for some
micro systems in Prague Czech Republic
and manager software engineering manager
of the mobility back so as John said I
started with Java ME support in back in
two thousand so the time it was just a
plug-in and lighter on it evolved into a
full-featured ID so the topic of my
presentation will be NetBeans mobility
since version 6 20 will come soon so we
are now middle of the development cycle
and I would like to show you so what's
new and in the mobility back and what
Java ME developers can use so version 6
20 of NetBeans so there will be a lot of
changes the most significant is the
completely reverted java infrastructure
including editor directories so like
much faster it provides a lot of
features that are essential in modern
IDs but i'm not going to talk about the
editor features i'm going to focus on
the features that should help java me
developers to create applications very
quickly
so I'm moving to first to introduction
to mobile it it back so so mobile at the
back also we call it NetBeans mobility
now is Adam for Java ME developers there
is support for several flavors of Java
ME the first and the most important for
us is Java ME cldc midp and you can see
in the slides the list of the most
important features terrace visual
designer for mid BOC DUI there is a
whole solution for application porting
and biased build system which is very
flexible I'm going to talk about that
later it integrates with most of the
emulators for Giovanni it's very
important because people usually want to
test applications on the emulators of
devices der a lot of samples there is
there are wizards for generating and to
end applications and the mobile NetBeans
mobility comes with bundled wireless
stupid which is an emulator version 22
or 25 depends on the milestone there's
also support for Java ME CDC which is
more powerful platform we can do visual
development using the famous Mattie's
visual designer it supports both a swing
and awt api's there's also support for
development occasions for sony ericsson
uiq to symbian based phones nokia series
8 a savage phones rig of printers
terrace wireless toolkit for cdc which
is another son emulator for windows
mobile which is represented by an aside
con virtual machine the latest stable
release is five dot five it was released
last year 55 plan which is minor update
but speaking about the mobility back so
there is there are several improvements
will be released next month and we are
also in the middle of development cycle
of 620 so we are in now in mid and at
the end of milestone 9
just a question you see phones going to
CDC or CL easy to be around so I see
that like since devices are getting more
and more powerful so there's going to be
definitely moved to towards CDC there's
even possibility to run to MIT be on top
of CDC so the NetBeans mobility is an
open source project it's part of
NetBeans dark project and we also
position that as a platform for all java
issues what does it mean it means that
like it's really easy to extend this
NetBeans mobility support to add
additional plugins mainly deployment
integrations with other SDK s also
plugins for like building of special
applications like with the target
audience for the NetBeans mobility so
basically we see two main developer
groups the first one are consumers so
typical users who develop other
applications and time to time so they
want to play with Java ME they would
like to design some cool applications
for their phones such applications are
usually simple for one or more devices
like you definitely want to share it
with your friends visual tools are very
important here since like you don't have
a time to learn everything so so like so
what whatever we can do in the
individual tools development area
soopers very useful deployment on the
real device especially on the on your
device it's very important it's like you
would like to test it immediately I also
see very important feature connection to
existing services maybe flickr it maybe
Google so whatever the other group is
expert professional developers they
typically develop a professional
chance these days it's mostly games and
for them like device fragmentation i
mean the the very the across devices is
is very important so they have to deal
with it LCD you I visual designer is not
probably not that interesting but
resource management the possibility to
to do regular belts on on dedicated
machine testing one real devices or
collaboration work that's very important
and also we know that a strong character
support is a must and like such
professional very often work with device
database which allows them to port the
application to varios to various devices
so I'm moving to next slide and first
think I'd like to show is visual
designer so the visual designer and
mobility back like the first visual
designer is targeted on the standard
MIDI API which is LCD you I it supports
flow and screen design so you can see
that on the right top side of of the
slide so that's the visual that's the
flow designer so each icon there
represents one screen of the application
the screens can be connected using
commands or other events and basically
it's very easy to design like using
dragon job like several screens and the
connections between them on the we're
right side you can see the component
palette with available components and
click it's even possible to put custom
components on the palate then there is a
screen designer which allows me to
design the individual screen again it's
using drag-and-drop and I can even
change the properties of of the items
directly on the screen and you can see
the result on the left side so i'll be
showing that during during the demo so
you will have the fields of how quickly
such an application can be
can be created and it's mostly target to
customer consumer developers the next
slide is just a summary what I have just
said in 620 so there are several
improvements the first one is the
possibility to add custom components
there is an API so anyone can design the
components and distribute together with
mobility back or independently and we've
added added more components into
standard distribution so there's splash
screen there is a weight screen which is
special component which can display some
kind of progress well there is a task
associated with it running on the
background there is a support for SVG
components there is login screen screen
for sending SMSs theme and his personal
information management and file browser
there are more advanced features like
optimization we can detect unused
commands and components soap like allows
me to to optimize my application so you
note so Java me to every bite counts
there is a new game designer which helps
developers to create like the whole
levels or animated sprites so basically
the idea is that like user gets a set of
images from graphic artists and then
like you can easily generate the code
which splits up the PNG file into frames
and like then it displays the right
frames during the animation Gerry sighs
Fiji support well it's been there since
version 5 25 but it's going to be
further improved we are still working on
data binding which is basically
connection between various data sources
and the UI and so for instance you have
a web server is connected to you I and
plate so all the results all the values
are automatically synchronize
so the next visual designer is the
Matisse UI builder for angry and
personal profile again like to give you
an idea how it works so on the left side
of the slide so you can see sample
application created by Matisse you see
the help lines that allow me to align
the components together then there is an
example how to deploy the application on
savage savage device and like how it
actually looks on the real device next
slide is just a summary so I'm getting
two very important feature for expert
developers which is application portal
so before I continue so the device
fragmentation is one of the biggest
issue of Java ME so it's caused by too
many different devices there may be
different screen sizes different
capabilities there may be like color
displays or black and white some of the
devices may have touchscreen the other
just a simple keyboard and of course
there may be some problems in the
implementation so this leads to the
situation where developers have to build
and maintain like tens or hundreds of
versions of the same applications they
have to manage it somehow they have to
like build build it advanced test on
various devices so we have developed
very unique system for handling of such
such application parts we call them
project configurations so basically the
idea is that whenever I need to port my
application to another device I just
create an a project new project
configuration by default all settings
are inherited from the default
configuration and by default like new
jar file and Judd file are created so
you see the flow basically you see the
flow on the slides so like the first
step is to create a new configuration
then there is an optional step I can
base the configuration on some existing
existing configuration that I have
created in my previous project or i can
use existing device database this is
very important because like such a
configuration can be predefined with all
the attributes and information about the
real device i download you to the nation
because developers would know I did it
on the home page once the configuration
for it or not I would rather let
everything okay fine so is the question
religion that means comes with the pre
different yeah R&amp;amp;R so if I made
available I don't really want to set up
these four configurations I want to just
update NetBeans and get in different
optical predefined we find everything
okay the question is that whether there
are any predefined configurations so
that's basically the idea so whenever
you create a project you have only one
configuration because like we assume
that like in in men in most cases like
the same application will run on all the
devices so whenever you encounter a
problem so you can easily go to this
management software and you select from
the database like you just select all
the phones that you would like to
support you you click OK and all the
configurations are automatically created
the last that's the question the
that database that you select them from
that's download that that's part of that
means I think that I should deep dive
into the details a little bit so what
NetBeans provides is an API for for
plugging in the database and then there
is there are two basic implementations
the first implementation is that we can
work with all existing configurations
that you have you have ever created the
second is that we can get the values
automatically from installed emulators
sometimes it's not enough but we work
with other about other vendors of device
database and those like the data may be
available through third parties there is
a lot of work behind the creation of
such a database so we we rather partner
with someone else then to create our own
so one of the potential candidates is
j2me polish which is very well-known a
solution for application porting since
NetBeans has a open architecture and
like everything can be installed as a
plug-in so it's very natural solution so
back back to the slide so the next step
is sometimes it happens that I have to
use like another code fragment for for
particle device people usually use it
the amazing preprocessor so we have
developed a unique decoded commenting
preprocessor which basically means that
all the preprocessor directives are in
command so you can see the syntax on the
picture
and one of the requirement is that it
always has to be valid java source code
so on the fly so the our editor on the
fly comments out all the blocks which
are not active in given configuration so
whenever I switch configuration so the
whole source file gets recommended and
also there was another requirement which
is that this solution should be version
control friendly so you can imagine if
you if we recommend to one configuration
and back so then the source code would
change again and again so it's designed
in a way that like it's always stored on
a disk in the default configuration so
which is still the same and it just gets
recommended on-the-fly vanload and when
the document is loaded and when it's
stored it again gets recommended back to
the default configuration there's also
possibility to change whatever attrib
whatever attribute off of the project
and application so for instance there
may be a different set of resources I
can have images for a phone with small
display I can have images for phone with
the big display and I can easily set up
one configuration to use dead set of
resources and the other views and other
set of resources you can see that on the
very life on the left side so there are
two folders with resources one for
smaller smaller screen resolution and
one for bigger and as I said before so
the one advantage is that like I can hit
compile everything and it builds tens or
hundreds applications in one in one step
so all all results are stored in folders
with the name that corresponds to them
applicator to date configuration name so
it's on the left side so you see several
versions of the same application so one
is generic one and there is one for
nokia cos 41 for nokia CEO 16 to the
next slide is about the like just summer
of application porting what's new in 6
of 0 is this device database spi so as i
said before the default implementation
is for existing templates and properties
obtained from the emulators so now i am
getting to the end based build system so
i said before that like everything so
all projects in the beans are end so
it's the folder which sources and then
there is one main build XML file and
then bunch of standard and properties
that's it the main build system is very
well commented and it contains lots of
hooks so which means that if I'm not
happy with Watford I what I got so I can
easily add my code to my target so for
instance like after packaging of the
application so i can run another set of
optimizations or so i can easily plug in
a mine own preprocessor another
advantage is that like i can build the
application from command line so you see
that on the slide as an example
so what's new and very new in netbeans
mobility 680 is we call it advanced
build system basically the whole build
script consists of small building blocks
I mean there is a fragment of ant code
for just compilation there is a fragment
of unscripted for obfuscation and so on
all those fragments are registered in in
the system I can easily plug in another
one and then NetBeans combines
everything and generate the right build
script for me so for instance i decide
to download the plugin for more
sophisticated obfuscator by default
views proguard but there are several
commercial so I install it and
immediately like my build scripts get at
least those parts that managed by the ID
gets written regenerated and I can start
using the new obfuscator I don't need to
change anything or I use it as an
example and I will be showing that
during the demo so for instance rim
blackberry so they use different
packaging than just standard me TP so we
have a plug-in which provides this
functionality so i just installed the
plugin there are a few additional on
targets and everything gets connected
together and it works out of the box
each project configuration can be built
its own way so i use as an example iqs
to meet p applications that can be built
on top of either cldc or CDC or also I
can develop egg way egg way means swing
for java and me so i can build the same
application for java SE and also for cdc
yes it can be run from command line it
requires like the the midp staff
requires Java ME and extensions that are
provided together with netbeans but you
can take the library and you can
distribute it with your with your
project so it is just small library
which does there are special tasks for
updating manifests and yards and for
running for verification of whiskey shin
and click all that stuff it's not part
of standard and yes the only the only
thing that we recommend to users is like
when if you check out this this project
from CVS repository there are too many
references because you usually use many
emulators and many such things so we
recommend to open it at least once in
netbeans because it will help you to
resolve all the references it's useful
especially when you like installed the
emulators in other directories than
standard plans okay so the next
important part is integration with
emulators so you can see how it looks in
the ID so there is a call it java
platform manager which contains links to
all the emulators and SDKs and for midp
for cdc midp so we can automatically
detect all installed emulators which
means that I just have to go to the
manager and it auto detection and it
detects all the emulators and I can
start using it and the auto detection
means that we the NetBeans gets
information about the classpath about
the device capabilities or else screen
size and so on so basically you don't
need to you don't need to do that on
manually there is also possibility to
quick round the project you using
whatever emulate
so the automatic detection takes
advantage of you yeah I which stands for
unified emulator interface it's an open
source project hosted by uei def
java.net and it's just a specification
of the layout of of the SDK of the
emulator so like where the ID can find
the emulator process and provera five
process and there are the java dogs and
so on currently the supported supported
SDKs are sony ericsson's nokia motorola
bank you see man's and there are many
more so we usually work with the main
one there's also possibility so like if
everything fails so I can specify we
call it custom emulators which means
that i just type in command line and
point the ID to the to the class pass
and then i can i can use it and they're
also like there may be predefined
templates for well-known emulators so
for instance the rim blackberry plug-in
uses this model so there is like pretty
fine command line for rim blackberry and
we just like find the location and then
everything works seamlessly CDC is much
more difficult so basically the main
issue is that there is no packaging
model for CDC so too like in addition to
to the platform Sylvia also have to
provide some specific specific packaging
nevertheless at the moment so NetBeans
mobility supports sony ericsson uiq on
symbian nokia cs8 a windows mobile
savage break of printers and wireless
cook it for cdc packaging plies it means
that we have to be able to package
applications for symbian so they are
called sis files savage e defines jnlp
file there is there may be specific
packaging on deployment on windows
mobile
to another feature is deployments who
there is a variety of deployment methods
so you see the list on the slide so we
have deployment on real devices at the
moment it's sony ericsson phone windows
mobile we are working on deployment on
nokia phones turtles are like other
web-based deployments ftp secure copay
and web dev very important power this
wizards for generation of end-to-end
which basically means that the
server-side applications earnings and
somewhere on a web web server and then
the midlet accessing the server side so
basically there are two two versions of
the communication the first one is Java
ME web services also known as GSR 172
and if there are phones which don't
support us are 172 so we so the ID can
generate a proxy it's on the picture
below the proxy would communicate with
the web service or with the server side
using soap and then there is a special
optimized binary protocol well binary so
the ID generate sources for for the
protocol so it can be further modified
but basically it's like the bits simply
packages all the arguments into the
plain HTTP protocol
so other features the mobility back
comes with bundled up fiska to its
proguard DUI for person is really easy
so yeah I usually go just to project
properties and set up the highest of
whiskey in it if it doesn't work for
some reason so then then we use lower
grades so the application can be signed
I can sign our individual configurations
independently so i can use several
different signing keys deployment I've
already scribed it okay so now it's time
for a demo so I'm switching to the
NetBeans IDE so what do you see right
now is NetBeans 620 miles till nine you
see the welcome screen instead of editor
and the first thing I have to do is to
create a new project so there are many
predefined projects so there is a whole
category for mobility and i'm starting
with just a mobile application which
means in this case it's cldc midp
application so the next step is easy so
i just have to provide the name of the
application if i'm not happy with the
default location so i may change it i
can tell the idea whether it should
generate the hello midlet for me or not
so i'll create a midlet from scratch i
don't need that
so the next step is the default emulator
for for the project so by default there
is a wireless toolkit so I'll choose it
but you see I feel already installed
emulator for nokia devices sony ericsson
and wireless to get the next step is I
can even specify device because like
some emulators have several several
device skins and also like device
configuration and device profile so
that's mandated by the specification so
the next step is the work with it with
the device database so if I at this
point would like to create versions for
other phone so I just open this and ok
so let's say i'd like to have also
version for nokia 0x40 and for sony
ericsson so there's more devices so
let's do just one of them
that's it so the project has been
created it created all the
configurations it created the build
scripts at the end build script and I
can provide it that there is the hello
world midlet so i can start compilation
of the application and running since i
haven't you have to write those sorry
that you can figure eight if you
selected do you have to write those
yourself no no way it was automatically
detected so now I have to create a new
midlet so again I use context action so
which is new and there is a bunch of
predefined templates so I'm using visual
midlet right now so let's call it hello
midlet and it will be in a package hello
that's it so the midlet code
automatically added into the application
descriptor and manifest so I don't need
to care about that so like I do is ID is
checking for everything under the visual
method got opened in the individual
designer so what I would like to do
right now I would like to create a
simple application that would consist of
a splash screen then there would be some
kind of initial menu one day log that
will display how a world one that would
display for instance some alert or so
like several poses like kind of them off
of multiple components ok so I have
started with the mobile device icon it
represents starting point and end point
of the application so all arrows that
lead from this mobile device like
represent start and like all arrows that
lead to this icon represent exit there
are two different states started and
resumed so I can like design the
application that would behave
differently when I started for the first
time or or if I resume that from post
state
okay so the first thing is that i'm
using a splash screen which is a the
netbeans specific component it's
available as an extension again like
this this extension gets automatically
added to to the project then there's
going to be less i'm using list as a
menu let's say text box wait screen is
quite important and where else let's do
file browser
I need more space so now it's time to
connect the application together from
started I would like to get to the
splash screen from splash screen I would
like to get to the list so now it's time
to design the menu so I need a couple of
list elements
so there's exit one would be called
download
how
and file bros so exit should take me to
the exit help will be represented by
text box and I have to get back from the
help to the initial menu or else is
there download goes to the weight screen
file browse to the file browser and
again I need a few back commands here
and let's say
also on alert
so now it's time to modify the
individual components
so I'm using screen at screen designer
to do that so I have added text my
application to the splash screen so next
is the text box which represents my help
help is here so wait screen I'm gonna
use wait screen to do some kind of
business logic
so in this case I'm representing the
business logic by thread.sleep
that's it and something to this form
will be stewing item
it's dumb
so let's start the application
just
so I'm rebuilding the whole application
again
to hear is the application running on
the virus toolkit emulator so I can
start it so you see the splash screen so
here is the initial menu so this is the
white screen so I forgot to attach that
the text that would display the progress
but it's been done so file browser it
asks me for a permission to do that and
so you see I can browse the two files on
the mobile phone
so finally the hell and I'm done is
provide any way too easy way to upload
the common application of the phone yes
of course let me try that we know that
you are if you have benefited more to
the USB can it uploaded so the question
is whether whether the ID can help me to
upload the application on a device or on
the undernet yes there are several
devices supported not all the devices
supports this dis applaud so basically
we we support Sony Ericsson's phones
that come with this with this capability
and also like I can show you how to do
that with the with the java virtual
machine running on windows mobile device
so let me connect the device using USB
and to do that so I just have to go to
the project properties and set up the
deployment
so i'm using windows mobile it uses the
default predefined version but i can
override it into project and i'm
pressing ok now there is a deploy
project action so we will see some
progress and hopefully it's visible to
the audience
okay so do you see the Java logo so it
started the virtual machine and now like
I just have to confirm the installation
so the application gets installed I mean
like the platform recognizes all the
push registry and security and so on and
I'm moving here so the next step is just
run it
you see my application so here is the
menu
does it support motorola phone something
yes of course well there is there is no
deployment on the motorola phones yet
okay so i'm not sure whether the phone
support it or not okay so this is the
example of development of real
application and they playing catan on
the device
okay so next thing I'd like to show you
is how actual like some parts of the ID
are implemented so first I'd like to
start with the rim blackberry plugin
it's already opened so rim blackberry is
an example so how I can modify the build
process of the project
so what you see here is the is the
NetBeans plugin called rim blackberry
project and here are the fragments of
the build process so you see there that
there are like five small ant task
registered by the plug-in so one is for
initialization for for running for
debugging and for creating the code file
which is essential for blackberry so if
I open that so you see it's really just
one on target that I that I have to
register then there is a customizer
panel which is again important for
setting all the properties and for
displaying the trees and that's it I can
build the module or the plug-in and roll
out it in the development ID which is
the ID that's running so at the end of
this action so this plug-in should be
installed in the same instance of the ID
and I should be able to use it so you
see the progress
it is a support available for palm based
devices also liked real well the problem
that we have is that like there was a
port that son had yes I'll back
unfortunately debt project has been
stopped and it's not available anymore
ok so the plug-in has been now like
built and it's installed here so let me
create a new project
and one thing I need is to go to Java
platform and add the platform for rim
blackberry
okay you see that it's here so suddenly
that this debt platform was
automatically recognized and clicking
next detected I can start using that if
I go to this application I can set it up
as a default emulator done so let's
build it and run it
so it takes some time to start the
blackberry emulator can you make changes
to the plugin and reload it again yes I
can
starting start
ok
so here is my hello midlet running con
on blackberry and if I check the
structure of the projects we will see
there are like additional files created
for blackberry under this directory so
you see there I saw c.o.d file and CSO
files which is like blackberry specific
the same the same is true for the
deployment deployment is against simple
API so where I need to register just the
few lines of end code and then there is
a customizer for the deployment that's
it you showed us the deployment through
locally connected devices is there also
a way to deploy through SMS there is no
such provider but it would be possible
to design that the basically der stood
like what would we support is that I can
set up ftp deployment and upload it to
the server then the only thing you have
to do is just sent an SMS with the URL
someone ok so i think that like i would
have enough content for more demos but i
would like to invite at least for a few
minute David cash bar so if you probably
have may have noticed the nice visual
library that we use for for the flow
designer and this decide this flow the
special library has been written by
David so David so please come here and
we would like to show you just a teaser
for possible next presentation that
would deep dive in this visual library
which is now part of NetBeans platform
okay so it has to be on a quick that
means our ID yes our net win project is
not only about ID it's also about the
NetBeans platform which allows you a set
of modules for regular work for example
if you have an application and you would
like to make it reg you can use Windows
system or modular system or up to update
features part of the means platform is a
visual library that's targeted for
making your application visual ever
really simply fast or it's it's targeted
to be intuitive I know you I and fast
you I its program entirely simply so
it's using home similar programming
model as a swing now it supports both
general and also supports graph oriented
modeling and visualizations it's a part
of the NetBeans platform and therefore
it's open source and you can really use
it even as based on the NetBeans
platform but also as a stunt oil product
but use just using with two jars
included into your application here is
the screenshot of the mobile designer
that you've seen previously in the demo
so nothing special about that here is
totally different visualization which is
focused on the general visualization of
for example this one is or just purports
edit or where you can edit sheets of
airports basically oh here's another
screenshots provided through the
NetBeans enterprise pack which allows
you to edit casa no editorial editorial
and vs do file editors also again
totally different editors for example
the editor or the screenshot on the
right side it allows the composition of
the general visualization together with
the graph graph oriented thanks here is
the small list of the features that it
elves you for example I can name
animation support or level of details
widget which allows you to to show more
components as you zoom in into the scene
so the conclusion is that you can if you
are interested in the in this project
you can visit that means graph that
means or excite or you can invite us an
email to the mainland cast also i would
like to mention that we recently are
going to release book related to an
admin's platform itself thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
