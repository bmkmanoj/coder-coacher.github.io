carve or I from bill monk bill monk is a
site to record lending among friends you
can go out to dinner and write down that
I paid and you guys owe me ten dollars
and then next week my friend can pay for
the tickets to the movies and where you
even and build uncle keep track of that
it's a very good application with that
I'd like to hand it over to them thanks
guys thank you Matt so my name is Gaurav
hi I'm Chuck and we're the founders of
vilma we're actually here today because
matt is a user of our site and I know
some more of you in the audience are too
and some at one day was he wrote in to
us saying oh this would be a great idea
what do you guys think and we went back
and forth after a while and he suddenly
took his clothes off and was like haha
work at Google and I like your service
and it would be cool if you guys could
come and talk a little bit about it um
and so as you guys know the as you guys
well though a building web apps that
work for people you know you've got to
find something you've got to find a
problem that people really have and then
execute it in a way that makes sense and
with vilma I think that is our key power
we found a very real world problem and
we've created the site their users tell
us as intuitive as matt said buttons are
where they should be and it all just
kind of make sense we're going to go
through some of the design decisions
that we made to get here and some of the
seemingly trivial things on the site
actually have a fair amount of thought
that we went into it that went into it
and I think it makes a big difference as
to adoption and how people actually use
it so to our continued i'm going to give
you guys a little
background about Chuck and I this is our
first company we launched in mid-january
both of us used to work at Amazon we
quit last fall and let chart tell you a
little bit about what he did there great
so a bargain I both came from a
technical background within amazon I was
working in the item metadata team which
tries to infer knowledge about the world
of things just based upon pools of item
data for example to learn that bicycles
have wheels very cool stuff I also
worked before that if an answer on fraud
prevention which is actually turn out to
be really helpful with designing a site
like filmic and then before that with
actually with Larry here and a few of
the people who are now at Google of
worked in a company which worked on
mobile applications for example in cell
phones and pdas which the cell phone was
also played up really well for bill look
yeah I used to work out a team that are
called a browse team and our job was to
make sure that all products at Amazon
get categorized in the right way and a
large part of the problem there was
evaluating lots and lots of queries on
all products at Amazon very quickly and
in real time so it was a problem largely
related to scaling anyway so going on
what we're going to talk about we're
going to describe the problem that we
solved give you a bit of an overview go
through the solution a few slides of
bill mo just to keep it simple and then
really the meat of the conversation is
where we'll go through various design
decisions talk about observations and
how that affected our decisions on
building the site I will tell you a
little bit about the business of bill
month I think that's interesting just
because we come from a geek background
and we're bootstrapping this business
there's a lot of interesting things
we've learned in terms of where you put
your efforts and what you get out of
that and then we'll share some of the
lessons learned in general so I'm going
to hand it over to chuck great thanks so
we are solving the problem of friends
borrowing borrowing money borrowing
stuff this has been acknowledged by
people for a long time to be a big
contentious issue here in a Shakespeare
cook neither
borrower nor a lender be for loan oft
loses both itself and friend you lose
your cash and you lose your friends it's
really hard it's a huge problem with
people have in daily life is not losing
their cash not losing the friends but
still maintain a normal social
relationships of people friends borrow
and lend money and stuff to each other
all the time it's part of friendship
it's part of what we do what were people
we forget and if we try to actually
remind the other person it's kind of
awkward and feelings can get easily hurt
this happens all the time let's just
talk about splitting bills you split
bills all the time roommates rent
utilities and so people go on vacation
together we've all been in the
restaurant we have like eight people out
for dinner to get that giant fill and
the haggle over how to split it up and
then remembering that big pay more
person just wants to pay and forget it I
saw there's so many cases where bills
happen stuff you let a friend a book but
you kind of forget who's not lend it to
you want to you want to keep trying you
want to look at what sort of video games
your friend might have to borrow and
maybe you might want to find out what
they're willing to borrow they're not
Luna borrow these are all things that
computers can be very good at helping
people with so we decided to write on
web application called filmer to solve
this it does three things it helps you
split up your bills it helps you borrow
and lend stuff and just keeps track of
everything in one place we also add a
cell phone interface to it so that you
can use the Site water on the go so you
have the website and then you have your
cell phone probably the most important
page on the whole bill website is the
friends page the thing goes here is it's
we try to make it as actionable as
possible to give you the summary hey you
actually need to collect eighteen
dollars and seventy-five cents into
books it's very rich right there it's
one place telling you all the actions
you take with all of your friends one
stuff you have it all for example you
can look at Bob Bob knows you two books
you above thirty dollars and fifty cents
now suppose you're running well why do I
know about three dollars and fifty cents
and what are the two books make it
really easy to click that click on Bobby
get some drill
details so here you can see the
transactions will load up to that amount
back and forth this just once every so
the ski trip you have bought some money
Bob blows you some money for pizza you
lob some money for the cable bill that's
why it works out to make thirty dollars
and fifty cents library you combine its
cat's cradle Sun Also Rises one of the
books that bob was here what are things
to notice is we have side do you have an
open transaction what's that we're going
to get it out a little bit but that's
really there can be a huge history of
things have bought there's only a few
things are sort of explaining the
current and not owed with Bob so we also
help you keep track of that really one
of the things we spent a lot of time low
is making the interface as simple as
possible a fartist screen and the one
that users seem to like the best is just
entering the bills splitting a lil it's
as easy as starting with the basic
details how much money was it what's the
basic description and you start adding
who pay it could be one person could be
many people and your participated in
this case you paid seventy-five bucks
for dinner there were four people by
default we assume that wasn't even split
so we do the math for you but you know
in some cases were a friend and a little
bit less for example Claire didn't have
the soup you can make that friend not
look quite as much all there easy
interface easy to go back and edit um we
also added the ability to record the
fence when you're on the go but this is
really useful for is you ready to dare
you want remember how much money you
spent know roughly how many people were
there you don't let it all the details
you want just pay with your credit card
make sure you get paid back some time
and go on having a fun night it's about
remembering right then filling in the
details later the messages can be a
symbolized for example 45 sorry 75 space
4 space jisu which means i paid $75 for
four people for cheese so you messages
can be more complex you can enter more
details if you like but really that's
the basic that you have to do try to
keep it really simple so users can do it
quickly remember their money and get on
with their lives if you guys want we can
talk about more details about this after
the talk be happy to talk more about the
SMS angle the library itself it's what
you'd expect out of the library it's a
collection of everything in your in the
world that you can see it's the
collection
your stuff the things that you owe the
stuff that your friends have so you can
browse with your friend zone and in the
status the hook for example Bob's
borrowing my artificial intelligence
book and I'm very complier other jacket
it's a place where you sort of look and
browse the stuff that you can spend your
stuff and your friends and stuff it's
very easy to add to the library we try
to keep again Mike the shared bill
interface we try to keep that very
simple it's a multi-step process what
kind of thing is it tell us how you want
to enter it we just offer two choices
today you can enter through Amazon Web
Services we're tied into that so you can
suck up all the day from amazon using
simple product search or you can measure
it yourself and we actually allow you to
do a semi-structured item data at a very
easy feel to use type stuff in once you
have the item you show all the full
details and we allow you to let it out
to a friend you can even sell to a
friend which is really useful if the our
friends were borrowing a book for a
couple months you're like you can just
have it have a couple of bucks and we
can even look up with the fair prices on
amazon if you care or you just gets it
to them but it's really trying to manage
the real real case of you let out your
friend you want to track that you've
done that maybe won't actually sell to
them too or just get it get it over to
them but at least you know where your
items are you've taken action with it
would not let it just slip out of your
brain so I'm going to hand over to go
out here to talk about now they're gone
through a really fast run at the site
there were a lot of really small
decisions we animate some really big
decisions we have to make and a lot of
philosophy really went into this and it
could have the site if you're not very
differently than it is today okay so um
one of the big questions we had is what
really is the problem we solve and there
are a lot of solutions out there today
they're trying to deal with the problem
of friends splitting bills and I
money and a lot of them take the shape
of I have a cell phone and I can beam
you some cash right now by sending a
text message and whatnot and while these
problems while these solutions target
one end of the problem the real problem
the real issue is tracking what happened
so when ice but I oh my friend cash all
I really care about is knowing that
happen I also don't want to forget to
repay them down the road because that
can be embarrassing and then there's the
bill there's a bill splitting back that
you have to deal with you know and you
know after a few beers you certainly
don't want to figure out exactly who
owes who how much going to move on and
have a good time so these are the pain
points that we're trying to solve not
immediate payment and kind of the way we
did that is what I make it extremely
easy to record a bill so we did put the
cell phone commode from the go and
simplify the you as much as possible we
wanted to make it really clear that
there are actual summaries the user
should know what they need to do even
out with a friend as opposed to try to
you know trying to figure out well how
are we going to settle up this bill over
time and then let filmic do the
reminding so the awkwardness is turning
to someone and saying hey you know you
still owe me 30 bucks from that cab the
other day we made a very conscious
decision on the site when you send a
reminder to someone you can actually put
custom text in there just because we
don't want people writing nasty messages
and leaving a bad flavor I think these
are some of the little things that lead
to people sticking around on the side
which kind of leads to another question
we had is are these debts binding so if
i go to bill monk and i recorded debt
does that mean i owe you money and is it
kind of you know Tony Soprano is going
to turn up at your door and be like give
me the cash and it was really important
for us what going with something
somewhat sensitive like tracking
your friends to convey the sense of
friendliness and it convey that these
are informal debts and really this is
based on trust just like it is in the
real world some of the things that we
didn't realize how important they are
especially coming from Tycho background
branding was really important having the
serene just monk gives you this you know
oh he's a fair guy he'll take care of it
as opposed to calling our site loan
shark calm where's my money at you know
and then messaging every time we talk to
people we're not like use this to get
paid back the way we describe it is use
this to be fair be a good citizen we'll
keep on top of your finances get the
clutter out of your mind and then again
the nasty reminders of something we were
careful about hub another question we
had is well when you split group when he
spilt when you split bills who are you
doing it with is it usually a fixed
group of people like oh I split bills
just with my roommates or just with my
office buddies when we go to lunch and
it would have been much easier easier
for us to model the system where you do
have go online and define hear the
people obviously bills with and then
going start entering bills but really
that's not how it is I wanted to
illustrate that so you split rent with a
few guys what if your roommates goes on
a road trip with three of his other
friends any splits gas with them and
then one of them you know has splits a
gift for Mom with his brother and really
as you see there's this network of
people and you're splitting those with
everyone now being the geeks that we are
we wanted to convince ourselves that
this makes sense so after a while we
graphed a subset of the users on bill mo
in the graph here all the notes are
users the size of the node is based on
the recent activity by that given user
and the edges if there's an edge between
two notes it's because they're split
bill together as you can notice there
are lots of tight clusters but then
sometimes they sit far across and
connect with other groups for the
overlap in a strong way so I mean in
order to make this happen we really
didn't want my artificial groups and we
didn't want this process where you come
and say oh well
my friend and marks my friend house is
my friend now I'm going to go in our
bill in fact instead as you enter a bill
if someone is not in the system you just
used your email address and that at that
moment will create an account for that
user send them an email saying welcome
to Villa monk which is the last email
don't ever get from us unless they want
to continue using it but it all becomes
very natural by the way side benefit of
this is over half of our users were
actually invited by other users which
makes sense you have a financial
incentive to add people to build on
another question was how we split bills
now in in real world you you know a lot
of people you go to a restaurant it'll
just hand the bill around and say why
don't you figure out what you owe and
just throw some money into the pile and
we figure it out again but there are a
few things we observed about this
process ain't no one likes to do the
math it's kind of a pain and people are
generally bad at it and the last person
who gets it ends up getting and gets the
bill ends up getting gypped and has a
few more dollars paid off so this is a
case where we said you know where it
will do the math for you we'll set up
some good defaults and how this works
but we'll make sure the three if they're
bits left over they get prorated across
every one a few simple decisions like
that I think go a long way now the
students there's one very tiny problem
which is we're dividing the bill evenly
for you sometimes pennies don't quite
get allocated even make some rock I'm
split pennies which is the question that
who gets stuck with the penny that's
where you know you talk to us for
example Nora here is one of our alpha
testers you're going to get penny
knocked off your bill yeah so but
another
where we when we looked at what people
are doing and in this case we actually
tried to improve them a little bit um so
when people's good people pay their
bills out there very bill center oh I
owe you for rent I owe you for gas and I
owe me for dinner but at the end of the
day all that really matters is that I
owe you some amount of my so if I if I
turn around a check and I give him a
hundred-dollar bill does that cover a
little bit of last night's last month's
rent or does it cover groceries or two
if we if we let people be bill centric
we would put them into this workflow
tunnel of allocating payments to actual
bills this was a case where we actually
turned to our users and said this is not
a good idea we think it's better off if
you don't pay individual bills off but
you pay your friends off so the decision
we made on the website is when your
bills when your what a balance between
you and a friend it's zero all built
prior to that will hide them for you and
we'll call them close bills after that
point are considered open we actually
have a nice chart on the website that
kind of illustrates this yeah so the
charts interesting so like I was saying
well we call bills closed is when the
running balance for you and your friends
hits zero every bill up to that point
history is closed or when you cross
syrup and that's a new waves we're
thinking about it and we started dry out
lots of graphs as we're going through
our designer like you know what these
are actually really useful grass turn
around right they show people where the
history of their financial history with
their friend in recent times who put up
on the site and the weird things our
users love it they said wow I searched
friends and how I work with my friends
that I never knows before they pay lots
of small things that I paid them back a
big thing or we always go back and forth
conforth it was kind of cool it doesn't
you know it's just one of those side
things we did and users just love it and
also it's kind of neat from the geek
perspective because the graphs generate
client side which is fun using lots of
little dibs actually
so we're dry grass using mini babe it
anyways another question people had that
this was enough this is probably the
most contentious point on the site is if
someone enters a bill I want to go and
approve every single middle that happens
and we what we did was Chuck and I were
talking about how we've split bills in
the past and how other people do it and
they put two big models there's either
the super accountant who lives with you
and he's like don't worry about it i'll
take care of everything i'll do all the
bills oh there's the more kind of
democratic distributed system where
there's a note on the refrigerator door
and everyone goes and adds a little bit
they take care of it we wanted to
accommodate book and adding an approval
system makes that really hard the other
is we want to avoid the situation where
I interval and now i'm waiting for your
approval but you don't really use bill
monk or you don't like to or you're lazy
in that case i'm getting hindered so
they're unapproved balances and approved
ones if someone's not using the system
you're just going to start looking at
unapproved balances overall this is a
case again where we went back and forth
with our users and said if we do go down
this route here are some of the pains
that you'll have and we stuck with the
decision of instead of approval we do we
have an audit log so you can track
everything that's been changed on the
bill as well as a notification that says
hey this has been changed just want to
let you know right now notifications or
bit noisy so we're going to fix that
soon but that's kind of a decision we
took there another question a lot of
people ask that said it's not if we
decided against it is i don't really
want to add my friend to the system with
an email address i just want to give you
a an arbitrary string that represents my
friend Sean sake Jim owes me that's
money and this is the place where you
put our foot down here if there's
information about you somewhere online
and someone's going to use that
the real world to turn around say hey
buddy yo me miss or couple set a lot but
not you have a right to have to have
access to it we've also found a lot of
times with our users so it will Apple to
the system they won't really want to use
film oh they don't see a need but down
the road you'll suddenly log back in and
say oh I understand what's going on and
suddenly start using it so but at the
end of the day really if there's
information about you should have access
to it so the way we get this is email as
identity and the nice thing about that
is you don't end up with multiple
identities on film of representing the
same real world user it's also makes it
extremely easy to add people outside the
network very quickly I let Chuck take
over some of that this is Leslie right
so as Cora mentioned we're geeks by
training and occupation and all of a
sudden we are in the position of not
just creating a new website which we can
do is geeks but also trying to think of
it as a business so I really hope this
section is useful for all of you just
understanding what goes into these small
bootstrap little businesses and what if
we had to deal with the first question
everyone asks us as far as building a
company is where's the money in this why
are you doing this it's not just simple
generosity as much as I'd like it to be
I should point out bill monk is free to
use today so why are we doing this what
we think of this is actually could be
huge if you think about there's an
economy of eternal an economy of
informal debts between friends people
are always lending money back and forth
it's largely been invisible in terms of
normal economic indicators how big is
this economy hard to say like I said
it's been invisible we can take some
back of the envelope guesses though in
the united states alone there's 20
million roommates okay assume in each of
them paying around 400 otters a month in
shared bills like rent and utilities
that alone is 100 billion dollars for
roommates the United States just one
back of the investment this could be a
humongous market our goal is to be
tracking a significant chunk of this
informal economy through bill monk what
do we do that people want to settle up
online sometimes you say okay fine we
haven't we have a big dinner together
went up to the movies bought some
tickets now on the office of the
3 i'll pay you back online we want to
offer that feature on bill monk and then
take a tiny cut of that transaction if
possible another model 2 is some people
want very powerful users for very
specific narrow use cases will offer
those features and charge a tiny premium
yearly or monthly amount for access to
those features as far as growth so far
we've only been alive for five months we
already have seen eight thousand users
and the glass bar mentioned over half of
those were for referrals and words we're
having we're 30 currencies being used
active in our system we're very big
across the entire world all this was
done was just really minimal marketing
mostly it was bloggers writing about us
to date have been the biggest sources of
people learning about vilma which is
great yes a crime map you prefer the
friends and it's just been the two of us
and so were like wow this is really cool
so maybe we could turn out the marketing
heat and get things going more in the
future we want bill o to grow and grow
as i said to manage all of the informal
debts that people have in the world but
even more broadly just to be the hub
where people come to these single hub of
internet to manage your expenses do
personal expenses through bo monkey do
your bill pay integrate with online
banks but still stay true to this idea
that it's not just about you being set
off separate from rest the world it's
about you existing within the social
network all of your friends and your
money flowing back and forth with them
too phyllisha were just like to add one
thing that's sure there's um so you know
in the last few years well there's so
many more people online today every
college student has a laptop and this
whole generation every time they have a
problem they turn to the web to look for
a solution there isn't a place right now
which offers you a one-stop-shop for
dealing with your finances and we think
there is a big opportunity up biggest
biggest mall business without a whole
lot of cash we have course members of
the source software and for those who
are curious our stack includes Ruby on
Rails writing on the fast to giant
Apache we're based on linux debian
distro Postgres database pound software
load balancer subversion bug tracking
system sorry subversion repository
system track as our bug and feature
tracking system and then we used for
internal documentation mediawiki just to
give you guys a flavor of what we're
using we'd like to move a little more to
just the general lessons learned in this
transition from being geeks to
entrepreneurs marketing is hugely
important marketing takes a lot of time
when I was you know way back in the day
working my little company and marketers
who over there I sort of a flutter than
Mike alcohol marketing does nothing
marketing is a whole lot they are
forging connections they're getting
people to come use your service and
they're really helping to establish what
it is that you really should be doing
very narrowly focusing you we found out
how important it was to work with the
press like I was a girl represses how we
get a huge chunk of our users and press
can hurt you press can help you a lot
really you have to find a relationships
with the people doing journalist most
journalists love to meet people who are
doing stuff out in the trenches it's
been really great for us to forge this
connection some talk to these people and
get out there and bloggers are
journalists bloggers matter a lot work
with bloggers bloggers are wonderful and
of course be transparent as you try to
work with your company's message as you
try to work on the features if you have
internal problems let everyone know
where you're coming from you have what a
lot of pay and you really get a lot of
user loyalty out of it as far as groups
dropping us as a company like us is
really important for us to be frugal not
just because we haven't we don't have
much cash to work with but also because
the process of trying to work with as
little money as possible really forced
us to cut to the bare minimum in terms
of feature set cut to the very marrow in
terms of hardware and really focus on
what are we truly
about what can we execute on and it gave
us a sense I think of deeper ownership
with a problem that we're in as far as
how that manifested it was in personal
life we've sort of ever since college
having to hold off and a lot of big
expenses about buying a house not buying
fancy car we feel I'm trying to keep our
daily life simple so we don't have many
needs so that we can find activities
like having a company in terms of the
business we don't have an office we
don't have fancy chairs I won't tell you
about our servers the another really
important company lesson for anyone
starting a business those do not do it
alone it's absolutely been violet guard
and I have been working together why he
need something to be accountable to
otherwise I probably won't get out of
bed quite as early probably work quite
as late you need some I to bounce ideas
off of good ideas don't happen just
working really really need someone to
say so stupid make it seem more suppose
Nixon will be if you modified it then
becomes genius that's great and just
motivation the other thing about having
our company is there's perfection ceases
to be an option you have to make a whole
lot of systems incredibly fast so you're
going to have to choose between options
without full knowledge sometimes to
shooting from the hip a great deal
here's my advice though if you're
shooting from the hip all the time make
sure your aim is getting a little bit
better over time so it's fine you have
to trust yourself to do these fast
decisions but take a step back every so
often ask I'm actually getting better at
making these snap decisions if so what
can I do to improve it in terms of
actual process we have found for
ourselves that from day to day the most
one of the most important things we do
is have a little short meeting in the
morning we're say all right what did you
do yesterday what am i doing today and
to form a list of to do's just once a
day then it can go off and work on our
own then the sort of daily touching base
has been just hugely useful exposing
problems showing up trends and really
keeping ourselves motivated if an issue
or an idea comes up you have to track it
especially ideas we may not think of
just how many good idea to sort of want
to do you
you know lose forget so we track
everything in our software tracking
system infrastructure document please
document all of your infrastructure
stuff hi Youssef your machines hagure
poster works how the embarrassed I'll
pour chocolate code works we've lost a
lot of time so it's because we sunday
i'll remember that we don't so just we
found we have to document as we go and
he'll save us a lot of time in the long
run in terms of our technical process we
do right design docs we're a small
company so they're not very huge but you
have a couple pages the what they're
really most helpful for us you guys
probably know with writing design docs
is your own process being forced to
write about what you're about to do
really makes you think about it more
critically and then having to show to
somebody else makes you really think a
lot more about its potential holes and
scaling issues we're fanatics about
monitoring our systems we wrote a lot of
wrong monitoring software and tracking
metrics for success both business
metrics as it is the company doing well
or not in these particular areas as well
as software metrics how well is the
service performing what's its throughput
how about how long would a scale or more
boxes do we need these these things you
really should have from day one and unit
tests where if we're great I don't think
it's reasonable to expect engineers to
write unit tests for everything often
times that work well but get a test for
our core infrastructure pieces for for
data model pieces absolutely necessary
saves a lot of time it really gives us
peace of mind in terms of our users you
live or die by your users how do we act
on that we try to make it really easy
for a user to get reach us we make it
varies from the contact us and then we
try to respond quickly and try to honor
they took their time the talus dig it
was just another report bug we're going
to do our best to get back to them as
soon as possible and we're trying to set
for ourselves a 12-hour SLA on that now
we're going to miss that tomorrow we're
going to be on the road we might find
some wireless along the way and still
meet our SLA we have rights and tools so
we can track contacts and issues oh I
shake a step back and point
there are large number of these
practices we picked up amazon we think
amazon does a fantastic job doing
customer care and we really strive to
meet that level of customer care they
have a really good internal tracking
tool we tried ourselves to write our own
really good tracking tool so if
someone's commented we know what else
different in the past have a respond to
get who responded how long did it take
us to respond can we follow through link
that contact back to a bug in our
database when the bug is close to tell
the user that hey we solved your problem
that's what we aspire to do nothing with
users if a lot of users are asking for
something maybe should change course
that's where the library came from but
first like public is about money and
users like what about my stuff I'm
borrowing and lending stuff with the
same people were like okay good point
we'll do it that's where the library
came from because a lot of our users had
this very really discuss that we were
not meeting and we could easily meet and
then mistakes this is hard to do but
people actually really appreciate it is
when you screw up people are very
forgiving if you say I screw up and I'm
very sorry and here's how I screwed up
and you can actually be further
technical sometimes if either user is
given the Sun review the song as if it
helps give a little bit more deep detail
users actually love it because we're
treating them like a pure and you're not
talking down to them we found that this
actually gets a lot of loyalty for more
customers and oftentimes me the case
where customer reports a small bug very
terse email we respond with the very
detailed summary like wow I love you
guys and then they start giving us tons
of great suggestions and great before
pros and it's wonderful you love it so
that I think concludes what we're doing
with the presentation we're actually
going to open this up for some Q&amp;amp;A now
so place if you guys have any questions
please feel free to ask about anything
about the business the bad thing with
the slide where we're going in the
future perhaps even this the experience
of what it was like being um starting up
for a company quitting amazon putting on
jobs a hard thing to do some feature
requests yeah or feature it was
so I have a good question if you want to
be a platform for all payments online
we're a good try and develop the
ecosystem of
little services department on yourself
is there a way they are coming
first yeah there's definitely working on
some web services not just for tying in
not just for having other third-party
payment systems interface books but also
for Friday providing more and more user
interfaces people write to us and they
say I want to use I would have a Java
apple for my phone to be able to do
things so from that end yes we're
working on on on web services as far as
providing a generic system for tracking
with all debts online they haven't
really thought about it to that level
that could be though spectacular web
services one of their aspect is our
philosophy that your data of notebook is
your data so we'll also strive to find
ways while still protecting your privacy
of course allow you to suck that data
down here on your system we do as big
absolute necessary you can do that today
nano exhales matchings would like to
make it what service
portree tell our users doing
we get I don't know what's our current
growth right it look various day by day
that's a good day a good day is one
percenter day tom so it really it's more
about 3% week struggle where were some
we compare the problem is also up the
robot is hard to answer is because
there's a baseline growth rate which is
if you like users alone it has always
been blogged writing about is and also
do press articles coming out and you see
this causing spikes it's very hard for
your actual with there are sort of time
it's very hard to figure out what's the
baseline extra that's all of that but it
does look like an exponent of course
we're very very happy no but it contains
together be part of growth is retention
I would find potential that's that's a
really good part actually our users are
very sticky so we'll find people come in
clover further friends and are a very
large part of our user base is extremely
active a very common story actually is
that some reverse their friends the
person does not set up where we to have
actually Cylon become a very active user
so the side appears to be very sticky
once you actually land on it and learn
about the problems are playing with
their tiny bed
all the time line like between when you
first conceived your idea
great question we started coding October
yeah who lost you January and then we
sort of doing a lot of developing sense
that member that was before talk about
so I'm considered advertising at all to
yeah great we have considered
advertising now the thing about
advertising and a psychic development is
are you guys familiar with the hunter
versus browser let me do some theory to
you just when people are the web beers
into a lot of two things severe it's
very task-oriented you want to solve a
problem you should get out of the way
and let insolvent ask other sort of
looking wrap with eggs and finally going
around within weeks usually most
advertising is going after the browser
the person is willing to be led astray
to do something a lot of advertising was
highly contextual will not fit into the
world views within Tom will try to solve
a task a lot of Gil monk especially
built like a muddy feature is about
somebody who say like yeah I'm trying to
build a friend of mine we could what
advertisers makes their property
probably click on those links but but we
add the library which is a lot more
browsing the front steps that it was a
place in front of a blank advertising as
well as after doing an intern bill you
can also click advertising there at that
one so we're still thinking about
advertising if you think about what
Bullock's sitting over sitting on some
amazing data for doing very targeted
advertising if you want to go down that
route because we know for some people a
lot of users can optionally tell us
their gender their zip code and their
age if they want they don't have to but
a lot of our users do which is great
tells us who they are but if you think
about it right now what you're buying
how many people you're buying it with
the kaveri at roughly where you are and
all this other wealth of information
means we provide incredibly specific ads
if you wanted
to go down the row crops a little part
of our mention to do so but it has to be
thought about as being very exciting an
interesting to database my past
intentions
I'm just kind of curious of who did your
graphics rooms and stuff to get your
life
I would source a little bit or one of
you guys trap check is a UI wizard so
he's done almost everything on the side
the icons of colors will sell Jeff
Burkhardt logo he had a friend who is a
works as a you got you I person full
time for another big company he did a
little bit of freelance work for us and
I drew up but yeah really was just
sitting around for the infected drinking
coffee and beer was just doing lots of
dutiful scintilla find one that we liked
we've been pretty lightly able to hire
someone else to do it was his life force
partly because we need to be incredibly
flexible changed over out so much with
the traditional hot cross and working
with the decider up with the hanger
prostatic package that should work for
us we could before really hire someone
else to be a desire is likely to us
they are questions
so why'd you put your job as our this
that's a fantastic question that what is
your office saying it really is hard to
pick a job you know but most people like
I have like really an emotional
attachment to the fact of having a job
now it's pretty happy i am setting it up
mix between buddy some pretty cool
products white quit door what I from
friends I'm going straight to beer
together a lot thanks for taking one I
Trojan chatting would it be cool to hear
a company what you're going to need to
do all the stuff that's where the idea
started that way up until one day this
is I went for a trip actually I was
gotta check out am i blocking work it
was like wow I should start my own
company darn it this is the time I
really dug the pipe with something off
but i decided to want to start a company
before I move on vilma them just so they
must be thought about doing huh but it
took million away from work and I'll get
a lot of space and really make that
decision and it really is an emotional
strong part decision we were pretty
lucky I should say and that work great
really good places our lives to quit our
jobs we don't have families and we don't
have mortgages I actually know somethin
entrepreneurs who have for their jobs
with Jeremy some mortgages and my hats
off to them I mean that's a huge step
you know that's just amazing process a
lot easier because we're a great place
to take this risk odd because we don't
lose anything by doing so it was it it's
also a lot of fun but we have an idea
that we really believe in we want to
work on it we get total technical
we're learning a lot of things on the
way and let Chuck said probably we're
probably not going to have this chance
later on in life right now the risks are
low we don't have much to lose in terms
of money or reputation so let's go do it
your certificate about your users desire
hey hey and have you hit to bet that day
babe I think the idea is cool and just
personally a little skeptical or maybe
more than a little skeptical that this
will still be a viable business you have
any charge of especially if you don't
advertising to put it down yes I repeat
your question so the question is how the
direction of research to figure out for
users they are willing to pay me how
much they're willing to head and there's
skepticism expresses great to stress up
the people not be willing to pay all
right so the in the ideal world the way
that we want the way that we want to
monetize the system is to keep the site
actually completely free except for
settling up online and in charge
something competitive to what's out in
the market today such as well paypal
charges in order to these person person
transfers so what will find at that
point
a lot of users won't pay each other
online they'll just write each other
checks or they might do something else
but if we can make it easy enough and we
keep the prices competitive to what else
is out there you say in terms of the
hassle of tracking what's going on as
well as going to the bank and cashing in
your check what we've learned in the
months that we did the months that we've
been out with the service is there's
clearly a value proposition to the
customer that they get and people come
and use the system and they get it a
spread to work the kind of charge that
every single customer will be looking at
won't be very high as well as they're
walking this big upfront cost if we're
able to charge a small amount per
transaction so it's not as a daunting
unfortunately we've been looking at
various payment options out there living
pick up and no one's really designed
something that's very friendly towards
person-to-person transactions and so
work this is something that we've been
working on and talking to various
companies about as well as thinking
about what it would take for us with
local infrastructure
any other questions all right XS</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
