with a lieutenant who developed this
idea called thin link which provides a
unique product code for all sorts of
items pretty much infinitely expandable
mostly designed for creative types who
can't afford UPC codes or ISBN numbers
things like that and she just launched
at the Maker Faire over the weekend so I
thought it'd be cool to show to a bunch
of Googlers and I think it's a lot of
potential and maybe it'll eventually
make every item in the world searchable
hello
thank you for the invitation my name is
Ulla Maria and I come from Helsinki I'm
currently working at the University of
Helsinki at the Department of Education
I study work in organizations how big
organization develop new forms of
activity that's kind of my official
agenda but today I'm going to talk about
my unofficial agenda mainly about things
that I write on my blog my blog is
called hobby princess and there's a
small story related to this actually it
goes two years back to when I was
studying or visiting London School of
Economics two years ago and the family
where I was staying put me to babysit
this five year old girl for one night
called grace and what happened that
grace made me to watch TV series called
brats for two hours which I have to say
that was a pretty scary experience and
at the same time I was reading an
article where girls girls like crazed
were presented as the future hope of our
economy because these five-year-old kids
have internalized the rules of our
consumer society so well that they
really know how to put money going I
thought that well there should be
something more interesting research for
for these little girls so I thought that
okay I'm if I'm going to write about
things related to technology and society
and so I'm not going to write for
consumer princesses I'm going to write
for active
people hobbies so that's why it hobby
princess my two main areas of interest
that I write about our first drafting as
technology-mediated social practice or I
could say internet mediated social
practice and secondly I'm interested
recommendation based markets especially
for art design and crafts I know that
they are both very large areas and I'm
going to touch upon both of them a
little bit in this presentation and
especially how they come together in the
project that I'm currently doing which
is called thin links a year ago I wrote
a small piece of text called a crafter
manifesto where I was trying to pin down
and the I did why do people enjoy making
things why do we do all kind of stuff
and the starting point and that was also
later published in the make magazine
that's why I was invited to church in
the Maker Faire in San Francisco the
starting point if we begin to talk about
this is that it seems that people do get
satisfaction from being able to do
things because in the things that they
do that they make they can see
themselves this is a very basic
dialectical idea of us being in the
world of us becoming ourselves through
making things because through making
things when we externalize our ideas on
on paper on physical products we can
reflect our ideas and then we can learn
well the joy of making things shows in
different kind of small activities that
were very familiar with first of all
people personalize the technology that
they buy for example in the beads on
mobile phones in Japan is great hate
people personalize nice night sneaker
sneakers for my friend says hello idiots
that was first thing that she could
finger in the morning when she was
thinking what text she should booth put
on those um there is people do all kind
of this hard craft you know build all
kind of gadgets we saw that well in
Maker Faire in San Francisco of people
really crazy about doing what sort of
things
t-shirt making is it's a very popular
activity also very good business
currently and as you see for example I
put Jose's or article iPods leads
they're they're like a big hit among the
crafter coming community it's not only
my observation that people are now doing
a lot of stuff I think that they've
always made stuff but no it it has
become with the with the kind of tools
that we currently have it has become an
interesting phenomenon that also many
writers in the field of innovation and
organization
talk about for example Eric von Hippel
writes about democratizing innovation
Charles Leadbeater
writes about a phenomena called pro-pro
on revolution Henry Chesbrough writes
about open innovation that saying that
the most interesting things currently
especially the mobile sector developed
in the fringes at the French is not
inside big corporations but in the kind
of environments for people have time and
freedom to try out new things also maybe
in a more kind of futuristic vision of
of making presented my annealed person
field in the in his book called fab well
the things what is special about the
things that we we make is that they seem
to carry they seem to have magic powers
they carry meanings that other people
cannot see these can be our ideals of
what is beautiful and right or they can
carry our learning process or they can
cultural heritage related things like
what we learned from our grandmothers
and where our parents and but the most
important thing here is that it seems
that people do want to share these
stories whatever the meanings are people
want to share them with other others and
that's why they seek recognition for the
things that they make primary you know
if we've done if we made something we
want to show that to and first we show
that to our friends and family but
people who do think that they made
generally cool stuff they see broader
exposure for they products and that's
that's what we see currently what's
going on in blogging I followed
especially something called craft
blogging which means that people
basically do stuff and post about stuff
they do on their web blogs for example
there are all kind of things done like
you know like traditional crafting is
big but people also build all kind of
robot and gadgets people like to imitate
like fashion items or of example this is
Jean Paul Gaultier's jacket and a jacket
and not only like if you think that only
women do that also for example in
Finland I found a very interesting
subculture
well snowboarders basically they've
started to make their own beanies they
own hats for a cool personalized hat for
snowboarding this has become a huge
phenomenon and you can think that I for
example I followed five months an online
chat about how to crochet crochet at the
beanie a hat where teenage guys have you
know sharing techniques sharing pictures
there is this one guy called veal
actually who got so enthusiastic about
it that he eventually put up his own
beanie business now has made something
like 2,000 beanies and he's currently
employing his parents
so in company I don't know if you can
see this picture this picture is the
most popular web locks in the Finnish
blogosphere on the right you can see
knitting blocks and other on the left
it's all the rest you can see that they
are hugely they're very very popular
they kind of live there in allianz where
then new interesting website where
people meet and shared stuff also emerge
I pick one example called supernatural
calm which for example have practice
called picture Sunday which means that
every Sunday people post about stuff
that they've made during the week and
then other people can comment and that's
I works
there are blog rings for the other
bloggers rings for men who knit bitches
with cats queer net has all kind of
metas there are also different kind of
organizations that are expanding right I
rapidly this cultures of crafts I think
it's actually from here and where people
meet online and offline the essential
thing here is that work seems to inspire
more work when we get to see what other
thing people have made we get new ideas
and we want to do our own version of
things and I think that this is here
when we kind of get into the basic idea
of or the basic question is that which
is that is there some kind of different
form of exchange going on here
is there some kind of different craft or
economics which is let's say closer to
hacker ethic or something which means
that when I observe these people I mean
I notice that people are not putting
their stuff online to sell then only for
selling them or only for earning money
they are also they are publishing based
off the to get
feedback to get other people commenting
they work to get new friends to meet new
people and find new things and most
importantly to have fun and this is
precisely those kind of weird projects
that people do those are the kind of
project that we really want to recommend
to other people as well see what my
friends have made see these weird Trotec
that they built in amsterdam i don't
know but these are the kind of project
that we really want to recommend i mean
that's that that's kind of word of the
day or kind of slogan of the day we'll
know Marcus are increasingly based and
recommendations like Amazon his best
example I mean we get books recommended
based on our previous purchasing
behavior we also got an awesome book
recommended on our web blogs we got a
last of him for a recommendation for
recommending music we all have all
consumed net etc etc and yep you are
perhaps familiar with the concept of
long tail and no anyway the person who
first persons to conceptualize this idea
of recommendation based market and what
this mean was I called Chris Anderson
which is chief editor of the Wired
magazine he in October in 2004 he wrote
this article called long tail where he
said that actually the future of the
entailment business will be not in the
body talent and hits but actually in the
long tail in the obscure products that
you can only find online and like if you
read the article you kind of get the
idea that everything that it's not in
the body tail everything that it's not
like hits so sold in shops it's in the
long tail and that's the own tail
economy but if you take a closer look
you
you know that not all things are equally
recommendable because recommendations
are basically based on unique product
codes the products codes that we know
best are for example Amazon
identification number and UPC barcode
and the electronic version EPC and I has
been for books but these codes are
mainly developed for companies and by
companies and they are developed for the
purpose of managing production and
logistics mainly and these codes for
small producers should seem pretty
useless they cost money and they are
pretty difficult to get hard hard to get
so that's why all these kind of weird
projects for that voice Aeon for example
this is a good site we make money north
art which presents all kind of
technology art projects all these kind
of weird interesting stuff that we see
all these products that I was showing
you previously these products are not
part of long tail and and you could say
that most art and design and crafts are
actually not part of long tail because
long tail ends where product codes end
so that's why there is this huge
invisible tail actually which is much
longer than the long tail which means
things without unique ID codes about a
year ago we started thinking that this
is not this is not fair in the sense
that it's not fair that those who kind
of only who belong who had their
products within the commercial system
get most publicity or get they were
voice hurt so about a year ago we got we
came up with this idea of free product
code and that that's actually emerged
when I was speaking at a technology
conference in Copenhagen called reboot
and I was talking about craft blogging
mainly and about craft or manifesto and
it happened that in the evening on
Saturday evening
when we went out we were at the bar and
then we met this guy called Jimmy Wales
from Wikipedia and we started talking
about this idea a longtail yeah it's
good but yeah we really what's missing
is the Easter free prep code for small
producers and then we started like
circle circling around the idea and I
think that like after first like our
third year we decided okay let's let's
let's give it a try let's make a free
product code and let's see what comes
out of it at that night we're talking
that well maybe we should call that
longtail identification number or
something like that a bit later we
thought that okay maybe not let's let's
call it a thing link because it it will
it would like physically be a link
between physical objects and online
information about them
this is the site that which is published
at the Maker Faire this weekend called
thinglink org it is Society it's a it's
an open database free open database
we're makers or come in all kind of
makers like artists designers and
crafters or they can go and create
unique identifiers for they work this
was not the first site that we built we
actually previously we built a site
called thing links calm which was just
kind of first experiment where people
could go and create unique identifiers
for free but you couldn't register or
save them anyway then to make like the
first attempt of the database was site
called wiki product stork so we just
took the media wiki platform and put
this and made like site where people
could just enter products and describe
them and I it was working or right but
after like using it for for some time I
realized I mean it was also working
Google I mean it especially if you put
that thing link on the title
information but after a while I realized
that this is actually too difficult to
use it's not going to work with people
with artists and designers crafters who
are not so familiar with you know
working with or especially coding and
HTML so we thought that we we have to
make it much more simple I'm going to
show you the site after this
presentation but I will first address a
couple of questions and and explain a
little bit more about this about the
site and about thing links first of all
like for whom did we build this we we
built this for makers that can be all
kind of makers currently I mean now when
we have had it up for four days we have
I just calculate this morning we had
like four different types of users well
we have individual people who seek
exposure for their products because it's
amazing - it's an easy tool to create
portfolio web portfolio for your work so
it's individual people but in addition
to that we have a couple of museums in
Amsterdam you want to try thing links on
the exhibition's that they are
organizing now we have the University of
Art and Design in Helsinki who have
thing linked all the masters of art work
they're going to use thin links and they
expects position where people can go
around and actually the graduated
masters of art they're going to give out
like thing link stickers as business
cards for the work that they've done
then we have a couple of small shops who
are selling work from local designers
basically what is the benefit is that if
the existing product codes that are made
by companies and which serve basically
the system of production or logistics so
this was planned to sir
the current system of use which means
that first of all the idea is that thing
links they give products unique identity
on the internet and they really link
physical objects with online information
about them I mean you could tag this an
example I have like Mike is not working
but for example dress that I'm wearing
it's actually a dress that my in which
my mother got married so it is very
important for me there is some meanings
that I would like to write somewhere and
if somebody someday finds this dress
from three markets so that's possible to
find out you know who has made this and
when and you know what kind of history
test so for example you could put like
singling stickers or STIs anything
linked on on a corner garment or then
you could also use RFID tags I also have
this dress tact with RFID tag I have a
Nokia three to 200 with the near field
communication shells which enables you
to actually write a URL or code or on
its own STK so that's like one example
that you can actually link object with
online information about them and which
is really interesting I think that if
you could travel with the objects so
that you could actually track the
history of an object when it travels
from one person to another feel really
cool okay there is spelling mistake help
to learn about new people and new things
that they make so things is for I don't
know if you're familiar with a theory
called Action Network at actor network
theory but if you are I would say that
this is actor network theory in practice
the idea that it's about making visible
that the networks of things and people
and make them navigable I think that the
first kind of technical question is that
well is the code long enough for the
beta version the code is thin column six
digits it's three numbers and three
letters well
417 million the space is 17 million
codes so that's not very large but but
the idea is that the code is extensible
actually so the format is always in
sequences of three three numbers three
letters three numbers three letters but
yes I said that for the first for the
beta version it will be the shortest one
sixth in column six digits it's very
human readable another question that we
get is that East England class level Oh
an item level identification well the
basic idea is that you can decide if you
have made if your shoe maker and you
make five equal pairs of shoes you might
give them one thing linked but if
they're different and if they have
different stories you might like to
think them separately what is happening
next like this is the very first version
there are a lot of you know things that
we should improve what we're going to
work next is that to improve the
interface till now on the site we can't
we have you can create thing links but
very soon you can also label
personalized stickers I think labels for
your work
indexing thing links is one question
that interests me that's why I'm here as
well I hope and of course the mobile
access so so that people cute that we
could have software on on our mobile
phones where it would be easy to find
about thing linked items I could
actually show how it works now I don't
know how I'm doing with time
it's very easy to register yourself an
account when you log in it immediately
shows the things that you've put into
the database but so from the home page
you basically when you when you want to
start creating things you just click
create and it gives you an empty forum
and it automatically generates your
thing links so this is the unique thing
for free work then you just fill in the
basic information which is like a name
title for a thing who is the maker who
are the makers and then there is space
for description there's a lot of space
so you can tell about the about the
history about the materials about how
you made it and you can add links and so
on and most importantly you have tags
keywords like in Flickr to make it easy
for other people to find your work and
then you can also add the country and
the year when the thing was made now we
have a Flickr integration for photos at
this stage so you can also easily add a
photo it automatically it it searches to
the nine most recent photos that you've
uploaded on Flickr so again like then
you can pick one there and when you
saved your thing then it just starts
accumulating this list of your things
for example let's see this also bear
which is already embedded toy that I
made carries euro other people can leave
comments for you as well so it's in that
sense it's an interactive database then
you can also search for things search
for art
for example okay well that's not art
well there I think they do maybe I've
been with ambitious and tagged my
workers are yeah gives you you can
browse what's here and also the homepage
will is the most popular tags of your
country's pop your ears and also soon
the most popular makers and yeah this is
basically how it works I think I would
you like to see something more or I
believe it two questions
dress scanning how's the Skinner know
whether it's in England barcode or some
other barcode
the in the code there there's always a
theme column so it's not only the number
and then we have to build software which
identifies
some other barcode and the thinking
department will not be identical I
haven't had any interaction before mr.
Spock I think that the other part code
couldn't have the same column embedded
in it and that's what it makes them
different from other part goes for
example and it always comes in sequences
of three three three or yeah so that's
how it for example can't be mixed wheat
with like UPC barcodes because it has
the thing column embedded and the
sequences of three three three or do you
think that they're okay what if somebody
wants to buy one of the things
well you can of course when you describe
your thing you can um for example put a
link on etsy.com for example or an eBay
where you want to sell your stuff so
selling your stuff on things orc is not
possible at least yet I don't know if in
the future but but it's not in our plan
so basically you can add the link to to
an online store yeah yeah that's what I
should be thinking I think I mean right
place in business but yeah that's what
we're a lot of people were asking to
maker fair that what what's how I'm
going to generate like some income
because knowing basically being you know
financing this out of my own pocket so
yeah not yet
those stickers actually the sticker well
this is the basic sticker like you know
this is for if you have built a robot or
furniture so you can actually stick
stick at on on on that so the idea is
that the sticker will have thin column
and then well free space for writing the
code but the idea is that actually that
people can make their own sticker design
so we will publish stickers made by
people it doesn't have to be this is
only the basic sticker and also what
we're thinking that that it will be
become possible person that you can just
immediately when you create it a thin
link you can click label and it and then
you can choose the sticker design that
you desire and then it makes
automatically puts the unique code on
the on the on the sticker and you can
print it out or order that as well so
ordering stickers will be will become
possible
something is the invisible tail I mean
it's just going to be bigger than the
long tail and
is this a fad or is this like just the
way you know life is evolved I think
that the question for example that is
bigger than the longtail well the fact
that fact is that very many people do
all kind of stuff but the kind of
crucial question is that what do they
find so meaningful that they would want
the thinglink them or they would want to
share a story but then and people have
different motivations I mean some
obviously want to put the stuff online
for for selling that you know make an
income others just for fun or others
just for example hobbies who collect
stuff so it's kind of like displaying
the story behind an object makes it more
valuable I mean if your business is
making like maybe making stories with
people or for example antique retailers
for whom it's very important to to tell
exactly who owned this who of the
mistresses of the King Edward on this
mirror previously and you know make all
this visible those have definitely an
interest so I see that there are a lot
of a lot a lot of like possibilities a
lot of use case use cases for things but
as I said that like now we're at the
stage of exploring every morning when I
open this pace I'm and like very
interested go there and see like who
have put that thing there and why and
what what do they say about that so now
we're in face of exploring you know who
will start using this but I think that
it's huge that's bigger than the
longtail yeah
how many not that it has been there for
four days and I put on like I wrote
about it on my blog I think the day
before yesterday no there is a bit more
than hundred things I mean in the
database okay thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
