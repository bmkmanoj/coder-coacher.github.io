publishing group and chose apartment
Mill Basin London nature's pocket the
scientific journal hope you've heard of
over the last year so I've been looking
our scientific identity and what that
means in terms of how scientists can get
to know one another so if you've never
met a scientist and you get an online
reference to them how do you know what
that scientists is done how'd you know
what they're as I have to call their
provenances and in science that's often
done through published papers so with
scientists we've got quite a good way of
getting a context for one another
through these these publications and
within the social network system that
we've created and we also track
conversations that scientists have had
with one another and the kind of things
they've talked to by the tags they use
that kind of thing so I started thinking
about what that would mean in terms of
the rest of the Internet how would we
know at an individual if we met them and
all we had all we knew about them was an
email address or a URL so this is kind
of a loosely formed experiment exploring
the kind of the slower aspects of our
identity so not necessary stuff that
comes directly from RSS feeds but the
kind of how do you know that I talked
about provenance well you might look at
some blog posts but how can you tell her
and I could get just from a URL so do we
hand answering a question of do we have
a consistent identity that exists on on
the internet and also looking at the
content we make in the social
relationships we have but one of the
first questions people ask me is what on
earth is provenance because it seems
like a slightly outward so provenance
this is a I give this talk at the
extract conference in Paris about a
month ago and this was as a really poor
quality mobile phone picture in a
restaurant showing that the provenance
of the meat sold in this restaurant
comes from paper which is Holland France
and Germany so that's saying that the
restaurant or voyage is this meat to
come from these countries what
provenance also has kind of a deeper
meaning than that it's often using
antiques so you only buy an antique from
another dealer if you can get the
paperwork if you can know that this
thing really is an 18th century French
table and so I think people also have a
provenance the website by people despite
the focus on pages people create content
and people people kind of pages are
interesting because they have
information on them but then was the
best way to get a piece of information
is if someone gives you a reference this
article is really good we'll go and look
at what this guy is written stuff that
comes back from a search engine you
don't know whether to trust her or not
so slightly different view of provenance
don't me know what these are no okay um
they're my ducks when I was about six or
seven these are all my granny's house
and they're actually Burmese opium
weights and so I have the provenance for
these I know that my grandparents on
them I know that my great-grandfather
bought them in Burma when he was doing
oil exploration there because I have the
piece of paper that shows the how much
he paid for and the fact that an antique
dealer vouch for them that there were
authentic from eighteen fifty or
something like that so that's what
provenances
change your topic slightly identity i
think is really important we care a lot
about who people are and so running
through this writing this talk and
thinking white stuff nature I've been
thinking about what happens 10 years
from now how do we know about the people
who existed know how do we know about
people who will exist in the future what
kind of devices will we use to establish
an entity will ever then go on to iPhone
or n95 like devices how will we if we're
using those devices to navigate the
internet that's a really strong personal
tie between me and the stuff i look at
much more strong much stronger than this
laptop which is mine and I use alone my
phone is a really strong tie to my
identity so identities change quite a
lot over the last come a few hundred
years about three or four hundred years
ago we started getting surnames so Bell
and butcher and things like that where
surname is based on the profession of
people about 20 years ago it was a
postal address and a fixed line phone
number that was homey knew someone was
been email mobiles and websites arrived
so what we are what we are defined by is
changing as more of our existence
becomes digital more and more of our
lives are available at a distance from
us much more of me lives on the internet
and is visible on the internet so in
this kind of quest let's start with the
person so this is me and I set off a
little quest to try and prove my own
provenance so that's our with some facts
I'm 35 I'm married I've got son called
Oscar I work for nature as I said so
what else can we find out about me
online well if you google around use a
Google or search engine to be correct
probably you can find these little
identifiers these represent me on
various different social software
services there are kind of monikers for
me depends when i arrived in a site
again early i might be Gavin if I get in
bit later then all my presents at Gavin
take one I need to know my blogs it's
always starts based on that and
sometimes I'm Gavin Bell
and so I formally I want to be known but
that's actually who I am I'm not those
identifiers and these URLs these are
unique spaces on the internet that I on
so the tumblr log those pages on
delicious the stuff I've created on
freebase the photographs are stuck on
flickr these URLs represent me there are
sources of content that i have created
so I think our existence is quite
distributed I exist on 20 30 different
websites I'm referenced by lots of other
different websites but all of this is
kind of connected together and so a
question I had was how easy is it to
tile the stuff together and in
researching this quite a few people
Simon Wilson annex talking here on
Monday in particular so my open idea
might solve a lot of this and it kind of
does it kind of helps it gets you to the
point where you can prove that you are
the person or the sequence of keystrokes
which owns the URL that's being pointed
out to these other services but because
it's authentication only it doesn't
solve the complete problem and I think
open ID open ID project took a really
good run at this in that they sold the
unique small problem that was like there
to be solved they didn't solve the whole
thing they let people build on top of
that so I think because of the way open
idealized authentication authentication
includes a URL open ID puts a
representation of myself online usually
there's an H card on that open ID page
quite often that each card has an
exciting thing rel equals me wrap around
various links on it so that ties my
identity to these other pages so it
connect me to say that my flickr pages
so this is none of this is radically new
this has been talked about in terms of
the ex iphone microformat for quite a
while but this expand next expand on
this a little bit and who do we know why
no cut a lot of people online I have
lots of contacts and social networking
sites i have people who come and
comments on my own weblog i have aim
buddies all of these people have their
own personal websites they're all
connected to other people in social
networks and all these social networks
tend to point at personal pages or home
pages which represent them so if we
follow these backlinks we can start
building a network of my friends and the
things that they say they own
so we can work out so we have a page
which says this is who I am we have
other pages which declare who my friends
are and we have a means of connecting
these together through these different
social networks there's a mathematical
proof number the people doing research
into all that says that which I can
never remember the fine detail of the
proof but essentially it says that if a
page is pointed out if two pages are
pointed out through different routes and
one page says that this page is owned by
someone and their page points at
something else as a mathematical proof
that shows the page which isn't pointed
at is actually part of the same loop I
was really clearly explaining I'm sorry
about so I started looking at machine
traversal of my own personal social
network across multiple social networks
trying to connect the other my content
and the people who I know so I make a
bunch of stuff i right I take pictures I
tag things or apply to stuff I make
posts on my own blog and in other spaces
can be some of this open up well yes in
terms of tags is we don't want to have
the whole weight of the content we want
to be able to summarize this so we can
get a picture of myself and my friends
so we can sum this up in terms of tags
we can sum it up in terms of locations
in terms of photos by tags we can get
automatic text summaries a written
output and in terms of music that I
listen to we can look at last.fm we can
look at Doppler in terms of places that
I visited in places i'm going to this is
all web chat date web shaped data as
Matt bit off likes to describe it and so
I started thinking about the internet as
a single social network they're a nice
quote from a guy called Gary McGraw
echoing been Smith's 1991 observation
about how the internet works people keep
asking me to join the linked in network
he said but I'm really part of a network
it's called the Internet Ben Smith in
1991 so I was talking about office email
systems and how I eventually one person
eventually people would realize that
there were part of a whole network of
email and 16 17 years later
one would think about separate office
email systems connected together there's
just email it connects people together
on the internet so we have
interconnected people with content
specific repositories helpfully tagged
up with metadata and we meet ways of
machine traversing love but tags are as
simple as they signed tags are
individually created labels for items of
content they're inherently personal I
put the tag on a piece of content so I
can remember what it is I'm summarizing
it for myself they're intentional quite
often so y'all might take something with
to read or I like target so that someone
else can pick it up to sidley a sign for
example I'm friend of mine on delicious
everybody has a different point of view
when they're using tags they might have
the same word so it's other like
publishing conference recently when they
talk about library they mean bricks and
mortar buildings what's not two books
when you guys talk about library i'm
sure you mean Ruby and PHP code
libraries so this can lead to a kind of
a fragmentation of understanding the
target song isn't meaningful you need to
know who has done the act of tagging for
it to become a meaningful piece of
information for you so there's a flip
side to this is in something we're def
we're exploring inside nature if you can
understand someone else's tags then
maybe you can use those tags to give you
an insight into a different scientific
discipline it's not lots and lots of
people win Nobel prizes they go and look
at another area of science and they come
back and apply that to their own area
and Gregory Perlman's one and turned
down the Fields Medal recently by
looking at thermodynamics and applying
it to topology so Ruby's not a good
example Ruby means a color is a gemstone
it's a song by the kaiser chiefs
depending on who you are that word has
different meanings and the song ruby
ruby by the kaiser chiefs is talked
about on Ruby mailing lists as a kind of
piece of amusement and we are smart
enough to differentiate between the
usage of Ruby referring to the song by
the kaiser chiefs and the general use of
ruby on the mailing list referring to
the
language how can we teach our computers
to be this smart or how can we give
enough evidence and have context to
people rising sites that we make but so
they can infer the context from what's
being shown so the crux of this is kind
of can I some the open of my friends to
work out who knows what about what and
can I move to a level where answer
managing people and not managing feeds
this is kind of an attention hack my
feed reader I'm sure like euros has got
hundreds of feeds in it I don't read
most of them my machine bisley updates
and when I read 20 or 30 of them but
there will be things I'd like to keep in
touch with I've been under the kind of
longer form bases friends who want to
keep up with but I want to read every
blog post never written so I think we
tend to make queries which are people
driven we're not necessarily looking for
a link to a page we're looking for an
answer to a problem or we're looking for
a certain piece of information that we
can use in another context we did some
research in nature and we find that
about eighty percent of people would
rather a recommend a paper to one point
through a search engine they trust a
recommended paper substantially more as
well so Google returns pages not people
are techniques so does yahoo all search
engines return return pages but people
based queries are much more sort of
fine-grained do you know John on which
John do you mean these things are much
more complex and much harder to enter
into a simple search box I'm preaching
to the converted here I'm sure you know
this book so we had these kind of micro
queries which are really contextual show
me a good restaurant harder things like
would silent be a good speaker at this
conference as you know if you seem to
speak before what was he like it's quite
good how do you get that kind of stuff i
well there will be blog posts that
mention Simon or John or Fred speaking
at a conference but will they talk about
his delivery will they talk about her
nervous he was well they talked about
the quality of his presentation probably
can you abstract the height
these are kind of things you'd ask
friends sort of implicit knowledge an
example I've got is the wine site corked
can I find a decent wine by searching on
the internet no kind of find a decent
wine by looking on what my friends drink
in court yes so the kind of the content
that people are labeling and the Conte
the relationship between people in that
content is where it is really rich and
important so Sarge is only so helpful um
I want to know about astrophysics mrs.
actually a real world example so
colleague of mine ear Mulvaney as an
astrophysicist I'd like to write science
fiction some time and it's completely
geeky isn't it and I asked Ian after
searching around and different search
engines to find out about astrophysics
and looking on amazon to find out of
astrophysics and he ended up writing a
turn our page email saying read this
book read this paper have a look at this
thesis I wrote and now I have a package
of a white six months worth of reading
that will take me up to kind of
undergraduate level in certain strains
of astrophysics how do I get that kind
of package of information out of the
internet or how do I find the right
person to go and talk to and so Simon
who have talked about Sam Wilson salmon
those law Bolton ID how can I tell this
it's quite a hard thing to answer and
how do I know he's actually the best
person to ask about open ID amongst my
friends how can i get my computer to
tell me this those are questions that
are running through my head this talks
not really what answers I'm just trying
to raise questions in your head really
so quick demo no okay and I cooked down
one a quick admission um I write really
poor code I don't write code for a
living I draw big boxes I'm a design
social software so in space of what ten
days kind of end of may I set myself a
task to pick up Ruby again find the
right tools and work out if I could
write a loose screen scraper to prove my
point that I've tried to Mick in this
talk that we have a connected identity
online so I wrote some not great code
but I disappeared some decisions I
didn't use any api's I didn't
any feeds I didn't use only private
information there's no authentication in
any of what I'm doing this is all
publicly available data that's available
to any robot that's searching around the
internet so let's start the page this is
my homepage and we can find some
interesting stuff on this page so if we
have a look we can see that there's some
microformats on here there's an x f4 l
equals me and using the ruby library
mofo we can very easily extract this we
can then we can find that I've helpfully
put relic was me around a whole range of
stuff on my own site so my blog my
tumblelog my flickr pictures what my
twitter presence my delicious links
events on upcoming on my profile on
nature network so all of these things
are simply extractable by running a kind
of fine line script and they give us
starting points to go and visit other
places so we can go and visit delicious
these are this stuff I was linked
logging while back and using some xpath
I can find this list of tags that little
xpath expression pull tight the contents
of these tags and this gives that I've
thresholded this page to show and 5 and
above so I'm looking for stuff that I've
used on a consistent basis and you can
see the stuff I'm interested in we can
grab that stash it this person likes
these things we can move to flicker
flicker gives us a whole ton of stuff on
flickr we've got photos tagged people
but there's not as much microformats
stuff so we have to move across to
apricot the really lovely screen parts
are written by why the lucky stiff
so ideally the stuff on flickr would be
my performance there are some
microformats on flickr but maybe not
enough it says where we true of most
sites are not picking on flickr in
particular so here's my son and on this
page we have a bunch of stuff that is
quite useful for us to extract so if we
run this xpath query we can grab this
number so we can know how many pictures
I've taken if we run some other xpath
queries on this lot we can grab oops all
right we can grab the contents of all of
these tags so we can find and this data
behind these to know how often I use
these tags so rather than modeling all
of the tags that I use on all of them
sites we keep them tied to the content
that they're associated with so these
are words that describe photographs the
same word might be used to describe
different things so the context of
language which I use to describe
photography differs to that which I
might used to describe music and used to
describe wine so red here on flickr it
means one thing but read in terms of
wine means something much more deeper
and richer so if we go to my profile
page there's a bunch of stuff on here so
again xaphan reticles me pulls I this
stuff so there's a link to my homepage
and in digging running the source on
flickr com i discovered they've added
rel equals me around this haven't told
anybody they've done this but they are
terrell equus me so this concretely ties
my profile page to my external identity
in ways that are one hundred percent
true and that connection is
when I discovered it I felt slightly
unsettled because I didn't have control
over connecting these two pages together
the guys at flickr helping either on
microformats great stick relic was me
run that but if you were wanting to keep
separate identities or not wanting this
stuff to a machine possible there's
aught multiple URLs on here and when I
presented this a txtag quite a few
people can't answer garden no you didn't
know flicky were doing that and some
people said to me they were going to
move there you are off from here up into
the main body of their profile so there
it wasn't microformat didn't concretely
link the two things together okay so we
can also get all of my contacts
following this link and get to a page
like this some more xpath and we can
grab the contents of one of these little
boxes and in here we can get the number
of pictures that Jeremy's taken a link
to his photographs a link to his profile
page and if we go to his profile page
don't we then run a script on this we
get a list of all of my friends the
names they use their own name list of
stuff and at the bottom we've got a URL
that we grabbed and where we grab that
we grab it from the profile page this is
Firebug at the bottom ensuring the
plastic was URL rel equals me wrapped
around that link that points back to
Jeremy's home page so let's go and have
a look at Jeremy's home page so it's the
XPath to get that kind of stuff this is
a fragment of Jeremy's home page and he
has some nice rolls me stuff on it as
well so he has really caused me run his
upcoming so let's go and visit Jeremy
are not coming so this is jeremy not
coming and I haven't screen grabbed
about Jeremy on our friends not coming
we can follow these links pulling aight
these x paths get you the contents of
this you can then follow the profile
page finder he links to me different
username take one only
and then we can get all the way back to
my own page so we can have started from
Gavin Bell calm got out through a social
network collecting information whole way
along gone back to one of my friends
pages come back on to their social
network upcoming in this case and come
all the way back to me on all of that is
scriptable automatable by someone who
doesn't code for a living so this stuff
is out there were connected together and
it's really easy so as I said we we can
build a profile of me and my friends
where else can we do this well we can do
it on magnolia vox Dei corked any of the
social networks this is amenable to so
what else can we do well I haven't
really talked about blogs that much and
so we can go back and we can scrape
delicious and we can get this link shows
the tags that delicious has determined
or most appropriate in terms of the
content that Tom coats from plastic bag
torg writes on his blog this is what the
internet thinks Tom right to bite and we
can grab that there's a thing we can
also grab these so this is the link two
times most popular article on delicious
and gross huh and we can grab the number
of people who done it and also this
links us to the army
the delicious page abide this story on
Tom's website and we can find all the
types of people describe the size so
we're starting to build up quite a rich
summary picture of the kind of content
but Tom rights so again this kind of ex
parte sir so the reason for all the
XPath is I was at the ex tech conference
and trying to encourage people to go and
build stuff using these experts and
using these ideas and as I come on to
the later part of my talk I'll show you
why I did that so we can do the same on
technorati we can pull off technologies
authority does that and we can pull off
the XPath sorry that last XPath gets
these tags here so we have we can using
this kind of approach we can build
profiles for our friends we can build
their personal site their tags what
people take them as the content that
they've done how popular their content
is and how well-connected I am term this
is all available from this is all
publicly available data it's kind of
stalking which makes me slightly
uncomfortable but it's sort of not it's
just summarizing the stuff that they're
putting out there and aggregating my
friends together so I can get a snapshot
of get the kind of snapshot that people
are building through adding applications
to LinkedIn sort of people aggregation
one of what makes me concerned about
this and why I haven't actually finished
this as a public application is if I
make this release as an APR in a public
application on screen scrape anybody all
I'd like to do is use this as open ID
enabled pages you sign in with your open
ID we follow the rail because we link
that you have on your page it comes back
with a personalized list of your friends
you can't do it for anybody else using
my application at least because I think
that's uncomfortable feeling for me so
we can do services like we can browse
our friends by tag so we have this
application will two types of pages
profile pages showing my friends and
stuff they do but also tag pages so we
can look across the tie see what words
are popular we can look at rice and fall
of interest amongst my friends not the
Internet in general my friends and see
new subjects coming onto the horizon so
over the last six months of an ID will
have rocketed up my performance you're
starting to rock it up other things will
drop away so we have these layers of
connection who I'm connected to and we
can see disparity as well so this is
something that social networking sites i
think correctly do they don't show you
who you've linked to but doesn't link
back to you because it's a bit of an
invidious thing to do on within the
community of social networking site you
can see who your friends are and you can
see who their friends are but you can't
see the set in the middle which is the
people who you think are friends you
don't think your friends and tools like
this will let you look at this private
but also that you find the people who
you friended we haven't friended you so
the two ways that that work so you can
see people sorry what this won't show
you is people who friended you but you
haven't friend it back you can probably
do that by difference that and we can
infer from the content types of the
various sites that we're looking at
other things so I don't know who's on
Doppler but doctors by tracking places
that you've been to
so we can use these places that have
been 22 in fair that we can use these as
tags so if someone visits New York a lot
we can say governors what New York what
he knows about California by the only
once ben de carro so I don't know that
much about Carol but in terms of my
friends I'm the only person i know
that's been to Cairo so if one of my
friends is looking to go to chiro then
I'm probably the person to ask so that
you need context in terms of whether
something's visible it's not simple
threshold and on numbers okay so I
cannot put this as surfacing my friends
from the sea of feeds little recipe is
kind of take a webpage adds some age
cards to make that an open ID you've got
a person who you know you can verify
find the social networks for the XF and
links with people their friends come
back tags and profile pages come out of
this ok so I think it's a new kind of
application and i'm not sure what way it
should be built jock and once in a
minute but it's kind of peer evaluation
and this kind of context sensitivity i
think is important so that's rough
operational model for how it might work
and the email notification i think is
important this is not a service you're
going to run a real time you're going to
send off and maybe wait for a response
on you know give it your instant
messenger details and i'll ping you back
and say we've baked your profile for you
it's a kind of notification they service
right on a real-time processing thing
okay so i think this is a bit scary
everybody gives all this freely
available data and it's really easy to
pull it all together and if you were if
you had say Laura morals if you didn't
mind about who could use this service
you could pick anybody in general find
out their friends find out who they're
connected to find out what people think
of them and model anybody you fancy I'm
sure people have written up occasions
like this but there aren't them seem to
be on any on the internet yet and I
wonder is it kind of just a is there a
kind of utopian dystopian choice here
who runs these services say nature
o'reilly google amazon did we trust all
of these companies clearly you trust
google but would you prefer to be on own
with a mate on a colocation box because
they know you know your friends you
trust your friend and his data but if
you're using that box as part of your
identity and it doesn't have the same
kind of backup like somewhere and visa
has and it disappears well then
something part of your identities
disappeared and a mate with culo box is
not that reliable google + hours you are
reliable as you've got fantastic data
centers and that kind of stuff so one of
the things that i think is important is
the defaults and applications and
awareness of what we are letting people
do with their data and communicating to
them clearly that publishing this data
and putting on the Internet makes it
available to search engines makes it
available and it's not just our friends
that see it it's visible on the internet
and I think that we're not doing a good
job of that I think we're not clearly
communicating to people what happens
when they put their data online I'm not
sure how we do that in a relatively
terrace way but I think we need to be
more hand-holding with people saying
stick the stuff up here and everybody in
the world can see it it's obvious if
you've got a blog that that's what
you're doing but I think it's less
obvious in terms of social service
social software application
is what bits are public what bits aren't
public as we make micro changes to
profiles and things like that what date
is being aggregated and shown so most
people will never know the kinds of
pictures that they have and flickers
shown lots of people don't know that
their favorites that they add to their
Flickr profile are publicly visible so
every picture that you ever favorited if
I go to your profile I can find all the
pictures that you think are cool on
flickr so we're not doing a good job of
declaring what's public and what's
private it's okay two last points the
unproven instalar people get jobs
because there on the internet so they
have a visibility they blog about good
stuff they go to conferences they stick
their talks of those kind of things they
are trying to get visibility I wonder is
there a point at which if someone
doesn't have a profile image on the
internet they won't get a job it's
certainly something that a lot of the
big recruiting companies are doing they
hire interns to search for facebook and
linkedin and myspace profiles of new
college hires to find out they
trustworthy that kind of stuff so a the
kind of public versus private nature of
that data becomes important there
everybody knows that on Twitter on
Facebook on myspace this kind of stuff
there are robots are growing a friend as
many people as they can see so they can
subvert the privacy privacy measures or
they can use them for spamming that kind
of stuff we need to be more sensitive or
that kind of thing so some ideas for the
future I think identity consolidations
happened it's not a future thing I'd
like to be able to track people are not
feeds I think microformats are
increasingly important but we need to
send be sensitive in their use and
communicated people what happens to
though data because we've might perform
over the Flickr example thriller cause
may I think is key in this and it's
heading to count awards a sort of social
network based search I don't necessarily
want to ask the whole internet how to
sew
particular problem I'd love to be able
to search my friends and using services
like this where you can aggregate all of
the day of your friends together you can
build these kind of small scale
personalized search products okay some
examples these are three examples here
built by friends of mine who saw this
talk in the last month I've got together
and actually made some stuff so this is
Jeremy Keith basement Brighton and he
put together a little application girl
hack fight based on twitter delicious
flickr and technorati he screens grapes
all these different sites and determines
various people's strengths based on
attributes so if they've lots of
pictures on flickr than they got a big
score on perception if they've lots of
stuff on delicious they get a big score
in terms of memory that kind of stuff
it's just a fun bit of bit of nothing
really but it's good fun you can enter
your name and it goes or goes away to
some screen scraping comes back and
tells you these your scores then you can
go and fight people it was put together
in there in a day at the BBC yahoo hack
day events or last weekend this is an
application that James islet works for
tango zebra heart of double-click built
this is much closer kind of kind of what
I'm doing with ID 6 and you went to your
name and it does one screen scrape
flicker and things like that he hasn't
hide it into any form of the
authentication so I can enter anybody's
name here and I'll get all this data
back I'm not sure if that's a good thing
but it's an entirely possible again
James built this hack day last weekend
lastly screen grab of something from
Doppler so this is chris messina screen
grab of Doppler from last night this
morning showing a new feature on Doppler
so Chris worked with Twitter and
microphone microformats to Twitter six
weeks month back matt pittle from
Doppler and imports these age cards and
you can mark any one of these people and
add them to your Doppler social network
I think it's the first example of people
doing social
work it's our portable social network
type work I that's the first I've seen
anyway I'm really pleased to see lots of
this stuff being built the last month I
just got three kind of closing things I
think you can probably guess so I think
we need better guidelines for building
web applications we need to do a better
job of communicating to our users what
we're doing what this data is available
how this data is available and what they
can hide would probably need finer
grained privacy control within Nature
Network one of the things we're looking
at is doing no one can see this my
friends can see it my friends and
contacts anybody who has me to the
social network and everybody in the
world that kind of five levels I think
works quite well across most social
networking applications that's quite
closely tied to the idea of privacy
we're making lots of data available on
the internet and I think there are
privacy concerns around there certainly
susharma speaking next week she works
for the open rights group in the UK and
when I give gave her this presentation
she was really quite not upset but
surprised that this was as easy as this
is lastly I think we should be looking
at tools to let us manage people are not
feeds people are what we care about the
data they generate is interesting but we
care about people if we've decided to
add someone saw social network we
decided down to multiple social networks
then maybe our feed reading tools she
canna prioritize their material or maybe
add in the feeds and the social networks
because it knows who they are we kind of
need to integrate our different
applications together so that we're
modeling friendship relationships and we
can use tools like Google and Yahoo
search engines to find stuff that we
have no contacts with but we can use
tools like this to go and find our
friends to ask them something okay thank
you very much
questions how many authors comments are
changing the dynamic
particular
typically start he's got some
but like let's say I step you but
someone over time and quality out use
that your liking
of course basically
so these have yeah so it's kind of
people manage an application over
talking about I think it probably should
update itself it's not a one sauce scan
of the internet to say these are my
friends the cyclone updates are on part
of the reason I haven't built the
supplications because I'm worried about
the bomb with bill that i rack up with
my Colo provider should it subscribe to
all the feeds that this person has
should a whole sites on a daily basis to
see are there changes in terms of
friendship when I rewrite this I'm going
to use the API is that various people
have use the flickr api delicious api
that kind of stuff do they have
notification services within those api's
to tell me who's joined at who's left my
social network can i get a private
password protected feed that says this
person joined in this person left your
network some of the social networking
applications aren't there show you this
kind of stuff it's the kind of thing at
Facebook does facebook even tells you by
your friends who've made friends with
people knew who you don't know so i
think i'm not sure what kind of
application this is so as you can see
I've got this idea of 86 calm where I'm
going to hopefully build something but
it might working pretty well as I kind
of as an exchange plugin maybe it's a
maybe it's part of gmail where this tool
is best cited I'm not sure and how often
it updates itself I'm not sure one of
the other kind of things I'm really
interested in them it is environmental
concerns if this thing's needlessly
pulling dine megabytes worth of feeds
every day then that's not very good for
the environment that data has to be
shifted a rhino cos I electricity to
shift our data around what's the minimum
lines of data that this needs to pull
across to build an accurate picture of
my friends so thank you it's a good
question who else
no okay well thank you how much
