coming thanks for folks that we cannot
see but they can see us in New York and
Kirtland who are also interested in
watching this talk it's a great pleasure
for me to introduce professor LAN way
vermin he's the chair of economics at
the London Business School he's you know
a colleague of Hal Varian who many of us
know he's been doing a lot of work with
us for many many years and several of us
have been to his seminars where he talks
to us about you know his work on real
estate bubbles and how they would impact
us and so on and professor Braverman has
been spending several years doing
research on using economic theory to see
how telecommunications affect GDP and
national growth especially in emerging
markets like Africa and you know one of
the things that has always struck me
when you look at the globe downstairs in
building 43 that shows how the Google
queries are emanating from different
parts of the world this one part of the
world which is very dark right and
that's the continent of Africa and
frankly as a company that's out there to
make a global impact that's an area of
concern for us and how can we enable the
closure of this digital divide but you
know not doing it just because we need
to close the digital divide but it has a
real impact on the economics of the
region and what you know lens going to
talk to us about is how that happens and
share with us some of his research this
talk is most likely going to be
published also externally so if you have
any confidential questions I request you
not to ask them Google confidential
questions not to ask them during the
talk but maybe right after but feel free
to ask questions either during or after
depending on how Len prefers it thank
you very much and I give you professor
Braverman
thanks deep it's a great pleasure to be
here today in lovely warm US Northern
California reminds me why I live in
London when I moved there from the
University of Toronto people said why
would you leave Toronto for London I
said it was for the weather so so yeah
my research is being on the impact of
communication systems on economic growth
I have a book coming out called the
networked computer
Cambridge University Press late in this
year with my colleague no fuss oh and
what what it tries to do is give the the
rights the the communications part of
the new economy Google is an amazing
firm and just delightful for me to be
here and to talk to you and and a
two-way talk any time you will have a
question please please ask but one has
to remember that Communications is
really the backbone for computing the
new economy the so called impact of
computers on economic growth and
productivity really relies on big
telecom networks allowing computers they
interact ship data and so that's why
it's the networked computer I'm on our
advisory board at Vodafone on a project
called the social importance of mobile
and there are a lot of anecdotes about
how Mobile's are transforming the
developing world especially parts of
Africa and Indonesia and when I said
they know anecdotes are nice but you
know I'm an economist that can we get
some something more scientific than
anecdotes they said well okay why don't
you do it and so I started looking at
how to estimate how to measure this and
I'll talk about how we do that it's a
difficult problem but we I think we have
some evidence which I'll show you and
share with you some very recent research
which backs that up
so let's begin in the year or a zero of
the year if we look back at history and
this is the shares of world GDP from 0
to 2000 and you can see the world began
in India early on India was by far the
richest country on earth 32 percent of
GDP I don't know how people measure
these things but but don't ask me
these are guesstimate now and you can
see just behind India's China so China
and India were half of the world GDP up
until around 1400 okay so for most the
world's history China India led the
world are then they you can see the the
kind of collapse in both China and India
that collapse our share of GDP is also
because the huge growth in in Western
Europe and the United States so you can
see that by you know in 1950 the US and
Europe are half of the world's GDP india
and china are pretty small at that point
at the bottom is africa which has never
amounted to very much diamonds if you've
seen blood diamonds but the developing
world is coming back we talked about the
BRICS Brazil Russia India China where
the growth is today where the
opportunities are for both any kind of
business and where democracy and real
opportunities for Entrepreneurship are
occurring on this chart what we have is
something you don't have to I don't have
to talk to you about much is just the
digital divide what do we have here
which you can't see because of the black
lettering for the countries from left to
right are Sweden the United States
France Malaysia Center
gal Vietnam Bangladesh and gana so you
can see and there are three things three
columns the first column is personal
computers per 1000 people in 2003 so
come computer density the second one is
internet density Internet users per 1000
people in 2003 and the white column is
mobile phones per 1000 people so if we
compare Sweden and Senegal now that is
the first columns and the fifth you'll
see that PC the ratio of PCs and Sweden
to those in Senegal for 1000 people
thirty to one and the ratio of Internet
users in those two countries is 30 to 1
and it but the ratio mobile phones are
still very much in Sweden's favor 17 to
1 if we compare these the US and
Malaysia u.s. is the second set of
columns Malaysia the fourth pcs in the
u.s. to Malaysia is only 4 to 1 now you
think of the huge gap in GDP per capita
between those two countries internet use
the u.s. is only 50 percent more per
capita Internet use and in mobiles is
about the same now on this next chart
all I've done is add Mobile's in 2005 is
the fourth column and so you can see if
you're looking at the developing world
which is everything from the fourth set
of columns on Malaysia Senegal Vietnam
Bangladesh and gana the huge increase in
Mobile's over a couple of years so the
the growth are in Malaysia went for 442
or 40 for mobile phones per 100 people
in 2003 that's 75 per 100 and two years
later in 2005 so the density that the
penetration of mobiles in gana - when
39 in 2003 are some 3.9 in 2003 per 100
people 213 3 years later so huge boom in
mobile phones and on this chart you can
see a quote from the World Bank which is
that the people in the developing world
are getting more access in incredible
rates far faster than they got access to
new technologies in the past the digital
divide is rapidly closing and that's the
mobile phone and mobile phones closing
the digital divide because it's a much
lower cost technology it's it's much
more scalable you can bring it out and
roll it out at a much different rate
than landlines landlines require cables
in the ground that's very costly and
it's certainly open to theft copper or
in the jungle can be ripped out very
quickly a cell phone site actually
doesn't have that much that's stealable
because it doesn't have much secondhand
value what's multiplex equipment worth
right plus you can put a guard in there
and and the character these photographs
from a colleague of mine show you
something odd this is a company if you
know yellow in Africa this is in
Kinshasa the yellow is what company MTN
MTN is one of the great mobile companies
in the world the fact if you're looking
for what an innovation in mobile don't
look it's singular don't look or at the
West look at Africa look at the
Philippines look at China that's where
the innovation is occurring in the use
of mobile phones and the companies in
Africa like MTN cell tell which is now
owned by MTC Kuwait or ascom these are
the firms we should be fearing in the
West because their business models and
what they're doing with mobile phones
are something that in Europe and in
North America we really haven't
scratched that surface we really haven't
thought of mobile phones as the major
screen
the major instrument and here what you
see odd is you see that it looks like a
payphone it's designed to look like a
payphone because people are used to what
a payphone is is what's odd about this
payphone it's not yet so no it's on a
bicycle right and there's no wire there
folks you know there is no wire that is
a mobile phone this guy's there's a
normal pay phone on a bicycle
now Mo Ibrahim the founder and executive
chairman of cell tell sub-saharan Africa
in 2005 vulva phones grew at 67%
compound rate of growth compared with
10% in Western Europe last year there
are more new mobile phone customers in
Africa than in North America if you talk
to voter comm in South Africa which is a
Vodafone subsidiary they had more net
ads last year that income levels they
thought they would never reach the
greatest road of growth they ever had
was last year why is this occurring in
fact and when we look at the data we see
that people in developing countries can
be spending upwards of fifteen percent
of their annual income on a mobile phone
and there and there's some there's some
who look at that and say what a waste
you know they're getting these gadgets
these fashion items from the West and
they're wasting their income on mobile
phones and that's what because I think
those critics don't understand the
crucial role of communications in
economic development that for economic
development to occur and we all want to
help to want to understand more deeply
why Africa has not developed what are
the circumstances which are holding it
back beside bad governance one needs
social overhead capital or what needs
roads one needs electricity grids one
certainly needs telecoms
I think there's a underestimate out
there but the role of communications the
role of search the role of information
and economic development if you read the
I don't like the Millennium Development
Report Jeff Sachs and others talking but
what has to be done and they're
absolutely right about what has to be
done but he read those kind of that
report their roles to hundreds but sue
two hundred and seventy pages long and
the role of the private sector is how
many pages out of two hundred and
seventy pages nine role of the private
sector is nine pages the role of
communications is kind of throwaway line
because I think there is not an
understanding about the necessity of
communication systems provide on to
provide markets people don't want to be
subsistence subsistence farmers but if
you're in a rural village in Africa or
in India and there's no communications
the trader comes to town provides you
with the fertilizer provide you with the
seeds there is no option he tells you
the prices then he comes and buys any
excess grain that you may have there's
no market you're completely at the mercy
of the trader now we'll be looking at
data shortly well just show in Indonesia
for fishermen what the differences are
when there are mobile phones so the new
economy is about commuter of computers
communicating on modern telecom networks
the version of the new economy in the
developing world is really about the
provision of communications for enabling
information flows and information flows
are going to come in a variety of ways
both over landline and mobile
and are going to be powered by the need
for people to be in market economies so
communication networks widen markets you
can't have markets if you can't
communicate you need the information to
provide you with the alternatives to get
the best price to understand what you
can sell and what you can buy
we in the West forget that we assume
that their information is readily
available wasn't so long ago that that
didn't occur I mean the the original
robber Bela barons you know the melons
of the world they made their money from
the fog by having either the fastest
train or the fastest steamship because
we had to physically transport
information and modern communication is
extraordinary recent when was the first
transatlantic telephone cable what year
was the first transatlantic telephone
cable which procure bit was built
between the UK and the US who wants to
give me an answer
1920s 1935 1951 much closer with 1956
this is the 50th though we just passed
the 50th anniversary of tat one
transatlantic telephone one a joint
venture of AT&amp;amp;T and the British
government which besides Sputnik was the
engineering marvel of the 1950s and that
can't won before that if you want to
make a call there's nobody in this room
who can remember making a call before
1956 but me if you want to make a call
between the North America and Europe
before 1956 how would you do it
radio bounce it off the stratosphere
you'd book a call three weeks in advance
and sit by the phone for hours for the
operator to connect you and say there
are sunspots today and it was and it was
$30 a minute now at one in 1956 had the
capacity of how many simultaneous voice
calls 8383 so when we think about the
vast fiber underneath oceans that's ten
years old with the communications even
in the West is extraordinarily recent
that's why the Information Age is just
beginning and we're just scratching the
surface because you know bandwidth in
November when bandwidth was a 56k modem
bandwidth on a mobile phone is still
very limited broadband everywhere is
going to lead to the next information
age right so it's gonna look so modern
communication is lower widens markets
lowers transactions cost provides the
necessities of being an entrepreneur of
being in markets sir
by the importance of communication for
McCullen but what about transportation
Western world is another question is
what about also the role the role of
physical transportation besides
communications transportation with
Vodafone we've been studying what is a
cost to the annual cost of having a
bicycle in rural India buying a bicycle
and the annualized cost of that are
about 15% of income but then when you
have the bicycle they get information
you have to actually physical travel to
town so roads are essential absolutely
you can move the goods but you can't be
part of the market economy without
communications and communication
networks are better medium than roads
for communications which I think comes
before you can move the goods but I
agree social overhead capital is not
just about mobile phones and when I talk
about the importance of mobile phones in
African India doesn't mean that it's
better than having health or education
I'll show you the end that that's not
true it's one of the things we need but
it's not everything
I know I was just in Beijing I take the
executive mba students to Beijing every
year for the study trip to China and on
the trip I had for executive students
from India and they won that we got to a
day in Beijing they said oh my god
India's in trouble they actually have
roads here so so the problem that we're
at we're all academics here right so the
the problem is an academic is how do you
demonstrate the importance so here's a
chart which shows on the on the
horizontal axis I have GDP in 1980 and
on the vertical axis I have averaged
telecom penetration teledensity and you
can see that orange line is the
correlation and you can see the
correlation is about point nine between
GDP and telecom penetration yeah the
problem with correlation at just
correlation it doesn't tell you cause
and effect it doesn't tell you what
causes what because we know as as people
and as economies get richer that
telecoms is also luxury goods so they
demand more of it
so the causation could be from economic
growth or income to teledensity not from
teledensity to economic growth so we
can't say from this simple correlation
look what you need to grow is get more
phones I can show you the same chart and
everything next time I give a talk I
will which would have on a GDP on on the
horizontal axis and the vertical axis
have white wine consumption per capita
has a very high correlation but 0.6
because you know with the trends are as
you grow as you get richer you drink
more white wine you substitute that for
beer but it's obvious that you're not
going to have that kind of correlation
and say okay Africa drink more white
wine and that's not gonna let you know
so we really want to know causality you
can't build public policy or advice
based on correlation so as an academic
the problem is one of building models
which do causation and not correlations
I published a paper in 2001 with hundred
roller where we did this for the OECD
and for landlines in the 1970s and 1980s
okay
and it was a multi equation model that
basically controlled for spurious
correlation and controlled for in
dodging a ax T between income causing
demand for telephones and the man for
telephones growth of telecom phone's
causing growth because it's just the
latter we want to know we want to know
do telecoms are they good for social
health are they good for society should
there be policies to really promote
communications so we built this model
called the production function for
equations with endogenous demand and
supply of telephones in it and we got
very very interesting results
substantial growth dividend from
telecoms in the OECD in the 70s and 80s
in the United States we found but 10% of
all the economic growth that occurred in
the u.s. in the 70s and 80s was due to
telecom development there now if you
want one you may wonder is does that
sound reasonable I have another one of
these kind of odd questions for you how
many phones were there per 100 people in
France in 1970
now I can pick on friends because I'm a
French citizen you know that beat Greece
with five and Portugal with six as I
said with my story about the first
transatlantic cable modern telecom is
very recent
remember the Europe I had emerged from
the second world war and really hadn't
thought of telecommunications of being
really essential to you could on the
growth and so here is a chart which
shows you the teledensity that is the
number of phones per 100 people Austria
Canada France Ireland Italy Portugal
Spain Sweden the United States in 1970
which is in blue and 1980 which is in
orange and you can see the enormous
growth in mainline phones that is the
you know the thing that's still
connected to a line that sits on a wall
somewhere I don't see many here you know
you know the mainline phone it's usually
black you can get a fashion item now it
can be white and and they're really
remarkable now you know they will not
read aisle the last number and it will
could have could remember up to 200
numbers you know has maybe 8k of memory
that's really surprising how little
advanced their computing occurred so you
can see the big change in telecom
penetration main lines between 1970 the
number I said how many main lines per
100 people is a little odd because the
Universal Service is one phone for home
so you've got to think about how many
phones per 100 is universal service so
what's the average household size around
two and a half so 40 phones per 140 mean
lines per 100 is basically universal
service so you can see Universal Service
existed in Canada in 1980 the u.s.
Sweden in the 1970s but nowhere other in
Sweden Finland of 1970 so this is the
fixed lines the blue now is 1995 I
showed you fixed lines in the developing
world in 1970 1980 would be it down at
the bottom because there was none so the
blue was 1995 the orange is 2003 and you
can see here for these countries Bolivia
China their increase in main lines over
that very short time frame and the
outstanding example is China they think
of the population China the size of
China and the physical geographic size
to go from 3 phones per 100 people in
1995 to 20 in mainline phones that is
the stuff that's wired in the ground is
astonishing it's astonishing
what happened
but if you look at countries like
Morocco you can see main lines went the
wrong direction there are no net
additions and even a few if you look at
that chart you can see that you know 15
main lines per 100 we haven't reached
that anywhere but in China in those
countries so nowhere near universal
service this is mobile phones for 100
people in the same years
the blue is 1995 you can see blue
doesn't peak much above zero and the
orange is only eight years later again
China looked going from zero to twenty
two mobile phones per 108 years and look
at Morocco from her main lines no net
additions but they've gone from
basically zero to twenty three main
mobile phones per 100 so mobile phones
is the growth in communications in the
developing world and then the question
is well do mobiles in the developing
world provide the same kind of impact on
economic growth that made main lines
there to the OECD in the 1970s or 1980s
are they being used in the same way
again so we get back to a model and
econometrics to try to figure out
causation because the correlation is not
going to be much use plus when we start
looking at developing world we have bad
data and we have countries which have
wars we have poor economic results and
we have a lot of investment in mobile
phone so one has to be very careful in
these kinds of models how we as
scientists come up with evidence from
which we can base policy on because we
want to be we're going to tell say that
mobile phones are good for your health
that we want to be very careful that we
have evidence for that
and so we here we built in what's called
an endogenous growth model is how
varying was here he could talk about
this as well where we're looking at
broad decades Long's averages of
economic growth and what are the some of
the main causes of growth we have in
here telecom penetration Sigma long
fixed and we have a investment and we
have primary school completion we're
looking at skills were looking at human
capital that's being added over these
years I won't go through the the results
or the econometrics we had a 92 country
sample from 1980 to 2003 both developed
and development and it results from the
model were and this was reported in The
Economist magazine March the 12th of
2005 actually less had a the fund cover
was an African child
holding a mobile phone be the same the
10% difference in mobile penetration
levels leads to a 0.6% difference
I'll explain what that means it's a very
robust result it also the econometrics
show that Nobles add a little to growth
in the developed world right the people
already have main lines but adds a lot
in the developing world they're that
kind of you know we have very scientific
tests in economics it's called the smell
test
does it smell right should know about us
be more important in developing world
than it develop
yeah smells right yeah so the so this
was what the model showed and let me
explain what it means so here I have two
countries Indonesia and the Philippines
the Indonesia's in blue and the
Philippines is in orange and the first
two columns right here we have the
current levels of GDP growth per capita
you can see that Philippines is growing
around two and a half percent a year 2.6
percent a year and Indonesia is growing
1.6 percent a year so Indonesia is
growing slower by one percent a year
than is the Philippines now it in in the
in the model we've developed it's over
decades long averages you can't expect
to put mobile phones in tomorrow and get
economic growth the next day it really
requires a lot of changes to occur in
society and in the use and Marcus that
starts functioning so this is not like
an instantaneous prescription for growth
but here what in this and what's labeled
to what we do is we over 20 years
equalize the mobile phone penetration
rate between Indonesia and the
Philippines and you can see that doing
that increases the growth in rate in
Indonesia by about one percent a year so
the gap in mobile phone penetration
which was
in this year in 2003 there were nine
mobile phones per 100 people in in
Indonesia and abut 21 in the Philippines
so we equalize that a gap over a long
period of time we increase growth in
Indonesia to about the same as the
Philippines so that's chosen the
importance of Mobile's
but as I said earlier yeah and and was
asked um what about roads what about
education what about public health
what about hospitals I mean there are a
lot of things there are absent in the
developing world and so here on the last
what's labeled number three those
columns there keep mobile phones way
below the Philippines and Indonesia keep
it at the level of 2003 but what we do
is increase the primary school
completion rate slowly in Indonesia to
match the Philippines Philippines has a
much higher rate of people with primary
school education levels so we increase
that in Indonesia and you can see then
Indonesia grows faster than the
Philippines so the real question for
Public Policy would be if I have an
extra dollar to spend what I want to
spend it on mobile phones or on
education or on health I can't answer
that not from our work you can see that
a lot of things are important to growth
so it's not the I don't leave you with a
feeling that all we have to do in Africa
is provide mobile phones that's wrong
mobile phones are one of the avenues of
growth may not maybe even not the most
important one but it is an important way
of people to be get into markets to
increase incomes in the present research
we're doing we're looking at what we
call the consumer surplus what are the
benefits to consumers from the spread of
mobiles this is for those of you who are
any any economists out there
so so thanks for having a few here I
appreciate that Google so what we're
doing here is what we're looking at the
benefits to consumers over and above the
price and you can see that the spread of
mobiles in China is where something like
2% of GDP in Ecuador 4% we've done this
for a whole set of developing countries
it's another measure of the value of
mobiles in development now let me give
you some other evidence because you can
say well economy-wide production
functions or endogenous growth models
I'm looking all of Indonesia and you
know maybe that's a little too grandiose
so here's a recent paper it's coming out
in the quarterly Journal of economics
Robert Jensen at the Kennedy School what
he did is he got data from let me get
exact years here from September 3rd 1996
to May 21st of 2001 weekly data from 15
fishing villages in Indonesia in India
in a state of karela so what he did is
he actually gathered 420 firm 420
fishermen pen large and 10 small weekly
for that entire time period how much did
they receive for their fish well I'm
worried that they landed because what he
knew was is in this chart here is what
this chart shows is in these three
regions when we're mobile phones
introduced so in the region one was
infused on January 31st of 1997 on a
second region
July 6th of 1915 in 1998 in the last
region only in 2000 so this is a great
way of doing a natural experiment to see
how did fishermen do
they make more money and the consumers
benefit for the spread of mobiles
because the anecdote is this if you're a
fisherman off the coast of karela
and you have your your catch of fish you
then go to port and the port then tells
you what your catch is worth you may not
like that price but what are you going
to do these fishing villages are 15
kilometres apart
I'm going to get back in your boat and
try the next village maybe it or nobody
left there and trying to buy fish so
there's no information about what the
market opportunities are so the people
the fisherman then are really at the
mercy of the people buying and the
evidence was that and these three
regions are three different catchment
owns for fish and all the fishermen in
those cashman zones in region 1 where
all we sell in region 1 they'd never
cross the boundary to region 2 or region
3 even though a 15 kilometer trip would
only cause something like 5% the fuel of
that only cost like 5 percent of the
value of the catch but they never did it
and no idea what those other markets
would be they'll now come Oh ball falls
so the you know the the story is you now
you're on your boat so you got the
mobile phone you phone in you say okay
what do you pay here's what I got today
what are you paying I don't like that or
you phone 10 different people for three
different ports a hundred different
people you do SMS right because an SMS
is like a contract it's not you know SMS
is nice because it's physically you know
you can go back say hey here's what you
promised to pay so does that really
matter well
here is the mobile phone adoption by
fishermen this shows you when it becomes
available you can see mobile phone
adoption is basically zero until you can
see the the phones added the black sharp
black line going up shows when there are
phones in that district so this big one
they came in very soon and mobile phone
adoption in 20 weeks went to 85% 85% of
fishermen had mobile phones within 20
weeks of them being available look at
region to look at Region three when
these devices were available they were
used now it wasn't that anybody actually
decided to have mobile phones for
fishermen it just when they put in the
base stations there was sufficiently
close to the coast that they covered an
area 30 kilometers outside the coast you
know not that they ever thought the fish
with one mobile phones right but
fishermen quickly adapted the technology
amazingly fast and you can see it's
unanimous right this is not a slow
adaption rate this is phones are their
first the big boats get them then
everybody gets them this is an adaption
curve which are amazing now here's what
happens to prices so again the price
dispersion you see before my mobile
phones remember he was what Jensen was
getting was all the weekly prices from
20 fishing boats and you can see the
huge variance in prices before the
adoption of mobile phones in fact eight
percent of the catches were wasted
because when they paint the port the
price was zero
nobody wanted fish although 15
kilometers away
there were buyers who had no fish to buy
because there's nobody in that port with
fish so the here there was a huge social
waste so the price dispersions are
enormous you can see what happens as
soon as you get mobile phones
the dispersion goes down remarkably from
a 60% significant dispersion to 6% and
lower and then what he does is test for
law of one price is there a single price
for fish across these three regions
before there it before mobile phones
there isn't because the fisherman in
that catchment zone always went to those
ports afterwards thirty to forty percent
of the fishermen go to another region
and that's bizarre but Raj means that
after the mobile phones there is a
single uniform price for any kind of
fish across the entire area the average
revenue of fishermen went up by eight
percent the average price of fish to
consumers fell six percent and there was
no waste so very large social benefits
oh so why are people spending fifteen
percent of their income on phones is it
a fashion device for some of them yeah
but it really is an information
gathering tool mobile phones are
providing a very vital communications
absolute need that we forget we know
what markets are here but in developing
world markets don't function they don't
function properly because there's very
little information remember information
is power and there's no power to
providers like it's the single fisherman
before mobile phones I see some
questions
it is it is in Jensen's thing it is not
but it's the increase in the revenue is
of sufficient magnitude that even when
the first mobile phones cost $100 so we
are if you you can amortize them over
over about four months for these kinds
of benefits see another question
now returning to that was it voice or
SMS we see them a lot more research can
be done after the differences in the
uses of mobile phones in the developing
world the data I've seen for example
from South Africa a show that in the
rural areas the amount of incoming SMS
relative the outgoing SMS is 13 to one
much different ratio from what we see in
the West and that's because the richer
people in urban towns are call our
SMSing them so we're seeing very
different patterns and I'll come to at
the end whether I think it's voice or
data I think that's a very important
point how much of this our data services
and also couldn't we be using voice for
data services as well because search can
be voice as opposed to SMS now the
founder of Reliance Ambani and in India
said if a telephone said this a few
years ago if a telephone call could be
made cheaper than the postcard in India
it will transform every home and power
every Indian remove every roadblock to
opportunity and growth and demolish
every barrier that divides society so
what about Google what about the digital
divide what can you do well at the
moment today actually this is part of
data but a month old
there are 2.2 million mobile phone users
in the world one to 2.2 billion mobile
phone users in the world 1.4 billion of
those are in the developing world so
many more mobile phone users in the
developing world than in the developed
world that's not true for PCs and the
developing world mobiles are used to
access information as we just showed so
what
in Google do about that how can you help
I know you have a big group looking at
this so you know I may be adding very
little to your innermost thoughts which
I don't know but clearly we need better
search tools for mobile phones in the
developing world what's the main
impediment to the use of SMS illiteracy
the literacy rate in a number of these
countries is extremely low so it's very
difficult to use a mobile phone for
search either SMS search or a Google
search when you can't read and so
therefore you know we need some kind of
other ways of acquiring information now
when I said that these firms in the
developing world are really innovative
they're they're innovative because
they're developing banking tools because
in a number of these countries banking
is something that doesn't exist in rural
areas and there's no access to banking
from the poor if you drive in from
Johannesburg from the airport the
highway is just littered with signs and
what it says is carpenter and gives a
phone number because the remember a
mobile phone is a very different tool
than a landline phone I talked about
universal service for landlines being a
phone for every home but mobile phones
are extremely our personal devices one
for every person because what they are
in the developing world is their
identity because then if you live in a
shanty town nobody's gonna come and
knock on your door and offer you a job
nobody knows who you are nobody knows
where you are but a cell phone number is
identity
the key encrypted unique number it's an
identity and we're seeing in the
developing world people are now even if
mobile phones are mainly prepay 95%
prepay so you top up your phone they're
going to their mobile phone provider and
they're asking for the records of how
much they've used their phone and how
much they've used it in prepay how much
money they put it into it as a very
simple credit check
it shows look here's what I've had this
phone for two years or a year here's the
money I've used on it here's all my
calling I am a responsible person they
have nothing else so the mobile phone
and its records is something much more
than a simple communications tool and a
number of these cell phone operators
cell tel and others are understanding
this and using these four very kinds of
youth services banking one of them and
so what we find is that in the
developing world
how do you do banking if you're
illiterate somebody shows you the
keystrokes you don't know the numbers
you don't know the letters but somebody
shows you if you do these seven
keystrokes here's what you can do and
people have learnt those so this
keystroke growth route is some way of
doing search or icons or pictograms
something where the people who are
illiterate they don't want to be
illiterate I mean they want to function
we've seen enormous entrepreneurship
look I mean you know grameenphone the
Nobel Peace Prize partly because of
mobile phone provision in Bangladesh
where in each village you have usually a
woman who becomes the entrepreneur
you're boring the few dollars to invest
in the mobile phone you're reselling it
we see in India and in in Africa mobile
phones and communities where there is no
electricity
there's an entrepreneur who has a
business that every week they take all
the mobile phones and they bicycle 50
miles away and recharge them all and
bicycle back so there's there's a lot in
you entrepreneurship uh there's enormous
entrepreneurship in Africa in India
these people haven't had the ability to
become entrepreneurs because they have
there's no markets there's no way of
earning money there's no way of showing
what you can do and so these kinds of
search tools and then it's targeted
information so for example on the date
on what we just saw in Kerala State it's
still sometimes you in if you read the
paper and I have it with me sometimes
they call hundreds of people or SMS
hundreds of people to get the best price
well that's really inefficient right
that's pretty good
there must be a better way of doing that
there must be some aggregation function
one can do and there must be a best
price algorithm you can develop so they
don't have to go through this and this
is this fishermen farmers there's all
kinds of you know the kinds of
Agriculture basic industries that we
think about that we don't think about
here anymore I mean how many people here
want to be a fisherman right but these
are real sources of wealth in these
economies and we can make it even better
if we're able to provide them with
better search better ways of getting
information now it's extremely
rudimentary it's person-to-person
depends on who you know there's some
other person you don't know who give you
a better price yeah that's so there's
any I think enormous opportunities out
here but I think we didn't also need
more research and the ways in which
they're doing how they're using SMS how
they're using voice and how we can
provide search tools to the illiterate
on job opportunities social even social
networks which are very dense
in these countries you know I don't know
of any you know my space that exists in
India and Africa for these people
education and my final slide is I think
I already asked the question I got the
answer what's the main developing world
issue for pc and mobile search the
illiteracy so what can google do I call
it the Google literacy program why don't
you help them become literate and
literate in novel ways you know because
on a mobile phone we do have a way of
becoming literate I mean we could think
of the mobile phone and an educational
program in a mobile phone with the
screen we can think I'm sure you can
find a way of giving these people simple
literacy on the mobile phone mobile
phone is that is the instrument at the
moment could be PCs in 10 or 15 years
presently I'm not saying here the we're
going to end at mobile phones and that
the landlines won't come back and
bandwidth won't appear but this is the
the screen at the moment and the screen
at the moment has has its problems the
problems are that people can use them
sufficiently I wanted you know as a as
an economist I want Africa to grow I
want them to have more opportunities for
education and for jobs and to get better
prices for the goods and to understand
what market opportunities are and for
that they need information and I think
you can help provide that information
and it's good for Africa and it's good
for Google right because as they become
literate then they go to Google search
and and again there might be advertising
I mean I haven't you you have thought
about all these
but let me leave you with with this
program this advocacy that if Google
really wants to help Africa I think one
way you can help is by helping these
people become literate and using your
enormous technical abilities and your
enormous humanitarianism to develop the
tools for mobile phones which have all
the letters they have the numbers they
have a screen they're interactive
they're personal think of the ways in
which you can help Africa by being as
great as Google is for them Thanks
so uh lots of time for questions I hope
you know what a movie screen is a movie
screen is much bigger and they are
getting the the writing underneath is
teaching they're practising literacy at
work in Africa
it may be pen yeah there's so many
different languages and some I don't
know what them big a very healthy I
didn't know about the program but yeah
absolutely that's a big help I think
that's a very good point the question is
the fact that mobile phones are
spreading like wildfire I mean we're
seeing penetration rates you know 60 70
percent in in these developing countries
because they have it and they want to
use it that I think there is a desire to
be literate I think that the mobile
phone gives them a reason to be literate
where there wasn't one before so it's
both the tool and it's a draw so I think
you're absolutely right that the fact
that these people these kids now have
mobile phones or let's not just think
about the kids let's think about the
older generation as well because they
have these mobile phones it now gives
them the potential to become literate
they're not going to go back to school
traveling to school can also be arduous
and costly and this is you know you can
personalize the program you can learn
what you need so I absolutely i I think
it's a it as to the demands
illiteracy enormous Lee that they want
to SMS each other
or anyone's many communication to our
class
that would say but let official
broadcasts every community with other
dan sighs I don't know but yeah you
think that's the that would be the next
step
yeah yes
well it's the it's the reduction of the
inefficiency they're getting a lot more
revenue because there's no wasted catch
and they're going to the port that gives
them the best price so that's how
revenue can go up and still prices fall
for everybody because we eliminate the
inefficiencies when there are no markets
functioning so that's really removing
the inefficiencies is kind of win-win
that both the button that buyers and the
sellers are better off</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
