MATT: So I'm here today to
introduce Vytas SunSpiral.
So Vytas and I know each other
from our undergrad experience
at Stanford, a rather
long time ago now,
where we were both running
robots around the CS department
in the middle of the night.
So after, Vytas
went off to start up
in Pittsburgh Mobot,
which did some
of the first autonomous
robotic tour guides.
Came back here, right
across one of our creeks,
and has been working at NASA
and with Carnegie Mellon
and a couple other
places back and forth.
Over the last decade or so, he's
done work on walking robots.
He's done work on lots
of different projects
within the Intelligent
Robotics team.
One of the coolest
projects was the spheres
which were little robots that
could fly around the space
station autonomously and
interact with the astronauts.
Sort of.
VYTAS SUNSPIRAL: Getting there.
MATT: Getting there.
And he's here today
to talk about his work
about biologically
inspired robots.
VYTAS SUNSPIRAL: All right.
Hi, everybody.
So thanks for the
introduction, Matt.
The real interesting
thing, the big story
that we're dealing with
in the robotics world,
is that we've traditionally
made very rigid systems
using the engineering tools
and techniques and design
tools that are easy and
accessible to us today.
And there's a generational
shift starting
to occur in the
technology, where we're
moving more and more towards
softer, more compliant systems.
And you see this really
led by those people who
are taking robots out of
structured laboratories
and factories and
starting to really grapple
with the real, natural
world and having
to have sensor-driven
approaches where they don't have
perfect models of
the environment.
They're not controlling
the environment.
And that's leading
to this compliance.
And so I've been
investigating how
we can look at that
shift in space robotics,
in space exploration,
and specifically pulling
some specific forms
of soft robotics out
of biological inspiration.
Now all of this interest
of mine has really
started way back,
actually, back when
I was in high school, a focus
on artificial intelligence
and really trying to
understand, how do we work?
How do humans think and reason?
How do we experience all
the things we experience?
And that really
rapidly got me thinking
about embodiment in the world.
And to understand
human intelligence,
I found that it would
really make sense
to start by understanding
how we move.
Because that's what
our brains and bodies
initially evolved for.
And if you look at some of
the very first neurons that
evolved a long time ago,
those were motor controllers.
That's what their first
role in the natural world
was, was to control motion.
And it's since then, on top
of that foundational base,
that all of these other
things that we think
of as the aspects of our brains
in neuroscience have evolved.
And so to understand
all that intelligence,
it helps to understand the
foundational components that
come from motion control.
So the way we're going to tell
the story over the next 40
minutes or so is,
of course, when
you want to understand
how we move,
it's very important
to understand
the physical structure
that you are moving.
What are the physical
properties of it?
And there's an interesting story
that's emerging these days out
of some corners of the medical
field, physical therapy field,
looking at the body more as a
network of tensile material,
rather than a very rigid,
bone-centic approach,
which is how we
have traditionally
built robots and
buildings and whatnot.
So I'll talk about
that and then talk
about what that means in
terms of an engineering
principle called tensegrity
and what implications that
has for understanding
how our bodies work
in a very counterintuitive way.
And then finally,
I'll get around
to showing the work that
we're then doing in the lab,
building prototype
robots and exploring
how they can be applied to space
problems and some of the really
interesting new things that
are possible when you harness
these properties of these
soft, tensile networks.
The challenge with
them, of course,
is that they defy all of
our traditional engineering
and control methodologies.
And so how do we control them?
And for that, we will go back
to looking at neuroscience
and some biological inspiration
and explain a little bit
about what the
modern thoughts are
on how we control
motion in our bodies.
And that will finally give us a
few philosophical insights back
to the nature of
intelligence, and we're
full circle in 40 minutes or so.
So starting off with
our physical bodies
and how we move, one of the
first things to think about
is the most fundamental
aspect of how
we move in the world is through
contact, contact dynamics
and contact events.
So much of our
robotics technology
is focused on path
planning to avoid contact.
We've been, until now, very
afraid of making contact
with the world.
But the reality is,
almost everything
we do-- every step you
take is a contact event.
Every manipulation task
is a contact event.
And no matter how
perfectly you were
to try to plan to avoid
contact, the real world outside
of the laboratory is full
of unexpected surprises.
And so you want
a physical system
that is well adapted to
absorbing contact forces
and impacts, and
you want to assume
that that's the
norm of operation,
rather than something you're
constantly trying to avoid.
And that becomes a very
different physical system,
when you think about it, than
our traditional approaches.
So what we think about,
the common sense way
we think about construction,
is like our house.
It's a continuous
compression load path.
The weight of the roof rests
and presses on the walls,
and that weight accumulates and
presses down on the foundation.
And it's nice, linear load
path through the structure.
And that's also
what you get when
you build robots out of a series
of rigidly connected systems.
Even though there may
be motion at the joints,
it's still a rigidly
connected system.
And so one of the
challenges with this
is that you can get really
large forces accumulating,
propagating through the system,
magnifying through leverage,
and accumulating in joints.
And so-- oh, that's
a microphone.
I'll stop doing that.
And so that can really
make it challenging.
Individual joints can
really get saturated
with forces in very
simple situations.
So now take a look at an X-ray
of our shoulder in motion.
And one of the things
that you first notice
is that there's actually a fair
bit of space between the bones.
Now there's soft tissue
and cartilage and ligaments
in there, but, especially
when that little red arrow
points up, you'll
see how much space
is available between
the bones when you're up
in these positions
and other positions.
And that's fascinating.
That's really an indication
of maybe a different way
to look at our body.
The soft tissue that
may be between there,
too, the bones don't just
rotate on a nice, simple axis,
like the machines
that we build do.
You can kind of see here.
It slides and glides and moves.
And if you're load bearing
during those motions,
if you're compressing through
that joint, bone to bone,
you'd be tearing up all of
the ligaments and soft tissue
that's between there.
Your body's really not
well adapted to that.
That has a tendency to lead to
arthritis and other problems
like that.
So this is so counterintuitive
sometimes to think about.
And one reason, perhaps, is
when we were all in our biology
classrooms and in
high school, we
had these skeletons
in the corner.
And it's a little misleading
because that skeleton
is being held together by a
bunch of aftermarket hinges
that are not there, not
present in our actual bodies.
What really hold
our bodies together
is all that soft tissue.
There's no mechanical, rigid
connection between bones.
They are able to float and move
free relative to each other.
And what holds it together,
that soft tissue, collectively
is known as fascia.
It is sort of a somewhat
elastic collagen fibers.
And it is what is your
fundamental shape.
When you are initially
embryotic, it turns out,
you start life as a sack of
fascia with 660 pockets in it.
And it's into those pockets that
your muscles and bones later
grow.
And so this is your one
continuous structure
in your body.
The bones are not
actually continuous.
They're discontinuous and free
to move relative to each other.
But the fascia is continuous.
So the outer layer of the bone,
the periosteum, those fibers
are continuous with the fibers
that are your ligaments.
And those fibers are
continuous with what
then wraps around and is
all throughout your muscles.
And so really, it's better to
think about the fascial system
as a continuous
system and not even
sort of this idea of
periosteum, outside of the bone.
Well really, the
core, hard bone is
sitting in a pocket
within the fascia,
as a little mental flip.
What's interesting
is that people
have been starting to research
this in a lot of ways.
Over the last 50 years or so,
there's been a lot of focus
on this coming out of the
physical therapy realms.
I've actually got
these slides backwards.
Our of the physical
therapy, Ida Rolf--
have you ever
heard of rolfing?--
is one of the pioneers
and techniques of looking
at the continuous tensile
network of the body.
A lot of other modalities
have come out of this.
They're very effective.
And so, as a result, starting
just, what, five or so years
ago, you've started to have
some of the first International
academic conferences
that are really
looking at the fascial
systems in our bodies.
So this is not yet mainstream
medical accepted wisdom.
But it's gaining
a lot of traction
and has a lot of power
to explain things
that we see in our body.
And one of the
current researchers
on the topic, Tom
Meyers, he works
with some other folks where
they've been doing dissections
on fresh cadavers, prior
to being preserved.
And that's important because
when you preserve a cadaver,
it glues all the
fascia together.
And surfaces that are meant
to slide and glide and stretch
and flex become hard and rigid.
And so it becomes very difficult
to actually investigate
this tensile
network in the body.
It's one reason why a lot
of our medical knowledge,
built upon anatomy studies
from 100 years ago,
missed this, where people were
just like, oh, it's a muscle.
It's a bone.
Those are what matter,
and the stuff in between
is just holding it together.
They were missing
the fact that this
is a very active, complete
system in the body.
One other thing that's really
interesting that comes out
of this is Tom Meyers
has been trying
to map out the long distance
kinematic chains in the body
that participate in load
transfer and force transfer.
How does force propagate through
the soft tissues, end to end,
as you're pushing on a wall
all the way down to the ground.
All these sorts of
different types of motion.
And what's interesting
is that what comes out
of it is that the lines of
force transfer, he finds,
follow very closely
the meridians
that are used in acupuncture.
And it's also along those
lines where, within the fascia,
that you find the majority of
our internal proprioceptive
sensors, strain gauges and
length and position sensors.
So it makes sense that these
are the lines of action
is exactly where you want
to put all of your sensors.
And it's not in the bones.
The bones are not full
of sensors telling them
how much load they have on them.
It's all in the soft tissue.

And so you can see this.
This is like an image from
a Body Worlds exhibit.
And you can see how
you can get some
of these continuous networks.
Like coming up
from the lower leg,
you can see the IT
band on the side
over here and up to
the lumbar fascia.
And there's this whole network
of large components and sheets
of this tensile material.
And the muscles themselves
are part of that network.
They're just an active,
shape-changing component of it,
rather than the other parts that
are a little bit more static.
Though even the fascia
can adapt itself
over time, just a larger
time scale than muscles.
So that's where some of
the physical, biological
inspiration is coming from.
But if you now take that, and
you say, oh, wait a minute.
This is strange.
If we're moving away from this
continuous compressive load
path, what's the alternative?
What does that really mean
to have all the force moving
through the tensile network?
And this is where we get to talk
about tensegrity structures.
The concept of
tensegrity was first
explored by Kennith Snelson
and Buckminster Fuller
back in the '60s.
Buckminster Fuller
came up with the term.
It means tension and
structural integrity.
And the basic idea is
that the tensile network
is the continuous
network of the structure.
It holds the structure stable.
And the rods, the
rigid elements,
are actually floating,
discontinuous in that network.
And it's a combination
of the two in balance
that actually makes it stable.
The rods are under compression.
They are being compressed
by the tensile network.
And if you look at
the overall structure,
there's an equal balance
between tension and compression
through the different elements.
So they're very
counterintuitive,
which is why they made
really awesome forms of art
for a long time.
And they're very
difficult to analyze,
but we are now getting the
computational and mathematical
capabilities to do
that and starting
to look at how do you
use them for machines,
for robots, and motion.
And it turns out they
have a lot of really
neat physical properties.
For one, they're very
lightweight structures.
And this matters a lot to NASA.
The elements, the
rods and the cables,
are all experiencing either pure
tension or pure compression.
So they're not bending.
You don't have to worry about
bending and shear forces
in the rods as much.
And therefore, you can
use very light elements.
And tensile elements generally
can take a lot more force
for their weight, so you get
very efficient structures
from that perspective, from a
weight structure perspective.
You also don't have those
lever arms internally.
If you push down on this rod,
it doesn't push another rod
directly.
It affects all of them, but
not in a direct, rigid leverage
form, so the forces don't
magnify in the same way.
Instead, what you get is a
bit of a passive, global force
distribution.
Even when you push
down on this rod,
strings up there
will participate
in absorbing that stress.
The whole structure participates
in dealing with the events
that it experiences.
And this is really nice.
If you start thinking about
an animal or robot that
needs to move in the world
and is costly changing
its relationship to gravity,
so it's always getting forces
from different angles, not
just like a house that's just
sitting still, then
you need that ability
for the whole structure
to participate,
working with the forces
it's experiencing.
Now with those
properties, then it's
not surprising that you
find that all the way down
at the cellular level, there
are researchers such as Donald
Ingber who's at the Harvard Wyss
Institute, who's been studying
for the last 20, 30 years
that cell structure can
be modeled as a
tensegrity system.
And it's interesting.
You'll see later that
some of his cell models
end up looking a lot like
the robots we're building.
And so it's a nice
place to be starting.
And so, again, it's
not surprising,
given these really
good qualities
that allow cells to adapt
and respond to the forces
they experience in a very
lightweight and efficient
manner.
There are other
researchers who are looking
at how do you then
apply these concepts
to the gross physiology,
our large scale
physiology in our bodies.
And I meant to bring along
with me a physical model of one
of these spines, and
I completely forgot,
and I apologize.
But you can see it really
well in these spine models,
where these vertebrate end up
actually floating, suspended
apart from each other.
And you can load bear on it,
and they don't necessarily
make contact with each other.
Which is very compelling because
the standard model of thinking
of the spine as a series
of vertebrae and disks
that are pressing force down
through them in a linear manner
begs the question
of why don't we all
have bulging disks
and pinched nerves.
Why does that happen
sometimes and not others?
And one theory is that
because this is maybe
that sort of ideal, optimized
model, where the primary load
path is through that
tensile network.
It's your muscles
and ligaments that
are supporting and actually
spreading your vertebrae apart.
Now when you run
and you jump, you
get high frequency
impact shocks.
That might cause a little
jostle through the system,
so it's still good to
have disks in there
to protect against that.
But you don't want that
force happening continuously.
Then you get wear and tear
and very unhappy soft tissue
between the bones.
Likewise, this is a
model of the knee, where
it can absorb weight without
these two bones touching.
This one is less clearly
anatomically correct.
This is conceptually
showing that here's
a manner that this can be done,
where you can have that load
bearing without
continuous compression.
This structure is not
immediately obvious.
And there's people
thinking about it.
Tom [INAUDIBLE], who's worked
on some of these models,
has some theories about sort
of the way the fascia weaves
and how that creates
a Chinese finger
trap that helps spread
the bones apart.
The key story here-- it's
an open area of research.
But the key story is
that your body, I think,
has multiple ways that it
moves force through the body.
One way is through
this tensile network,
and this tries to
keep those bones apart
so they can actually maintain
a reasonable level, a managed
level of force
between the bones.
So that doesn't overwear
and grind on them
and can control the dynamics
of the system very nicely.
If you end up having injury or
damage to your tensile network,
your muscles and
your tendons, then
maybe you fall back to this
continuous compression,
bones resting on bones.
Better to have that then to
fall apart and die early.
So we can use both.
But there's certain
ways that are
more beneficial to how we move.

So that sort of wraps up
the initial inspiration,
the physical aspect
of the inspiration
and why we may find this
valuable to look at,
if biology is building so
heavily on these principles.
So then the question is,
what can we do with it?
What does it change
in the way that we
think about exploring space?
And the first major project that
we've launched on this front,
it's funded by the NASA
Innovative Advanced Concepts
program, NIAC.
And it's to look at
building a robot that
has multiple functions
in one structure.
Traditionally, if you
want to go explore Mars,
you build your robot.
It's got wheels,
and it's a rover.
And then you put the whole
thing in a landing structure
that has an airbag.
You land, you
discard the airbag,
and then you go driving around.
What if we could do
that all in one system?
And that's the concept.
This tensegrity ball that's
made of rods and strings
can land and absorb impact
much like an airbag does.
And then once it's landed, it
can itself roll round and move
and be the exploration system.
So now you're saving mass
and system complexity
by putting that all together.
The other important
aspect of this
is that these structures
are deployable.
Since you are changing
string lengths,
you can pack it really
small and then deploy
it, which is very important for
launching things into space.
We have small rocket
launch volumes.
Here's an example of
how it might land.
And this was done in a
physics-based simulator
that we're working
on and we're trying
to open source sometime soon.
And there it is
rolling, again, just
by changing the string lengths.
And here you can see a more
detailed image of it going over
some hills and rougher terrain.
And so that's the concept.

What's really
interesting about it
is that was the
initial inspiration.
But then one of the realizations
is that if this system works,
you change the nature of how
you explore another planet.
Because you now
have a system that
was robust and compliant
enough to survive
the impact of
landing from space.
So now, if you
want to go explore
in some really rough,
dangerous terrain,
and you're up close
to a cliff where
there's a lot of interesting
scientific geology to explore,
and you happen to slip and
fall off the cliff, all right.
Well, you didn't want
to do that, but it's OK.
You can probably survive that.
At least. that's the intuition.
So it maybe really
changes the risk profile
of how machines
move in the world
if they're very
robust and resilient.

Just a little more
analytical approach,
we did a lot of
research into really
looking at that landing event.
And this model shows a
little better the payload,
that central sphere.
That's where you'd put all of
your scientifically important
instruments that are potentially
quite sensitive to shocks.
So you might have your
spectrometers in there
and your fine grain microscopic
imagers and whatnot.
And these guys are going to have
some limitation of what impact
forces they can take at maximum.
And so it turns out you can,
in fact, manage that and limit,
depending on how you size
and scale this system,
you can limit the
amount of forces
that those guys experience to
keep it within the engineering
requirements of
those instruments.
So that's really nice to see
that that quality is there,
like an airbag.
And of course, that
simulation, so we tested it,
threw a robot off a building.
And you don't get to
do that very often.
This was falling from 10
meters, which gives it on Earth
a landing velocity similar to
the terminal velocity if this
was landing on Titan, which is
our initial target exploration.
And so this was just
a first prototype.
It had some motors in
there so it could collapse
and stand up again.
And it survived and
continued to work.
So we did that analysis.
We found that as you
make the rods bigger,
you get more stroke
length for deceleration.
You can protect your
payloads quite nicely.
That's very exciting.
And that the mass of the
system isn't really a driver,
because you can just change your
spring constants in the springs
to handle whatever
mass of your payload.
So there's a lot of
engineering flexibility
you get out of this that may
be even more tunable than you
would with an airbag, where you
have more limitations on what
type of gases you're using and
what its compressibility is,
et cetera.
So there's some really
nice advantages,
I think, to that sort
of landing scenario.
It's also interesting to note
that we went from airbags
on MRR to the sky
crane approach on MSL.
And one reason for doing
that is because airbags,
the mass of an air bag scales
with the square of the radius
because you are completing
the whole surface
area of that sphere.
So as you get a bigger
and bigger system,
the airbags start becoming
really, really heavy.
On these types of
tensegrity robots,
you're not filling in
that whole surface area.
Rather, it's going to be more
of a linear mass scaling.
So one of our places we'd like
to look at this in the future
is, how well does this
scale to very large systems.
And it may actually turn out
to be a more mass-efficient way
to do that.

And then Ken, who's actually
here in the audience,
brought with him from
Belgium a prototype robot,
very much along the lines
of what we're looking at.
And it was able to do all
sorts of different things,
including rolling.
Now this is an
under-actuated version.
There's only six
actuators in here.
And we would actually love
there to be a lot more,
and we're working on that.
But even with just
those six actuators,
you can get it to
physically move,
now not as gracefully as you saw
in some of the videos earlier,
which took more
actuation capabilities.
So we've performed tests
on those, on that system.
We've used it to verify
our physics simulator
so we can trust
the results there.
And we're now hard at work at
building our next prototype.
And you can see the
first rod of it.
It's going to be
a larger system.
It's going to have
12 actuators overall
and should be capable of a
lot more interesting motion.
And we'll have to iterate
beyond that a few more times
before we get to a
final system, but we're
moving from crazy
ideas to hard reality
here, one step at a time.
Another direction that we
have been exploring-- that
was one major thrust.
Another direction
we've been exploring
is really looking at
the spine because that's
the place that you can really
see this tensegrity property
the best in
mammalian physiology.
And so you can take
that spine model,
and we made a slightly
simplified version of it.
It's using tetrahedrons.
It gets the same topology on
how the different modules move
relative to each
other and how you
can get them to spread apart
from tensing up the strings.
And so we've started
to use that just
to explore, how do
we get it to move.
How could we get
this type of system
to go over different terrains,
kind of like a snake,
but very flexibly, instead of
having, again, rigid motors
at all the hinges like you do
in a traditional robotic snake.
And we found it's
really compelling.
And the story on this
one is going to really--
you'll really see some
interesting aspects of it
when we get to
the controls part.
And in this one, too, we've also
been working on some hardware
prototypes, both two
different hardware
prototypes of the snake robot.
And this is another one inspired
by that same tetrahedral
approach, but it's designed
for climbing vertically
up pipes and shafts and
going around corners.
And so there are some
really neat applications
that are hopefully going
to come out of that,
enabling going through
really rough terrain
or stemming up cliff sides and
complex approaches like that.
But what we really
find, though, is
that-- you're seeing
all those hardware
prototypes and the
directions we're going,
but the real challenge is how
do you control these things.
These systems, one reason why
people haven't been building
robots off of this principle is
because they are oscillatory.
They're structurally non-linear.
Any one element might have a
nice, purely linear application
of tension or compression
to it, but when
you look at the
overall structure,
it's very confusing
and very non-intuitive
as to how it's going to behave.
When you're going to push on
it, how is it going to deform?
How do you engineer
these things,
and how do you control them?
Again, they're
inherently oscillatory,
and most times,
controls engineers
are trying to do everything
they can to stay away
from oscillatory
regimes of structures.
You want nice, linear,
simple behaviors.
And we're purposely
jumping into the deep end
here and saying, actually, what
can we do with oscillation?
What are the advantages of
having an oscillatory system?
What are the advantages of
having a compliant system,
and how can we use that to our
benefit when controlling them?
And so we're having to
start from the ground up
and figure out what are
the right engineering
tools, because your standard
forward and inverse kinematics
approaches don't work.
Your standard path
planning and motion
planning technologies
that have been built up
over the last 20
or 30 years, they
don't apply easily
to these systems.
So to that end, we are
going to once again dive
into a little bit of
biology and neuroscience
and see what we find there.
The first rough cut, and
there subtleties here
that I'm skipping over grossly.
But the rough cut is
to realize that there
is a big difference between
what happens in your brain
and what happens in your spine.
In the brain, one of
the things that you find
is that that's where all
of your 3D sensors are.
Your eyes are there.
Your ears, which tell you about
your relationship to gravity.
They hear things out
there in the world.
You can map with them.
The brain has a lot of
activity in developing your 3D
model of the world and figuring
out where you want to move
and even why you
want to move there.
You might not realize it, but
those things of like, well,
do I want to go to McDonald's
or to the really good cafeteria
around the corner
that has organic food?
That's still-- that decision
is a choice about where
you're going to move next.

Far more of what you do
with your brain is actually
concerned about why you want to
go somewhere and what motions
you're going to execute next.
And so that's going on.
And what's
interesting, though, is
that there's a lot
of evidence that we
don't do a lot of detailed
motion planning in our brain.
The output of the motor
cortex is characterized
by some folks as a force vector.
It's steering.
It's giving sort of high level
steering commands to your body,
to your spine.
But you're not
planning in your brain
exactly how far you're going
to reach out to touch this.
Because our sensors
are too noisy,
and we get too much
error in that respect.
It's in your spine that
all of that sort of work
is being closed.
You actually see nice little
closed loop control loops
between sensors, such as your
muscle spindles, which tell you
sort of length and velocity and
position change of the muscles,
and your Golgi tendon
organs, which are essentially
strain gauges.
And those are some of the
sensors that are all spread out
through the fascia, along the
lines of force transmission.
Those guys are
closed loop directly
with motor control neurons in
the spine that directly control
the muscles that those
sensors are associated with.
Now, information propagates up
to the brain, too, but slowly.
Neurons are actually
shockingly slow.
And by the time you've
stepped on something
and felt it, by the time that
signal reaches your brain,
your body has already reacted.
So it's very counterintuitive.
So this is where we
close the control loop
on how do we actually contact
stuff and how do we move
and really touch the world.
The challenge is, there's
not been too much research
into the details of how this
works because it turns out
to be very difficult
to get probes
and sensors into people's spines
while they're awake and moving
without paralyzing them.
You can actually
get into the brain
easier than you can
get into the spine.
The spine is more
fundamental to what we do.
It really evolved
before all of this did.
So one way you can
start to decipher this
is to remove the
brain and see what
capabilities you still have.
And you've all heard
about a chicken
running around with
its head cut off.
It's real.
It happens.
And I've witnessed it.
And what happens there is
the chicken runs randomly.
It's lost its directionality.
It's lost its
intentional movement.
But it's still running.
It's balancing on two legs
and coordinating hundreds
of muscles, and that takes a
high degree of coordination
to occur.
So where is that
coordination coming from?
It's no longer the brain.
It's in the spine.
But the spine is interesting.
It's a modular, segmented,
decentralized system.
There's no known nexus of
control or hierarchical control
in the spine.
So where does that
coordination come from,
is going to be a question
we're asking here for a moment.
They've also done this in
a more scientific manner,
rather than just whacking
heads off chickens,
and they did this some time
ago, where they would actually
sever the spinal cord
right below the brain stem
or above the brain stem
in different locations,
keep the animal alive,
and then do tests
on it in terms of how
it can move and behave.
And they find that
the animals can
stand without the
brain involved.
You can push on them, and
they will maintain balance,
if the inner ear
is still involved.
You can put them on tilt tables
and different things like that.
And I'm going to
show you a video next
that some people
find disturbing.
It's a cat to which
this has been done.
They don't do this
research anymore.
But since it was done, we
might as well learn from it.
And so this cat is
going on this treadmill.
As that treadmill
speeds up, you're
going to see the cat go through
multiple different gait styles.
It's going to go from
a walking to a trotting
to a galloping gait.
And all this is done
without the brain
being involved whatsoever.
So this is all spinally
modulated, all reactive
to the environment.
So again, a high degree of
coordination and complex motion
primitives and
behaviors coming out
of a decentralized,
modular system.
So how does that happen?
We're going to start
with a quick experiment,
and you guys are going
to be involved in this.
I'd like you all to
try to clap together.
I'm not going to lead it.
You're going to
do it on your own.
Just see if you can come into
a nice, synchronous clapping.
[CLAPPING]
VYTAS SUNSPIRAL: All right.
Pretty easy to do, actually.
No one was directing
that, though.
So that's that same quality
that we find, actually,
all throughout nature.
That this gets used heavily.
And it's this idea that
coupled oscillators
are able to synchronize.
And this turns out--
there's a really good book
by Stephen Strogatz.
He's a mathematician who
explored this in depth.
And it's a fun, easy read.
And it'll blow your mind
because it turns out,
this is a mathematical
quality that's
independent of how
it's implemented.
It can be physical oscillators.
So if you put a bunch of
metronomes on a table,
the vibration of those
metronomes through the surface
of the table will eventually
put them all into sync,
and they will all
coordinate with themselves.
No intelligence
required whatsoever.
You find the same thing in a
lot of other natural systems.
You see it in fireflies that
are able to all flash in unison.
Again, there's no
king or queen firefly.
They don't have a
centralized clock.
Yet they're all coordinated.
And if you dive
into the science,
you find it in ants and animals
and how humans even behave,
and we'll keep coming
back to that theme.
So it turns out it's
pretty easy to analyze.
This is a synthetic
version of the fireflies.
Each pixel is an oscillator.
At the top of its oscillation
cycle, it flashes.
And it is able to witness
the pixels right next to it.
Not the whole global field,
just the ones right next to it.
And when they flash, each one
will modify its timing ever
so slightly.
And so just by having
a very simple set
of rules like that, if you let
that system run for a while,
it'll eventually
coordinate and synchronize.
And so this is forms
of emergent order.
And it's not
surprising that nature
is building on these principles
very heavily because,
how do we get coordinated?
How do we create
order in our world?
It turns out you don't
need a top-down authority
to create order.
It can emerge from
the bottom up.
And so if you start playing
with these principles,
if you design with oscillation
and synchronization
at the heart of
your systems, you
are enabling yourself to
get a free passive property.
You can get
coordination for free,
rather than having to have
really complex, really
fast control groups that
are looking at timing
and communicating and trying to
get everything to synchronize.
This becomes a passive
quality, and that's awesome.
I like things that
come for free.
And talking about this idea
of rhythm in oscillation
being at the heart
of life, you in fact
find that if you
look at what we do,
as we, just as humans,
move in the world,
almost everything
we do is rhythmic.
Talking is rhythmic.
Even the sounds of individual
letters is a frequency.
It's a rhythm.
There's a cadence to talk.
There's a cadence and a rhythm
to chewing and to eating
and to movement and dancing.
Walking is very rhythmic.
And all the way down, of
course, at the center of it all,
our heartbeat is
a core rhythm that
is driving everything we do.
And you might think,
OK, that's all great.
But I can do very
arrhythmic things.
I can put a finger right
there and not move.
But even that turned out
to be a rhythmic action.
And you guys get to try this.
Because you breathe, because
your heart and your breath
are always synced to each other,
and because you are a breathing
person, everything
you do is rhythmic.
So try this.
Go stick a finger out,
and stick it at something.
Don't rest it on
there, but just try
to hold it pointing
directly at something.
And now take some
really deep breaths.
Fill your chest and
just deep breaths.
So this is just to accentuate,
to make it more obvious.
You might notice that your
whole upper body starts
moving as you're breathing.
And this is happening
all the time.
We're just making it more
obvious in the moment.
And that means that in order
to hold this finger still,
these muscles have to be
firing in a rhythmic manner
to counteract the
fundamental motion that's
in your body at all times.
And so even when you try to
stay still, you're still moving.
You just don't think about it.
It happens very automatically.

Modern neuroscience is
looking very heavily
at neurons as oscillators.
A lot of the computer
science field
thinks very heavily about
artificial neural networks
and information
propagation through the use
of neural networks.
But the neuroscientists
are really
focused on neurons as
oscillators, frequency systems
with feedback loops, and
how do they oscillate,
and how do they synchronize.
And one well known researcher
makes the bold claim
that the brain is primarily
concerned with rhythm, timing,
and temporal prediction.
And of course, this makes
sense because it's not just us
that's rhythmic.
The whole natural
world is rhythmic.
Day and light cycles,
other animals, everything
is rhythmic.
And so if you want to
be successful at life,
you want to be able to predict
other rhythms around you.
And if you can get
your own control system
to synchronize
with those rhythms
so that you can make
those predictions,
you will navigate
the world better than
if you are trying to use
a rule-based approach.
Now besides just looking
at neurons themselves,
individually, as
oscillators, then you also
find there's these networks
called central pattern
generators, where you get
a number of little neurons
mutually connected to each other
with inhibition and excitation
connections.
And those connections,
if they're balanced--
and it turns out to look a lot
like a tensegrity structure,
compression and tension-- if you
get a good, appropriate balance
of them, you get
a system that is
able to self-generate a rhythm.
With absolutely no inputs,
they will generate rhythms
on their own.
And you find these all
throughout the spine
and all throughout the brain.
They're most clearly associated
with controlled motion,
in terms of the origins.
And they help create
cyclic behaviors of motion,
again, like to walk.
Locomotion is very, very
cyclic and rhythmic.
And networks of these CPGs
have an interesting property,
that they're very
tolerant of perturbations.
If you're walking on nice,
flat ground, that's great.
And then if you step
on a rock, you're
disrupting that control
sequence, yet these controllers
are very adaptive to that
type of perturbation.
And I think it's, in fact,
a very interesting way
that they're adaptive
because it matches very
similar the way that the
tensegrity structures are
adaptive to the physical
forces they experience.
Again, you're getting
this compliance
in the physical
structure, and now we're
starting to talk about seeing
this compliance in this control
network.
And these controllers,
as I mentioned earlier,
the tensegrity
structures themselves
are all oscillatory
and vibratory,
which enables you to
get a synchronization
between the controller and
the physical structure.
So you start seeing how
these pieces can all
start relating to each other.

And so going back to that snake
that I showed you earlier,
the spine inspired snake, we
built some control networks
for it out of central pattern
generators, little oscillators
for each string that were able
to interact with each other,
and they can influence each
other in terms of their timing.
And so you get this really
nice coordination capability
out of them.
And we showed, then,
that this robot,
with no modeling
of the environment,
no external sensors
looking and making
a 3D model of the
environment, just purely
based on the internal
perception of how much tension
is in each spring, is
able to traverse and move
through a wide variety
of different terrains.
And so I think that's a very
compelling approach to looking
at how do you coordinate motion
in a very complex system.
This is a very high
degree of freedom robot.
There's 12 segments in this
one, with at least six strings
per segment.
You know that's a huge
control structure,
and it would be very challenging
for traditional control
approaches.
Yet instead, the
CPG model allows
us to get a very nice
reduction in the control space
here because the network itself
manages all the details of how
these parts coordinate
with each other.
And it's at a high level.
All you need to do is get some
very high level direction.
For instance, to
get over this wall,
you saw the robot
initially was reared up.
And that was one high
level controller saying,
hey, I want to just increase
the tension on the top string
to lift up the robot.
And the rest of it
just settled itself
out in terms of how
the parts coordinated.
You didn't have to do inverse
kinematics or the mathematics
to figure out how each
component related to the other.
And same thing with the turning.
It's a very simple control
signal to enable that turning.
I didn't have to reason
about the entire structure.
That control network
does that for us.
So we've also been applying
some of these control theories
to our rolling
robot that we want
to use for exploring
other planets.
We've used both
evolutionary algorithms
to explore different
ways of rolling,
and we've also used the CPGs,
the Central Pattern Generators.
They've been successful
in different ways
and able to, again,
traverse a wide variety
of different terrains.
And what's really
neat about this
is there's a whole new
world of controls research
to be done for these
soft, compliant systems.
By no means would I say
that we've managed it all.
Now this is fun here, actually.
This is an example
of what happens
when you use the evolutionary
algorithms to figure out
how to actually give these
robots directionality.
A lot of what we've been
talking about so far
has been just reactive controls.
But that, where you
saw the four of them
all chasing little boxes,
that was a form of saying, OK,
go to the box.
Give it a direction vector, and
it will go in that direction.
And so we could
actually get it to be
steerable, which is
an important thing,
to actually have a
usable, functional robot.
So there's more stuff
going on the lab.
We're researching actuation
techniques because, of course,
we're, again, outside the norm
of engineering approaches,
so there's all sorts
of challenges there
and interesting new ways
to build these systems.
But that gives you
a quick overview
of what we're doing in the
lab and then finally brings us
back around to this
question of what
have we learned from all of
this about human intelligence.
And this is where we get
purely philosophical.
But my key insight
that I think is
worth thinking about is,
as computer scientists,
we tend to think of
process-oriented information
processing approaches to
computation and reasoning.
But if it turns out that the
neurons and the neuroscience
in our bodies is
founded on oscillators,
oscillatory neurons, and
how things synchronize
with each other,
what does that mean?
What does that mean about
a computational system
where synchronization is at
the heart, not binary logic
or tertiary logic or whatever
else you want to come up with?
If the heart of the computation
system is synchronization,
that explains some
interesting things
that humans are very good at
but our AI and computer science
algorithms are challenged by,
such as pattern recognition
or categorization.
These are things that
a bunch of oscillators
that can use this
property of emergent order
would get for free, almost.
If you get a little bit
of resonance over here
and a little bit of resonance
over there, and suddenly,
you're like, oh yeah, of course.
Those things go together, even
though they're quite different.
But you see the
relationships between them.
And that is interesting
because that's also
what we do as humans.
Things that we really focus
on, we focus on relationships.
We focus on community.
We focus on network, how
do we relate to others.
It's amazing, in fact,
that we can do math.
That's surprising.
That part's not obvious
when you look at our brains.
Where is that we came up
with the ability to do math?
That's very neat.
But we do these other
parts really well.
You move to a new location.
You start hanging out
with some new friends.
A few years go by.
Next thing you know,
you've picked up
the linguistic accents
of the people around you.
You start dressing like them.
We synchronize to each
other as communities.
That's part of what defines
community, a lot of times,
is a shared identity.
We do this without
even thinking about it.
And so these are properties
that I think maybe
are stemming from fundamental
questions of how do we move.
And that has a big
implication for a lot
of what we do in
computer science today.
If you are looking
at problems of how
do you categorize information,
how do you create sets or order
or meaning out of all this
human-generated information
that we see on the web,
some of that, our skill,
is maybe coming from
a very different way
than we are approaching it from
a computational perspective.
And I haven't dived
down this path,
but maybe there are new
and interesting ways
to achieve that type
of comprehension.
And so that's the philosophy.
And then I just want
to make a final thanks.
I clearly, having done
research across eight
different technical fields,
I didn't do it all myself.
There's been a huge team
of students and interns
from around the world
working in our lab.
Two of them here, Jonathan
and Ken, right now,
and also Terry Fong has
given an amazing amount
of really great support to
keeping this effort going.
So thank you very much.
That's it.
[APPLAUSE]
VYTAS SUNSPIRAL: 44 minutes?
All right.
So we have a few
minutes for questions.
Yeah.
AUDIENCE: How does the
locomotion efficiency
of the tensegrity robots compare
to that of wheeled rovers?
VYTAS SUNSPIRAL: Right.
That's a good question,
and one that we're still
working on getting--
we're really
going to find out when we get
some good physical prototypes
in place.
But one way to think about
it, especially the rolling one
that we're working on, it's
essentially one big wheel.
And you can almost look at it
as a three-dimensional bicycle
tire, right,
because you actually
have all the cables
going through the middle.
And so it's a nice, big, stable
wheel that you can control.
I think it may be
fairly efficient.
One of the tricks is
the timing control--
and again, why the oscillation
really is helpful--
the timing control to
make sure that you're not
fighting each other.
Your different cables don't
have to fight each other.
One is releasing while
the other one is engaging.
And then that helps get you
that cyclic rolling behavior.
We have some initial
results out of the simulator
that showed that energy
consumption was pretty low.
But still evolving that
question right now.

Yes.
AUDIENCE: Where are
your actuators located?
VYTAS SUNSPIRAL: Right.
And this is the perfect question
of, OK, great properties.
Now how do we actually
build these things?
And that's what
we're discovering.
So let's see here.
Why don't I go back to a
picture of one so you can see.
This one.
Right.
So in the new one
that we're building,
the actuators are mounted
in these end caps.
So they're internal
there, and they
have a spool that the cables
are being wound up on and off.
And then there's also some
springs internal in the rods
to give it a little
extra compliance.
And so this is a
good initial start.
It's not, I don't think,
the end of the road, though.
What I really want is
electrically active,
elastic polymers and things
like that, that we can control.
And some of that
stuff's out there,
and we're building
some collaborations
with folks who might be
able to help with some
of that materials
science research
to really get to
materials that are more
like human and animal muscles.
But that is an open
area of research.
There isn't a good synthetic
artificial muscle right now.
So this is what we're
starting, because that's
the technology
that's accessible.
But I think down the road, we'll
be switching it out, I hope,
eventually.
AUDIENCE: Because [INAUDIBLE]
for example, for when
you [INAUDIBLE].
So actually it should be
pretty powerful to hold
those extensions
[INAUDIBLE] when you land.
VYTAS SUNSPIRAL: Yeah.
So that's why we had that
one first test we showed you
where we dropped a
simple prototype.
And it had basic
DC motors in there.
And we had the motors
off when it landed.
And it survived the
impact, and then they
were able run afterwards.
AUDIENCE: How do
you compare weight
of the motors versus the
weight of payload for example?
VYTAS SUNSPIRAL: The target
that were running towards
is to have a payload,
like on a full system
design would have a
payload of 70 kilograms.
And then the outer structure,
the rods and the motors,
would be about 30 kilograms.
AUDIENCE: How is that
comparable, for example,
to use airbag?
VYTAS SUNSPIRAL: Yeah.
In our phase one study that
we completed last year,
we found that we
believe we'll be
able to get what we call kind
of a science instrument mass
ratio.
So the core idea of
going to another planet
is you want to deliver
scientific instruments
to go do research with.
That's what matters.
That's the payload
that really matters.
Everything else is all about
getting the instruments there.
And so if you compare the
mass of your core scientific
instruments to what's
the mass that you
put into orbit around
this other planet--
so that includes landing systems
and heat shields and mobility
systems and all that-- we,
in our initial estimates,
are coming up with--
I think it was
about a 50% ratio of scientific
instruments to total mass.
And we found that MSL, I think,
had about a 20 or 22% ratio.
MRR had a 17 or 18% ratio.
If you go back to Pathfinder,
it had like a 1% ratio.
It was all mass and
very little science.
So that is our
fundamental metric
that we think is really
valuable here, that you actually
are saving mass
and making a more
efficient system
in the long run.
And I would hazard to
say that if this works,
and even if, at the end of the
day, our estimates are off,
and you end up with an
equal amount of mass
as you could with a
traditional system,
one of the things
that you still gain
is that this is now
a robust system that
can handle large impacts.
Whereas MSL, you wouldn't want
to have it fall off a cliff,
whereas this one might
be able to and survive.
And so that is also,
in and of itself,
a very valuable property.
That's an excellent
question because we've
had to think hard
about that one too.
Yeah.
AUDIENCE: How large
would a robot like this
be if it's carrying a
70-kilogram payload?
VYTAS SUNSPIRAL:
So that goes back
to-- that's actually
interesting.
That goes back to this
chart where-- I'm one off.
There.
Obviously, the size of the
payload will have some impact.
But the real key driver of
size is your stroke distance,
how much room you
have for that payload
to decelerate within the
structure when you're landing.
And so obviously,
a bigger payload
eats up some of that
stroke distance.
But 70 kilograms, if you're
packing it full of batteries
and scientific instruments,
is not necessarily
that big of a space.
So ignoring the actual dimension
of that central payload
and just looking at
rods and distance
to land, if you wanted to,
say, keep your instruments
from experiencing more
than 21 Gs of deceleration,
you could do that with
the 1.5 meter rod.
If you wanted more
sensitive instruments,
and you wanted to
keep it under 14 Gs,
go to a 2 and 1/2 meter rod.
The mass ends up playing
into the design criteria
where if you had the
same size everything,
and you made your central
payload more massive,
you would want to use stronger
springs to absorb the impact.
And so, as I was kind
of hinting at earlier,
it gives you a
lot of opportunity
to play with the engineering as
to how you actually build this
then.
Yes, Matt?
AUDIENCE: So some of the
other most interesting work
in robotics right
now is going on
with other biologically
inspired models.
So what do you think
this has in common
and has different from things
like making a robot that
moves like a big
dog, for example?
VYTAS SUNSPIRAL: Right.
So there is a lot
that's related to that.
That's BigDog and R2 up on the
space station and other places
like that.
What you see there
is they've all
started to add compliance to
their joints and to the motors.
They're using a series
of elastic actuators
or hydraulic actuators, systems
that can absorb and comply
to the environment.
And that's really
the indicator is
that that's a very key property.
And so this approach is similar
in that it's saying compliance
is at the heart of this.
So instead of just looking at
the actuators being compliant,
what if we look at
the whole structure
and giving compliance
to that, so that it now
is an even more completely
adaptable system that
can morph and adapt to
the things it encounters.
And so the challenge
is, of course,
you're making a deep
technology shift,
and so that puts us back
down at the beginning.
So are we able yet to do things
that are comparable to BigDog?
No.
That is an amazing
modern machine
that's using the cutting edge
of the current thrust of design
approaches.
How will these
approaches compete
with each other in 10 years?
Well, I hope this one will be
more effective because it will
be a more robust system
and lighter weight.
BigDog is an amazingly
energy-hungry system.
They have a whole diesel
generator on there
to get that thing to move
because they have to generate
a lot of power in the
approaches that they're going.
I think that this
type of approach
may be more energy-efficient
in the long run.
We'll see.
With continued funding
and continued research,
I'll have an answer
for you soon.

Anything else?
AUDIENCE: If NASA
shut down tomorrow,
and you had to find someone
else to fund your research,
and it wasn't
interplanetary exploration,
what application would you
apply mobile tensegrity to?
VYTAS SUNSPIRAL: That is
a fascinating question,
one I should think
about every day.

So one place is to go talk
to, obviously, the people who
fund most of robotics
research in America, which
is the various military
funding agencies.
And that's one place, ONR and
DARPA and folks like that.
That's sort of an
obvious place to go.
I think what my personal
passion is, is to bring on board
more collaboration with folks.
And I know who some of the
people might be eventually.
But collaboration
with folks who are
doing the physiology research
into these structures
and start working with them,
using the robotics development
as a foil, as a mirror, to
parallel what they're looking
at in the physiology
and medical research
and really trying
to work together
to collaborate to
say, hey, let's try
to get a better understanding
of how our bodies work.
Because some of this
is really significant.
If the way our
spines work really
is at least partially or
more so than traditionally
thought of about
moving the forces
through the tensile network,
that changes everything
about how you do spine surgery,
how you even advise people
how to maintain a healthy
spine, and what people should be
doing, good ergonomics
changes, when
you think about all
these approaches.
So I'd love to be
diving into that
because that's actually
where the impact is really
going to be.
Robots are good technology.
We're going to
get better robots.
That's cool.
But the biggest
difference is going
to happen in terms of how
it helps us understand
ourselves and have better lives
that are freer of pain and more
graceful aging because we
understand how we work,
and we understand intelligence.
In the long run, a lot
of this understanding
of the physical
system is, again,
my core idea is to
understand how we think,
how our intelligence works.
So I would love to be
working with organizations
that want to take
some of these insights
into oscillatory
rhythmic systems
and ask the question of, how
does this apply to modern AI.
How do we take this
just from locomotion
and start thinking
about feedback systems?
Like Matt and I
were just talking
right before the talk,
someone like Google,
you guys essentially exist
as a robot in the internet.
You have sensors.
You find out what's
happening in the environment.
You can change things.
You can reason about it.
You can make change
that propagates back out
into the internet, in
terms of how people move
through your search
engines and whatnot.
And so you are a robot.
You're changing the environment.
It's a closed loop
feedback system.
So would thinking about
rhythmic oscillatory systems
play into that?
Is there a temporal quality
to how a place like this
engages with the internet?
And is there an advantage to
some of these thought patterns?
I haven't gone down
that direction yet,
but if there were
funding, I'd be happy to.

MATT: Thank you all
for coming today.
Thank you, Vytas,
for the [INAUDIBLE].
VYTAS SUNSPIRAL: You're welcome.
