Tabitha's here today dr. Peter Marie
rust who is currently a reader in
molecular informatics of hammers in
Cambridge and senior research fellow
Churchill College dr. Murray rust is the
creator of CML chemical markup language
and
tricity on semantics camberwell google
NCI and other matches okay thanks very
much indeed Leslie and I'm delighted to
be here I just to say that there is now
here is that about a month six six weeks
ago you held a google foo camp with
nature and o'reilly we've been working
very closely with tim mohan a at nature
and london timmo was one of the
organizers of that and he invited me and
unfortunately I had a clash so my
colleague peter corbett went in said
i'll be showing you some of people's
work really excited to be here because
i've been in the sort of information
game for 30 40 years something like that
I'm a chemist by background but I really
feel the time has come when the world is
going to explode with information so
this is a major power house that's
driving it's a nun looking here two ways
that we might jointly take this forward
so I've not come with any preconceptions
but I do believe that the combination of
Google technology with the stuff that
we've been developing in chemistry has
got enormous power I think it can
literally change the face of chemical
information i can just introduced here
Steve Heller steve is from NIST and is
the Guru of in chi and i'll be
explaining inch in a minute so anyway
first of all when i give presentations I
used to give presentations with HTML
slides here I hate PowerPoint for
various reasons it destroys information
it destroys brains and so I've now over
the last few days taken to writing a
blog so my slides and my message will
increasingly be found on the block so if
you put Peter Mary Russell and blog into
the web you'll find it so one of the
things
things I've been interested in here you
can see I'm interested in open data the
idea that those basic scientific data
which belongs to the human race and that
is things like the melting point of
compounds genome data things of that
sort and then that cannot be copyrighted
or own warpath here for example the
question of scholarly publishing and one
of the key things i'll be looking at is
scholarly publishing we used to read
journals now the publisher so you have
access to a database this has changed
the way we publish information I think
for the poorer because it means that we
no longer have that possession of the
information that we used to have and
then not only do I hate powerpoint i
hate PDF PDF is one of the greatest
destroyers of information developed in
the scientific arena and mike k of an
xslt and sex and it came up with this
lovely and statement down here if i can
find it where is it oh yes could you
tell me how we convert PDF into xml mike
says converting PDF take some bows like
converting hamburgers into cows so you
know for good nick can we get away from
PDF and go to something semantic so my
slides are semantic and you'll find most
of them in the block but you'll also
find that i give a number of demos here
and those demos are not easy to
distribute we're looking at ways to
distribute the demos but basically i'll
be doing these from bookmarks here and
so forth so the first thing I'm going to
do while I'm talking is then going to
give you a demonstration of jamo because
this epitomizes much of what I'm going
to be talking about now j mol is the
leading molecular visualization tool
along with pi mall both of these are
open source and this is not a movie this
is actually a real
and live scientific application this is
caffeine and this is being driven by a
script but I can do that I can move it
around so it's a live living object and
that's been transmitted from the website
into the outlet so we have the power to
transmit semantically rich information
and this can be coming down in chemical
markup language so it's fully chemical
markup language aware and as you will
see there are many many different things
it can do its computing these pictures
on the flyer they're not pre-prepared
it's computed those surfaces within the
outlet and the guy who wrote jay mohr
Bob Hansen is an absolute genius he
doesn't have research students because
he's at a liberal arts college and st.
Olaf in Minnesota and he does this by
himself and this is one of the great
things about the open source and
movement that with the internet we can
build virtual communities so when the
movie is finished and I think I just
want you to look at it and say wow
because it is just wonderful and there
is the sort of thing that we should be
transmitting over the web and this is
the sort of thing also that we should be
able to search for we should be able to
query these things in the language that
the scientists use them so those were
proteins and we ought to be able to say
does the protein have a helix in here's
the well-known double helix of DNA we
might want to say let's search for all
double helical molecules on the web and
that's the way that I want to see
scientific information going that you
simply use natural language put it into
google and off you go now I believe that
chemistry is the best subject almost in
the whole world to do that because it's
very well understood it's been around
for 150 years chemical information is a
mature subject we know how to do it and
if we get the right protocols the right
semantics then we can do it and I'm
going to show you that in
it's here so I think it I was a bit more
of it there's lots of fun here but you
can down there you can do this at home
it's safe right okay and fun so I'm now
going to go on to talk about how we put
this together now open source I am
completely committed to open source but
open cells is more or less either a
dirty word in chemistry or I've seen as
a Mickey Mouse subject so anybody
involved in it is seen as off the wall
you know what are these guys barking at
if it doesn't cost money come in that's
the sort of thing that we have to fight
against and I'll talk a little bit about
why i think the economics of this has
been distorted by the pharmaceutical I
used to work in the pharmaceutical
industry so i can make comments like
that but i think the pharmaceutical
industry it has created an artificial
market for software which actually is
now contra dumped it turned out that
there are some heroes here who have
developed software which j.mull is one
and there are a number of other very
competently put together ones and this
has been a real labor of love because
these are built as toolkits they use
modern methods of object-oriented design
of a web integrate ability and so forth
and at the very end I'm going to show
you something called bio clips but
basically two years ago at the american
chemical society meeting we got together
under the blue obelisk in horton plaza
san diego and went out for a meal so
that was how the blue obelisk was born
there's a little bit of fun then but now
we believe that in fact people starting
to take us seriously so we had a meeting
last night and we had a blue obelisk
awards they went to Christophe Steinbeck
who developed an cdk and Jeff Hutchison
who developed open Babel when I say
developed there are the current gurus of
this there's a sort of guru
successorship in this which which passes
down so they are responsible for these
are real labors of love because building
too
it's at the best of times isn't fun
there's blood on the floor at midnight
as I call it and they've done it with I
would say a mixture of apathy and
antagonism from the community so what do
we now have right I'm going to show you
you will know all about mashups and so
on but and I just wanted to show you a
very simple mashup I've been a very
exciting one which is nothing to do with
chemistry which was done by some geeks
that we meet with in Cambridge and these
people want to liberate and local
information so they built this mashup
having said that oh wait a minute I know
what the problem is yeah the problem is
that i got to the acs meeting i said
could we could i have an internet
connection they said yes and when I
turned up on the day well I said well no
you couldn't we can't manage an internet
connection this was in san francisco
which you would thought knew about the
internet but it didn't so i had to I had
to sort of put all my slides on HTML so
I just wanted to show you this it's a
very simple mashup google maps here
mashed on to wikipedia so that if you go
to one of these and i have no idea what
it is it uses a google api to get the
google map and it uses a wikipedia api
to go into the article and so you can
find anywhere in the world what are the
Wikipedia articles of interest in that
area so that I think is a really very
clever idea and the developer said that
he would be offended if I said it took
more than three days to develop so what
you've got is something which is mashed
on top of two different data sources and
i'm going to show you that with google
in chi which i think is does exactly the
same sort of thing google doesn't know
that we're doing google in chi well it
does now of you
because I'm telling you that right and
pubchem doesn't know we're doing google
in chi but both of those we access
through their api's right so just before
I do that I'm just going to a little
tikki stuff are you happy for a little
bit of techie stuff right okay and right
so one of the problems we have that
something actually got up at the meeting
and said look in chemical informatics we
have all these different programs they
don't speak to each other but there's
nothing we can do about it this was one
of the other the pharma companies or MDL
or some somebody like that I mean really
we've got all this appalling mess of non
interpreting programs and we're just
going to accept it because that's the
way God designed information so what we
have is if we try and do anything in
chemical information we end up with a
human having to cut and paste or type up
or redraw or something at every stage in
the process and it's about time it
stopped so and hinduja / i'll show you
Henry because he exists and Henry and I
are symbiosis so I'll go to Wikipedia
for him because Henry's got a Wikipedia
entry and so here he comes somewhere or
other yeah a picture of Henry those
Henry right professor to Imperial
College and he put me into Wikipedia as
well and I so we're both in there and
that's the way we can communicate with
people so keep the markup language does
all the mainstream parts of chemistry
molecules reactions computational
chemistry spectra and crystallography so
it's a sort of eighty percent solution
for chemistry we've been at it about 11
years and the chemists have not yet
taken it seriously everybody outside
chemistry believes it's an established
fact so that's a but that is changing it
is beginning to get taken seriously
mystery it's only a game in town anyway
so we first of all developed it as a
sort of object oriented architecture and
the idea was to use XML schema for
inheritance but I think xml schema is
one of the most awful things designed
and it has convinced me that the way
forward is ultra light weight and
information design so we use XSL schema
for the data types but we don't use it
for any sort of inheritance so CML
consists of something that looks like
this so there's a whole lot of different
things here each of these are XML
elements in the schema and how many of
you have done some chemistry in your
life one okay right well you might I
mean these are not too hairy are they I
mean they're they're ordinary names that
means something okay and what you'll see
is that this lot is chemistry but this
stuff over here is general physical
science so what we've had to do is
actually invent a language not just for
chemistry but for physical science in
general and that is a key part of CML it
is actually very easily adaptable to a
whole range of physics and engineering
another STM areas and we of course very
happy to share it with people and the
key technology that we use is a very
lightweight dictionary so if we have
something like the compound melted at
such and so you don't develop a markup
element called compound or melting point
or whatever you use a generic tool here
at scalar it has a data type which in
this case is an x SD float and then it
links to two things it links here to a
dictionary which tells you that it's a
melting point and it will give you a
definition in there
and it will link to unix dictionary so
one of the key things is this idea of
separating the primary markup into links
to dictionaries and I think this is the
scientific equivalent of micro formats
one of the great things is anybody can
make this up and it doesn't break it
because the dictionaries are all
namespace so we would expect you know
hundreds of dictionaries in science but
we would expect them to start a kneeling
we would expect authority to say well
this is a dictionary you should point to
and gradually you would end up with a
consensus in the community of the
dictionaries that you should be using
it's the volume of this right at the
back good okay right so we then see that
we can actually build the whole process
of workflow in science and in chemistry
on XML and we've done this so we're able
to take things at the left hand side
which might come out of a database or
they might and have been typed up or
they might come out of a journal and
they go into programs and they get
repurposed and ultimately they end up in
databases and we've done this on the
scale of having run a million separate
jobs using this technology and all right
some of them crashed but nevertheless
we're running at I would say a sort of
point point one percent failure rate
something of that sort it has to be
brought down but basically you can
automate this process whereas most
chemists are still cutting and pasting
as they go through this sort of process
so the sort of thing that we're looking
at then is where do we get the data from
so what comes in on the left hand side
and where do we put it to at the end
because one of the key things is that in
most science there is a lack of data
that you can feed into this and I'm
competing against something and I
winning
and right so where does this come from
well there are you can say okie work on
data in chemistry but the problem with
data in chemistry is that you can't get
hold of it it belongs to somebody and
they want that you have it so I don't
worry Leslie I can show them down come
on yeah I doesn't worry me none less
they start competing and so in data in
chemistry the tradition has been
somebody owns the data if you want to
know the ID of aspirin you have to pay
chemical abstracts two dollars so for
every compound you want to know what it
is you have to pay chemical abstracts
two dollars well you can get an
institutional deal but since you will be
looking at a lot of compounds it will
cost you an awful lot and my feeling is
that the formula of caffeine should be
free to the whole world it's been around
long enough so we have a problem with
the data so part of what we're trying to
do is liberate the data the other thing
is that we get this data in publication
so the primary place that scientific
data arrives from is scientific
publications now in some subjects like
let us say geophysics or astronomy you
often get a database as part of the
publication so go to look at parts of
the sky and then come back and put all
of that in a database but in chemistry
when people make molecules they do it on
a piecewise basis so that what you get
is what I call Micro publication let me
see if I've got that in here somewhere
or other
I thought I'd put it in yeah here we are
so what actually happens is here's the
chemists and they're making compounds
and they send off to a publisher and
these ones send it off to another
publisher and each set of compounds goes
into a different publication and there
are probably at least a million
compounds published a year and there's
no coordination between the publication
of these at all although the general
principles are extremely similar and
they've been known for a hundred years
so making compound is like cooking a
cake you have a recipe we took so much
of X we mix them together boiled them
and outcome is compound then we knew
what it was because we knew what its
color was in its melting point and it's
spectra so they're literally hundreds of
thousands of papers like that each year
but no coordination so up until recently
what we've had is we've had
organizations called abstractors who
have been typing all the slot up again
so there's a big industry in columbus
ohio in retyping the chemical literature
into chemical abstracts and the same in
bal stein in germany well they also
retype it on a competitive basis so in
my view this is not a sensible use of
human resources so imagine if we could
when we published a paper we could
actually publish it directly into a
database now we've got to tell people
that there's a chemical in it and that's
where the inch she starts to come in so
we will show you now how the ink she
works now imagine also that this these
papers were actually freely accessible
they're not at the moment because most
of these are closed access but if they
were freely accessible then you wouldn't
even need a database all you would need
is a search engine like Google and you
would say find me all the caffeine and
it would go and find you the caffeine so
what we're now going to do is show how
they ain't she makes that possible so
web google inching right
you joke know if that's not available
I'll kill them that looks to be a
problem at our end Andrew Kissel's
right okay well we'll come back to that
later and but that is what I have got
however and this I'm afraid does detract
from the magic but we do have it we do
have fun we've copied it somewhere other
but it is a pale and a pale imitation so
basically here's a molecule now Kimi's
can drill that molecule in different
ways and that's perfectly allowed there
are different reasons for that which we
weren't going to but one of those
actually the same molecular different
styles of drawing it to emphasize
different parts of the molecule and what
the ink she does is to say no matter how
you draw it there is a single string
here at the bottom which represents the
fundamental canonicalization of that
molecule so that this molecule generates
that string and that in chi string which
is overseen by the international union
of pure and applied chemistry and that's
what steve is involved in right has so
Steve's responsible for this and that
was published about 12 months ago and I
would say this is got enough momentum in
the community that it's now unstoppable
not everybody likes the idea because you
can see it impacts on the business of
the secondary aggregators so i'm going
to show you what you would have seen you
would have seen a chemist you'd have
seen a chemist draw a molecule like that
now i'll explain what happens this is a
normal drawing package for a chemical
and it may be that our server comes back
again or it's the middle of the night so
I'm a little bit worried and the chemist
will draw that and it would generate the
energy generated in chi on our surfer so
now you've got an inky string now what
the server does is then shoots that off
to the Google API now Google does not
know it's a chemical it doesn't know
anything it simply says here are some
characters please see if you've got them
in your index so Google Ling comes
back with these characters and says I've
found them in the following pages and we
know that they relate to that compound
so so I've got a little example here and
so we drew a molecule like that sent it
off to Google and within a second it
came back and it found the hits in our
database and because google had indexed
that i'm going to have one more try just
in case it was a temporary glitch
otherwise i will continue on
no and right so this is really a pity
because I mean I can explain it and I
have explained it but it's valuable to
show you actually working but what you
have to accept is that there is no
chemistry involved at the Google end and
all the one is doing is turning this
into this string sending it off to
Google now the reason it is pre indexed
is because the service at the other end
understanding she thinks in she's a good
idea and has said i'm going to add
inches to our data so what I'm now going
to show you is a resource that does that
and this resource is called pubchem and
it was started just over a year ago and
it is part of the nih's national side
molecular libraries roadmap so here it
is a database of chemical molecules and
and so forth the american chemical
society have tried to get the US
Congress to restrict the operation
because they claim it competes with
chemical abstracts service so you can
see the tension here what we're going to
do is we're now going to go to pubchem
should be the link should be given at
the bottom pubchem homepage and then
we're going to search for it so we'll
search for molecule will search for
caffeine
oh i think i think it i think i mistyped
it
right so here's caffeine and if you
click on this entry here it comes up
larger there's caffeine and you can see
there are not so exciting links from
caffeine so what you're starting to get
here is a resource which is part of the
whole hyper domain of bioscience here
and there's lots of information on it
and then down here towards the bottom
you'll see the in chi here so there's in
chi for caffeine and that would have
been indexed by google if the Google
index had got here I think it doesn't
and that's one thing I want to talk to
you about because this is a CGI does
Google index cgi so does it skip them
okay don't worry right so that we
believe it probably isn't index but if
it was indexed then the system would
find that okay so
I now want to move on having talked
about that too how we can look at
journals now journals are in chemistry
as I say do not allow you to read or
index their content without a
subscription but when i'm showing here
is the ability to read the data
associated with the journal so some of
the journals will publish the data and
that data is freely accessible and what
you're seeing here is completely
constructed by a robot reading a journal
and taking all the data out of it and
adding the value to that journal so this
journal consists of several hundred
crystal structures and none of this
information as portrayed here was
actually in the original data file is
all being transformed and so for so here
is a molecule and here you can see the
jamo love it and if you're a chemist
you'll know that the green ones are
chlorines and you can see down here
there are some chlorines so they are the
same molecule but ones in three
dimensions on one's a traditional
chemical formula and as we go through
you can see them here and moreover if
you want to know more about that you can
link back to the original journal
article here which should come up in a
minute never give live demos they say
but I think on the web you have to
accept that it's worth it all right well
they let it them but we've also got a
summary page for this so what we've done
here is we've created summary page which
is a greater and more powerful resource
than was originally present in the
journal article so this is a lot of this
is our annotation and you can see here
the robot has actually been checking on
the data in the structure here and the
robot has also been able to draw
pictures which are not present in the
original publication and as always you
can see the in chi at the bottom so that
any indexing engine can get hold of our
data here and index it there are a lot
of oh my I've killed the Browns I
haven't I'm sorry not very clever bring
it up again I I have many more things on
this demo then I can show you at the
moment and I'm trying to think what is
the best thing to show you i think i'm
going to show you the what we call the
journal eating robot so we'll start that
one and that one should start a local
server i hope and then we are going to
carry out a demo on it
maybe I think it may need starting
manually so forgive me if as it needed
starting manually right so what we're
going to do here is we're going to see a
paper now imagine that this paper was
freely available on the web and it's
only a political question and it isn't
so this is a paper describing some
chemistry and what we have here is we
have you don't need to understand all
the words all you have to take home
message is it stuffed full of chemistry
let me write so you can see chemical
names in there and what the robot has
done is it's gone through the paper and
it's found all the things that thinks
our chemistry so it says I think for
bromo benzaldehyde is a chemical name
now if you then click on it the robot
will actually work out on the fly what
that is so it will take the benz which
is the thing in the middle here it will
take the brown which is on the full
position and the aldehyde is on the one
position and it will work that out so
what you have is the chemist talk in
terms of text but the robot is able to
interpret that now it's not a hundred
percent because some of these names are
so complicated but you can see here
that's quite a complicated name there
now what we can also do and this is
where the next mashup comes in that
somewhere in here I've got a work called
form as an okay we want to know film a
zone is a chemical what is it well we
don't know what it is about what we can
do is we can search pubchem for the
former Zhan so we go off to pubchem and
it will bring up the pubchem page and it
will tell us that that is former Zhan so
you've got a mash up here in that and
the original paper due
not now we're looking at it because we
are super imposing this text analysis on
top of it and pubchem doesn't know that
we are requesting that from them so
we're linking the paper to pubchem and
now what we can do not on my machine but
in general is we can click on that and
we can put the entry for fomos on which
oscar didn't know we can now say Oscar
this is former Zhan put it in your
dictionary so next time it will know
that and doesn't have to be asked and
this is really a question of social
computing so what you're getting is that
and that if enough people around the
world do this and if they all point at
the same server then they will without
any effort build up a communal
terminological resource for chemistry
right so Leslie said 45 minutes I
started at ten past so I'll spend a few
more minutes because I really want to
show what I think is the next generation
of scientific client so I'm now going to
show you something called bio clips
since any demonstration is suspect give
me a little bit of leeway when it's an
decides it's just going to have some fun
with me but you know the Eclipse
platform Eclipse right so that is the
development and environment which has
been developed by IBM and put into open
source and what a group of the blue
obelisk people have done is to turn that
into a rich client so this is using the
Eclipse framework but what we've got
here is and completely transformed into
a scientifically aware system so I've
just got to remind myself where to go I
hope it says sample data somewhere under
pmr because otherwise I'll have a very
slight problem
sample data and that is some examples
here so you don't have to remember very
much chemistry but do you know what a
spectrum is right ok so this recognizes
that this thing here is a spectrum and
when you click on it then it actually
says this seems to contain the spectrum
should the spectrum perspective be
opened yes thank you by eclipse and so
it comes up and down here it says well I
understand this spectrum as a so called
continuous spectrum and I can magnify it
and you can see that these Peaks are
actually you know real Peaks like that
and and so forth so this is a living and
living plug-in it's called J spec view
it's written by the leading an open
source developer who work for he
contracted this to molecular design for
several years but he's now got that his
men should take the IPR out of molecular
design so it's now fully an open source
and so we are beginning to do those sort
of things similarly if I do the other
spectrum it's what's called a barge
spectrum and mass spec and here the peak
list correspond to the peaks here so
value when to say peak 29 much watch
that one very closely i go to peak 29
and i say delete and it disappears there
now that's not a very good thing for
graduate students to be allowed to do
because they might be editing their data
but we have a completely live spectral
viewer here similarly we can go down to
the molecules so here's a teepee this
appears to contain a molecule shall we
show it yes so here's a teepee and this
is a live thing you can see all the and
edit buttons over the top so if I click
on that and let's see can I draw yeah I
can draw on that so i can edit the
molecule here we have a live chemical
editor and that again is a blue obelisk
product and finally here's viagra we put
that one on and we got a 3d molecule in
there and so we're
creating plugins for back this is bio
clips Leslie open source rich client and
we have plugins for all major chemical
functionalities in that and perhaps the
most exciting one which I hope will work
if I'm lucky is RSS now RSS oldest might
fail because i think our server is down
but this has developed something called
CML RSS so it actually sends not text in
the RSS feed it sends real molecules and
this thing is able to understand these
things as molecules as I say it will
probably fail unless our server is up
again but that is a feed of all of these
molecules and if and I think it is an if
now it doesn't seem to be it seems to be
a problem at the moment that ought to be
an RSS feed coming off our server with
these molecules so 51 I've been talking
for 41 minutes so just to summarize we
have a number of issues here and we have
technology which we would like to be
able to distribute bio clips as an
example of that if there was a way of
getting bad clips onto the average
chemist desktop then we would have
solved this we are not probably strong
enough as a community to make that
happen because chemists are very
conservative how do we develop this
client to the stage where it sells
itself and so forth so that's one of one
of our questions the second is that we
have to break this problem of of the
flow of wealth so here is what I drew as
the flow of wealth in and the chemical
software industry
is that farmer contracts with the
software companies who are closed and
database companies who are closed and
pays them a lot of money and they supply
products into the farmer industry but
none of these effectively come back to
the community so the flow of wealth is
from the scientific community down to
the service companies I'll be generous
the service companies for the farmer
industry now this is a large market i
don't know what i would estimate but and
if we said a billion a year that would
probably be an under estimate wouldn't
it i think so so you know it's it's a in
our terms it's a large market and it
fuels you know 20 different software
companies they're all competing against
each other they all have very similar
products and the products are based on
technology which is 10 years old at
least so none of them use web technology
in the way that it's meant to be at the
moment they don't have plug-in
components they don't use lightweight
services Semantic Web they're not
developing ontology they're not using
XML you know as not for exchange of
content so you have something here which
I rod not show you and here you've got
the scientists who are trying to do it
probably trying to work with their
neighboring disciplines but because of
this it's very very difficult for us to
be taken seriously they can put the
resources in they've got the people in
the suits who go and sell it and also
they can stand up at meeting as L we
have that their best text parsing text
mining system in a chemical world we've
solved it well you say to them well
what's it do it's all we can't tell you
it's a confidential secret but it's the
best in the world and that actually
makes it very difficult for us to
develop things we publish in
peer-reviewed papers they don't but they
have the power to sell it into the ins
so it actually makes it very very
difficult to get the modern technologies
taken seriously in the industry so and I
will finish there and just go back to my
blog where I
one of these and my presentation nose is
under here but these are some of the
people that I want to recognize so we
have people in the blue obolus we've got
at least two people from last night who
aren't on this list we have Warren
Delano who's pi mall and we've got Jimmy
Stewart's who has donated mopac one of
the great computational programs into
the public de more into open source then
as Henry scheper my symbiote and then
people at Cambridge now one of the
exciting things here is most of those
people are undergraduate students and
the system you saw the Oscar system was
really built primarily by students I
haven't shown at the data eating robot
which can go to the literature and
actually suck data out with a very high
percentage and the undergraduates do
very well because they haven't been
institutionalized and then we do have
funding from a number of people here we
have it we couldn't have done this
without funding but a lot of this is
marginal on other projects you know you
don't it's not easy to get funding
precisely for that sort of thing so
that's me again I'd like to thank Steve
very much for his pioneering work on
Enshi because I think that's the one
most prominent thing that will make this
fly people can understand it I will just
go back and see if it works but I'm not
optimistic and I will talk very severely
to our server when I get back now it's
not there and again this is one one of
the things we want to do is we actually
want to get self-replicating services so
we would like mirrors of these services
and the game one of the things that we
want to do is to be able to package
these services up so that anybody can
take them and it's too
all them easily but creating
distributable package services is not
easy and again that's something I like
to pick your brains on
yes she is really yes like smiles and
actually have the same basic philosophy
which is that you take a molecule so
I'll go back to the molecule if I can
find it and but not my way see if i can
find this
right the first thing you have to do
when you need the molecule in is to
normalize it so it takes all these
molecules here and normalizes them to
the same internal structure it then has
to canonicalize them so it works out a
unique numbering scheme for that and
then it has to serialize it now in
principle the first two bits are the
same in any language but the details
differ we don't know what it is in
smiles because the code is closed though
we can guess it for up from the outcome
in chi is a somewhat more an elaborate
and slightly more verbose language than
smiles but it's basically the same this
is six carbons here and then carbon one
is joined to carbon for two carbon 6 to
oxygenate and so on and then these are
the hydrogen's here so in she is very
similar to smiles you can translate
between them one way or the other but in
chi is developed so they can deal with
more complicated molecules including
transition metals and and and so for
both linear notations effectively it's
miles is proprietary and over the years
has had various versions and so
this is a open source public domain
version and it also covers a larger
class of chemistry smiles was developed
primarily for the pharmaceutical
industry and as such only covers
primarily that area of chemistry
which enhance the ferrocene and got
metallics and so on it's not exciting at
the polymers for example which is
something that smiles doesn't care about
because you know what's it's a
business-oriented notation and it's done
very well cos the pharma industry has
done well over the years but that's
that's to pass with the primary
difference of the two of them and this
is being extended in adopted by the
government that's becoming an
international standard through this
international in an appeal about
chemistry so it's been institutionalized
in a much more public and open way it's
going to be here in 10 or 20 rules for
sure where's the other one you don't
know it's going to be here and what
version is going to be here right well I
think Google is doing a lot for the by a
bit so let's say for the chemistry right
what our first my ph out and see if any
other make sense the first is that i
think it would be very nice to have
somebody or some group here that we
could be in contact with and disgusting
so that you know that would be the first
thing the second would be that Google
and was able to say this is something
that we Google take seriously at some
level and we are exploring how best to
look at and indexing or representing
chemistry on the web and so on to say
you know this is something which can be
done properly and we're playing our part
in doing it so if we take those and then
move on I would say that you then come
to looking at aspects of the technology
now the indexing of Vinci by Google and
it's January from our point of view a
bit of a mystery and when we started
this we actually found
hundred percent recall and a hundred
percent precision we put a hundred
inches up on the web and google indexed
all of them and when we searched for
them we got back only those hundred and
nothing else which is a remarkable thing
so it's really very very powerful ways
if you use smiles or casts or something
you get back football scores and crazy
frog and goodness knows what right so it
is a very precise technology on the
other hand it's got some problems with
the syntax here in that we're not quite
sure but we believe at the moment that
you have to take the inky equals off or
something like that for it to work you
know we have a little bit of folklore
because we don't know what's going on at
your end and so forth and we have mail
people will also feel that some of these
things sometimes drop out of the index
or that we can no longer find them when
they used to be there and so the general
feeling that we don't quite know what
we're looking at you can probably also
if one could get the stage where certain
data resources were indexed by indian
chi even though Google might not in
ecstasy GI I'm if you go to pubchem we
would like the inches in pubchem indexed
even though Google will probably skip
them at the moment because it says
they're a database something of that
sort is so important to us to be able to
get that to know that if you put an
itchy on the web you can guarantee
getting the pubchem index for it and
there will be other resources like that
so so we'd like to be able to set people
this is the guaranteed way of getting
your Inn
is indexed by by Google then I think
there would be some general support for
easy generation of in chi now we have
the technology but it's useful if we can
say well Google and NIST and Cambridge
agree on the best in chi tools to use or
this is the current version of entry
tools don't use the other lot and some
scissors yeah we're not looking at major
version control but versions and things
can be a problem I think you can so does
that all make sense so far well an
answer your last question waiting
adichie's on to google the singular base
you should take a look at google basis
rather fantastic that sounds very ties
are alternative ourselves together with
sitemap file on board so we know where
to find
we want you to tell us the best thing is
it doable and agree on the protocol that
we can per say this is the best way of
doing something and that would be a
major step forward i get Peter and I are
not exactly twins I guess you don't like
my comment on you know what to do what's
going on is first of all the question i
had in Peter and I will talk about on
the train down here you know there's to
Google really care about chemistry is
there an interest in doing something or
is it just you know random kind of
things well let's do this in science or
do that in science so and you know if
there if that's the case you know is
there someone here at Google that we can
communicate with on a regular basis to
try to develop and see what what can be
done to would benefit the chemical
community as well as Google obviously
the entry is one possibility and we'd
like to be sure for example that you
don't cut off parts of the entry that we
can put a string in that the pluses the
minuses the parentheses don't disappear
as they might normally disappear for
other things is there a way of doing
that is it worth doing it and so forth
and you know not knowing anything about
what's going on not being able to talk
to anybody because we don't know what's
going on it obviously makes it very
difficult for for us to think of
anything to do and I think in
we're very much interested in open
source open access open data and the
things that are available that if Google
can enhance those through google scholar
or whatever these other things are as
i'm sure you probably know there was a
lawsuit against google by the American
Chemical Society for the just the name
scholar which they lost and that's been
settled but you know we'd like to know
who's there was anybody technically
involved forget the lawyers and then you
know the technical people who caused the
lawsuit you know who are they do they
ever want to talk to anybody on the
outside or or it's just this is
self-centered operation that does
whatever they want and it doesn't care
doesn't really interact with with the
possible people in the community if
there's somebody who cares would like to
I like to know who he is or she is to
possibly communicate and see you know if
there's something interesting that we
might be able to do on a random basis or
on a regular basis but you know up until
today I had no idea about anything about
Google other than I use it all the time
and does that make sense at this level
you know I mean obviously you know there
may be ways of you know larger scale
collaborations in the future it's on but
we're not coming here and you know with
any preconceptions of that sort of thing
at all and it's it's finding out what's
possible I mean I think I would also say
it unless day that we are also
particularly keen in what Google might
wish to do in promoting open source and
supporting the sort of activity that we
have and perhaps advising on ways
forward and some but you know and that
doesn't excuse for that okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
