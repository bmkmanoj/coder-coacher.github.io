engineering manager here at Google if
fergal apps and site reliability and a
few years ago I became very active in
Google's diversity efforts and learning
about all the various programs that
existed here at Google and I was
pleasantly surprised as I learned about
why we were putting together these
programs that it was not about doing
something that was nice
or it was really about the importance to
our business and our company and also to
the fields in which were committed to
innovate and one of the things one of
the people that I came to know during
this process was Beryl Nelson who's an
engineering manager in knowledge and she
was the person who was sharing a lot of
the research and the background with the
executive team and so I got the pleasure
to collaborate with her on multiple
occasions about putting together the
information about why we were doing this
what it was important and specifically
how managers needed to change the
dynamic in their teams to be more
inclusive of all the different people
who want to contribute to technology in
today's world
so I Beryl finally published her work
externally it's been in published at
Google for some time but the ACM just
published it in November's edition and
she's here today to do her presentation
on the background about why diversity is
important to people who want to be
innovative who want to drive and be
successful in this business so it is my
pleasure to introduce Beryl Nelson
thank you so it's really it's really
pleasant to see this in print because I
submitted it to CAC em in December of
2012 so next time you think that one of
your code reviews is taking a long time
just think about me right it is better
because of all the peer reviews but I've
you can find the article in the November
issue of communications of the ACM now
so let me put this into presentation
mode and thank you all for spending this
time so first I want to tell you why I
care about this you know the I was hired
by Google five years ago in India and
that's the first time I was back in a
Western society really since 1995 when I
moved to Japan and I saw that things
were a lot different than they were when
I had been working I worked at Digital
Equipment Corporation in the 80s until
95 when I moved to Japan it was
different in a lot of ways right one is
that there's a lot more narrow
definition of what makes a successful
computer scientist than before we used
to have people from all ages and all
sorts of academic backgrounds I also was
heavily influenced by living in Asia for
15 years and being a visible minority it
like I've been working and in academic
settings that are mostly male since I
was 10 years old and that is nothing
compared to being a visible minority in
Japan in India I really felt that much
more strongly but the second thing that
happened was in my first week at Google
something appeared in my calendar which
said something like why women mean
business and at the time I thought if
something appears in my calendar it
means they want you to go so I went and
it turned out to be a talk by an author
of a book it was hosted by a Lisa Knox
in our Sydney office was it Sydney no
she was in Singapore but the point is
that it gave some information about the
correlation between successful companies
financially and having women in the
executive team and that really opened my
eyes to the fact oh it's not just a
conversation about being have some kind
of numbers game that maybe we're missing
50% of the population if we don't hire
women or if we don't hire blacks it's
it's actually really important to have a
lot of different kinds of points of view
at the table if you want to innovate so
I I've read a whole lot about this it's
not my day job my day job is I work on
Google search it's just something I'm
interested in and I feel like there are
a lot of people who are really
interested in this and they just don't
have the information easily accessible
and that was my goal in writing this
paper so the outline of this talk is
this that teams whose members are
heterogeneous in meaningful ways have
higher potential for innovation but
there are social science experiments
that use quantitative methods and
they're repeatable to show bias
stereotype threat and methods to combat
them right but the effectiveness of
diverse teams depends on trusting and
supportive cultures there are many
things that can be done to interfere
with bias and stereotype threat and so
on publishing data is one of the
important things and I'll go through
some of the tools cognitive illusions
they're actually not covered in the
paper there was a space constraint but I
would like to talk about them too
they create another barrier to effective
decision-making but there's hope there
are people who have actually made
substantive change in their tools for
this and if we have time I'll give some
positive examples so in terms of
financial performance oh and this
experiment is about women but I'd like
to say that there's just a lot more data
about women or about race and any other
axis but we should we should really
assume that almost all of these studies
will refer to any kind of
difference okay so in this particular
study it's one of many that shows that
companies that have a higher percentage
of women in the management part and the
management part of the organization do
better financially in this particular
study the they created a metric of how
far women were from the top of the
company and they aggregated it over the
entire company so companies with a
higher metric are on the left in the
darker color and those the average is on
the right so they performed better
return on equity better earnings before
interest in taxes and better stock price
growth and then a similar experiment was
done looking at companies that were in
the top quartile for having women in the
executive team compared to zero women in
the competitive in the executive team
and you can see both return on equity
and average earnings before interest in
taxes are higher when they're more women
similar a similar study was done looking
at companies with at least three women
on the executive board and again this
shows a similar result it's not just in
the West in India there was a study done
that showed that companies headed by
women have an annual growth that's much
higher than the average it's some of the
average is something like 35 to 21
percent over the course of five three or
five years and the women led companies
were 64 percent or 54 percent in the
same period so it's not just in one
geography multiple geographies Cedric
herring has shown similar results for
race and it's true
that these are not proving that the
reason that they're more effective is
because of the difference but the
experiments have been done in many
different geographies with different
methodologies with similar results so we
cannot ignore this right so similarly
diverse teams are better in a
and the way you can think of it is that
if you have a routine task that's
repetitive you really want communication
to be easy and then you're more likely
to want people from the same background
it's easy to communicate but when you
want to innovate you're better off
having a team that comes from multiple
points of view so you have more points
of view at the table one of the results
that's really interesting is that when
you look at gender tech tech patents
since 1990 in the u.s. more than 90
percent of them have male only authors
but the mixed gender patents are cited
26 to 42 percent more than any of the
single gender patents and that has not
been well explained another really
interesting study was done by some
people at the Sloan School I think I
misspelled the name here but I went to
talk with Tom Malone about this one time
and Anita Woolley is one of the
collaborators what they did is that they
did a study of the collective
intelligence of teams they took
participants with a wide range of Ages
something like 16 know 18 to 60 put them
in teams of from 3 to 5 and gave them a
number of tasks to do one of which was
just too large for a single individual
to perform and what they found was that
the only predictor of team success was
whether there were women on the team so
the way that you read this chart the the
vertical axis is how well the teams
scored and going from left to right it's
zero percentage of women 200 percent
women each of these bars represents a
group of teams that that scored
similarly with the blue circle meaning
the average for that group and the red
is the standard variation the important
thing to note is all the high scoring
teams were near the middle there are
some low scoring teams near the middle
also but but the teams on either end did
not score nearly as well as some of
those in the middle so they tried to
Stan why are these teams scoring better
in fact Tom Malone told me well I I
didn't want to believe that it has to be
women to make the team smarter right so
it and it was a surprise result that's
not what they were looking for so
they've come to believe that the reason
that these teams are smarter is that
there's a strong correlation between
women and the social intelligence that
causes people to be able to get all the
ideas heard in the room and they have
some more experiments planned related to
this now so until now I've been talking
about why it's important to have a
diverse organization and now I want to
talk about why it's hard to make it work
it's really hard to make it work there
are really significant barriers and
these are just some of them there's
unconscious bias there stereotype and
identity threat they're cognitive
illusions
there's exclusion from critical social
networks so for example if you if you
play golf and somebody else plays golf
you spend a lot of time together and you
hear about things but if you are not
really friends with another person
you're working with you won't have a
casual social conversations that make
you aware of things that you would when
you spend more time together a lack of
role models and mentors or unaware
managers that different people have
different career goals and motivating
factors so all that you're going to hear
now is going to end up with the
conclusion that the organization's
culture is really important to determine
whether it can benefit from diversity it
has to be inclusive and adopt practices
that reinforce that inclusivity now two
of the popular books about this
phenomenon are called the hidden brain
by Shankar vedantam and and blank by
Malcolm Gladwell and they approach a
problem slightly differently blink talks
about judgments that you make quickly -
good or bad effect and they study
several of these examples so for example
there's a study of the of a car
salesperson said there
one person that studied in the book that
is really really good like everyone who
comes practically will send a letter
saying thank you to him and what he says
he does is he just doesn't pay attention
to how that person looks physically like
when you came in this room you saw me
and you probably made some assumptions
about me based on how I look probably
within the first few seconds and he says
I know it's there I totally ignore it I
try to treat everyone the same that I
don't know whether they're really going
to buy a car but some there was a guy
named Ayers who did an experiment in the
1990s where he sent some young people to
car dealerships in the Chicago area and
he had white men white women black women
and black men they were all dressed
similarly they had a script they go in
the dealership they'd ask for the
cheapest car and start bargaining until
they wouldn't bargain anymore and then
they came back and they got some data so
the average price given to white men was
725 dollars above invoice for the
starting price right before the
negotiation for white women it was 935
for black woman it was 1195 for Blackmon
was 1687 after negotiations the black
men on average were told 1551 it's
almost twice as much over invoice as for
white men at the starting position
before bargaining now if you ask people
are you biased they'll say no hell no I
treat everybody the same but if you look
at things like the Obama election right
the exit polls say something different
from what you actually saw in the
numbers so why is that right that I'll
get to a good study of that soon another
thing which we saw in the talk
announcement is there's a
disproportionately high set of men who
are very tall who are CEOs right if you
compare with the general population
something like 52% or at least six feet
tall compared to 14% in the general
population and there some large number
about a third are 6 foot 2 or more and
that's less than 4% in the general
population so when people talk about
women or blacks they might say oh we
have a pipeline issue but when it comes
to short people we don't have a pipeline
issue they're everywhere right right and
if you asked if you asked well do you
think that smart that tall people are
smarter I mean there's only one person
who ever argued with me about that and
he was 6 foot 2 right an engineering our
one of our polling offices right we
don't believe that we're biased that way
but our actions show that we're making
these biased decisions and we don't
understand what now the hidden brain
looks at this from a different point of
view and that's the way in which we make
decisions that have an opposite effect
to our intention so for example there
one example that is given is there was a
study done in which their two job
applicants seen waiting in a waiting
room right it's a test situation it's
not a real job right but what was found
is that if an average wait applicant is
seen sitting next to an overweight
applicant the average weight applicant
is wait is rated lower incompetence
higher ability everything it's like it's
sticky right I mean not only is there
this bias against overweight but there's
it's if you associate with that person
you're also associated with that bias
another really interesting study that
many people have cited is this one you
might have seen it before what happened
was that Melissa Bateson went to coffee
stations at a workplace in northern
England and they had an honor system for
paying for the milk to put in your tea
or coffee so there was a sign that said
how much money to put in
right so they change the sign and what
they did is put photographs with the
sign for the money and they change them
every week and the amount of money they
collected each week you can see in this
graph right so the weeks it had flowers
like the the second week the fourth week
and so on they got less than half of
what they got in the weeks with eyes see
like the the odd-numbered weeks and in
the weeks where the eyes look straight
out you they got really lots of money
right so and at the end of the study
they asked so did you notice these
pictures nobody noticed but their
behavior reflected that they were
responding to this so the the
interpretation is that your your
subconscious notices when you're being
observed and you'll have a higher
standard of ethics when you feel like
you're being observed so clearly we're
making lots of subconscious decisions
all the time and it's really scary right
to know about this so how can we
understand it better okay so this some
of you have heard of this a lot of you
probably by now there's a study that
started I suppose in a number of
universities at the same time but one of
the most easily accessible is called
project of implicit at Harvard and what
was observed was that if a hundred years
ago if he asked are you biased against
blacks or whatever people say of course
I am right but around 1990 or later
people would know that they didn't
really want to act that way and they
wouldn't answer that way but their
behaviors would still reflect the bias
right so what these people did is
initially they took just a piece of
paper and they would show something like
a flower or a bug and they would try to
match it to something like something
good or bad and in the in the West
anyway we think of bugs as icky bad
things right although in depending these
big beetles as pets you know but but
there's even a temple in Kyoto that's
all covered with the wing
of a very interesting but-but-but in the
four flowers we associate them with
really happy occasions you know like
weddings or birthdays or things like
that so initially they they did a test
like this just to show how long does it
take you to answer a question when you
put together flowers with something good
and bugs with something bad versus the
other way around right and then the
second test that they developed had to
do with race they showed photographs of
people there'd be a white face or a
black face and then they would put the
face together with a word meaning good
or bad and again they found that it was
much easier for people to answer
questions when the white was with good
and black was with bet than the other
way around right so now there's an
online test and they've had thousands of
people participate in this so it's for
any individual person if you take the
test you might not get exactly the same
answer two times but over the course of
large numbers of experiments it comes
out really really reliably and by
measuring your response time they can
find out many many different
associations they're called implicit
associations so about 70% of people
prefer white people to african-americans
but if you ask about your preference
only 15% will say they prefer whites and
that includes african-americans they
also have this preference 80% prefer
young people age is one of the most
strongly measured biases that there is
and that includes in Asia where we where
people really revere the and respect the
experience you have with a but still
people test as preferring young people
50% prefer non-arab in names 76% prefer
abled as opposed to disabled people and
so on right I test as moderately biased
against women in science and technology
and that is totally against my
of interest I've been working since 1981
in science and technology so there's a
book called blind spot which describes
the development of this test in some of
the associations one of the things
that's really interesting is is there a
predictive link between the way you test
on such an Internet test and the way
that you behave and there isn't really
conclusive work so far there was some
research that indicated that in the case
of strong bias against a race that there
was a predictive association in the way
that you would behave but the research
is not very strong on that regard yet
the fact that we can measure it at all
though is a really big step forward
because it means we can examine
ourselves now there's another concept
called stereotype threat and I'm sure
many of you have heard of this so let me
define what I what I'd like you to think
of it as this graph indicates one of the
the manifestations so for example if
you're talking about math scores for
girls under high stereotype threat the
girls will test a lot lower than boys
under low stereotype threat they'd be
similar so stereotype threat is the
phenomenon that has to do with the fact
that we have multiple identities so I am
a woman I'm a mother I'm an MIT alumna I
am a daughter there are all sorts of
characteristics that I have but when I'm
put in a situation where my identity is
under threat then that identity becomes
salient so for example I'm an American
when I was in auto rikshaw late at night
in Hyderabad with someone who was was
fuming on and on about the bush invasion
into Iraq like I was getting pretty
nervous right it's scary and it became
really salient that I'm an American
alone at night with this angry man right
whenever you're in a situation in which
you there is a there's a stereotype that
you know about that is disadvantage in
dis advantageous to you and it's
something that you care about it can
affect your performance
now Claude Steele has written a
wonderful book called whistling Vivaldi
that talks about the history of the
research related to this and the way
that he started was looking at the
problem of Hawaii College Entrance
scores were not predictive of
performance for black students if you
looked at this the the slope starting
from entrance score to where students
would score after four years of
university for Asian or white students
it would go up at a similar slope but
for blacks it wasn't doing that and it
wasn't just in one school it was
everywhere and it was even at a lot of
schools that were trying to have
interventions and people didn't
understand it so the question is similar
to the Larry Summers question in which
Larry Summers asked well perhaps women
just don't have what it takes to excel
at science right he didn't survive his
job after that but but similarly people
were asking the question maybe there's
some ability difference and what was
beautiful about Claude Steele's
experiments is he established that the
same people under different conditions
can show opposite effects so let me tell
you one of his experiments they took
some black and white male college
students and took them to play mini golf
in one situation they they told them
this is a test of your athletic ability
and then what happened is that the black
men were fine and the white men needed
three extra strokes so then they did it
again and they said this is a test of
your sports strategic intelligence then
the white men were fine and the black
men had to do five extra strokes so it
showed that the same population would
have opposite effects depending on the
similar the the way that the problem is
posed and how that you
how you how you deal with the way you
present the problem basically so some of
the things that are really important
about this are that it works to say
things like this test does not have a
gender difference if it's a credible
statement right that's a way to reduce
stereotype threat it's also important to
say that it happens all the time right
like you only you only have to know that
that mysterio type exists and it starts
really young like five-year-old girls if
they color a picture of a girl holding a
doll they'll do less well in a math test
then if they color a picture of a child
eating with chopsticks or a landscape
five years old right another thing
that's that's really interesting is that
positive stereotypes work right so if
you tell a woman you're in Asian well
there's a stereotype about Asians doing
better in math or you're a Stanford
student if you tell a white man
something that reminds him of the Asian
stereotype he'll do worse in his math
test so that you can manipulate the
situation in some sense because of the
way that you phrased this now another
thing that's really important to counter
stereotype threat is critical mass one
really good example was the Supreme
Court of the u.s. when the first woman
was appointed Sandra Day O'Connor
she said the press hounded her all the
time every time there was a decision
they would say what did the woman say
and it all went away when Ruth Bader
Ginsburg joined the court of course that
has nothing to do with how biased it
might be within the court the way they
make the decisions but the external
visibility it just reduced her from
being a person to being a representative
of all women right and then when Sandra
Day O'Connor
retired all that attention went on Ruth
Bader Ginsburg which surprised her so
critical mass is really hard to define
for what will work best but in general
somewhere around 40 percent is where
people start feeling comfortable and
some experiments have been done for
example in in sending in setting up
brochures for a flyer for a company and
around 40 percent minorities in the
photographs is the point where
minorities start feeling safe and
feeling like they will they're willing
to apply it's also important for an
organization to say we value diversity
an organization that says we're color
blind people don't trust it it's sort of
like well you have a deficiency but
we'll ignore it right but but saying
that your difference is important to us
is a much stronger statement it makes a
big difference it's also important to
have a credible narrative and that that
means that you have a way of explaining
a story to someone that allows them to
see their own success so for example in
university if you have a freshman a
first-year student who can talk to
someone who's in their third or fourth
year who looks like them then they they
can start to feel like yes this is
something I can do there's somebody else
who's faced similar problems to what I
faced and I'm able to face them too it's
really important to have a an expandable
view of intelligence meaning that
knowledge is not just static it there
are things that we can learn self
affirmation is an exercise that has been
incredibly successful it started the
experiment started with a school in
which students were given an exercise
for 15 minutes to write something about
one thing that they valued and the in
the control group they were supposed to
write about something that someone else
might value but they didn't particularly
value the students who wrote about a
value two years later we're still
scoring better
in their classes and this has been
repeated for physics college students
for women it's amazing it's a very small
intervention and it has a positive
effect it's important to improve
critical feedback so people thought that
it would have a positive effect on
students if you if you gave them
positive feedback sort of like cheering
them on you can do it I'll support you
it actually doesn't help what really
helps is being very engaged saying I
have very high standards but I'm going
to work with you and we're going to make
sure that you can reach this it's a it's
a non-intuitive result having
communities of support turned out to be
a really important difference between
Asian students who also were often
minority than black students at
universities in the u.s. because Asian
students would naturally culturally form
groups in which they would discuss
problems with each other and the
african-americans normally did not form
these groups in which they'd study
together but once those groups were
formed they had similar positive effects
when when someone feels really isolated
and I felt that myself as an engineer at
Google sometimes you're starting and you
feel like oh if I say something I'll
look dumb right and you kind of isolate
you're you're so not wanting to show
other people that you conform to the
stereotype and sometimes people even
refuse to take advice which would help
them because I think taking the advice
would just confirm the fact that they're
done whatever but with having a group of
people in which you can share your
learnings really increases the
effectiveness of the groups and another
really interesting result has to do with
intergroup conversations so for example
say that you have a black man you know a
white man taking a black history class
in the US often what will happen is that
that white man will be the only white
person in the room or maybe they'll be
too and then they feel this kind of
reverse minority effect in which they're
afraid to say anything
because if they say something that
sounds like they're insensitive or just
unaware that might put them at one end
of the spectrum or that might they might
sound just really arrogant or uncaring
on the other end of the spectrum and so
it's really difficult to find a balance
where they can actually participate and
learn
so again Claude Steele studied this
situation in an interesting way they
they asked participants to put chairs
out for an intergroup conversation about
race but they didn't tell them that
putting the chairs out was the
experiment and what they found was that
if a white man was putting the chairs
out for a bi-racial conversation by
default they would put their chair
subconsciously a little bit farther away
from the others what worked to change
that is to say we are going to help you
have a conversation in which you can
have a meaningful exchange about how to
deal with these difficult issues treat
this as a learning opportunity and when
they introduce a conversation that way
they would put the chairs the same
distance that they would have in the in
the other standard case so one thing I
forgot to mention is that you can
actually measure physiological effects
for stereotype threat like people's
blood pressure goes up you can measure
sweat but if you ask them are you
feeling under stress they'll say no
right people don't actually they're not
really very self-aware about when
they're under these influences and it's
really important to deal with them
because it's something that's constant
right if you're the only one like you in
your group it's not just a job interview
you're talking about it's all the time
every day all your interactions and
finding a situation in which you you
have a trusting environment is really
important to make the team effective now
there their number of consequences of
stereotypes one of them is these
prescriptive stereotypes now some of you
have heard this study
there's an there was a study done in
which a man and a woman were each asked
to help someone who had to fix a broken
copier and afterwards the man or the
woman colleague was rated on their
effectiveness if the man helped out then
his score was higher than that than the
base score if a woman helped out it
stayed the same if they didn't help the
man score stayed the same but the
woman's score went down so why is this
because women are expected to be helpful
altruistic when a woman doesn't conform
to this prescriptive stereotype she pays
a penalty but if a man does it it's an
extra right this is a kind of bias we
have to watch out for
we have attribution error when when a
man and a woman together are performing
a technical task if we report it as this
group did this had this accomplishment
then most people will assume that the
man has higher responsibility for this
but if you separately report the man to
this and the woman did this all that
effect goes away there there differences
in career advancement strategies that
work and one of them is that sponsorship
is really more lacking for women than
for men and it's a really important
factor to help them succeed sponsorship
is the difference between sponsorship
and mentoring is that mentoring someone
gives you advice in sponsorship someone
actually takes a risk for you and puts
puts your name out there for some new
activity it's also been found that at
the high levels of an organization
changing jobs can actually increase
salary over the long run for men and it
decreases it for women so the same
strategies that work for one situation
don't work for everyone
a small bias can have an unexpectedly
large effect in an organization a
simulation was done in which there were
eight levels of an organization and it
was assumed that in each review cycle
some fixed percentage of people would
leave and the people would have get a
random a randomly assigned performance
score people with the highest
performance score would be would be
promoted and this this was repeated
until the entire organization turned
over so when you start with the entire
organization with 50/50 women and men by
the end of the experiment at the lowest
levels it's 53% woman and at the highest
level is 35% woman and when you simulate
with 5% of bias it's an even stronger
effect and 1% of bias you cannot even
measure it
so the that's one of the reasons it's
really important to pay attention to
bias in an organization a small amount
can have a huge effect this is also a
famous study a couple years ago there
was a study published in which some US
science faculty received resumes that
differed only in the name
they either received John or Jennifer
and it was an application for a lab
manager so they were asked to rate them
on their competence their higher ability
if they were hired whether they would
mentor them the salary and whether they
were likable and there was a difference
of very measurable difference between
the way that men and women were rated on
on every measure and the men were
offered four or five thousand dollars a
year more than the women the women
faculty exhibited the same bias that the
mended and the only the only measure on
which the women scored better was
likeability so this bias actually exists
now I presented this in Poland and
someone said but what if it's conscious
bias what if they but I think we don't
want to go there
it's possible right there there was a
study of a real person who was a
successful VC and her bio was given to
some MBA students some with heidi and
some with howard everything else was
identical and the students were asked is
the skill the same or different and who
would you like to work with so the good
news is that the skill level was
addressed similarly was assessed
similarly but when asked who do you want
to work with almost everyone preferred
Howard like 70% Heidi's just too
aggressive so women had higher levels
actually faced a penalty right that
there's a narrow band of behaviors
that's acceptable by showing some of the
leadership traits that we associate with
successful leaders they're going against
some of the prescriptive stereotypes for
women and so it becomes a difficult
balancing act in meetings the the
studies are a little bit more soft
relating to meeting behaviors but in
general the studies agree that men tend
to talk more and interrupt more women
are more likely to be interrupted
they're more likely to allow a
successful interruption and if they
interrupt someone it's most likely to be
another woman right in formal settings
men will gain the floor and keep it more
women take a lot less time and in
framing a question and this is important
because we want our leaders to be able
to frame the questions and by self
training women to not speak up or
minorities then they're less likely to
have the perceived skills needed to be
an effective leader in informal settings
women excelled all the collaborative
skills and so on I'm trying to go faster
because I'm going to run out of time I
always do so it also is really important
to realize that career needs are
different and what we assume is not
always the case so this represents a
study of managers and why they leave a
job and you see that men are almost 10
percent more likely than women to leave
because of a promotion or for hire
salary women are something like 9
percent more likely to leave because of
a difficult manager than men and almost
nobody leaves really just because of
childcare what happens is that we
perceive it as a woman leaving because
of a child raising issue often times
they'll just say that and not really say
what the real issue is the real issue is
that if you feel like you don't have a
future it's not worth the trouble to try
to keep a job and raise a family at the
same time this happened to me I was told
by my manager to quit when I was
pregnant with twins just to be good to
the twins you know
so that's part of why we moved to Japan
I figured was why bother with this
manager right and this and similar
results have been found in in Japan and
that was before Google existed it we had
nothing to do with Google ok so what if
you could study the same person being
both a man and a woman and it turns out
some people have done this right their
studies of transgenders and pretty
consistently they find that when men
become women they experience
disadvantages that they didn't have
before initially they might have their
incomes fall by 12% and over the long
term by 30% when women become men they
they get new privileges their
professional lives become easier their
incomes rise by seven and a half percent
initially ten percent in the long term
but even better their two biologists at
Stanford that are transgender one from
man to woman and one from woman to man
and they're willing to talk about it so
the person who went from woman to man is
named Ben bars he was oblivious to
sexism and early life he couldn't
understand the feminists but afterwards
people would say his work is much better
than his sisters people who didn't know
it was the same person he says he gets
better treatment in everyday life he can
complete a whole sentence without being
interrupted and now he starts
remembering all these things that
happened
him as an MIT student things like the
professor saying Oh your boyfriend must
have done that assignment the things
that at the time didn't seem that
important right the one that went from
man to woman she's named joan
roughgarden as a man she made a
controversial proposal
she works in biological ecology I think
and she but she still had some authority
and people engaged but after becoming a
woman she made another and the
establishment was totally livid nobody
engaged with her and at workshops people
even came and threatened her physically
like jumping up on the stage or starting
to shout at her and that had never
happened as a man but she says well you
feel like this guy is going to come over
and hit you and should I get ready right
she's no longer on any committee her
salary has dropped she gets interrupted
when talking she can't frame issues and
so it's a really it's really stunning to
hear such things now I want to change
gears a little bit Daniel Kahneman is
not an economist he's a social
psychologist but he won the Nobel Prize
for his work in prospect theory in
economics and that's a story of
risk-taking when the outcomes are known
so for example if you tell someone that
you have 10% chance of dying if you take
this shot or if you tell someone you
have 90% chance of living if you take
this shot then people take opposite
decisions even experts so you people are
very influenced by the story so I won't
tell his whole story because we'll run
out of time but he had a lot of really
interesting anecdotes that show why he
was interested in this area and he's
come up with this idea of a cognitive
illusion in which the coherence of a
story rather than data or truth leads to
an illusion of confidence so when people
basically people reject data when it
doesn't match their story and that's a
really important
thing to watch out for he coined a term
called what you see as all there is - so
that's as for example people will infer
anecdotally from their experience that
the world is like this for example
someone might think well look at this
person over there she's a very
successful engineer that means that any
woman can be successful if they're just
like her right so there is no problem or
conversely my sister had a terrible time
therefore there's a terrible environment
out there and nobody can succeed and
either one is really inferring from
insufficient data these cognitive
illusions take greater effect when it's
something relating to your own
professional competence now there are a
few examples of very positive change
one is the MIT science faculty study in
the 90s there were three senior women
faculty who believed that there was bias
in the way that lab space was allocated
or grants they didn't know for sure but
they felt that it was true so they
decided to talk to all the senior women
faculty in science and it wasn't hard
because there were only 15 of them and
most of them agreed this was a problem
they went to the Dean the Dean decided
that they would do a study the committee
included three men who were current or
former department chairs and one senior
woman from each department and they
looked at all the data except salary and
they found that indeed there was bias in
some of the departments and it surprised
everyone because it did not look like
what they thought discrimination looked
like in any individual case they could
argue this person shouldn't get this or
but when they put it together it
described a pattern and they weren't
even aware that they had it it really
shocked the president of the university
when he figured out that all these women
used to think there was no problem when
they were a young faculty but their
experience changed over time what I
think is really amazing about this is it
so public you can just search and find
it it was around 1997 you know in this
year a lot of tech companies
started releasing data this was done in
1997 and they made effective changes
there's another another report about 12
years later Harvey Mudd College is
amazing they went from 12% women to
about 40% women in computer science in
five years and they it wasn't rocket
science to make these changes they took
all the first-year students who wanted
to - Grace Hopper which is a large women
in computing conference and that
provides role models sort of like I can
do this they change their introductory
computer science course to not require
previous programming experience and to
become more holistic and they involve
students in research from their second
year and it not only increased the
number of women in computer science it
increased the number of computer science
graduates period from around 25 to 30
per year to about 75 per year this is
amazing it made the whole field more
attractive they also increased the
percentage of women in in engineering
close captioning and YouTube was
introduced because there was a deaf
engineer Ken Haran Steen who decided we
really need to do this project so he'd
worked together with Naomi black who's
an accessibility engineer they're both
still here but when it was released it
was a killer feature that nobody had
predicted nobody realized that this is a
feature that would be really critical to
people even beyond the hearing impaired
community so these are just a few
examples of cases when organizations
have made huge changes because of the
composition of the people that they have
and the way that they approach problems
so this is a summary of some of the many
things that you you should do if you
want to have an organization that really
values diversity data is almost it's
probably the most important thing
sharing data makes it possible for
people to change because otherwise
you're just working based on your
intuition creating an atmosphere of
trust is important
critical mass is important another
really nice experiment was people women
did math tests and groups of three women
or to earn a man or one woman and two
men and their scores got progressively
worse as we reduce the number of women
adopt an expandable view of intelligence
know yourself take you find out what
your own biases are create an inclusive
culture actively valued diversity
sponsorship is important support
alternative career goals and share
strategies that work so I have a bunch
of resources listed here some of the
books my full book bibliography is on my
blog the rule of one it's called rule of
one because this is a phrase my aunt
came up with when when people infer from
just a single instance then they come up
with poor conclusions I call it
reasoning from insufficient data
my aunt calls it the rule of one right
so my blog is called rule of one dot
blog spot.com and so the full book
bibliography for the article is there
also and this article is in C ACM well
