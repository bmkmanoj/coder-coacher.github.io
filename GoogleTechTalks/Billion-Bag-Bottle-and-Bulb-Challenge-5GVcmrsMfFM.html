all pet on behalf of the green committee
who were sponsoring this Tech Talk this
afternoon we're fortunate in the Phoenix
area we have great expert and on the
topic his name is Greg Peterson
he works in a place called the urban
farm and among a number of his other
projects I've done for a few years on in
he and his group have kind of introduced
me to a lot of interesting and strange
ideas and so we've brought them in to
introduce you to some strange and new
ideas as well so great thank you welcome
we're gonna go ahead and start you off
on a one-minute video on my house of all
places so so my big idea is let's look
to see how we can have our homes and the
land around our homes fuel our lives my
entire yard is edible from the front
flowerbeds to the edges of the backyard
I started thinking about how we could go
about sustaining ourselves in the cities
and I looked at this great big garden
that I had that I've been gardening in
for the past 20 years and to myself how
could I go about fitting in edibles and
energy in my art a few years ago I
planted up an apple tree heads in the
freight yard one of the biggest pieces
of the edible landscape or the fruit
trees there are over 60 fruit trees here
on the property part of how we go about
putting 60 fruit trees on 1/3 of an acre
to keep them all small on any given
month I'm getting 30 to 50% of my diet
from my yard will often go out in the
afternoon and harvest our dinner it's
easy to go get an entire salad out of my
yard
that looks pretty normal huh the house
the whole notion of so my name is Greg
Peterson and I live at a place called
the urban farm that's the video you just
saw and the whole notion behind the
urban farm is that we frame out this
notion of green living in a way that
people understand and that it's easy to
do one of the things that I've thought a
lot about over the past 10 years of my
life I actually just finished a master's
degree at Arizona State University about
a year and a half ago and it had me
thinking about a lot of things and about
sustainability we call it the S word and
living green and one of the things that
I was distinguished out over the past
few years is this notion of something
called a one use item okay I call him a
one use asset one use item and those are
all those things that are in our lives
that we use only once so what are some
examples of one use item see you guys
use on a daily basis yeah right though
Forks plastic forks plastic bottles
aluminum cans we're gonna talk about
aluminum here in a little while those
are all those things that you know you
go into the restaurant and they bring
you a cup of iced tea and there's a
straw in it right you know what I do
with that straw I take it out and I put
it next to the I never use it so that's
a one use item that never gets used so
what I'm here to do today is to
challenge your thinking primarily around
these things that we call one use items
okay and as we go along as you have a
question you know if you see something
that you have a question about stick up
your hand let's talk about it because
that's what'll help drive this
conversation all right so what are the
reasons I have a few reasons up here
what are the reasons to reduce our use
on these things there's the health
reasons which we're going to talk about
plastic bottles here in a little while
and the impact that they have on our
health there's the health of the
environment we'll talk about that a bit
and then there's this the the whole
notion that one little thing so I
started using a stainless steel water
bottle about a year and a half ago and
I've not used any plastic bottles since
well besides the you know Gatorade or
two that I have a month but I've stopped
using plastic water bottles so that
little thing makes a big impact over
time what what other reasons you might
we have to reduce our use of these the
cost that's a very good one
because over time if you're buying you
know a friend of mine buys a case or two
of plastic water bottles that you know
one of the grocery stores and there is a
cost involved absolutely any other
thoughts on that you know and that you
know that's a very good thing there is
an environmental cost to the production
of that the the plastic bottles are made
from petrochemical products so there is
that inherent cost involved so that's a
really good one okay
plastic is forever go ahead to the next
ones one more I call this my 95 95
dilemma okay and it revolves around the
fact that plastic is forever 95 percent
of all the plastic that's ever been made
is still in existence it's either in
landfills or you know and your trunk or
but it doesn't ever break down there the
the other 5% can be calculated into
incident it's been incinerated okay so
95 percent of the plastic out there it's
still a it's still in plastic form and
the other 95 percent is 95 percent of
all the plastic bottles
don't ever get recycled now I know you
guys are really good about doing
recycling here but usually when you're
out in the world we have no place to
recycle our plastic water bottles so
they primarily go into the landfill
1267 give me a few guesses on what 1267
might mean around plastic oh that's a
good one yeah that's not it but that's a
really good guess years to decompose
actually then what I have been told by
my researchers is that it really doesn't
ever completely decompose so it would be
longer than that all right yeah exactly
what else what else might that represent
I'm sorry
recycling codes like how many there
might be okay good now that that's
really creative I like that that's not
what it is though where was it what
there was one more over here that is
really close it's the number of plastic
bags that we use per person per year in
the United States and that's what
exactly what I was doing
um this gentleman up here is shaking his
head it's like it's amazing when you
stop to think about it how would I go
about using 1267 plastic bags in here
and when then when you go to you know
one of the grocery stores and you see
somebody coming out with you know 15
bags of groceries and they've all been
double bagged right that's the only
place I can go with it because I wasn't
using that many before
I believe that number is only for
plastic bags like you get in the grocery
store grocery bags plastic grocery bags
the the numbers absolutely astronomical
and how many are made in the country
it's it's three hundred billion or
something like that we it took me a
couple of days just to wrap my head
around how to do the math you know
figure out but that's correct
plastic bags plastic bottles this back
the this is a photo courtesy of Planet
Ark that's a big pile of plastic bags
that they were you know trying to
dispose of what happens with this stuff
when we you know when we dispose of it
you know everybody talks about throwing
something away right where does it go to
where is a way there is no way
especially this the the notion of what
we're doing now is we're living in this
closed system planet Earth is a pretty
much a closed system anymore I mean
there's a you know some light that comes
in and out and but we've got a certain
amount of resources to use and when
they're gone they're gone and so plastic
one of the things about plastic is it is
a petrochemical product so as we use it
up we're also using up those
petrochemical products in order to make
it happen and that port turtle on the
last slide how many people have seen
plastic bags and trees by the road where
else what's the craziest place you guys
have seen a plastic bag on somebody's
head there you go not wrapped it
hopefully not wrapped around their head
so that's the bad news that's the bad
news
the good news is we can do something
about it like I said a couple of slides
ago the choices that you make on a daily
basis around this stuff makes the
difference and the nice thing is is that
the choices you're making right today
are fine and if you're still using
plastic bottles that's great what I'm
here to do is to help you see that
there's a different way and then you can
choose so that's this whole continuum of
living green right there's living not so
green and living way green fact often
I'm people will tell me because I live
at the urban farm they say oh you live
at that totally green house in north
central Phoenix that where I live is it
16th Street in Glendale and I have to
stop him and I say well totally green I
don't first of all I don't know that
that's possible I've not gotten to a
place where I've figured out how to be
totally green okay my sense of it is is
that it's just choices all along the way
so there's light green a little bit
darker green a little bit darker green
all the way to you know extreme green I
could be considered extreme green I
would think the house where I live the
urban farm is a third of an acre in
central Phoenix there are 60 fruit trees
on the property we have solar
intolerance on the roof we have we make
our own electricity we and heat our own
hot water and we use the grey water
which is what goes down the sinks and we
collect rainwater so we've incorporated
all of these kinds of things into the
landscape at the home where I live so
that's a you know that's a little bit
more extreme and what I do is I I talk
to people about these different notions
and I point them out and then then you
all get to make a choice and then it's
your you know you can look at and say oh
you know what that's something I can do
the apple tree hedge that was mentioned
in the in the video I had a lady come
and see me about three years ago and I
could see a light bulb going on in her
head when it was happening
she was figuring out that she could
actually do her own apple tree hedge and
a year later she came back to me and she
said you know what I bought 16 apple
trees and I put them in a heads and
they're growing great
so I you know I know that I'm doing what
I'm supposed to be do doing when people
are you know starting to take notice
like that no suffering allowed there's
you can't suffer when you do this if
people are gonna suffer when they're
when they're looking at going green
they're not gonna do it
so you this isn't about suffering it's
not about giving up a good friend of
mine still uses straws I don't use
straws I'm not interested in straws
there for me there's something that but
she still uses straws which is perfect
for her and that's a choice she makes
and that that works but if we start
telling people that they can and can't
do things around this stuff it just
doesn't really doesn't work so that's
the part where you know there's no
suffering here
so what can we do this is where this is
where I want your input down here's some
examples up here but what are you guys
doing to go green I'm in the office what
are you doing to go green here in the
office there is recycle bins everywhere
which I love that's great what else you
doing use those instead of bottled water
that's very good those are like a
Nalgene bottle or you know it's a poly
poly carb polycarbonate bottle that's
great
there's also stainless steel I brought
some stainless steel water bottles to
share with you guys I didn't bring
enough for everybody but we'll figure
out we'll figure out how to distribute
them stainless steel is what we're
finding is this stainless steel is the
best it doesn't leach and then it is so
it's not leaching chemicals into the
water that you're drinking like other
plastics do and then we're reducing the
amount of plastic bottles that we use or
eliminating the amount of plastic
bottles that we use so what else you
guys what else you guys doing to be
green what does that look like to you
good you know and I heard in Mountain
View they have bicycles out in front of
all the buildings right that would be so
cool I would love to live in an area
that I can bike Phoenix isn't that area
but
unfortunately and this where you guys
get to talk a little bit while I take a
drink yes exactly
turn off your and that actually that's a
very good point there's something called
phantom energy anybody heard of phantom
energy phantom energy is when everything
you know have you ever grabbed your cell
phone charger
out of the wall and unplugged it and
it's still hot it's using electricity so
phantom energy is is all those things in
your house that's using electricity
whether you're using them or not and you
mentioned I mentioned earlier the solar
panels on the roof of the house I
actually got I've had them for two years
now and I actually got my electric bill
this past weekend my electric bill for a
two thousand square foot house in
central Phoenix was eight dollars and
forty five cents last month now I did
that in two ways I did that in two ways
and this is important first of all we
are producing our own electricity on the
roof okay and that's that's that takes
infrastructure and putting it in and
that's something that's harder to do the
thing that's simple to do is make things
more efficient and I know you guys have
started making things more efficient
around the offices here make things more
efficient put the compact fluorescent
light bulbs in LED lights are coming on
the market you know you can put those in
yes
that is a very good question the quit
and the question is does it make sense
to eliminate incandescent bulbs that are
still working and put compact
fluorescent bulbs in their place
the thing about incandescent bulbs is
they use 10 times the energy of a
compact fluorescent lightbulb ok the the
nice thing about in this case the nice
thing about incandescent bulbs is that
they have a you know a life of maybe six
months or a year they've the short life
so if you've had one in for a while you
could run it out to the end I know
people that just have gone in and
changed out all their bulbs and then
recycle the old bulbs the caveat on
compact fluorescent light bulbs is that
you need to recycle them appropriately
when they're done because there's some
heavy metals in them that they're
they're questioning right now but that's
the simple thing at my house the other
the other ways that I got an it you know
reduced my power consumption to eight
dollars and forty five cents in a month
was whenever I have to buy a new
appliance I make sure it's Energy Star
so I'm not going in and doing it all at
once but as I'm going along okay added
insulation to the Attic I did that about
10 years ago all these things are adding
up cumulatively to make it to a point
after living in the house for 15 years
that I you know I can get my electricity
usage way down another thing that's
really easy to do ceiling fans that
helps a lot so there you know several
things that I've done to reduce the in
tour to reduce my need for electricity
that's a great question
so what else do you give me a couple
innovative ideas what do you what else
you guys doing at home
that's nice that's local right yes right
so there was a couple things that I
heard the first part of it was where are
the products coming from and being
conscious about where the products are
coming from and the second part is how
are the products manufactured right
anybody heard the term food mile food
myung-su some shaking a food mile is the
how far food travels from where it's
raised and to where you you know till
your plate essentially anybody want to
guess on the average food mile on our
food the average amount of miles that
food travels to land on our plate a
thousand not quite that's good that's
good
1,300 miles the food travels 1,300 miles
and that that the impact the
environmental impact of that is HUGE
because that food they have to use
gasoline or petrochemical products to
get them here and that also goes to
eating in season okay eating what is
currently in season it apples are coming
apples and peaches and apricots and
plums and watermelons that's all what's
what we're coming into the season up now
if we wanted oranges right now oranges
are probably coming from South America
so they're having to bring them up so
knowing what
where are in this case food comes from
or where our products come from has a
large impact on the environmental impact
okay so if we can say you know what I'm
only going to eat what's local what's
grown locally that food has to be it
doesn't have to travel this far okay now
you see you mentioned the social impact
of this this whole notion of
sustainability and I call it the S word
because it's so non understanding it's a
hard word to grok it's a hard word to
get but in a nutshell there are three
pieces that we have to take into
consideration when we're looking at
sustainability there's the environmental
piece right that's like oh yeah right of
course okay you mentioned it there's the
social aspect of it okay what's the
social impact of this product is it
coming from a country far away that's
paying children two cents an hour to
make it okay what's the third piece yeah
exactly
economics a economic financial so when
we're looking at the this whole sphere
of sustainability we have to evaluate
all three of those pieces in order to
develop a model that actually works from
a sustainability sustainable perspective
and the economic piece is you know it's
businesses in order for businesses to
buy in go in to going green they're
gonna need a financial incentive to be
able to do it yes
right and then and so the ethics for me
the ethics fall under the social piece
so this is social sorry there and that
was that was my academic three steps on
sustainability you guys have any
questions about that okay so I have a
tendency to get off track is just drag
me back and find me if you need to what
can we do so there's this whole notion
of the cloth bags right
how many people have cloth bags at home
for the grocery store to take to the
grocery store how many people have them
at home and not in their car yeah
exactly
it took me a few you know getting to the
grocery store and oh my gosh they don't
have groceries or I don't have grocery
bags they're back at home to get to you
know remembering and then what I did is
I just I'll take the groceries home
unload the groceries and put them
immediately back in the car okay now how
many people have walked into the grocery
store and forgotten their bags before
yeah do people I know I've done that
before
the deal I made with myself and we'll
talk about this a little more in a
minute but the deal I made with myself
is that no more plastic bags so what
I've actually done is I've loaded the
groceries in the cart back into the cart
and taking them out to this car and bag
them in the car yeah that's that's part
of how I've done it
stainless water bottles let's talk about
this whole notion of water bottles okay
we all need to drink water and there are
a myriad of different choices on what
kind of bottle so that we can drink out
of the plastic one use bottles like the
smart water bottles that I'm seeing at
this moment they're a soft plastic
they're the worst for us and they're the
worst for our environment remember what
I said earlier that 95 percent of the
plastic doesn't ever get recycled
plastic bottles don't ever get recycled
they still end up in the landfill and
that that's a huge impact on the
environment but they're all it's also an
impact on our health
plastic leeches and basically what that
means is is that the water that stays in
the plastic bottle over time
some of the chemicals that are in the
plastic leach out into the bottle okay
the the soft plastic one use bottles are
the worst okay and I've said it twice
now one use therefore use only once
don't don't be refilling them okay so
here's some don'ts about plastic don't
refill one use plastic bottles don't
leave them in your car that extreme heat
has the bottles leach more don't put
them in the freezer sorry if you're
freezing them but that those chemicals
get into the plastic bottle and all this
is listed on our website your guide to
Green Comm on the front page there's a
there's a few links at the top left that
explains in depth we call it the plastic
primer one in the plastic primer two
that's one that was the next piece don't
put plastic in the microwave no plastic
you know styrofoam in the microwave
because as you're heating it those
chemicals in those containers are
leaching out into your food and then
that's what we're eating yes please
right yes how is the amount of chemicals
are chemicals that are going to leach
into it in the second filling going to
be any significant amount compared to
how long it's been in transit in
so so the question is is that you buy a
bottle that's been sitting on a shelf
for a couple of weeks or a month and the
the chemicals have leached into it and
you drink it and then you fill it up
again and the leach it won't be as much
but what I am told by my researchers is
is that the older bottle gets the more
it leaches okay so we get the the longer
the older the bottle is the more over
time that it will leach I have a
professor at ASU that is that I took
classes from a couple of years ago and
he talked about prudent avoidance is it
prudent for me to be drinking out of a
for me to be drinking out of a plastic
water bottle it's not I've made that
I've made the choice to only drink out
of stainless steel yes with the BPA the
baby bottle BPA thanks that's
interesting the the so running the
plastic bottles through the hot
dishwasher yeah the you know they're
finding all kinds of interesting things
out like that and the research is out
there you know we're finding that it's
you know it's pretty readily available
so so I suggest to people
stainless steel bottles and glass and as
you can tell I've dropped my bottle a
few times and it's pretty dented up so
if this was glass that it had been
broken eight or ten times so then I
leaned towards stainless steel for
myself stainless steel doesn't leach and
you can put in the freezer if you want
to freeze it you know don't fill it off
all the way and you know that way you
can get ice inside of it there are other
metal bottles on the market and there
are several bottles that are made from
aluminum okay and it's been reported
that these aluminum bottles that are
then lined I myself have had some health
issues with having too much aluminum in
my body and it affects then or the
neurology of you know I actually shake a
little bit on this side because of
having taken in too much aluminum so I
go back to for myself I go back to that
whole notion of prudent avoidance okay I
want to avoid though
things that might impact me impact my
health and an aluminum bottle would do
that so I just I have weighed aluminum
also questions about that yeah I've seen
there are some glass ones very good
actually that is absolutely the case so
if I had to pick between aluminum and
plastic aluminum is much more readily
recyclable it absolutely is
I think they say that it takes 60 days
for an aluminum can to go from aluminum
can to being illuminated plus there's a
demand for it
what we're finding with plastic is
there's not the demand for the recycled
materials that that there is the supply
of them so it's creating you know this
is creating this abundance of plastic on
the market that we just don't know what
to do with so how do we fuel the demand
yeah well one of the things that they're
finding is that it's more expensive to
recycle it than it is to use virgin so
that would you know that'll have a
tendency to but you know we just need to
get creative you know there's this
really cool new product on the market I
saw it about six weeks ago
it's called nature's milk composter it's
a composter that you can put in your
kitchen it looks like a trash compactor
it's about this size and you just put
all your compostables in the top of it
right and two weeks later this stuff
comes out composted out of the bottom
that is a cool piece of technology it's
like everybody should have one of the
I you know I've got mine on its way I
just love that idea
and we have we have the brains to come
up with solutions for all of this so we
just have to start thinking about what
are we going to use what are we going to
use all this plastics for I know what
you know I know we'll come up with
something they make out of plastics they
make benches tables I know they make
carpeting out of recycled plastic right
exactly so yes the entire right so
that's that's an interesting thought
that they recite the the plastic
industry also already is taking
something that isn't quite used from the
petroleum process yeah that's cool so
stainless water bottles this next thing
reduce reuse and let's not recycle
anymore and I usually get a bunch of you
know people saying what are you talking
about the notion here is that what comes
first
reduce alright reuse and then recycle
and what I'm finding is is that this
whole notion of recycling that's people
say oh well it's recyclable or oh I'll
recycle it and it's it's almost an easy
way to get off the hook right and it is
isn't it it is yeah it's it's a good
excuse so I'll recycle it right and
remember earlier we were talking about
one use items okay what I'm proposing is
that we look at how we can reduce or
reuse those one use items a my mom goes
you know when they bring the leftovers
home right in the leftover container and
I actually have a really cool solution
for you on that one too
but she'll know she takes the leftovers
home she eats the leftovers and then
those that leftover container lands on
my doorstep full of chicken food because
I have chickens in my yard okay and the
chickens eat all of that stuff so that
item now has been used twice okay food a
fast food container landed on my
doorstep right well Rhys
we found this item that's it's a
stainless steel take to go container and
you can actually take it to the
restaurant with you right when you have
your leftovers you just open it up put
it in there and take it out with you so
you're reducing or reducing the need to
have to even recycle that plastic how
many of you all have gone to a
restaurant you know most your food and
they come and say Oh would you like a
takeout container with that and I too
look at that and it's you know if it's
just a little bit of food it's like well
it's not really worth it
so sometimes I'll make a decision not to
take it home and sometimes we do I
noticed out in the kitchen we had paper
containers for that now that's really
cool so yeah that's another place that's
that's pressed paper takeout containers
right yeah that's something the pressed
paper is something that's easily
biodegradable okay so really what we're
doing here is we're looking at how we
can reduce our need for these items and
from a grassroots level this is where
the change is gonna happen
hey if enough of us out there say you
know what I don't want to use plastic
bottles anymore I'm just gonna use
stainless steel or you know something
that's used multiple times
I don't want straws anymore I will make
decisions it says restaurants up there I
will make decisions about where I eat
depending on what they're serving me on
and it's a little extreme I realize that
but I like to go to a you know to a
restaurant where they're actually gonna
give me a plate that they you know then
take away and stick in the dishwasher
and there isn't and then there's an
environmental cost to that also if
they're having to wash it I realized
that and that's going back to this
notion of the different shades of green
and it's like how many different shades
of green are there and the different
choices along the way that's a
particular choice that I that I make
packaging I've I've noticed that a lot
of the software companies now and a lot
of the stuff we can get online anyways
in fact I haven't bought since iTunes
came on board I bought a CD I just get
them off of iTunes I love that because
they're not giving me something that I
have all this packaging for now in fact
about a year and a half ago I loaded all
my CDs onto my computer
and I have this big box of CDs that's
sitting in you know what I do with them
I can't sell them so they're just
sitting in a corner so I actually love a
you know I love the digital age that
that part of the did a digital age so
I'm noticing that the packaging like
from Apple Computer it's made out of the
pressed paper or you know they're really
starting to get conscious about the
packaging they're putting out so anybody
want to contribute anything else that we
might do any more thoughts on what else
we can do yes yeah we actually have
available a 12 ounce water bottle this
is 20 ounce right here we have a 12
ounce water bottle on our website
that's something we can look into I
don't recall having seen a stainless
steel tumbler but yeah yeah I'm sure
they have to make them what's that urban
out there you go well you know yeah and
that goes you know that goes back to you
know this just you there's choices that
we have to make okay the all of these
stainless steel water bottles in fact
all stainless steel water bottles as
well as most of the aluminum ones are
made in China though that has its issues
too you know it's a balancing act and
really what I'm encouraging y'all to do
is just you know just pay attention to
this and notice the choices you're
making
so I was driving down the road about
about a year ago now and I started
thinking to myself what would it take
for me not to use any plastic bags again
period zero yep stop using go cold
turkey all right and in that moment I
chose not to use any more plastic bags
if I went to the grocer the agreement I
have with myself as if I get into the
grocery store and I don't have the cloth
bag my cloth bags then I put the stuff
back in the cart and loaded in my the
front seat of my car and taken home that
way I only had to do that twice before I
remembered every time okay
and so I'm you know as I'm going through
this process the next step of the
process for me was what would it take
not to use any plastic bottles so go
cold turkey on plastic bottles also that
was an easier solution stainless steel
for me it was stainless steel and I
started pondering this whole notion and
I went to my business partner Amy and I
said you know we ought to challenge the
world let's challenge the world to see
if we can get them to reduce their use
on a million plastic one use items what
would it take okay and we chatted about
it for a little while and and kind of
tossed it back and forth and you know a
million it's like a million it's not
that many anymore okay so we started
looking at a billion what would it take
to enroll enough people out there to
reduce their use of a billion items and
that's when our billion bagged bottle
bulb bag and bulb challenge was formed
okay it was we actually formed it a year
ago and it's online now you can see it
at your guide to green not yet your
guide to green.com slash campaign we'll
go look at it in a minute but the notion
is is that that we educate you in fact
your guide to green is mainly an
educational site will educate you and
give you the information that you need
in order to make informed decisions
about living green and in this case
about plastic
and really looking at your plastic use
why don't you go ahead and yeah let's go
ahead and click over there
the billion bagged bottle and bulb
challenge gives you an opportunity to
log on and that's one of the things
we're here to talk about today you can
actually log on and create your own team
okay you'll notice over here on the
right the urban farm team there are 21
members since we launched it in
September we have reduced our items
ninety four hundred and seventy nine
items over on the right I have a pointer
over on the right here the urban farm
team we've reduced the use of almost ten
thousand plastic items in six months
just my team just my team and you'll
notice that there are two hundred and
eighty nine users that are registered
and we've reduced seventy six thousand
eight hundred and ninety eight items
really what this is for is to it's to
educate it's to educate the public about
these one use items and how you do it is
you can just go to the site you can sign
up I think yeah there you go you go go
ahead and sign in once you set up a you
can there's two ways you can not set up
an account or you can set up an account
if you want obviously I've set up an
account I've reduced my use in six
months by fifteen hundred and ninety
eight items okay and so how we get to
that is remember that twelve hundred and
sixty seven plastic bags per person per
year if you say no more plastic bags
okay that you start right there with a
hundred okay and that's per capita in
the United States per person you know
per person so if you want to make that
level of commitment then when you sign
up you can say you know what I will want
you to go to the second link my pledge
you can actually the pop-up menu right
in the middle there it says I intend to
reduce the use of how many items per
month and I think we the high end is two
hundred one hundred plastic bags if
you're not using plastic bottles how
many plastic bottles do you think we use
I don't have the answer to this but how
many plastic bottles do you think we use
it's got to be 30 or 50 you're a month
for people that are drinking them every
day right yeah so just look at the
choices that you make on a daily basis
and see how you you know what level
you'd like to commit to and then then
the the interface does the rest
you actually can commit I've committed
to 200 items a month I'm pretty extreme
no more plastic bags no more plastic
bottles I you know like I said I make
choices about restaurants and want to
you know when I'm going into them and
I'm really conscious about the choices I
make about these one use items but I'd
really like to encourage you as the
office here if you can create a team
it's real simple to figure out
create a team and maybe we can get other
Google offices to create your own teams
and see if you can have a contest and
see who's the greenest Google office so
I have any questions about this that's
changing your lightbulbs out yeah that's
one thing that's what you do once yeah
okay so if you're committing to you know
10 or 15 or 20 you know these days
changing your lightbulbs out is simple
you know you can go to some of the you
know stores around town and and the
other thing about that is is that the
power companies here in Phoenix they
subsidize the bulbs so we have an
extremely reduced cost on the bulbs that
is a very good question
IKEA IKEA IKEA IKEA takes them there
places around town some of the stores
actually take the bulbs the nice thing
about that that's a good question too
the nice thing about that is
incandescent or compact fluorescent
light bulbs last forever okay I have one
in the hall of my house that I installed
in 1991 that's what 17 years ago and it
still works it no it's not on a lot I
mean it's not on thousands of hours a
year but you know I bet I get a hundred
or two hundred
a year out of that bulb and this still
works after than 18 years 17 years very
good yeah so here and here in the Google
office in Phoenix Arizona bring it on
bring it on and we'll get it recycles
okay so so this are you thinking are you
starting to think about this there are
so many things that we can do in just
about every choice that we make every
day there's a choice we can make to have
less that have less of an impact on the
planet I know some of you guys bike in
I'd love to be able to do that in fact
my one of my things is that the House of
the urban farm my office used to be in
the house so I'd get up in the morning
and I'm an early riser I get up about
5:00 5:30 in the morning and I'd commute
out commute out to my office right it's
about 25 feet out sit down work for a
couple hours commute back to my kitchen
for breakfast
catch the Today Show and get ready for
the day and then commute back out to my
office so that was one choice that I
made for many years my office was in the
house for many many years like 15
there's there's so many things it's not
just about buying a hybrid I had a guy
recently tell me you know what I can't
afford to go green I can't buy can't buy
hybrid and what I want y'all to know is
there's so many things we can do in
every choice that we make every day
there's probably an environmental impact
so
if there are any other questions yes
please so I go to the grocery store and
I say paper or plastic uh uh yes what do
we say and why I say neither is a
continuation right
yeah it's the shades of green you know
paper and plastic you're real close I
would happen to choose paper I'd choose
paper because it's highly biodegradable
okay a paper bag will break down inside
of a few months whereas a plastic bag
will last for years and years and years
that goes to my commitment to not using
plastic okay the other thing about not
using plastic hold on one sec the other
thing about not using going zero
cold-turkey on the plastic bags I
haven't been able to do it it was the
last time you bought chicken wrapped in
plastic or cereal or a bag of ice or you
know there these are these things are
all in plastic bags so we live in a
culture that we really can't get away
totally from plastic bags but there are
areas that I can make a difference and
one of them is no more plastic grocery
bags so yes
yes
they're everywhere they're giving out
their fries right well there are a few
of us that are talking about it so how
big the question is how many how big is
the how big is the problem given
nobody's talking about it I you know I
seeing things like San Francisco didn't
San Francisco recently banned the use of
plastic bags or and I think California
is looking at putting a bag tax on it I
know in Australia you can't use them
anymore we're waking up okay and it's
gonna take you asking those kind of
questions and saying you know what hold
on your time out we need to do this
differently this is we need to make a
different choice about this and it's
happening I'm seeing heaven when I was
over California I'm so excited when I
was over in California the other day I
stopped at the you know the Circle K or
the quick quick Mart on my way home and
I it's I bought a in a glass jar I
bought an Arizona iced tea and it said
tax plus tax and something else I can't
remem with is something else was and I
asked about it what it was said that's
the bottle deposit I paid a dime deposit
on that bottle that you know I'm not
gonna take it back because I'm not going
to California but you know so things are
happening like that that is starting to
impact the use of those those items and
so that's one area to do it and then
just we're just change our mind about it
you know let's just not use them there's
other things that we can choose yes I
saw something recently where they're
finding that plastic is accumulating in
the ocean oh yes the big right there is
there is reportedly and I think there's
a reference to this on our website the
article on it
there's reportedly off of Hawaii an area
this circling that's the size of Texas
that is full of plastic just floating on
the top and I'm reading a book oh my
gosh I can't remember the title of the
book but I'm reading a book that talks
about these researchers over in England
they're there daily for the past 5 or 10
years they've been going on this beach
and collecting plastic and taking
samples and the amount of
plastic stuff that's coming up on the
beaches is just amazing all the way down
to little little tiny balls that is
plastic that is breaking down but it
doesn't biodegrade it just breaks down
to these little plastic balls that end
up in the sand the animals then take in
and you know there's that impact so yes
go back to the plastic bag the
University stores not some grocery
stores actually if you bring into your
cloth wings actually give you like bison
five cents yeah yeah some of the grocery
stores are giving you an off if you
bring in by the way yeah what stores are
friendly to this because like last
weekend they have to automate the get
out what stores are friendly you know a
lot of them are waking up I mean the
friendliest ones Whole Foods Trader
Joe's you know I know Whole Foods I
think on Earth Day they get this this
year 2008 they gave up no more plastic
bags I haven't been in since then but so
you know they're waking up I heard fries
you know they're there it's not so
common not so strange anymore to go into
a you know one of the major chains and
bring your bags and they they don't look
at you funny anymore five years ago they
looked at us funny
yes right that is excellent when you go
for other shopping when you go shopping
elsewhere take your bags with you also
absolutely you know what the interesting
thing you know as you can tell from my
talk today I'm pretty extreme when it
comes to this I'm pretty you know
progressive when this come into comes to
that and that's thought of you know
taking it in form I want to buy clothes
just occurred to me recently just
occurred to me recently and I think
that's part you know we have so much of
this coming at us right now that you
know it takes a while sometimes for it
to sink in and that's okay too you know
that's okay too we can do what I'm a
firm believer that we do the best that
we can do with the information that we
have at the time you know and when new
information comes out then we can make
new decisions
so please the water in Arizona yes yes
right
yes however then and some offices were
saying it was affected that that they
found people just drinking less water
how do you know anything about filter
systems tap water yeah well you know and
in Phoenix the the big the big challenge
is the taste you know and if it's cool
the so it's coming out and drinking
found it doesn't taste so bad but that's
the problem here in Phoenix and you know
the the tap water in Phoenix is safe
okay the city makes sure to that but it
tastes yucky yeah that's a technical
term the best thing you can do there's
there's you know filter systems asking
questions you should that you should be
asking of the people you're getting the
systems from yeah very landlord will put
it in right well there's two main kinds
of systems excuse me there's two main
kinds of systems there's the reverse
osmosis and that takes everything out of
the water okay and then there's the
charcoal filters and there's a couple of
really good like 10 stage charcoal
filters that the water tastes really
good coming out of it and that's the
thing if you you know if you give the
people in the office something that
tastes good they're gonna drink more of
it right so really you want to find out
from the landlord what what system
they're putting in is it a reverse
osmosis is a charcoal and the that's the
main question
I think so I think so and I have a
reverse osmosis system of my house right
people actually prefer some minerals in
the water
yes see that's the thing about reverse
osmosis it takes all of the minerals out
okay then you have to we have to put
them back in our body somehow okay
whereas charcoal doesn't do that and I
think that's what has it taste a little
bit better is the charcoal filter it's
not taking all the minerals out it's
just taking the bad stuff out so yes
please why does our tap water taste
yucky and or have we just be conditioned
to prefer the taste of something
differently Oh interesting
why does our tap water taste yucky and
have we just been conditioned I suspect
that that's part of it then we've been
conditioned however I know that my tap
water at my house tastes yucky you know
there's a certain I mean and it's not
all that bad I mean I can sit there and
drink a glass of it okay it's not all
that unpleasant you know I've got you
know we've got the water's coming
through copper pipes and in some houses
galvanized pipe and so it's you know
it's picking up the tastes of that I'm
you know I I would say that's why it
doesn't taste so good is because it's
you know it's travelling how many miles
is it traveling underground and a pipe
to come to our house but then it should
taste the same every city in America
yeah basic business and that's not the
case water taste different differences
our water you have to be cases of water
do you have whether it's water tastes
different from ground water oh we have
so that is attached has
we're all content in it a lot of this
all throughout so that's one taste and
then this stuff that's on the surface
that the canal water it's pretty
biologically active for just long time
and so it's in a completely different
taste but right to a certain extent
exactly right in New Mexico where I
lived the water tasted worse and worse
over time because as more people moved
in they're going to less preferable
sources for reitman right and I was on a
farm actually a few years ago in
Illinois or something like that and they
couldn't drink the the well water
because it was too high in Sulphur okay
so it's just you know there's the
environmental causes along the way yeah
I'm sure we can find out the answer to
the exact answer to that I just don't
have it off top of my head waters gonna
taste really different if it comes
through hard rocks it goes through some
banks oh that's interesting to me
soft rocks are you did you have one more
okay I love that you know you're like me
I usually sit in the front though you
know the professors at ASU and I was
there used to throw things at me shop
yes
oh my gosh incredible amount you see
little things that you've been here a
few times yes right is there is there
things here in the Google office you
could be doing better so I haven't seen
anything glaring at me I haven't seen
anything glaring at me and I typically
take notice of that just because I've
been doing it for so long but and I've
been coming to your green meeting so
next screen meeting how about if we'll
walk around and we'll have that
conversation I'd be more than happy to
do that that'd be fun for me yeah
absolutely absolutely well I really want
to thank you guys for letting me come in
and share with you today this is what I
love to do if I could do this every day
all day I'd be in in heaven please check
out our challenge your guide to Green
Comm slash campaigned and you know
create a team here that'd be great
we are also on our website we put out a
weekly tip there real simple I know we
are so busy these days that my tips that
I send out are two paragraphs and they
connect you they connect you back to an
article weekly article on a particular
topic so that really your guide to green
is about educating how can we get people
learning about this stuff and asking
questions so thank you very much for
having me I appreciate it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
