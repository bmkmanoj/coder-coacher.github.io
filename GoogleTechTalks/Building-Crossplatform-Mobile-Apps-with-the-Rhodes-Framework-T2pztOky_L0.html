going to talk about building mobile apps
on various phones that all use a C
framework with Ruby which is very
exciting idea for me and take it away so
today I'm going to talk to you about how
you can build mobile apps for pretty
much all smartphones iPhone Android
Windows Mobile blackberry all writing
them one time using this framework that
we have called roads so real briefly the
company that we've released roads is
called Roma bole and our mission is to
mobilize applications very quickly with
a great user experience and the basic
idea is to provide the high level
productivity and portability of web
programming that that I'm sure most of
you are are used to using but still
provide the customization and offline
capability of native mobile apps that
you might write in the native SDKs
whether it be objective-c for the iPhone
or Java for Android and make all this
available open source for rapid adoption
by developers so quick background on
this as you know that smartphone sales
are exploding there there are five major
smartphone operating systems but one of
the problems is that the growth leaders
are the installed base laggards so what
would you target you'd have a hard time
sort of building just for either iPhone
or Android and the other thing that's
happened is that native apps have sort
of won today right users sort of won
stuff that runs on their phones and
doing sort of interactive you know apps
where people are creating information
and doing that from mobile web browsers
is just something that users are just
not interested in doing today probably
if I gave this presentation a year ago
people would say well I'll just you know
build my mobile web app and and I think
now when I talk to developers about this
I say well
this is not the right session go even
though we're all about html4
productivity
it's HTML to build apps that run
natively on the phone whether you're
connected or disconnected so that's what
we let you do with roads we let you
build the app quickly in HTML and Ruby
you write it once and it runs on all
smartphones we actually think that
you're you'll generally write just like
with a good rails app you'll write most
of your UI or do most of your UI
customization in HTML because we have an
app generator that generates basic
scaffolding of an app and most of our
developers tell us they spend most of
their time just playing with the Ruby
templates the e RB HTML templates Rhodes
is also focused on synched local data so
does that mean that you can't write
stuff it roads on the phone that you
know reaches out and grabs from XML
feeds and you know using the net HTTP
libraries and you can do all that but we
provide this infrastructure this server
called rhosync and a sync client that
lets you write your apps so that your
development experiences that you're
writing to data that's local on the
device you have an ORM and it just looks
like the data's local and that whole
problem of how do you get data from the
back-end to the to the device is
something that if you'd like roads can
solve for you we also want to exploit
device capabilities so it's all about
writing rich apps right that's another
reason why the mobile web approaches is
not as good because you want to be able
to use the GPS that's on your device you
want to be able to use the camera on the
video and the local contacts these
devices are very powerful and you want
to you want to use them so we allow you
to do that as well it's with combination
of an extended set of tags but also Ruby
libraries so sort of whatever you need
for your app if you want to just have
the location the GPS location you can
just put a geolocation tag in your HTML
templates if you need to do something
more sophisticated like look at the
latitude or longitude and do some kind
of computation on it and then
conditionally do things and we have Ruby
libraries that give you
as to that as well and this is all
available open source it's up on
github.com slash Roma Bowl and that's
real-time so it's always current
with with whatever our check-ins are
it's not like snapshots if you if you
don't see a check in multiple check-ins
every day then you know ping us and say
get back to work
so that two components that you'll
generally use in your apps are roads
which is a micro framework for building
locally executing natively optimized
mobile apps you'll basically run an app
generator for the objects that you care
about and then you'll edit HTML
templates then you'll just do a build
and then you'll have a functioning we
have rake scripts that do builds for all
of the major smartphone os's along the
way we had to build the first mobile
Ruby implementations for all of these
different platforms the one exception is
Symbian there is a Symbian Ruby that was
funded by the Symbian foundation and a
company called pragmatic aam that we
worked with built that for the Symbian
foundation that is actually out there
it's available open source but they
don't unlike us they don't keep every
check in live so like the current
version is not actually available but we
started with theirs and then we've made
a bunch of optimizations to make it work
better on smaller devices just on the
issue of the Ruby implementations John
was sort of asking the question like
well you know how can you possibly be is
pretty big how do you fit it on all
these devices and this is where the
framework gives us an advantage the
important thing is that the code that
you would write in the framework right
and you're sort of working within our
MVC framework the code that you would
write within that has to work it's not
that any Ruby code that you could ever
think up has to work so we don't have
every ruby gem in there like we don't
have the XML support in there could you
add that it's all open source right and
the framework just gets compiled into
your application so you can absolutely
pull all the gems you want in
your project we don't stop you from
doing that but because we have a
framework can start with a very
stripped-down Ruby implementation
because and that handles 98% of what
programmers need to do and but if
anybody wants to take it and says well I
really we have I'm an adjunct at
Carnegie Mellon and and some of the
students there want to use roads and
implement XMPP to do real-time
communication and they want to add that
those libraries there are some Ruby
libraries for this and we said great
just do it you know would we take that
back and put it into the framework
probably not unless there's a real
compelling case to do that so and then
the other piece we have is is rhosync
which is a it's a sync server that's
focused on web service data it's focused
on apps that expose some kind of rest or
soap web service that you would connect
to so and that could be nowadays that's
basically any app but it's unlike a lot
of other previous sync servers like in
tell us and consider they're all about
syncing databases which ironically
enough is a sort of a harder problem in
general so it's a little simpler now
with all these web services that are
exposed but there are also some things
that make it harder and in telecine was
actually discontinued because they never
made the shift you know to being
optimized for web services but so that's
what rhosync does what all you really
need to know is the developer is if you
want to have something that will sync to
a back-end you need to implement one
Ruby class it has six methods log in
query create update delete and log off
and whatever your back-end exposes that
you want to get to as long as you can
write Ruby code that within those six
functions it'll just work so this is the
architecture of what we've been talking
about here so your app is all these gold
things so you have a controller which
you would expect right in an MVC
framework and you have a bunch of HTML
templates
happen to be ER be files and then on the
back end it and nobody's forcing you to
use rhosync if you want to do all your
own real-time data capturing and
retrieving you can do that but if you
want to use row sync to sync up you
write this what we call a source adapter
and that's this class that has the six
methods and so in this example I had you
know an app that has like two objects in
it that's another thing that that roads
apps are sort of good for if you want to
sort of do like a mobile mashup where
you're maybe getting data from different
different sources the best apps I've
seen do quite a bit of that you know
they'll get interesting data from
various places so in this example
there's you know a couple objects and so
there's more than one controller for
each of these objects some templates for
them and then source adapters so and
then we provide all the things in red so
we have these Ruby interpreters we have
a simple Oh our M it's called ROM and so
what it is it's just a very
stripped-down
object relational manager if you look at
things like hibernate or even active
record there's no way I mean if active
record could have fit on the device we
would have used active record but not
only is active record too big but so is
data mapper and so it's OGG and they're
just all like at least an order of
magnitude too big so ROM is just this
very stripped-down ORM and then of
course we have this rhosync client that
knows to talk to the roasting server and
sends its data back and forth to the
server very efficiently we use JSON to
do that and sort of tries to optimize
you know just getting the data it needs
from the server the server sort of
keeping a cache of what that device
should have and then trickle syncing
that as appropriate down to the device
now there's another intriguing box here
people usually ask about like wait you
have a web server there why do you have
a web server there what's why is that
red box there so anybody have any
guesses why web servers there it's all
about local data why would we have a web
server in the framework
so the reason why is we don't want to
have to handle all the we want people to
write in HTML because it's familiar but
we don't want to write an HTML renderer
for every device so what we do is we use
the browser component that shifts with
whatever smartphone OS is there and the
good news is is that in 2009 you've got
really good embeddable browser
components for all of these platforms
and nobody can tell when once you've
build your app by the way that it's
written with that browser component
we'll talk about later we do some
styling with if anybody's ever seen I UI
which is a joke Hewitt there's now a
Facebook wrote this library so that you
can write HTML but it looks like a
native iPhone app and so we've taken
that sort of basic approach extended it
made it even more optimal but then did
it for all the other os's so the net
result is even though there's a browser
there you can't really tell it looks
very close to a native app but all of
those browser controls expect to be
talking to a web server so that's why we
have we have a very very lightweight
stripped-down web server within there
and then we have another piece we ship
with sequel Lite and we have a bunch of
synced local data sitting on top of
sequel Lite so those are the third-party
components so we shipped with a couple
sample apps one for Sugar CRM
their open source CRM source sales
management package so we shipped with
that sample we shipped with one for
Siebel filled service and there's a
number of third-party apps that are
coming out now there's a company called
carry the day that has a product called
trail guide which is a mobile interface
to Basecamp it's a very nice app it's
out now vdg group is about to release a
product called mobile lighthouse
lighthouse is a hosted bug tracking
system and so this is a mobile interface
to that also written with roads and
Hampton Catlin who is a pretty prominent
Ruby developer he wrote Hamill which is
a
templating system we don't support he's
actually not suggested that we do it
would be heavier weight we use generic
er B templates is a simpler templating
mechanism but Hampton Catlin had written
an entire iPhone app for the Wikipedia
it was one of the top-selling phones on
the App Store then Wikipedia basically
bought him and his app and said we want
it to be free so then he rewrote the
whole thing for the iPhone and then he
read about our stuff and Ruby inside and
said oh I'm gonna throw throw that away
which he did he actually pulled it off
of github and he rewrote it in rows and
now it runs on all devices so let's talk
about the overview of what it means to
build the roads app and then we'll go
and actually write one so the the first
step is as in with most rails apps you
sort of want to start with your data
right what's the data that you're
working with you don't have to you can
build your roads up first make it run
locally and then you know work you know
decide what data are syncing with in
general we think it doesn't work quite
as well that way it's better to start
with what the data is so we recommend
that you create what we call a sync
source so you write your source adapter
code we give you a we give you a test
interface to do that so you can just
test it from the web interface and make
sure that you're bringing back all the
data any anybody that's sort of
interested in sync I've actually written
most of the code for row sync and we do
a number of things in row sync that are
sort of I think better ways of doing
sync but I'm not gonna drill into those
now we can talk about it later if you
want codes all up there you can take a
look at it on github then you want to
generate your app your actual roads app
that runs on the client so you'll run
row gen and and it it generates your er
B templates and your controller and then
you'll just edit the code edit the HTML
and then you do a build and you have a
functioning app so let's try it shall we
so okay so
what I'm gonna do is say ro Gienapp and
I'm gonna call it my new app by the way
if you're not sure the usage just say ro
gen app now by the way Rodian is a gem
like any other gem John and I were
talking earlier about how gems are just
such a great way of getting
functionality far better than things
like seat pan and apt-get etc it's just
a great way of getting developer tools
so you just say gem install roads and
you'll get roads installed on your
device so that's where we got row gen
fron from as long as you've done gem
install routes you will have Rho gen and
it says okay app options it basically
just wants a name so and there's a
variety of other options but I'm just
gonna say ro Gienapp my new app okay and
you can see we've got a bunch of files
this is hard discipline standing still
so we have this app directory and we've
got a bunch of yarby templates in there
we've got a config RB file that lets us
configure the app and we've got this
public should seem very familiar those
of you that are our rails developers I
understand that's a perhaps few and far
between here but so what we'll do is now
what we want to do is we want to
generate a model we can probably will
want to create multiple models right but
let's start with one so I'm gonna write
this little contact manager app and I'm
gonna call my model contact well let's
first look at Rodin model just to look
at the usage so it says okay what you
want to do is give us a name a source
URL and a source ID now if I had done
what I'd recommend it to you guys which
is you know define your sync source
adapter what I would do is I would just
take the source URL the URL where that
sync source adapter is exposed which
would be like on my test machine we like
localhost you know apps localhost my app
you know source
and I would take that and supply it what
I want to do is show how easy it is to
create a simple you know offline app
which I don't think you've seen yet I
built something from scratch like that
did the whole sync we can also create
something that isn't necessarily about
sync at all so though I'm gonna say ro
Jan model like actually let me go into
the my new app directory okay now I'm
gonna say ro gen model contact and then
I'm gonna say no source URL but I'll
give it a source ID and I'll say like
name comma phone okay and now I've got
the model should again as a rails
developer you could either used to have
a model many of your scaffolding code
and that's what we have so now I'll just
fire up my trusty textmate and we'll
look at our new app so this is our app
you can see that we've got a top-level
thing here and then we have all the call
the scaffolding to go and deal with
editing creating new contact records and
then we have this controller here it's
just a ruby file looks very similar to
the typical rails scaffolding for for
doing basic crud on objects but there
are some differences some of the URL
differences are the URL convention like
like gets and you know when what what do
you do for a delete is a bit different
than you get with rails now any those of
you that are mobile developers any
guesses why because it would be great
obviously if we could we would just
follow all the rails conventions for
URLs so the reason why is these mobile
browsers are all over the map in terms
of the actual rest verbs that they
support some of them don't support
delete some of them you know do put in
an unusual way so we viewed as closely
as we could to the rails sort of rest
conventions but they're not quite
exactly the same for that reason it's
also part of the value of a mobile
oriented framework so I don't really
have to do much here to get something
useful the first thing I want to do
though is is just provide a link to this
this object that the contact object by
the way our one Oh is about to release
and you won't actually have to the idea
is that we built our app first and then
we built the model so now we have to go
like tell our app about our model
there's actually a lighthouse issue for
one oh where it will it will actually
the model generator will modify the the
app homepage but generally you're gonna
want to edit this homepage and do cool
branding stuff with it and you can use
you know your familiar HTML Javascript
CSS toolkit to do that something like
contacts here and that's it you know
this is just just HTML so you can sort
of go as far as you want with that and
notice that that HTML is very generic
here it's just div tags right and
there's a reason for that any reason
what why notice that there's no sort of
like styling like right in here the
reason why is we want to you generally
want to create very generic HTML here
and then we ship with the framework all
the styling in libraries so we have we
use I you I it's 90% I you I to sort of
style
all of these div tags so that it looks
like you know a native iPhone app same
thing for Windows Mobile and blackberry
and we've done our sort of best attempt
at you know making something that's
native and this is an area where we know
the community will do better we've
already gotten a number of community
submissions and I know in the styling
for things like Symbian the community is
gonna do better than than we would so
let's go ahead and just do our build now
so we're in our my new app directory and
let's do a rake - key and you can see
all the cool tools that we have and so
we have the ability to build for
blackberry iPhone Windows Mobile and you
can you can just build or you can build
and run
for all of those now notice any any
glaring omissions on that list so
there's no Android build right now and
in fact that's sort of the missing piece
that's we're not scheduled to release
until March 10th anyway but the team is
furiously working on making sure that
Android has to be you know at a par with
everything else so it actually does run
it runs on devices pretty well runs
really slow on emulators which is why
I'm not demoing it today and but we
don't have the automated build we have a
step by step if you go out to our wiki
we have a excruciating step-by-step
guide for all of the environments but
most people just use the rake scripts
now and so we'll have the stuff for
Android soon so let's go ahead and do a
build and run for iPhone so you'll see
it fires up my emulator and I've got and
by the way if I had my device connected
it would just launch that off as well on
my device it's a little bit harder to
demo from we ship with it obviously you
can put your own icons on it this
happens to be the icon that we ship with
the other thing I wanted to emphasize
about this build process is it's just
our framework around your app right like
nobody knows that it's roads based right
so it's all just compiled together even
though it's cooler now that I can do the
rake scripts when I do
I used to the demo that you saw I was
doing my builds from Xcode so it made it
very obvious right that it's sort of
just your app and we're effectively just
some libraries I think now with this
black box it may you know with just a
rake script is not that easy necessarily
to tell that this is just your func
running app you know you can it
obviously won't have the roads icon but
it's indistinguishable from any other
app so you see this is the app that we
created it has a contacts list I can say
create a new contact
give my name because all the basic crud
is built in obviously you would want to
go in and change the the styling or you
know just the layout of the fields or
add whatever you want so now I've got
atom as a record and I've got a link to
new contact and you know you'll party on
these HTML files and and and edit it to
your heart's content and create the user
experience that you're looking for okay
so so that's sort of writing the whole
roads app there's this other thing of
defining a row sync source and as we
mentioned you're just really creating a
handful of methods you're creating a
login method so log into whatever your
back-end system is you can create a
query method that retrieves and reads
objects from the back-end source our
tutorial tells you what you have to do
to write that query method there is
basically that query method brings it
back in to typically you're getting it
back as XML then we sort of separate the
part from you've done the query and now
you want to like populate the the cache
on the server the form that we cache it
in is what we call object attribute
value triples it the objects are called
object values and we have generic code
in that sync operation that does it for
the vast majority of your stuff so
you'll see it sort of takes apart what
you've gotten back and it creates these
object attribute value triples that can
represent essentially arbitrary data and
one of the things that that we do and
because this is a Tech Talk I'll talk
more about it then I'm generally like I
haven't heard me talk about it before it
other meetups so one of the things that
we do in row sync that's unusual is so
if you look at any of these other sync
servers that have been out there like
Intel asynch and Motorola had this
product called starfish and what they
all do is they they sort of have these
databases here and they figure out the
data they need to get and they serialize
it over the wire in some
equivalent of object attribute values
right because it's a generic format that
can handle sending anything right the
the object ID in question you know an
attribute like the user's address and
then the value and then they get on the
other side and they sort of put it all
back together in a database right and
that's what they all do and that's in
the end that's a rather complex and
expensive operation so what Rosen does
that's a little bit unusual is takes it
from the back end in a way that's
usually a little bit closer to this
object attribute value format because
it's reading from some kind of
serialized XML anyway this sync method
that we provide but you can sort of
change if you need to then creates these
object values right on the server when
it goes then it goes down to the device
we keep it in that object value format
so we basically create a copy of this
sort of generic you could call it a
proper tea bag schema right this generic
property bag schema this object value
table then exists on the device so we
don't have a whole bunch of relational
tables right there's like the table and
the reason why we don't have to put it
back together into relational tables is
in 2009 people expect to use an ORM it's
a program to write they're not expecting
to write sequel statements so when you
write your roads app you're using ROM I
mean you can write sequel statements
against that object value table right
the the property back schema if you want
but it's not gonna seem like you know
your typical thing of like selecting
from your users table and your locations
table and your company's table it's all
in one table and we get massive
efficiencies by doing the sync to that
one table and yet it's still easy for
the developer because they're just they
have an ORM that mediates it so that's
maybe more than you wanted to know about
why we did things the way we did in row
6 yes
yeah it's it's not it's not really
different at all I mean that you could
it really does beg the question is SQL
Lite overkill and it probably is because
it really is just a big table so we've
been talking about that is there
I believe SQLite is overkill for what
we're doing there and we'll probably do
something more efficient there this was
it was like the fastest path to get it
out there right is but we absolutely do
not need the power of SQL and on
blackberry we don't what we want to find
is some real stripped down database that
that has far less and then rely on the
rom the ORM to do most of the work for
us
so on blackberry we don't actually use
SQLite we use purse light which is
simpler and that's that's a whole other
topics like what's the right back-end
given the simplicity of what we're
really doing there so it's a good
question so this is what you've seen
this is the process of generating a
roads app so upcoming developments we
released Oh dot three in early February
the big changes where we had GPS across
all the platforms PIM access across the
platforms we added Symbian support we
actually added it for there's a bunch of
I'm a adjunct at Carnegie Mellon there's
a bunch of PhD students doing Symbian
projects so they wanted us to do Symbian
ahead of Android that's my excuse for
not doing Android before simian know if
that watch this but our one oh release
will be released in about a week and
that has full Android the Android stuff
is all checked in you can actually build
an app with it it's just sort of a
painful build process so we have to add
the rigged scripts for Android and then
we can declare victory
it has device capabilities it has camera
support it has SMS support and the other
thing that's coming up and it will
probably be a couple weeks after that is
this product called row hub so you can
think of row hub as basic how many
people have seen what Heroku does so
what Heroku does it's basically it's a
hosted development site
like you write your whole rails app
online it's great stuff big fan of
Heroku we had a number of people that
said you know I love roads but you know
I got to go set up a rhosync server to
do this and you know then I build the
stuff and I have all these versions that
I need to make available to people and
we're we're gonna make available a
provisioning server open source to let
help people with that but ok I've got to
have a sync server and then I have to
have a provisioning server and I have to
have I have to set up these development
environments right to do bills even if I
use your rake scripts I need to have
something there that the rake scripts
can call right the iPhone SDK has to be
there the Symbian SDK has to at least be
installed
so what roja does it says you don't have
to install anything you don't have to
install SDKs you don't have to install a
sync server you don't have to install a
provisioning server you just get online
you generate your app we generate both
sides for you right the the sync server
stuff and the client side stuff and you
only breach object you only describe you
know the attributes for that object one
time right but it does both client and
server and you edit it online right you
know you generate the HTML you edit the
HTML online and then you just say built
so that is actually we're gonna go to
private beta very soon so anybody that's
interested if you register on row hub
comm to get into private beta we're
gonna let the first hundred people in
and as soon as our beta users tell us
it's ready to go then we'll go live so
I'm guessing that'll be something like
the end of the month I mean we're it's
it's primarily a service to just help
accelerate people so we're not really in
a huge hurry to put it out there it'll
be when users say say it's ready so I
guess my summary is why roads and ro
mobile we believe that the declarative
tag-based approach to development has
been shown sort of time and time again
you know the whole web development
paradigm of just writing HTML versus
writing - then you know procedural
code is is more productive we think that
the rich client a rich client that takes
advantage of the device and works
against sync local data is a much better
experience than mobile remote web app
luckily that's not a hard sell much
anymore we allow you to write at once
and it works on all smartphones and it's
open source from the ground up so with
that is it makes sense to open the floor
to questions framework itself can be
treated as a library or is it always
bundled in I'm also curious if you
second question for the rendering HTML
of style sheets are you taking a lot of
the work that Apple did to sort of
promote building apps that use a browser
and sort of using all those same kind of
style metaphors or is that I'm
infringing and I used to having to do
something different that's the same
design so what what we've done is we
actually have tried to do the the latter
which is create a native life experience
like Apple was promoting for you know
web apps that take advantage of you know
iPhone specific tags and we started with
the I UI to do that and most of the
stuff is I UI but we've sort of gone
further than that and tried to do that
against all platforms and there's
varying degrees of ability to do that I
think if you see some of our more
full-fledged apps like if you run that
you can download our Sugar CRM app or
you can just build it locally I think
we've achieved that for iPhone
I think blackberry and Windows mo
blackberry and Windows Mobile look
pretty good
we definitely have not gotten there for
Symbian in terms of I mean the Symbian
apps look like Web Apps I mean they're
at their local data right and they have
native device capability but they're
pretty plain we just don't have all that
knowledge we're actually hoping our
community is going to sort of
contribute you know styling as they do
their projects because we have
developers that want to do Symbian
support and just because we're new to
Android
you know are probably it's probably fair
to say that our Android apps are also
pretty plain vanilla so when I'm sorry
can you repeat your first question so
right now I mean it's a it's a gem right
so you you do your gem gem install and
then that gem is available but oh you
mean shared amongst all your apps like
DLL style or something no nothing's
shared so this is actually a good
question we actually have the capability
of doing this and we've thought a lot
about your point is well-taken we're
about we're between two and three Meg's
so you could say geez on some devices
you'd install multiple apps you know and
they all take two and three Meg's in
other words it's two and three Meg's
after you've compiled anything the good
news is your app codes real small right
so your app code on top of our stuff is
almost imperceptible but you're right
there's absolutely some duplication we
made a conscious decision to very much
focus on the I just want to build my one
app scenario there's certainly some
inefficiencies there and to me the the
idea that you want to make it more
efficient by by by taking advantage of
the all these things that you have in
all the apps right they all have a web
server they all have you know they all
have the rhosync client they all have
the browser component you know isn't
this duplication you want to make it
more efficient we will do that
eventually sort of driven by user demand
um I mean it's it's the right question
to ask but it also sort of feels like
the problem of success right people love
it so much they want to release a bunch
of apps we also want to very much stay
away from like we want roads to be in
the background like it's your app right
and we don't want people to know that
there's roads so we very much stay away
from the idea that roads is this like
runtime right that you get and then you
download apps for that runtime that
certainly would be a way around this
efficiency problem but I don't think it
it doesn't we can do something more
about shared libraries in the scenarios
where people want to share things but we
we would only go as far as you've
described was just the shared library we
would not go as far as well here's this
roads runtime and you can download apps
so so full disclosure we're only using
1/9 on everything but Java based devices
so we're using 1/9 for Symbian we're
using runt 1/9 for iPhone and we're
using 1/9 for Windows Mobile so Symbian
iPhone Windows Mobile we on Android and
Blackberry like JRuby did JRuby is just
too big
we always subset the Ruby anyway so that
we fit but JRuby was too big so we
started with X Ruby which is sort of a
dead ended project but it was small
enough to work with and in the end it's
sort of our Ruby now if maybe the second
part of that question is so are you guys
like the mobile Ruby company and we're
not the mobile Ruby company we're the
framework company I I'm a big fan of
Ruby I think they'll be native Ruby's
for all these devices and I'm more than
happy if it doesn't come from us so
today to answer your question we are one
eight one eight six base
for for Java based platforms for both
blackberry and Android and then 1-9 for
everything else and we're sort of hoping
that that either contributions come from
the community to take everything up to
1/9 or that mobile Ruby implementations
will emerge that we can just take
advantage of yes so one of the things
the question was are there apps in the
App Store that are built on this so we
have several developers that we're
working with that we know are sort of
about to release like imminently when I
say imminently like in the next week or
two so all the people I mentioned are
about to release we don't know all the
people that use our stuff its github is
even more sort of anonymous than source
for it right it's worse for today at
least give you metrics right we know are
like Watchers on github and we know that
we've gotten plenty of get clones but we
don't have any real view into that so
there's so many apps in the App Store
people may well have use our stuff and
to do something simple and submit would
be very easy we would be easy to do so
there may be some the ones that the
developers that we've developed close
relationships with the usually the
reason why is they're doing fairly
ambitious large projects right like
mobile Wikipedia and so they're just in
that whole testing cycle that you have
with large projects and we're a new
framework so the answer is none that
we're aware of there will be several
like if I come back and talk to you
about row hub in a month or something
there'll be several out there by then no
so there's the rule 3 3 2 that some of
you are probably familiar with and what
that because some people say well wait a
minute Ruby's an interpreter and you
know you can't have an interpreter so
turns out there's many apps that clearly
have an interpreter embedded so the like
the the iPhone telnet client there's a
shelling right so there's clearly an
interpreter there
so there's plenty of other interpreters
and other apps so having the Ruby
interpreter per se is not violating what
you're not allowed to do per rule 3 3 2
is download interpreted code except with
the exception of if you use the browser
component you're allowed to download
JavaScript but in any other context like
you can't download JavaScript as some
like command line JavaScript or some
kind of built-in JavaScript you can't
load you can't download any code which
then gets interpreted except with the
exception of if you know JavaScript
downloaded to your browser component so
what this means is there's nothing wrong
with having the Ruby interpreter if you
want to sort of be violating if you
wrote code it would be a little tricky
to do this within our framework but say
you just said I don't want to use your
framework I just want to use the Ruby
somebody could could deliberately try to
try to write an infringing app by
writing code that downloaded the Ruby
and then executed it with our
interpreter and that is possible in
order to not give people some you know
that much rope to hang themselves like
we don't support eval like we took it
out really to protect people from doing
things that would allow them to be
infringing unknowingly but if somebody
wants to be infringing this is not going
to stop them there's ways to get at the
whole dynamic nature of Ruby you know
beyond doing evals there's other ways of
doing it and so they can be infringing
if they want to but if they really want
to be infringing there's a lot easier
ways to do it than to use roads or a
Ruby interpreter for that matter
they could just get some shell
interpreters which is like a hundredth
the size to do it yeah
it's it's about three Meg's now I was
sort of hoping it would be around two
and we think there's some things that we
can do to get back down to two it hasn't
been our focus for one Oh so we're right
around three Meg's with your app you
know your app plus it is about three
Meg's it's not actually a problem on any
other devices like being that big it
just feels a little too big it's a bit
bigger than we wanted it to be for some
of the reasons we talked about like the
f3 makes is no big deal for one app but
you add enough three Meg's three Meg's
here and three Meg's there and you're
starting to talk you know real real
overly large footprints so there are
some very specific things that we can do
like not having a full-on database to
store the object values table that would
save us a lot of space so there's a
there's a lot of room for optimization
still even though we're you know if you
look at sort of our footprint of our
Ruby plus our framework versus like you
know ruby plus rails on a server we're
between one and two orders of magnitude
smaller but there's a there's a fair
amount of ways to go so I would say that
by you know say that you know next
several months so we can get back down
to two Meg's but it hasn't it just
hasn't sort of hit the top of the
priority list so I can tell you what
we're all working on now is building a
great Android implementation yeah
that's an interesting question so I mean
it's all because it's all open source
you can you can absolutely like feel
free to mix in your own C libraries one
of the big one of the interesting
specific scenarios is like would you
want the ability to like okay get out
from under your Ruby and like
all some objective-c library right we're
clearly doing it for specific device
capabilities so if it's just I want to
get to the GPS or accelerometer or all
these things but there may be some other
context where you just say I don't want
to do this in Ruby I want to do this in
objective-c and I still want to use it
from your app so this is definitely
possible to do and we do have we even
have a lighthouse ticket to have some
documentation on the wiki on exactly how
to do that because I think I think
that's a good thing to be able to do the
other thing is and that's actually gonna
fall out of we're gonna have guides on
the wiki for people that say I you know
I love the approach that I get device
capabilities with HTML tags but I'm not
willing to wait for you to provide that
capability so for example we had a
developer that asked us about proximity
detection you know the whole
controversial thing where Google used
the proximity detection API sand and in
your awesome search capability for
Google for the iPhone and so I've talked
to developers that said I would really
like to have that proximity detection
API like in my Ruby code right as a Ruby
call and it's a very cool thing and
we'll eventually do it
it's probably not going to make the
priority list for like the next three
releases but we have developers that say
I want to do it today so we'll have some
documentation on the wiki that says okay
you want to create your own tag for
something device specific here's how you
go do it with accelerometer is very high
on the list actually accelerometer will
be one one so we're doing our 100 which
we're in the finishing strokes of and
then accelerometers is just very high in
the list and it's on enough different
devices that it makes sense to do
proximity detection because it's not
really on a lot of devices will be
somewhat lower on the list
you know we're very much driven by
customer requests so if we had somebody
who's like actively developing an app
and they say I want barcode scanning
we'll just do it so if you look at sort
of our road map it really isn't one of
the reasons people say well why is it
one else one Oh is essentially
everything we sort of talked about doing
you know a reasonably robust set of
device capabilities you know the basic
right your app as HTML and it runs
across all the major platforms so one oh
we're sort of done like what the core of
what I our ideas are so now we are like
a customer feature request machine so
file a lighthouse issue and we'll do it
absolutely yes and we're gonna that's
what I'm saying is we're gonna put
documentation on the wiki we have all of
our documentation up on the wiki now
we've even had customers like edit it
you know for us on the wiki like say
well I think we need to add this step
and we'll have documentation on the wiki
that says here's how you go and add your
own capability to our set yeah mm-hmm
so if this is like a better way to
access device capabilities then probably
yes we don't have any specific plans
around that now and we probably just
need to get there's no question we're
still learning about Android so we
should probably have a direct discussion
about it afterwards and we'd love to be
educated by you guys on that yeah
aha that's an excellent question
so it really was always about the
question was can rhosync run an online
mode rather than just offline mode and I
think tell me if this is entering your
question so rhosync sort of makes the
assumption that the server the rhosync
server connects to your back-end grabs
all the data it needs to has it
available for whenever that mobile
client chooses to connect and then you
know gets that data to the client so
there's a scenario where a client just
wants to get immediately get data from
the backend and for which it really
doesn't make sense to be storing these
object value triples on the server it
really just wants data from the backend
and in fact the specific requester of
this was Wikipedia they said we don't
need to store this stuff in the meeting
so if we like the mediating servers sort
of doing the work to connect so we call
this the ask a synchronous it's
basically a synchronous query capability
and so there's another method that you
can add remember we talked about the six
methods you know logon for queries sync
there's a there's an ask method so you
can implement an ask method and then
what happens is if the controller gets
this ask request right you write it in
your in your app that it calls out to
the controllers ask requests on the
device so then the controller is the ask
request out to the rhosync server then
calls the source adapters ask method
which then synchronously queries the
backend and then brings the data right
back and that's actually how Wikipedia
is implemented now and you can actually
not only can you go look at the
Wikipedia app it's up on github but we
actually take that source adapter and we
ship it with roasting just because I
like that example of synchronous method
ah so this is actually a good question
so what you're sort of saying is is
there a roads that basically runs on a
desktop or our server you could think of
it as like a lightweight rails right is
there is there a roads framework
no there isn't today it's definitely
been requested we'll probably do it soon
and oh probably it's not so much because
you really want to use roads as your
website building thing I'm a big fan of
rails rhosync itself is a rails app and
it's sort of it almost doesn't matter
what it's written in but it happens to
be a rails app so if you're building a
server app I'm not gonna theoretically
you could use roads but I would say use
rails it's a better framework for that
kind of thing but you do want the
ability it would be nice to be able to
just sit on your device on your laptop
and run roads on your laptop without
necessarily running emulators to test
and so we will do that what you're
getting at is I and I think what you're
getting at is is okay I'm writing all
this Ruby code to write my mobile device
local thing I want to be able to share
code with the the mobile web version and
I think that's an interesting goal the
question would be and we're not focused
on this now but it's an intriguing thing
could you say okay I get the fact that
roads is not what rails is right like a
full thing to be like a web server
environment but maybe it could be just
something for sort of serving mobile web
clients it's an intriguing idea I think
it's a it's an open question whether we
be really better than then rails at that
my gut is we probably wouldn't be but I
think it's worth if somebody's really
gonna try to do that if you were really
going to try to do that we would
probably look at what could we do with
sort of share
Ruby libraries to make that easier yeah
no I get that
so and I think that because models are
just Ruby classes like if you're using
rails I think we you could probably do
that sort of ad hoc right just have the
same model but there may be things that
we can do to make that even easier right
like maybe have like you start your app
in rows and you want to have like your
rails export or maybe it's the reverse
I've already written my rails app I want
sort of a rail sort of model import
thing so we don't have that today but I
think it's a good suggestion it's just a
sample yeah it's it's all of the objects
it's quite robust it's actually probably
a little bit more extensive than some of
the apps that are out on the iPhone so
yeah it's there and it's free for
anybody to use yeah so row hub today we
didn't it's actually up on github but
it's private because we sort of didn't
want to confuse users almost all the key
pieces like the provisioning server and
build scripts sort of have their own
check-ins like the build scripts are in
the roads check in the rhosync server
which is a big piece of it is in row
sync there is this sort of web glue in
between where we sort of I think tied
the the roads client and the rhosync
server and the provisioning we sort of
made that workflow a little easier to do
and the question would be do we take
that sort of thin
wrapper and open source that itself I
think we're open to doing that if
somebody really wants to build their own
RO hub but I think I'd want to sort of
just hear from somebody because I almost
worry about just confusing developers
like today our message is if you want us
to sort of host everything for you just
use ro hub if you want to do it yourself
just you know get roads and get ro sink
if there was demand and people wanted to
build their own we're really only doing
the hosted thing not to try to make
money with it like Heroku or whatever
we're really just doing it as a way to
accelerate people's success so if
somebody else like App Engine wanted to
do a ro hub we would be very encouraging
of that scenario okay great thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
