pleasure to introduce Cheryl Parker
Cheryl is the founder of San Francisco's
own urban explorer in 1994 ms parker
received a masters of architecture and
masters of city planning from UC
Berkeley for six years Miss Parker was a
lecture in the landscape architecture
department at UC Berkeley teaching
gis-based 3d simulation for urban
designers in 99 ms parker work
professionally as an urban designer
economic development specialist city
planner and GIS web web developer the
title ever talk today is enhanced
flash-based local portals to the google
map now this is going to be posted on
YouTube so any questions you may have
that would be of a confidential nature
if you could take them offline that
would be great anyway join me in
welcoming Cheryl
is an mentioned I'm a city planner and
urban designer a couple of masters in
architecture and city planning works
several years as a professional city
planner and urban designer designing
places and envisioning places with
wonderful buildings great streets
wonderful landscape architecture but
always in the back of my mind was
troubled by gosh will they come if we
build it will they come and then the
other question was worse yet if we build
it will they leave are we going to push
people out by not understanding the
interventions so I took a sidetrack from
that life and found myself a job at a
non-profit in a south of in the South of
Market area in San Francisco working as
an economic development specialist
working directly with small businesses
and with city planners to try to
understand how people made decisions
within that local context and how that
local context became alive because of
those decisions I became involved in
creating geographic information systems
for local decision-making i called them
living neighborhood maps at the time
connecting city databases through a an
interface that then people could ask
questions and create a community through
their decisions so small businesses
could figure out where to locate
developers could figure out how to build
people could get educated on
understanding the land uses and zoning
so that then they could take an educated
voice before the City Planning
Commission and be able to influence
their own future within their own
community during that time I discovered
I had a knack for computer programming a
couple of other cities around and I
should I should mention I didn't have a
background in computer programming I
didn't even touch a computer in grad
school um
but because I started developing these
GIS interfaces a couple of cities around
the Bay Area oakland and san san mateo
approached me and asked me if i would be
able to develop a web-based GIS system
and this was back in 99 for their
communities for the purpose of doing
economic development through localized
decision-making put it out there for the
small developers and small businesses to
understand their communities and then to
locate within that context I operated
for years as kind of a boutique shop for
cities counties nonprofits the end users
were small businesses and city planners
and developed these local localized
decision-making systems during that time
because I have a strong background in
graphic design I became enhanced with
entranced with um using flash as a
medium for delivering GIS through the
web because it provided a much more
interactive and user friendly and
dynamic interface for users serendipity
serendipity introduced me to a man named
Gary diab from Vancouver British
Columbia who had a company called
geograph sin a small product called geo
flash we discovered that we were doing
similar things and very complimentary
things in terms of experimenting with
flash based GIS systems so we came to
work together for a few years and
develop a system using open source
components including mysql apache and
PHP with a flash interface again
serendipity during that period Google
and mapquest and Yahoo all started to
open the codebase the API so that
developers like me could start fiddling
around with their code in and seeing if
they could make mash ups or applications
using that code because we were using
our
system had a flash interface and we were
serving up dynamically rendered vector
maps that you could see through that
were transparent or translucent we
realized we could put that on top of a
google map and in a sense create a
portal to that google map and create a
kind of a super super google map and so
we realized we had something with this
composite system and we applied for a
patent provisional patent in 2006 and
then the full utility patent in 2007
through that by applying for that patent
and having a system which works with a
national base map and then can serve up
national data sets through that base map
this is enabling me to change my
business model from that of a boutique
shop to that of more of an undemanding
to be able to serve a lot more people
for a lot less so that jives with my
mission which is basically to make
widely available tools for localized
decision-making that are both
sophisticated yet highly user-friendly
there's according to the Small Business
Administration as of 2007 there's 25
million small businesses in the United
States location is an important is is
very important to many of the decisions
that small businesses must make on a
daily basis so for example restaurant
tours must search for local suppliers
small developers search for places to
build retailers decide where to locate
based upon consumers nonprofits
constantly need access to demographics
about their local community a full sixty
percent of that 25 million actually do
business in this way in a local
way interestingly there's a surprising
lack of accessible web-based tools for
small businesses in order to search
their locale for contextual information
in tandem with that though we now have a
cohort that is becoming adults
generation why they were raised on
handheld devices and being connected to
the Internet so there's an expectation
among new small business owners to have
these kinds of accessible web-based
tools so let's look at the types of
options that are out there for small
businesses so a task that many small
businesses perform on a daily basis is
searching for prospects searching for
customers so take this circle here is
representative of the full universe of
all small businesses now if you said
that you had a list of all those small
businesses all 25 million you'd be
wasting a lot of time because most of
them wouldn't be your targets so you
want to query through that and so for
instance say that we are a telecom
startup in Silicon Valley looking for
customers that we can sell our voice
over IP systems to our customers tend to
be financial services businesses small
but rapidly growing so we want to be
able to find a way to generate a list
where we can say during the past 10
years which local areas have had an
increase in small businesses cutting the
pie down and sales and financial
services we get a green wedge now but
still that's still a lot of leads so
what we want to do is we want to focus
to the point where we get this kind of
golden triangle that the leads that are
most valuable basically being able to
ask within these areas within this list
of businesses can you show us which
businesses have grown over time during
the past five years
and if we're really lucky we can ask in
which of these companies do we actually
know someone those are the the really
high quality leads so let's look at how
what are the options out there these
days for a small business to ask those
questions on the web there are many very
good databases out there so for instance
info USA dun &amp;amp; bradstreet Clara toss
Hoover's they all provide very good
databases for generating leads
unfortunately they have interfaces that
tend to be not quite as user friendly so
you come to a list as a small business
and you ask a question fill out a page
another page another page another page
another page and at the end of all of
that you're told that congratulations
you're paying by the record you found
156 records and by the way your total is
$133 unfortunately you can't view those
results before paying so you don't
really know what you're getting and you
can't drill down or refine that query
either what you're getting right now is
this green wedge but you're not getting
that magic golden triangle in addition
after you do this you then have to go
through another five pages in order to
pay so looks look diagrammatically at
the user experience have a question you
run a query you get the result 156
companies then you have to pay only
after you pay can you view your records
can you analyze and use them and then
discover oh I probably need to ask some
more questions and go through this
experience again which leads to a user
who becomes a prisoner of their
interface it's not that the data is bad
or the databases are bad it's just the
interface is
prohibitive another option that's out
there and I put it up here because this
isn't really an option for a small
business they wouldn't go this route in
order to answer this question but it is
a type of system that puts a framework
out there for doing web-based localized
decision-making and this is enterprise
GIS or enterprise geographic information
systems there's a couple of very big
companies that are kind of the leaders
in this ESRI and mapinfo provide a whole
variety of products along this line the
idea is providing a tabular database
spatial database served up through
servers to a variety of different
applications and web services and
browsers and clients a pretty
complicated system the license is
expensive so on average there's an
annual twenty-eight thousand dollar a
year fee for paying for the license then
on top of that you have to have either
hire somebody like me to implement it
and then develop the database and
customize it which I would charge
probably around fifty thousand dollars
and spend six months doing that or have
a trained staff to do that so as a
result the markets are limited it's
limited to those kinds of agencies or
organizations that have large databases
of land and can afford to make this
investment unfortunately what happens is
you start having a piecemeal a very very
defined and in-depth data bases across a
region or across the country which
exists within kind of arbitrary
boundaries again as a user you're kind
of a prisoner of
these boundaries so you make decisions
based upon your economy based upon as a
city planner based upon the uses in your
city based upon what you know within
that boundary but it's not within the
context of a whole region another
example is what I call API mapping
systems I mean it's the Microsoft maps
mapquest maps yahoo maps and also of
course the google map these things all
have something in common they're free
they're ubiquitous they offer points of
interest routing address location also
they're becoming very important in terms
of local search advertising each one of
them provides a certain flavor so for
instance Google's got this really cool
street-level view and I just happened to
be standing on that corner when I saw
the Google truck drive by one day and so
now I am inside a google map so i really
like google maps um of course there are
limits to this it's not GIS and it's not
meant to be G is so not able to connect
to local databases can't perform spatial
analyses can't display polygons on a
kind of thematic way or do somatic
analyses but that's ok they're not meant
to do that interestingly though they are
now providing the option of customizing
them so for instance going to Google
Maps press on the my maps button you
come to a page which allows users to add
enhanced functionality to the google map
web widgets or google gadgets in this
specific sense these arm applets so we
decide to add elevation contours to our
map we add it we get the option of
clicking on the button
we click on the button and there we go
we have some elevation contours added to
our google map that's what we are we are
a web widget that provides enhanced
functionality to the google map so we
have the national base map could be you
google could be yahoo could be mapquest
there what we provide are a variety of
different flash portals with different
enhanced functionality to that map that
connect down through to databases and so
if we took this to the instance of small
businesses this could be applied to many
markets but to small businesses this
might look like this so we have a portal
for finding leads one for analyzing
customers one for finding new locations
all connecting through to a variety of
different databases that exist across
time time series databases so for
instance business data labor market data
consumer expenditures lifestyle
demographics and in addition to that
given that these are web-based mashups
connecting to national web services such
professional networking conferencing
logistics traffic patterns and these get
distributed through google map 'let's
but on a broader sense this works within
the OpenSocial framework that Google
pretty much have announced last November
which basically there are a variety of
partners that work with Google that
enable people developers like me to
upload our applications to be able to
work within that framework of web
services and databases to enhance
functionality it's basically passing
around little applications made by
developers like me replacing and it's
any sense the the notion of purchasing a
software and installing it on your
computer this is more along the lines of
software as a service distribution model
so we complement something like
salesforce com should say salesforce com
and linkedin are both participants in
this open social community so they
enable people to developers to create
applications that sit on top of their
platforms so as of 2007 about 23% of all
of those 25 million small businesses
were using some sort of business
intelligence software like customer
relations management to help them in
their decisions over the next three
years this is projected to grow to a
full third of all of those small
businesses the same time linkedin
another of these participating partners
provides professional networking they've
been growing astronomically three over
three hundred percent in one year last I
looked there were 17 million users but
it seems like they go up by a million
every week so i'm not sure where they're
at now but as i mentioned both of these
work through that same kind of idea of
web widgets passed through the internet
so here is the app exchange or
application exchange through salesforce
com providing a whole variety of web
widgets that people can download and put
onto their computers to work within the
framework of the services offered by
linkedin in salesforce com or any of
them in addition our services would be
distributed directly through the public
sector agencies that work with small
businesses such as economic development
agencies and Workforce Investment boards
so here's what our widget looks like as
I said it's a widget pass through google
map 'let's linked in salesforce com if
we were to take that same question of
show give me a list of leads that would
be perfect for financial for telecom
voice over IP so show me the financial
services businesses that are small but
growing within Silicon Valley we would
handle that through basically fill in
the criteria and click with that first
click you get to where you were with
that other one which is 156 companies
you get that green wedge but it's still
not giving you that that golden triangle
we take that component of time and say
which companies have grown over the past
five years quick and we get a much
smaller result 25 companies these are
much more valuable leads and you're able
to to see what you're getting before you
buy it if we did an apples-to-apples
comparison then if you're charging by
the number of records 25 records x 85
cents equals sixteen dollars versus the
$133 of the competitor then if you take
one more step and say well we're working
through the OpenSocial community and
bringing connecting through to LinkedIn
and which of these companies do I
actually know someone these become
extremely valuable leads then and then
of course your one click away from
paying by using something like the
google google checkout
so to look at the user experience
diagrammatically this time you have a
question you're able to search view and
analyze you get your results and only
after it happen with your results then
you can decide to download and pay this
leads to a much happier user as compared
to the other experience where the user
becomes a victim or prisoner of the
interface the other way that we're going
to distribute this is through selling a
subscription and annual subscription to
agencies that work directly with small
businesses like economic development
agencies and Workforce Investment boards
basically the way it'll work is that
anyone who works within those walls of
that agency or any of the customers that
come within the walls of the agency can
use it without any kind of charge or
anything like that for data downloads
anybody outside there would be a small
fee if somebody wanted to download some
of the data so the way the types of
features for a more advanced robustus
system would be being able to look at
data and Industry movement across time
so for instance this is Silicon Valley
santa clara county looking at business
services across time through 1990
through 2006 so 1990 1994 1998 2002 2006
so you get an idea of how the industries
are changing and growing within a
certain area in addition 3d display of
data so here is the bioscience sector
tells you one thing a bit about the
spatial distribution of the businesses
but it doesn't tell you that much about
the
businesses so by just clicking on the 3d
button you get a much better idea of
your industry pretty fast these are the
large companies the fully established
companies this is a very important
location in this area for those
companies and these are more or less
home-based startups of course you can
click on any of them and then get the
information from dun and Bradstreet for
those businesses and then a buffer
analysis of being able to click an area
and be able to get distribution of
what's in that area so this is an
industry distribution for one mile
radius around that area three-mile
radius five mile radius and in addition
parcel based systems being able to
search for parcels that meet particular
criteria and then be able to click
through and get more information zoom in
and then be able to even link out to a
city's zoning code so now I'm going to
show some live demos of these you can
get to any of these through my website
www calm and go to the products page and
you'll be able to click and see some of
these demos so I have one already loaded
see because the resolution got changed
just going to reload that because the
resolution
so this demo is was developed for the
Silicon Valley Workforce Investment
Board several different groups of users
including those folks that we're looking
for jobs economic business analysts and
also business development specialists
that needed to do outreach to small
businesses based upon understanding how
they're growing and changing over time
so what you'll see here is a flash
interface over the top of the google map
and these layers are all very
interactive so if we were just to click
on an area what this is doing is pulling
up information from a database so this
first button is just the basic
information about that area but then we
can click on this button and this is
going to generate dynamic list from the
database of all the businesses in that
area from dun and Bradstreet so we get
this whole list of businesses here that
we can then export to our to an Excel
spreadsheet if we wanted to get a
different idea of those business
tribution of these businesses and what
industries there in we can click this
button and what this is going to do is
give us a dynamically generated industry
distribution for that area so we break
it down in all the variety of different
industries bioscience building
construction business services give it
by the number of businesses the jobs the
average jobs and the sales of all those
businesses if we wanted to get a more
visual representation of that just click
on the chart button and be able to see
that in a chart format so we can then
also given that its flesh be able to put
the cursor over the top and be able to
get the numbers easily and then be able
to say
given that this is going across time
click on any of these other years and be
able to get a different breakdown of how
that area looked in a different year in
addition we can look by count of
businesses total jobs or total sales and
you'll get a different picture if you
now we're looking at count of businesses
but if we chose total jobs we'll get a
different idea some of these industries
in plot are made up of tiny little
businesses some of them don't have many
businesses but they're very large
employers in addition you can look
across census information so for
instance if we looked at housing and
looked at basically tenure owner versus
renter occupied in two thousand and be
able to chart that for the area the
other thing that's kind of cool is you
can click on different areas and get a
quick comparison of how the area's
differ relative to each other
and so then um another thing that you
can do is zoom out and be able to get a
distribution of industries or any of
these data sets across time so for
instance if we wanted to search for
across businesses time series select the
business time series select census
tracks select an industry sectors such
as bioscience and say count of
businesses and then select the different
years so 2006 2000 298 92 and 90 and hit
go and now this will map that out across
as a thematic map across the geography
for all of those various years and given
that it's flash-based you can then kind
of animate that and be able to see how
your areas change across time so this is
in 2006 we'll take it to 1990 so when we
have this interactive timeline so we
have 90 92 98 2002 in 2006 we can see
how an economy is growing in addition
and I'll show one last thing is if we
want to understand these sectors more in
terms of how they're distributed and
broken down by business we can say okay
let's see the bioscience total the same
sector see what where those businesses
are located
and again here's the distribution by
just dots but if we were to say let's
show me by jobs we get a 3d
representation of that then if we wanted
to break this down and say show me this
bioscience sector by different
components within that bioscience
different industries sub-sectors so the
drugs and pharmaceuticals so let's see
that sector and what does that look like
and how many of those businesses and
where are they located within this area
okay so this is the drugs and
pharmaceutical cluster within that we
can take one last one like medical
devices
so it gives you a different idea of how
these companies are locating if we took
and look at research and testing it's a
whole different type of company these
the one the medical devices are large
companies located there the research and
testing is a completely different type
of company so here is the list of
research companies within that sector
it's showing a completely different type
of company and I'll just show you
quickly one other system that's
developed for a different reason it's a
parcel based system more along the lines
of understanding the properties within
an area a small city and enabling people
to figure out where to locate and where
to build so if you wanted to see the
zoning code you click on the button and
be able to see a distribution of zoning
across the area interactive map enables
you to click on any of them and be able
to see click out to the city zoning code
be able to see current land uses
and then over the top of that do a
search for particular types of parcels
so for instance if we were looking for
retail commercial parcels of a certain
size so look for although is greater
than 50,000 square feet run the query
and be able to see where they are on the
map a different size twenty thousand
fifty thousand square feet run the query
be able to see where they are click on
any of them and get information about
them be able to zoom in and get more
information and be able to click on top
of the map and get more zoom in further
and get those the aerial photos
and then if we were to do a kind of a
business search for particular type of
business we can then link out to the
google local search and be able to type
in for instance look for restaurants in
the area click on it so this is these
this list is brought in from the web
from the google local search but if the
city happens to have photographs of
those particular businesses then that
can be displayed through the interface
so that's my talk and I welcome any
questions that you might have and thank
you very much for your time I have the
microphone so
are you using the flash API to speak
directly to the Google Maps API mmhmm
yeah there's a communication going back
and forth okay so you've actually
implemented all of your flash API on top
of the JavaScript yeah
okay oh do you have any applications
that allow users to upload their own
data to include on a map to analyze with
what's on there not yet but that's
that's in the works that's something
that we want to do call it my map right
yeah great
okay well thanks Cheryl you're welcome
thank you
