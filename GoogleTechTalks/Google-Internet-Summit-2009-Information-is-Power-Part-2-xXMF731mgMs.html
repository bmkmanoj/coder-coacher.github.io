mention but which I'm seeing increasing
amounts of on the net has to do with
misinformation leading to you know sort
of knee-jerk reactions flash crowds and
things like that I think an example of
that I'm trying to read may have been in
Korea there was a big issue about
American beef and you know the points
failed jakub court felt the syndrome and
there was a misinformation that led I
don't remember what fears and as ben
says it was fueled by a very healthy
dose of quackery right just like
complete misinformation about the
disease the way that it's transmitted
and so forth the political imperative
was that this new government is pretty
pro-american and they wanted to complete
a free trade agreement with the US
there's no way that the US Senate was
going to pass a treaty unless Korea
lifted its beef boycott so in Korean
politics they're very evenly split
between left and right it's a pretty
aggressive political environment a lot
of very sort of heated described Korean
politics is very heated and so typically
when a government of one party or the
other takes power the other side does
their very best to go in and kneecap the
new president politically as quickly as
possible and cripple them for the
remainder of their term because they
can't run for re-election so if you can
just shut the person down and make them
ineffective they do and so sure enough
the government announces they're going
to lift the beef boycott and the left
the labor unions and others really went
to town to try to stir up a popular
frenzy of opposition to it and it was
kind of fun actually because there were
Googlers in the Korea Google office who
were out there holding the candles and
like marching on the streets and other
Korean Googlers that were you know
marching on the other side and saying
this is ridiculous it was you know the
fun sort of political issue and we got
involved in this because students that
were protesting the government's the
government were unhappy that the major
newspapers which are pretty conservative
were
no in their view you know kind of
unfairly attacking the protesters and so
what they did was they called for a
boycott on the advertisers in the big
newspapers that are supporting the
government and of course they used
Google Docs to list out all the
advertisers and we had the Korean police
now controlled by the Conservative
government trying to investigate who
were the students that protested it
because they wanted to like indict them
for some hideous crime of you know in
spreading false information and so
organizing a boycott and so we actually
had like the police raid our office they
took 8 laptops you know they they held
our people up to try to force us to
disclose user information that was not
being stored in Korea right this is
google docs stored on data centers over
here and so we just had to endure it
right but it was an example of how
seriously they sort of take that I think
that what's interesting is on there is
clearly a cultural thing that I don't
particularly understand about Korea and
China to a lesser degree Japan where
rumors fly very fast and often have
pretty dire consequences so in Korea
there's been a spate of suicides a very
well-known very successful actors and
actresses over the last two years and at
least the media story about it is that
part of the blame is because there are
rumors about their personal lives and
about their you know the doings or
whatever that get reproduced by the
Internet so the internet clearly has
this ability to like damage reputations
and search engines like Google make it
awfully hard for people who have had
negative stuff about them written to
ever move past that or get beyond it I
think that's very troubling I think the
to me the ultimate question is whether
you need to exercise some form of
control in order to stop that or whether
we can develop a kind of understanding
about the limits of truth and the limits
of speech on the internet that within
you know maybe 10 years will be much
better understood and we'll know better
how to kind of read and filter those
sorts of things and discount them
properly
it's how I think about it I wanted to
comment on your pointed the coast of the
networking has dropped and so it
Unleashed karoke BTW i think it's not
too just the cost of networking but
they've been with as well and then
accessibility because in the past people
had access to the networks of personal
relations so they could publish their
creations but those networks have rates
of about point 01 BPS and now we are
eight orders of magnitude ahead of late
so this is actually the driving force be
yes sir that's a really good point
stephen so related to Vince line of
questioning i think is could you comment
on the role of the Streisand effect and
then said that the the the example that
immediately springs to mind is that
there's little town in England that no
one would know about and thus their
concerns about having relative anonymity
would be addressed except they storm two
you know camera car well so I looked
mean to me these things from from it
from the sort of social engineering to
me these things are all of a piece right
which is that people don't really
understand what this network means right
they don't really understand what what
what the implication is the Streisand
effect you know is for those of you who
don't know you know if you're googling
the term you probably figured this out
already but the Streisand effect is
basically like like reacting to
something you don't like on the internet
in exactly the wrong way which is to try
to attack it or shut it down and
therefore draw more attention to the
thing that you're trying to shut down
and I just to be that there's sort of
like symptoms of a moment of massive
technological change that take a while
for people to kind of like figure out
and get used to eventually right
copyright lawyers are going to figure
out that wildly over broad assertions of
copyright are going to you know not be
worth it because of the negative
reaction that you spark you might say
the same thing about record companies or
others you know that suing you know
grandmother's is not going to actually
prove to be you know the most effective
way to win the loyalty of your users to
me that
all kind of a piece of just people
seeking to utilize some kind of control
mechanism where another approach would
probably be more effective I got a quick
point on that because you just said
something that I viewed as implausible
which is you said lawyers would learn
lawyers lawyers jobs are to build people
okay and so I mean that except for some
really exceptional lawyers who view
their jobs as doing you know advice to
clients about you know public relations
strategies but that's typically
something that somebody not an attorney
does the attorneys job is to X use a
legal system to their clients you know
the way the client wants it used so the
incidence of lawyers themselves have no
motivations on that in fact or trained
very specifically that it is poor
behavior on their part to leave any
attempt you know any part of the
possible legal process untouched so they
will issue the broadest possible
subpoena because that is what they are
trained and indeed professional ethics
requires them to do what you really see
I think what you really have to do is
expect that the people behind the
attorneys learn that that's the wrong
thing to do because then they can
instruct the attorneys instead come to
come give me a resolution that doesn't
cause the following negative effects
okay but if you just set the attorneys
loose and say stop this the attorneys
job is to be as broad as possible and to
do all the things that you all view is
socially reprehensible but in fact
legally and ethically they're required
to do in many cases at least in the
United States your example proves the
point that if you're not part of the
solution there's good money to be made
in prolonging the problem yes certainly
it means a good point but to be what
that says is I may be of course you're
right it's the clients that need need
need to be persuaded to me with that
says though is that it is is how
important it is to get the rules right
in other words the law really does
matter because you should just assume
that people will take advantage I mean a
great example just to play off of what
you were just talking about you know a
great example of where you need the
rules to be right has to do with the
standards for access to data in the
cloud right so you know the things that
used to be under your desk in a file
cabinet are now X tan
on some servers that are held by some
third party somewhere else and right now
we have a set of legal standards that
makes access to that information held by
the third party extremely easy even
though it's exactly the same data we've
had this conception which says in the
house very highly protected out of the
house not as highly protected now in the
house means you've got like a netbook is
the thing you have in the house and the
data actually resides somewhere else and
just our legal standards if they're
going to capture these old
constitutional notions of privacy have
to be changed otherwise lawyers will in
fact in every divorce action you can
think of will go and try to subpoena the
hell out of everything they can get
their hands on the legal rules really do
matter so I empathize with your morning
routine understand and I mention it
because I'm trying to separate out the
essential from the ephemeral here how
you sketch them very very broad forces
that are in play in essence Moore's law
and and all of the consequences are
going to happen irrespective of the
control of the Communist Party or any
other political thing and it's the
interplay of these that are playing out
to what extent does it matter how much
energy we put into worrying over this is
going to proceed along that path anyway
or are there specific points where it
does matter because that's the way in
which you've been the tree or been the
river and then you get very very
different outcomes depending upon
whether you take action now and so it's
separating out what the inevitable from
where the major choice points are it's a
really interesting question so so my
take on it is this which is that I
a series of choices that you know you
all were involved in that are embedded
in the way the internet works and when
the standards are written have proven to
be surprisingly resilient in my view to
efforts to exercise some form of control
and by control i mean you know even
things is kind of picky yoon as certain
traffic management techniques by you
know like by a cable company let's say
and the thing that I think is not
inevitable that is worth paying
attention to are the purported advances
in the network that would build an
ability in network operators to
understand and then understand what's
flowing over their networks and then
alter traffic patterns and flows and
maybe even destinations and so forth of
traffic based on what they want to do
rather than what the endpoints of the
network would have wanted to do to me
that matters tremendously and I think
that the great conflict has been that
nobody wants to harden the Internet in
the same way that we want just like I
don't want the law to kind of harden the
preserves of intermediaries of
information in the old pre-internet days
onto the internet I think anybody wants
to harden the architecture of the
internet such that it can't evolve and
we assume that we've always gotten
everything right up until now on the
other hand I get quite concerned when I
see this kind of what to me looks like
sort of an unholy nexus of of forces
coming together to try to build better
tools of control into the network and
that those forces are people that would
like to stop copyright infringement
people that would like to protect
children better people that would like
to have better law enforcement access
and surveillance capabilities and then
at work people that would like to have
political and social control exercised
through the network when you add that
all up together that's a pretty powerful
set of forces even in a country like the
US or the
you that would like the internets to
evolve in a direction which i think is
pretty unhealthy and by no means is it
inevitable that the internet will
repulse that just as its repulsed I
think a number of threats up until up
until now so I don't view that anyway as
inevitable let me just add I think this
is one of the very best presentations on
these issues that I've ever seen and I'm
really keen done thank you so much had a
couple years of practice so on the way
that we thought we would do this this
next sort of panel is Rick wit published
a number of years ago what seven years
ago now what what was at the time a i
think a very influential paper about how
to think about the interplay between
regulation and control and the network
and so what I've asked is is is Rick to
sort of revive that picture and then
Allan and Nicole will come down and
we'll try to dig into some of these
issues great thanks Andrew good morning
everybody it's always a challenge to
follow one of Andrews presentations I
will decline the invitation if I knew
was actually good work out this way i'll
do a truncated version of some slides i
put together try to set the the agenda
for the rest of the panel here as Andrew
mentioned we're all about the eighth and
ninth layers of the internet there was
some IETF engineer think back in the
1990's who coined that phrase and that
means economics and politics as the
eighth the ninth layers respectively you
can also think about it in terms of
Larry Lessig its code is law but by the
same token law is code and so we work on
the law side and try to figure out as
best we can how to preserve some of the
some of the normative values that Andrew
talked about in his presentation so a
lot of this is actually to be
self-evident to some of you and I
apologize for that in advance these are
actually taken from some slides I use
when I try to talk to policy makers
federal state international policy
makers about the internet about what's
going on in the internet and how it
affects or should affect their way of
thinking about networks because of the
telecom guy and the staff and D
see I think of myself sort as the
plumber so I'm kind of in the weeds or
what happens at what is called the last
mile by the incumbents I tend to think
of it as the first mile but nonetheless
so this is kind of this notion of what
is convergence all about and as I
explained to some of the policymakers
convergence is true to a certain extent
if you're talking about increasingly
networks and enterprises are converging
to the Internet to the to the IP
protocol in particular but it's it's a
mistake to think of it as convergence
beyond that because really what's
happening at the same time is that
divergence in terms of the networks that
are supporting IP not all the
applications and content that's flowing
out of the networks and so it creates
what's been known as the the virtuous
hourglass a couple of things that come
out of this in addition to Vince famous
I guess on the front of bored bored
watching magazine the IP on everything
t-shirt that he exposes memorable cover
it creates some interesting economic
elements which in turn them bleed right
into the political layer as well the
first is that the net is a complex
adaptive system and if you talk to any
complexity scientists you know theorists
we talk about this kind of thing what
the basically means it's it's a highly
evolved a very advanced extremely
complicated thing made up of many
different parts of which come is lots of
emergent behavior that emergent behavior
for the most part is unpredictable
because it's it's the interaction of
lots of independent elements working
together and that the whole is the
greater than some of the parts in
addition that the net has become a
general platform technology and again in
the words of the economist at GPT and
that means a platform of innovation and
growth and if you talk to people in new
growth Theory School of Economics like
Paul Romer what he talks about there is
increasingly we have an economy that's
based on ideas and not on things and we
talked about yesterday and again this
morning the economics of scarcity versus
the economics of abundance and this is a
radical change in the shifting and the
patches the past ten years or so about
what the internet is actually doing and
the effect it's having on the market in
a larger sense the third part to keep in
mind here is that in the old telecom
space services were always inextricably
tied to the network she had a cable
company providing a cable service over
cable network now of course none of that
is true you've got the services are now
becoming applications bits of software
they're residing on the network any
network using IP protocol leading to the
fourth element here which is that the
core the intelligence is moving to the
edges and again this is no surprise to
most of you but to many policymakers
they're like wow really that's that's
really interesting so Blair Levin who's
an analyst is tiful mentalists in DC and
was a member of the Obama transition
team wrote a piece about three years ago
which he talked about the internet
becoming the battleground for what he
called the value chain tug of war what
he means by that is that increasingly as
the value of course is shifting from the
cores of the network's to the edges of
the networks you're seeing some as was
put by by Andrews presentation the
Empire striking back the notion that hey
wait a minute this is our network this
is our value you should be taking this
from us this is kind of our god-given
right and you're seeing between networks
and users battles over many policy
issues network neutrality of course is
one of them but increasingly it's going
to be in things like industrial property
privacy security all the way down the
line all of these these these skirmishes
breaking out in DC so as as Andrew
mentioned I wrote a little paper a few
years ago with Andrew with Vince support
and encouragement which I appreciated
which tried to look at the world the
policy world not just the network world
into the OSI stack but trying to bring
to Washington the idea of starting to
look at things not in it in the typical
silos of the different service
industries but at the different layers
and so it's it's actually I think it's
helpful to think about what's going on
in DC in the past 15 years in terms of
the policy wars by looking at it in
terms of four basic layers physical
logical applications in the content or
interactivity layer Susan Crawford likes
to talk about that as a social layer she
doesn't like the word content it's like
content is just about stuff this is
really about people interacting and
doing things together so how do you want
to call it that that top layer is where
much of the activity takes place the
physical layer is where the battle over
the telecom act of 96 took place battle
which has pretty much been one now by
the incumbents the bell companies in
particular they were supposed to
unbundle their network provider can
action and provide some competition to
the inner exchange carriers now the you
know exchange carriers in the sea Lex
for the most part are gone there are
some still hanging around in a few
places but by and large physical layer
battle was won by the incumbents the
logical layer then was the next next
place where skirmish broke out and this
was the ISPs the independent ISPs like
Earth Lincoln AOL and this was the the
notion of isp open access and back in
2005 but the supreme court acted in
called the brand x case the FCC acted
three months later in a broadband order
which essentially deregulated the
incumbent carriers from having to
provide access is PA access to
independent ISPs that battle also won by
the incumbents so quickly between the
physical and logical layer we now have a
world where we used to have ISPs you
talk about ISPs I used to think about
them in the old days yeah yeah seven
eight thousand ISPs out there in the
country well now you mentioned the word
is P you're talking about the carrier
because their own two other ISPs for the
most part out there remaining so now
we're at the third stage of this battle
and this is where it gets really
interesting this is the what's known of
course this network neutrality a couple
quick words here about network
neutrality I'm not really fond of the
word some people call it net neutrality
but I think actually makes a little bit
worse I think some of the problems with
the with the nomenclature go to the fact
that of course the net is not a neutral
place certainly you have the end
principal you've got a lot of the
architectural elements which are their
intended to allow people to do what they
want on than that but people take the
notion of net neutrality and they try to
argue well but of course all these
things are happening people using CDN
networks all these commercial
transactions people getting one up on
the other but of course it's all true
we're not talking about the net in
itself what we're talking about is the
broadband network we're talking about
the last mile / first mile network and
so it's really the focus is on what's
happening at that layer and at that
particular part of the network element
where there's less competition and it's
about openness how you wanted to find
open is it's basically the ability of
people to come in and do what they want
to using their broadband connection now
a couple things here which may be a
little surprising to you network
neutrality people usually then add the
tagline regulation after that or
legislation or rule
net neutrality to me network neutrality
open internet it's about the end game
it's about the end it's not about the
means in fact prior to 2005 on the on
the on the broadband side and of course
we always have had in the dial-up side
we've always had network neutrality
we've always had a world where people
have the right to use the ISP of their
choice and that it'll bility to use that
in combination with a non-discrimination
principle meant that people had an open
Internet had access to do what they
wanted to with whatever provider they
wanted to use the problem now I think
increasingly people talk about net
neutrality is if it as if it never leave
then comes to some sort of regulations
into a prescriptive approach to ensure
that that open and it stays in place
that's not necessarily the case in fact
I would argue that right now in a world
without a net neutrality law or
regulation we more or less habit and
that's I think primarily because the
incumbent players having seen what's
happened with comcast the BitTorrent
situation at the FCC in the past year
and a half and a few other things that
have that have broken out they've
realized it's probably probably better
for them to stay on the sidelines with
their business models and not get too
aggressive because they now got a
Democratic Congress you have a
Democratic administration which ran on a
network neutrality ticket you've got an
incoming FCC which will be headed by a
guy who knows the internet well and by
all accounts is a fan of openness on the
net so I think they've made the correct
business decision to lay low and not get
out there very aggressively with their
business models so we essentially have
this environment now whether or not we
have legislation and regulation to
enforce it now the final part of this is
it is that enough that's that's really
going to it's unclear it's too early to
know is the norm of openness is relying
on end users and early adopters and the
net community to be kind of the
enforcers as it were of a net neutral
environment is that sufficient for us to
not have to worry about the incumbents
again I think it's premature to say that
the answer that is an affirmative but at
least something to think about quickly
also broadband you hear a lot of talk
about broadband with the broadband
stimulus money seven plus billion
dollars that the Department of Commerce
and the FCC and the Department of
Agriculture will be administering and
folks kind of ignore the notion what is
what is broadband what do we care why do
we care about broadband of course
broadband
a medium it's a way of taking
communications infrastructure and making
it work faster and the ability to
provide services that were not available
in the previous incarnation but it's
important to know what it's not
broadband is not the internet and
broadband is not internet access so if
you read the legislation to read FCC
regulations and then like all the focus
is on broadband and yet if you think
about it well it's not just broadband at
the capacity we want interactive online
services that reach and use the internet
to say that for example it's a content
delivery system well yes in part you can
use broadband as some kind of neat
one-way video streaming service but if
you're going to spend seven billion
dollars in stimulus money or 12 a
billion dollars in broadband universal
service money at the FCC to basically
allow comcast a verizon to build much
bigger video plant not sure that's
exactly what Congress had in mind it's
also not a box of widgets the economics
of broadband are unique from many other
kinds of products and services it's got
very high upfront costs utilizing lots
of public resources whether it's
rights-of-way conduit polls lots of tax
breaks and subsidies it's depreciation
etc so it occupies a different kind of
place above and beyond that if you go
back and look at the the world of common
carriage common carriage didn't start
because there's a concern about somebody
having market power they it started
primarily around instrumentalities of
communications and transportation and
that's been that way for many many
centuries going back even to Roman law
and so it is there is something
different about communications
infrastructure from other kinds of
elements of the economy and finally it's
not your vegetables right we could talk
all we want to about getting a you know
one gig to every home tomorrow but for a
lot of people surprisingly large number
of people they don't see utility in
broadband whether it's because of price
whether it's because concerns about
online you know nefarious online
activities affecting their families etc
we have to really be I think focused on
the demand side of the equation and not
just on supply and finally I leave you
with this this is my attempt to think
about broadband in terms of three
different dimensions so the first
dimension is we talked about in the one
that
the regular is mostly focused on from
the perspective of getting more
infrastructure out there into the
economy it's what I call availability of
broadband infrastructure right so you
just want make sure you have more bigger
faster competitive pipes wireline and
wireless pipes out there available for
people to use the second dimension is
the one people going to talk about too
much which I kind of alluded to earlier
its sufficiency of net carriage you can
have the biggest broadband network in
the world but if the provider does not
actually devote some portion of that to
the Internet then the notion of
broadband is some sort of optimal
platform for the Internet of course is
is a misnomer it's not going to happen
so you have to be at least concerned
about and think about how much capacity
actually is going to net carriage and
the third piece integrity of net access
is simply open Internet ie network
neutrality so these three I think work
together in terms of to me kind of
building a notion of what is the right
kind of a platform broadband platform to
create an open and robust access to the
internet again not to suggest this then
leads ultimately to hundred pages of
regulations that mandate this to say
these are the things we should want to I
think care about going forward as a
matter of public policy and with that
turn over to Andrew sure oh sure yeah so
about people not wanting broadband my
impression from what I can tell and part
of this is the Department of Agriculture
briefings and the NTIA briefings and all
that stuff which I've watched in track
is that there isn't and from talking
with some folks in the areas there's
actually tremendous demand for internet
access in at least the rural underserved
areas the farmers the farm business guys
who currently are dialing in and
frustrated when they're trying to figure
out what the futures prices are and
whether it's time to sell their their
crop in advance and other sorts of
things like that um is that ferry you
are you going after those folks where
you say people don't want it are you
worrying about the 50 state mandate and
the fact that some of the underserved
areas are frankly going to be you know
urban areas of folks who really may not
wish it at this point it's not there at
vegetables right so if you look at
various studies like the Pew Internet
folks do a variety of studies around
this
Consumer Federation of America's done
some studies CWA there are some I think
commonalities across all income classes
across all geographic areas is a certain
percentage of Americans twenty
twenty-five percent would say who just
don't see the utility in broadband but
as you point out in the rural areas
what's the so-called unserved or
underserved areas there is a tremendous
there is tremendous pent up demand
because at this point unlike in a lot of
suburban areas or urban areas released
there is some broadband some places
there are real issues having broadband
anywhere they're there and it's in part
because of the cost of building the
broadband plant it's a part because the
the middle mile the the backhaul access
to the Internet is is quite poor in a
lot of those areas and so that's in my
estimation that's where most of the
stimulus money that's where most of the
National Broadband Plan activities
should be focused is an upgrading
building that new plant and as Mark
Cooper t-bo a says it's not a matter
again of getting everybody on the
network at fifty or hundred megabits
just give everybody five hundred
kilobits in those area just get them on
the network and an always-on connection
take an experienced broadband away at
least many of us experience it from the
beginning and then that creates its own
demand in the own and the market forces
take over and people can start getting
up to higher speeds yes so didn't the
file 09 29 10 951 are you talking about
at NTIA 44 stimulus money yeah a lawyer
code for 09 29 is the FCC policymaking
proceeding that it's a docket number
literally for how the stimulus money
should be spent from a policy standpoint
which is what he was talking about Oh
951 is still open that's the what the
national broadband policy should look
like so we're members of you open
Internet coalition so we submitted
comments in 09 29 we've submitted some
separate comments and letters to NTIA
about how to use the stimulus money a
comment cycle for
51 is begins on june eighth and google
does intend to file some comments there
which may look something like what you
saw the screen a few minutes ago but i
would defend cools not attempting to be
a recipient of stimulus get on google
not trying to get up be a recipient of
stimulus money just be on the record on
that um so let me now show the visual
that i would ask the three of you to
react to just by way of quick
introduction for those of you that
haven't met them yet alan davidson runs
google's office in DC is a long time
Internet policy nerd and former actual
and a group who programmed among other
places at NASA nicole wong is a
associate general counsel deputy general
counsel and is my partner in crime on
those scary morning emails that i
mentioned earlier so i think u2 u3 need
to move off to the side for a second
otherwise you're going to get the lights
flashed in your eyes so what I want to
show is is a is a visual just to get our
discussion going and for those of you
that maybe if you are inclined to be
offended at things that offend people
leave for a second but I think we often
tend to be a little bit squeamish about
actually talking about the stuff that
we're talking about women censorship
happens but i just want to show you an
example and show you and then describe
the consequence and i'm gonna ask the
three panelists to react to it and to
just try both what they think is going
on and what sort of the policy angle is
so this is a video that was posted up on
youtube for those of you that don't know
greece and turkey have a fairly intense
rivalry between the two countries a set
of kind of antagonisms and about a year
and a half ago roughly there was a surge
of people posting videos from the
Turkish side insulting Greeks and their
national icons and from the Greek side
insulting Turks and their national icons
here is a prominent and notable example
this is a Kamal Mustafa Ataturk founder
of the modern Turkish state and a
revered secular figure in modern Turkey
you get the idea kemal ataturk it raises
points about a sexual orientation and
perhaps as gender and we can kill the
monitor now and so this video among a
handful of others has led to the banning
of YouTube in Turkey and I think you can
kill the screen if you want to look it
back to the panel here was to get
youtube band uh well you do it because
you're 16 you think it's really funny to
you no insult the soccer to you know the
other soccer today yeah I think some of
the original ones were like following a
soccer match and it was Greek users that
were uploading these videos so so here's
the so the situation is Greek people put
up video Google gets sued in Turkish
court Turkish court orders nationwide
block on YouTube which is still in place
today right so still today you can't
access YouTube from a Turkish ISP unless
you are tunneling your way out or using
a VPN or something like that so um let
me start with Nicole so let me just ask
you to sort of like describe the the
sort of legal situation that surrounds
this video and Google's actions and then
i'm going to ask rick to talk about it
from the sort of network layers and
control perspective and alan to talk
about it from the US side so um we
yesterday actually was the one year
anniversary of a block that was put in
place we had been going up and down in
Turkey for several months where we would
find out that the Turkish government or
actually it's usually by Louisville
prosecutors are upset about a particular
video and sometimes as videos are things
like the gay Ataturk video some of them
were videos that were of the PKK which
is the rebel terrorist group and
terrorists as
recognized by most Western countries and
sort of recruitment videos of when I
looked at the men running around in the
hills with guns some of them were
Kurdish nationalist videos so it would
be people Kurds espousing statehood for
folks in the in that part of the country
um which were hard to identify as
actually illegal unless I suppose you
speak Turkish because when the videos
were coming to me and that I take it
down drew was talking about we get the
bit like two o'clock in the morning and
there were 67 videos they were upset
about one of which was literally it was
a woman sitting around with livestock
singing apparently a Kurdish national
song I didn't know that but but that
that's the nature of the stuff that we
end up seeing the legal construct around
that and the reason the prosecutors will
bring these cases is based on a couple
of laws but to really important ones one
makes it a crime to insult Ataturk the
founder of the Turkish Republic which is
andrew has already informed me like dead
70 years and that was the video that you
just saw and and and then second
anything that essentially insults
Turkish pneus so that is things like the
the curd statehood Kurdish statehood
videos anything that sort of offends the
state and and those are the types of
things that we see coming in sometimes
those were those complaints are bubbling
up from the pop of people within Turkey
and then they go to their prosecutor and
the prosecutor bring the case the
interesting wrinkle in Turkey that has
resulted in our long-standing block is
that the the Turkish prosecutors and the
courts in the authority that actually
Institute's the blocks the telecom
authority will not tell us which videos
they don't like unless we register as an
entity within Turkey subject to their
laws right so we're ending up in sort of
a strange jurisdictional problem where
we have this service called YouTube it's
cool
noble we offer it to the world but but
in order for us to find out even what
they think is offensive or illegal in
their country we actually have to submit
to Turkish Authority which would mean
that effectively they want to be able to
censor this global product for the whole
world based on Turkish laws and and
obviously we haven't done that that's
the reason that we've been blocked in
Turkey for a year Rick so from the
network side one of the real problems
with this kind of situation is kind of
blunt force instrument used by other
regulators to try to halt the flow of
content that they're not happy about for
whatever reason this goes back many
years and Vint remembers is actually the
the the Nazi memorabilia i think is the
the yahoo case liquor in in germany
which you know went on for a number of
years france i'm sorry france my
apologies france um and so you know when
the regulators do something they don't
like rather than say we're going to stop
that one piece of content or that one
activity they go after the whole site so
they want to bring everything down and
and by doing so of course they get your
attention but it also brings down
everything else which which was not
offensive and otherwise serving the
interests won't presumably end users
they're also the additional overlay on
top of that of in some places if you
have a server in somebody's country
serving the content then ostensibly
you're subject to their regulations
however your servers in United States
and people are reaching you you know
through the u.s. com then you know I
think it's our belief that we have the
right to to put that content out there
according to the laws and the norms of
our society you know I guess I would
just add a couple a couple of things as
a Rick sort of mentioned this has been a
known bug for a little while right the
leaker case was probably the wake-up
call in circa 2000 this was the case in
France where some French NGOs basically
sued Yahoo about some Nazi memorabilia
that was available not on their french
site it had been taken down on their
french site was available through their
us site and we have seen since then a
number of cases like this now you know
rick is you know so part of the problem
is the blunt instrument issue which is
that the government's actually don't
necessarily have available ace a
the ability to block a particular video
or the you know through an order to
their ISPs necessarily but I think the
bigger issue in the one that we worry
about a lot in the United States from a
public policy point of view is this
broader jurisdictional problem right
which is if the government of France can
say or the government of Turkey can say
this video is offensive take it down but
by the way it's being served from a
service in the United States that means
they have the ability to basically reach
in the United States and take and and
you know control of the content that is
published here and that doesn't scale
very well right I mean we leave our
switch that we find ourselves in a
situation where it becomes a the most
restrictive rules govern right where
every publisher in the world now needs
to worry about if my content can be
viewed somewhere does it meet the rules
and that that is not a tenable place and
what's kind of interesting is we haven't
solved this problem like in you know
nine years since lucre we really not
made a lot of progress in the only way
well let me just add something there she
questions but I think what we're also
seeing is a hardening or an attempt hard
in some of these jurisdictional
boundaries so the the open Internet that
I know some of the architects of which
are here today um is actually facing
real real pressure from governments
themselves and and surprising government
so and we've known that Germany for
example will require filtering of
certain types of what they think of
content that they think is damaging for
children that's been in place for a few
years but Australia just passed an ISP
level filtering law and that they are in
trial right now with six companies in
Australia it's a Western democracy that
is requiring filtering so it doesn't
even matter what we decide to take down
or put up yes peas are blocking it Italy
has one on the table now and and and so
one of the trends that I'm really
worried about is that we've all had our
eye on the ball of places like China and
Turkey and Vietnam but we're talking
about Western democracies that are
instituting these filtering laws that
will change the nature of both
infrastructure and how we deal with
policy
and and when that happens the
conversations that we end up having our
with Turkey and China and Vietnam who
say well those guys are doing it why
would you have a different judgment
about what we do right and the old build
conventional wisdom I'm sorry the old
conventional wisdom was you can't
regulate the internet this is what
Andrew was saying you know it's john
gilmore censorship is just damage it's
John Perry Barlow telling you know the
cyberspace Declaration of Independence
ah well we're seeing is in fact the new
conventional wisdom is actually there
are a lot of ways that we can regulate
the internet and not all of them are
very healthy so what we've got to do is
just say it's not just a descriptive
thing to say the internet is a force for
freedom and you can't stop it it's got
to become this normative defense of the
core values that Andrew is talking about
I know there's a miracle sir so let me
see if I can take this argument up one
level which is 15 years ago when we were
looking at creating I can and all the
processes for namespaces and that we
were already getting hit with these
issues of property intellectual property
rights I know that some of the people
who were off doing that went off inside
of consulting with attorneys about
international law on the question of
sort of you know treaties between
different countries it might end up
regulated these sorts of issues and the
answer came back is where a substantial
their distance away from being able to
put in any international property rights
framework that would allow us to
arbitrate this it's now 15 some odd
years later are we and you're raising
other sets of questions in which you've
got multiple governments you know as you
were saying where Western democracies as
well as different styles of governments
which are trying to place limits on the
Internet is there a chance that that
will end up becoming enshrined in
international law as a set of
restrictions on you is that an issue
you're looking at I mean or is the
hardening of particular country
boundaries apparently the way people
have decided to go instead it's had to
say if we're laughing up here it's
because andrew is showing on the video
screen here the videos that he won't
show publicly and I'm really glad you're
not giving you getting you a preview
what you might get to see most sorry to
call so I think there are a bunch of
forces at work I think that there are
some countries that are seeking to
unilaterally right to protect to sort of
institute a virtual jurisdictional
boundary that looks a lot like their
geography at the same time I think that
for example Google has been involved in
a process helped found a process that
started with Andrew three years ago and
was launched four months ago with Yahoo
and Microsoft and the number of human
rights groups and other stakeholders so
it's a multi-stakeholder process called
the global network initiative and that
initiative is basically to set out some
principles that we as companies would
abide by in terms of what do we do in
response to demands to censor what did
we do in response to demands to produce
information that is a non-regulatory way
to try and push back a little bit but
but i think the promise of that process
is that you would have companies
standing firm together and saying we
won't do that and then NGOs with them
hopefully that say yeah that's the right
way to go and push policymakers in that
drives let me just underscores all we
have a lot of nervousness about sort of
an international you know regulatory
approach and you can look at things like
this jurisdictional issue and say well
look you know the elegant solution
actually is some form of lightweight
legal regulation that you could say you
know the approach that we've taken is a
country should have control over its
domain for lack of a better term and
we've been using actually domain name so
in google.fr we follow french law and
google.de we follow german law google ad
us we flip you know in google com we
follow us law and that's it and then we
you know we have a legal contract on top
of that about where the substantial
contact contact our that would lead to
jurisdictional trigger that would give
the government of Turkey the ability to
deal with this video for example but
that requires some kind of international
legal understanding we are and you could
imagine coming up with one save the
Hague is there's a Hague Convention
that's been looking at jurisdictional
issues in e-commerce there we have
substantial ever since we are all
lawyers to your earlier point we I think
have a very realistic understanding
about what can happen to regulatory
structures and we haven't had a
heavyweight legal regulatory structure
for the internet so far
and we honestly I think we should all be
concerned about what one would
ultimately do and so you know while it
is a way to solve certain problems I
think we all have to be a little skeptic
let me let me just offer up once maybe
somewhat more pointed answer there is
absolutely zero chance that there will
ever be a treaty that the US will sign
that will cut back on the First
Amendment with one footnote and that
footnote is copyright and intellectual
property so if you view that as an
exception to free speech which in some
conceptions of you know sort of the
Constitution it is there there is a real
effort to try to harmonize to use the
kind of trade lawyers term harmonize
international rules around copyright
let's be you know to be clear copyright
is a restriction on speech it is a
socially useful and important one and
constitutionally validated restriction
on free speech because it prevents
people other than the Creator from
deciding how and when to reproduce their
work so it's quite useful but it is
nevertheless a speech restriction end to
I think was Alan or Nicola said this
earlier a network-based implementation
of effecting that particular speech
restriction can easily be used for other
things which are not copyright which are
political or social or economic or
whatever you can use it to control
information and that's one of the things
which has caused a lot of people to be
worried about the copyright battles in
the international domain is because what
you do in order to protect yourself
against copyright in one in one instance
for very good and legitimate and valid
important reasons can immediately be
repurposed to serve a very different
function by people with very different
objectives famous add on to that in the
United States is a very similar debate
going on now about deep packet
inspection technologies used by the
broadband providers and very similar
arguments being made we need to have
this in order to filter content to
ensure the copyright is being protected
and obviously people who have who have
copyrights have the right to have those
that content protected one of the
concerns is how is that you know
interpreted how broad is copyright law
interpret
States but beyond that can DPI
technology then be used for other things
can be used then to ensure privacy to
ensure security to ensure a number of
things that oh by the way maybe you know
third party deals to prioritize certain
traffic of other traffic etc so there
are real concerns about kind of setting
the bright lines between what's
acceptable not acceptable use of these
kinds of technologies let me jump in
with a slightly different perspective
here you having this discussion sort of
on a sort of formal legal framework but
there's a there's kind of a broader
trend that is playing in both directions
which is what is the role of Nations and
and although not quite identical
language groups cultural groups and so
forth and it cuts both ways on the one
hand we have a homogenous ation process
underway globalization in which
everybody should have access to the same
content everybody should be able to talk
to everybody in some way and we also
have a specialization trend under way in
which we want to serve smaller and
smaller groups and Google actually I
would say a place very directly toward
providing different content to different
countries exactly by serving dafa
google.fr and Google de and so forth in
fact when I'm traveling and I try to get
just my regular Google it's hard to do
that because I have to find a way to
subvert that specialization which is
being offered as a service we're trying
to read your mind yeah read my mind
right so I don't know where all this is
going to go I may appreciate this is a
very very big set of issues but on the
one hand you have the problem of how do
you serve and and respect the
the I want to try to use the right
unloaded words not needs or legitimate
needs or any of those things but you
know just the extant forces that put
cultures and nations together and make
them units of some sort versus this
reducing the distance between peoples
and and breaking down barriers and so
forth that's going to play out I mean
there's only one big piece of this but
it means as a general trend across a
much bigger a straight of things and I
don't know that this is going to get so
we have the same thing within the u.s.
just 50 states with different laws about
what constitutes pornography and so
forth which I you guys can probably site
the the cases about how you get arrested
for somebody in Kentucky downloading
something that was created in California
I think that's totally right and it is
in some ways when I talked to like our
engineering teams this is actually um
this is the technical challenge right
which is how do you serve the people in
a personalized way with the services
they really want and yet continue to
enable that global exchange and I think
the answer at a really high level comes
down to making sure that what you've
built in is choice right that building
into this design the ability to choose
because so when I try and think about
how I would want the world to work I
would want for us to be able to say you
know what my kids are online I want them
to have this universe and I don't need
them at this point in their development
to go beyond this universe and I think
that that's one aspect on the other hand
there's a lot of levels of that where
there's a notion of sort of like freedom
to travel right I should be able to get
a visa to where I want to go and get
into to have a different experience I
should be able to go and see what Cuba
looks like and and so to me on the
Internet I should be able to see what
the experience for a local person in
turkey looks like
choice you actually put yourself on both
sides as a parent you obviously want to
have choice for yard as a country don't
you want to have your citizens local
bridges right and you're asking the
question of choice and I think
governments are going to want to
continue to seek control and citizens
are going to want their governments to
seek that control and I think what
you're seeing actually is a lot of
continued experimentation just really
quickly on the government side so you
know David Johnson and David Post wrote
this wonderful article in like nineteen
ninety-seven about how we might see this
emergence of new rule spaces on the
internet where people competed among and
they would self organized within
communities and we have not seen that
but it's an exciting idea you've got
things like i can write where there is
this hope that we could create a
non-governmental organization for
management of key resources right and
there and you know there are a lot of
we've got some great people who spent a
lot of time in this you know the jury is
still out about how effective that
mechanism is going to be over time and
so i think we are still in the
experiment experimentation phase about
what these governance mechanisms are
going to look like Nicole's that's to
underscore Danakil set the importance of
these sort of self self organizational
things that self-regulatory things like
what we've been trying to do on content
with this global network initiative or
whether you can come up with tools you
know whether we can engineer some of
this so you give people more control
over their lives online and that helps
take some of the pressure off the
regulatory side okay so forth I'd like
to look at the problem with the other
way around you're saying that the
countries are trying to unilaterally
stop access to this information but we
are also we are also trying doing that
doing it unilaterally to impose the US
Constitution on everybody else we're
trying to tell everybody you have the
right to bear guns yeah we're you know
we're telling everybody it's free speech
except for copyright you know copyright
is a u.s. you know Western concept you
know China doesn't doesn't believe in
copyright well we're trying to impose
our rules again you know against them
why don't we have a YouTube TR that like
you know that works well for turkey we
do but they don't they won't allow it
unless it's globally blocked right this
is the point about turkey is that
they're saying no you tube in turkey
less you remove this video from
everybody worldwide right so that is
maybe I mean making your way to the
giveaway right call call it call it me
tube turkey right like you know it's you
know the name is kinda irrelevant no no
but my point is that it but you see
they're not trying to enforce Turkish
law in Turkey they're trying to enforce
Turkish law globally the statement they
wanted they said is and by having these
videos available around the world you
are offending Turks around the world
take it down globally right no nobody
better but actually I think that it's
more I think it it's a great point I I
just think it instantly furthers your
point which is to say it's not just the
u.s. trying to impose its will globally
other countries also would like to be
able to impose their will globally but
we're also arguing here for openness
let's just say as a value right I'm
sitting here saying we should be
defending these core values that this
jurisdictional problem is a problem
because you're going to impose a
restrictive speech regime for example
and you're saying religion Utley will
lie why is that the right value saying
why are you imposing the right to bear
arms on other countries that's where I
like you know that's where it means to
be to the right speech about the right
to bear arms or the actual right to bear
arms well if you if you talk about the
speech you can tell people to kill right
there is there are I'm talking about the
Constitution itself like the different
amendments right so the right to bear
arms means that you can own hand guns
without the government telling you you
can't but are you talking about speech
advocating that right no no you're
crossing to to a man you know two
different amendments yeah in a way yes I
mean when we're trying to say we believe
in our core values our core values
include the first and the fourth
amendment so I actually would frame it
differently because I don't I think we
get distracted when we talk about Google
trying to vindicate the First Amendment
i would say that we're trying to
vindicate freedom of expression as
expressed in the Universal Declaration
of Human Rights and that to me is a
global principle it is it is a terrible
right which means that there are
exceptions to it but they're very
specifically articulated as well those
limitations
and and and so I I don't we have had
that flaw because I think we've common
I'm a First Amendment attorney so I'm
going to come out come out with what I
know which is to refer to First
Amendment rights but I actually don't
think their First Amendment right their
freedom of expression rights which
should be global so that's what I mean
that's where I guess we disagree I mean
I come from a country that went into
civil strife for like 20 years most of
it because of the ability to speak
because there was like hate speech what
country is that Lebanon Lebanon but
people don't kill each other because of
speech I'll each other they do they kill
each other because they decide to kill
it otherwise we can say like you know
arm you know guns don't kill people
right but I can insult you right now in
your country and you probably won't kill
me I think some people in my country may
actually kill you if you insult them
that's the problem is the ultimate
normative question right that that
Andrew raised right which is what for
this for the structure of the Internet
what is the normative value that we
should be designing toward and and I
think what 11 answer is should we be
designing to try and respect the the
very specific normative values of
Lebanon and what is okay and not okay to
say that would be one thing to try and
do the other is to design toward what I
think it started with his openness and
that will find a social way to deal with
what people can and can't say with each
other and I think the importance of
talking to a room like this is we are
still so much at the toddler stage of
what this will be that that designing in
a rigid way how people communicate and
what they can say to each other I think
is a very dangerous place for us right
now yeah you know let me just the point
that you're making is one that I'm that
I think is really really compelling and
important right so so it's it's one that
that that that matters a lot to me
though I think we ultimately disagree
right but I think that what you're
proposing is there are cultures that
have different points of view about free
speech and it's
rooted in a different point of view
about what the purpose of society is
Lebanon may be like India is a place
where coexistence is more important than
individual expression right so people
not killing each other is a more
important value to you and probably too
many of your country mates then giving
everybody the right to speak to each
other I think at Google if we've got any
kind of a normative value it has been
very much contrary to that I don't think
of it as a First Amendment thing because
it's nicole said the First Amendment is
a restraint on federal government
activity and so forth but it's it's a
notion of the human individual adult
anyway as an autonomous moral actor and
as an autonomous moral actor you have
the right to read what you choose to
read you have the right to speak with
you what you wish to speak other people
can read you not read you do what they
wish but it's this notion of moral
autonomy and crediting the intelligence
and dignity of that individual with the
freedoms that go along with that so to
me that's the sort of fundamental thing
that's embodied in the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights and that we
have identified at Google as kind of
like the normative value we're trying to
vindicate and it comes into conflict
with different judgments made even by
democratic societies and societies with
very different historical experiences
some like in the case of Germany or
India or I take Lebanon to that are
based in a real ground reality which is
profoundly different from our own it's a
real conflict you know I don't think
there's any easy way to solve it other
than to keep talking about it so just a
maybe it's a small question but um Steve
just said well go to some other place I
have to figure out how to subvert what
it is you've done I think the peep the
internet and maybe really the people
that work on it are rather innovative in
subverting various things that could get
put into place causing all sorts of
legal and political type of questions
somebody like Google would be in the
position to facilitate this if they so
desire to do so and enhance it what's
going to happen if these hardening of
borders and hardening of restriction
increases one would imagine that there
will be an equal and opposite reaction
in terms of technological innovation
that will try to subvert it what what do
you see how do you see this is going to
play out so it's interesting i actually
got asked this question and yesterday at
a panel at yahoo and by guy he's founded
i think it's called anchorfree or
something like that basically a proxy
server that's lets people in certain
countries access as if they were coming
from a US IP and and he's like so what
does this mean for your business I'm
just a lawyer I don't know what it means
for our business but but what it does
for me is confirm that users and
entrepreneurs are going to find a way to
communicate with each other to access
the information they need and that's
sort of the the brilliance of the
vibrancy of how the internet was
constructed so that you can have that
happen and I think you're probably right
as you see more rigid things like the
Australia filtering law taking place you
know there's a number of other countries
where that's going to happen and you
will you will find users who will find a
path around it and and until we can find
a way to swing the pendulum back and I
would just say you know we glue man do
but I'm a little bit more of an optimist
about openness as a value and how much
it's likely to take on so just digress
one second probably most important
debate that's happening and that's been
happening in Washington over over the
last 100 days there's a lot of things
going on but the thing that an
interesting thing that we've been
involved one of more interesting things
let me put it that way here's the debate
rick has described it very well you have
an incumbent that's built a network
really wants a custom to control over it
you have new entrants who really want to
innovate without permission you've got
consumers who really expect to control
what happens on that network you've got
a government that really wants build out
and so there's a lot of tensions there
the issue has nothing to do with telecom
it's actually the energy grid
and what's happening right now is a big
push to think about the internet as an
analogy right and actually so we've got
11 billion dollars in this economic
stimulus package to build out a
transmission in this country it's
incredibly important because of
renewable energy and trying to get it
from place to place but buried in that
bill is a requirement that all the 40
million some odd homes that are going to
have these smart meters under the
stimulus package that there's an
openness requirement open standards and
must be used under all these projects
and that's a huge that's a huge
development actually in terms of
creating an energy Internet some people
talked about it but it's also sort of a
an interesting idea that this the set of
values that we've created for the
internet and openness chief among them
actually taken taking root in other
areas and so I guess I would just use it
as an example saying I'm a little bit of
an optimist that opening some of itself
and the kind of values that Nicole is
talking about actually are very
compelling for a lot of different
reasons and hopefully we'll see them you
see some of these norms taking hold
rather than needing to have a big legal
heavyweight legal regime optimism from
DC Wow okay maybe i'll just i'll make
one concluding note on that question
which is so google does some things like
https access to gmail for example and
we've had it's no longer supported
anymore but we had a product called the
google web accelerator which is
basically just a piece of software that
lets you set up an encrypted tunnel to
google servers for your web queries and
there are things like that that a
company like Google can do but the
bigger you are the more vulnerable you
are to government pressure and so if I
were internet users now I would not rely
on big institutional players like Google
to try to solve those problems I would
instead be looking towards the smaller
the more innovative the more nimble I
think Google will probably be a pretty
reliable player and trying to provide
access to information to communications
and in ways that are private but it
doesn't obviate you know even a very
enthusiastic Google would not obviate
the need for other more
guerilla style solutions to evading
censorship and evading these
restrictions on information that that
that a user might feel are unwarranted
there was an article in The Times
recently about a group of software
developers who had developed precisely
that sort of infrastructure for Chinese
users who wanted to get around the
Golden Shield for and the Iranians were
using it and to such a degree that the
Chinese community had to close it off to
non-chinese users because their
infrastructure was getting overwhelmed
and proposed that then the Iranian
community was going to expats would be
constructing this infrastructure outside
of Iran for you know their families in
Iran to use so it might be interesting
to develop some kind of meter around how
much energy grid is consumed by
infrastructure developed solely for the
purpose of running around damage last
comment I wanted actually to attract
attention to the quantitative issue
behind censorship which is how small and
minority is empower to take down content
it's not just about countries or
different cultures but even inside
completely homogeneous social group some
individuals have different opinions and
they may be offended and they may want
to take down content or comment on our
links that this content is unacceptable
as an extreme example I can give my own
experience I put some song lyrics on
UCSD website which was there for 10
years and then someone called the
department and said that they are
offended by the rig's so they took it
done I that's also very important note
we tend to talk about China when in fact
what we're talking about is a set of
individuals who happen to hold power in
China this given motor that's a very
important point ok thank you all very
much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
