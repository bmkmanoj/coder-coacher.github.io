the marketing talk with Professor Barry
Schwartz on the paradox of choice and
professor Schwartz were also very
honored to have you here thank you for
coming
barry schwartz is the door and cart
white professor of social theory and
social action at Swarthmore College he
is the author of 10 books among them the
battle for human nature the cost of
living and the paradox of choice why
less is more he is a fellow of both the
American Psychological Association and
the American Psychological Society his
research and teaching focused on the
intersection of psychology and economics
and more specifically how the abundance
of choice in modern life both liberates
and bedevils those who face it so please
join me in welcoming professor Schwartz
hi everybody I'm really quite honored to
be here and just two preliminary remarks
one is I'm shorter than I used to be one
is that I I I thought it was
presumptuous for me to make myself an
expert in what you do so my talk is
mostly not going to be about what you do
it's going to be about what I take to be
a significant problem in people's lives
more generally and I trust that you're
all smart enough a to determine whether
what I have to say is relevant to what
you do and then B what to do about it so
I haven't tailored my remarks
particularly except for a few things
here and there to the particular
concerns that I imagine folks who work
here might have and want to insult you
by doing that second is I'm happy to
have you interrupt with questions and
comments as I talk and if it looks like
it's getting out of hand since I know
I'm a stern teacher I can just tell you
to shut up and save it for the end so
don't hesitate if you want to raise
something now and
as I say if it looks like I'm never
gonna get past my first two slides then
I'll change the rules okay
so first I want to acknowledge the
people I've collaborated with on a lot
of what I'm going to talk to you about
some of these are students of mine some
our colleagues in various places
anything you find worthwhile they had
nothing to do with there is in American
society not only in American society but
more here than anywhere else what I have
come to call the official syllogism and
this is a set of assumptions that we
have about well-being and about how
society should be organized that runs so
deep that I think we don't realize we
make them and the only time you start to
notice that you make them is when you
start to accumulate evidence that that
they're wrong so what is this fish
official syllogism first we all think
that the more freedom people have the
more welfare they have how could you
think otherwise this is a no-brainer
what argument could you even make to
suggest that there's anything wrong with
this assumption the second thing we
think is that the more choice people
have the more freedom they have what
does freedom mean if not choice in fact
for most Americans particularly
Americans of the educated classes
freedom and choice are two words for the
same thing to say that people have more
freedom is to say that people have more
choice and so it follows from these two
assumptions that the more choice people
have the more welfare they have so as I
say we so deeply believe this to be true
that we didn't problem most of us didn't
realize that this was just a set of
assumptions that there are other
assumptions one could make in that they
might even be empirically false and I'm
going to try to convince you today that
they are empirically false first to what
extent have has modern life embodied
these assumptions
and improve people's lives by giving
them choice this is my supermarket which
is not an especially big one the salad
dressings I should point out that
doesn't include the ten extra virgin
olive oils and twelve balsamic vinegars
that were also there in case none of the
hundred seventy five salad dressings
suited you so those of you who know how
to do combinatorial mathematics can
compute how many different homemade
salad dressings you can create out of
all those balsamic vinegars so there's a
huge amount of choices even choice about
how we get our stuff packaged and
I want to give credit to the cartoon
Bank all you're gonna see a bunch of
cartoons from The New Yorker so you
don't go to sleep and so I want to
acknowledge the cartoon Bank which has
generously given me permission to show
some but not all of the cartoons that
I'm going to be showing you so so so
we've always had choice in supermarkets
and now we have more choice how much
more in the United States there was a
three-fold increase in brands on grocery
shelves in the 1990s the average grocery
has upwards of 30,000 SKUs and these
mega groceries god only knows how much
they have so we've always had choice now
we have more choice and in the world of
consumer goods that you can tell the
same story pretty much everywhere there
was always choice and now there's more
choice and one could argue that this is
merely a quantitative change no big deal
well two things about that one sometimes
quantitative changes become qualitative
if they're big enough but second in
addition to having more options than we
used to in areas where we always had
options there are whole new domains of
life where there used to be no options
where now people have significant
options and I mention this because I
want to give you a sense of what it is
that is on everybody's shoulders as they
get up out of bed every morning some of
these choices are inconsequential and
some are extremely consequential I'll
give you just a few examples of there
are many more there's probably nobody in
this room except me who's old enough to
know that there was once a time when you
could get any kind of phone service you
wanted as long as it was provided by
AT&amp;amp;T
there was a monopoly there was the phone
company and not only was there the phone
company but the phone company owned the
phone you rented it and you know what it
lasted a hundred years it never broke
these days we get to choose long
distance service local service cell
phone service and God knows we get to
choose a lot of products these are the
cell phones of the future the one I like
best is the middle
it's a phone an mp3 player a nose hair
trimmer and a creme brulee torch and if
you haven't seen this phone yet you can
be sure that in a week or two you will
and what that does is it leads people to
go into their cell phone store and ask
this question and what's the answer to
this question do you have a phone that
doesn't do too much the answer to this
question is no the only kind of cell
phone I think you can no longer buy is a
cell phone that's just a phone I guess
this is progress but it means that there
are a lot of choices we have that we
didn't have before in the world of
health care the notion that the doctor
told the patient what to do and the
patient did it is is a distant memory
nowadays the ethic of medical care in
the United States is the doctrine of
patient autonomy and what that means is
that Doc's give you the options explain
what the costs and benefits are of the
various options and you choose Doc's
proposed patients dispose and if you say
but why do you recommend a really
principled doctor will say well I
already told you these are the pluses
and minuses of surgery these are the
pluses and minuses of chemotherapy you
have to choose and if you then say but
doc if you were me what would you do the
doctor says but I'm not you so an
enormous burden is now on all of our
shoulders to make life-and-death
decisions typically on the basis of
close to no information and this burden
is mostly borne by women who take care
of themselves take care of the kids and
also take care of their husbands the
clearest evidence of how the world of
health care has changed is in the direct
marketing of prescription drugs to
people like you and me hundreds of
millions of dollars are spent every year
by drug companies selling products to
people who can't buy them why would you
ever have an ad for prescription drugs
on network television show the only
explanation is that the the model now is
that patients will call the doctor's
office the next morning and insist that
they get switched from drug X to drug Y
because they just saw a commercial
and there must also be the expectation
that Doc's will honor the patient's
requests
I don't think companies just burn money
physical appearance is a matter of
choice in a way that it didn't used to
be what do I mean by that what I mean is
that there's essentially no part of your
body that can't be altered and not only
is that true but it's no longer even
something to be ashamed of you know
people used to have cosmetic surgery and
pretend that they hadn't
and of course everybody knew that they
had because they you know their faces
looked look weirdly constructed but
everyone politely didn't talk about it
nowadays people brag about their
cosmetic surgeries at least on the two
coasts if you have too much tissue in
one part of your body and not enough in
another you can just suck it out of the
park place where you don't want and
inject it into the place where you do
what's the consequence of this the
consequence is that how you look is a
matter of choice which means that if
you're unattractive it's your fault
nobody has to play the hand they were
dealt any longer in the world of work I
know that this doesn't apply to the
people in this room but modern
technology has made it possible for each
of us to work every minute of every day
no matter where on earth we are and what
that means is that whether or not to
work is a matter of choice every minute
of every day you take your kid to the to
play soccer and you sitting there
watching the game and you've got your
cell phone on one hip and your
blackberry on your other hip and your
laptop on your lap and they're all off
and as you watch this boring game you
ask yourself maybe I can return that
call and answer that email and draft
that letter and even if you say no to
all of those things you're thinking
about saying yes
you're deliberating about it which means
that you have a decision to make and
it's a decision that you have to make
base
every 30 seconds because the game sure
as hell isn't going to get less boring
as you watch it I just want to go home
crawl into bed and do some more work as
I say I know that this doesn't apply to
anyone in this room the company pension
is a thing of the past
for a couple of reasons one is that
companies would much rather that their
employees bear the risk than that they
do but the second is that instead of
having a single financial instrument or
a couple of financial instruments that
your pension money goes into employers
in their benevolence have now offered
people large numbers of options to
choose from you have a in many
workplaces a wide array of possible
investment vehicles for your retirement
pension and I'll talk a little bit later
about the consequence of that just to
show you that everybody bears some
responsibility for this institutions
like mine have completely abdicated
responsibility for being educational
institutions we have this gigantic list
of courses and basically tell kids take
whatever you want
often with disastrous consequences now
in the world of family at least two
generations ago and maybe one and a half
generations ago I mean nobody ever
forced you to get married and nobody
forced you to have kids but there was
what you might call a default assumption
that was very powerful and governed
almost everybody's behavior and the
default assumption was that you get
married as soon as you can and you
started having a family as soon as you
can and there was only one choice to be
made and that was who the rest was sort
of laid out for you those days are
certainly gand whether or not to marry
whether to do it soon or do it late
whether or not to have kids whether to
do that soon or late none of these
things is taken for granted there is no
default and what that means is that
young people spend an enormous amount of
their
time thinking about things that were non
decisions when I was their age there's a
lot that's good about this but one
unfortunate consequence of it is that
they spend a lot less time doing the
work that I give them and I can't say
that I blame them you know I mean these
are important things to figure out and
reading another journal article is not a
life and death thing whereas making the
wrong decision about your romantic life
might be so they you know they just were
willing not to do all the work and get
bad grades so I just kept the signing
less and less work unfortunately it
hasn't helped them make any wiser
romantic decisions even your identity
has become a matter of choice in a way
that it wasn't years ago in the sense
that even though you probably inherit an
identity from your family your community
and so on it's changeable you can
reinvent yourself on a regular basis one
is encouraged to do that who do I want
to be today there's this company in
Seattle that had a slogan about where do
you want to go today Micro something
this is who do I want to be today it's
just as applicable
you gotta admit these cartoons are good
right so in every corner of our lives as
Americans the world we used to live in
looked kind of like this and the world
we now live in looks like this and the
question is is this good news or bad
news and the answer as I'm sure you can
tell is yes now I want to be absolutely
clear about this though it never helps
to say this I will say it choice and
freedom are good almost all of the
things that I have just run down for you
represent real improvements in the human
possibilities and the opportunity for
people to be autonomous and in control
of their lives and all of that is good
okay I said it remember that I said it
everyone knows that the thing that
people have not been mindful of is that
it is also bad bad in in in various ways
that I'm about to describe that is to
say there is a dark side to all of this
freedom of choice which has been up
until now completely ignored and I'm
going to try to spell out the dark all
the rest of this talk is going to be
black black black black all the things
that make everybody miserable but
remember that I know just as you do that
choice is a wonderful thing just not as
wonderful as we thought so there was a
survey done in Europe and the stem the
stem sentence of the sentence was there
was currently more choice than I need
and then they asked people about various
different aspects of consumer goods and
the results they got were this in with
respect to clothing this is the
percentage of people who agreed that
there was currently more choice than
they need washing machines savings
accounts utilities cars cleaning
products and cell phones there were no
items on the list where the mid where
less than a majority of people agreed
that there was more choice than they
needed
so with respect to everything people
thought there was more choice than they
needed they just differed from one item
to another and how much they agreed
there was more choice than they knew so
there seems to be a coming together a
consensus that people have more
decisions to make than it's worth their
time and trouble to be making and I
think there are three different effects
that too much choice has and I'm going
to talk about each of them
one effect of having too much choice is
that it produces paralysis there are so
many options to consider that you end up
choosing none the first demonstration of
this was at this fancy food store in
Palo Alto the name of which I've
forgotten they all often whenever they
get a new product they'll put it on a
table so that people can sample it so
the experimenters got them to cooperate
in this store and they put out 24
different flavors of an imported jam and
anyone who stopped by could sample as
many different flavors as they wanted
and if they did they got a coupon that
would get him a dollar off on any jam
they bought a few days later they set up
the table with six different flavors of
the same jam and if you stop by and
tasted you'd get a coupon that would get
you a dollar off and what the
experimenters found is that more people
came to the table when there were 24
jams than when there were six it was
more inviting it was more exciting it
was more interesting one-tenth as many
people bought Jam 1/10 as many people
bought Jam okay now saying they found
the same thing with writing extra credit
essays because of the connection between
this company and Stanford I just thought
I should mention this in a social psych
course if you wrote an essay an essay
you could get extra credit towards your
grade and what was nice about this is
that the credit was independent of the
quality of what you wrote which could
only happen at Stanford
so so one one class the kids got 30
different essay topics to choose from in
another class they got six and the the
investigators look to see how many
people actually wrote essays fewer
people wrote essays when they had 30
topics to choose from
than when they had six topics to choose
and I think it's the same as with a jam
you know which flavor jam should I buy
they're all attractive you know this is
novel this is distinctive this I know I
like by peanut butter same thing happens
with the essays all these interesting
topics I don't know which one to choose
so I end up doing calculus homework
instead speed-dating you know what speed
dating is of course you do so I mean if
if not here where so they set up a speed
that two speed-dating evenings and then
one one evening people had 12 dates and
another one they had six and the
question was how many matches get made
and the answer is more matches are made
when you have six dates than when you
have 12 see more people have more
choices make fewer selections and
finally to raise the stakes quite about
a lot the the researchers got access
thanks to the cooperation of Vanguard
and about 1,500 employers to the the
investment records of a million
employees working as I say at 1500
different companies and what they were
interested in was this how does the
number of mutual funds that the employer
makes available affect the rate at which
employees participate so all you're
doing you know so one company offers
three funds 110 130 101 300 does that
matter
the answer is yes how does it matter for
every ten funds the employer makes
available participation goes down two
percent the more funds you offer the
lower the rate of participation
understand that in most of these cases
not all but most not participating mint
passing up significant amount of money
from the employer matching money it was
like you were taking a match and
lighting it to a 5,000 dollar bill
because you didn't know which fund
your retirement money into now this is
an extremely consequential finding since
Americans to save nothing and everybody
is going to be eating dog food in 30
years when they retire with no money in
the bank and and and what makes it
especially significant is that if you
were a benevolent employer and you were
concerned that your employees weren't
putting enough money away for their
retirement and you went to an investment
advisor any investment advisor and said
listen what can I do to get my employees
to save more every single one of them
would have told you the same thing give
them more choice then everyone will find
just the right fund with the right
amount of risk and safety and so on to
satisfy their particular needs and
tastes give them more choice the worst
possible advice so this is the this is
the first effect of too much choice it
produces paralysis there's a little bit
of research in real life on reducing
assortment in groceries for some reason
all the research that's been done in
real life settings has been done with
supermarkets what happens when you
reduce the amount of selection in a
grocery is that the strong brands gain
market share the higher priced brands
gain market share store brands lose
market share and by and large shoppers
are not influenced by how many different
kinds of things are on the shelves
they're just influenced by how much
stuff is on the shelves so as long as
you keep the amount of stuff on the
shelves bountiful there will be no
perception on the part of shoppers that
you have reduced choice however they
will buy more and they'll be more
satisfied they won't feel like you've
taken anything away from them they will
shop they will buy more and they'll be
happier with the experience overall
sales go up though only marginally when
you reduce variety so
saurons lose well I guess statistically
reliable yeah I mean I suppose this is
probably a compliment to higher priced
brands
I mean higher priced brands gaining
change because it wants you to buy its
brand because it's got a better it's got
a better markup that may be true but but
also they're only handful of studies and
we don't know whether this is inevitable
this is what's been found but if you
engineer things you might be able to get
the benefits of reduced selection
without paying that particular price for
example Trader Joe's is the
fastest-growing supermarket chain in the
United States and everything they are a
store brand pretty much so it's not
inevitable there are two caveats to this
choice paralysis thing that's worth
mentioning one is what's known as
preference articulation if you know
exactly what you're looking for more
choice is better because the more
options there are the more likely it is
that you'll be able to find exactly what
you want so he calls this preference
articulation and the model here is
before you look at anything you sit down
and you say what do I want in a car and
you list all the things you care about
in a car and then you go out in the
world to do a pattern match and find it
how often do people make choices like
this my estimate is never at least for
anything more complicated than say
raisins instead what happens is you kind
of get a rough idea what you care about
in a car it's got to be safe it's got to
be fuel-efficient and after that you let
the market help you figure out what else
you care about so you go shopping trying
to answer two questions one why do I
care about in a car - which one of these
things has what I care about and under
those conditions choice paralysis is a
likely result however it's useful advice
to you personally to sit down and figure
out exactly why you're buying whatever
it is you're buying before you look at
any of the alternatives I know that no
one will do that it's way too hard
second if the option if the different
options are
Allina Bellini that they are can all be
scaled on the same dimension then again
more options are better than fewer so if
you're going to Kentucky Fried Chicken I
bet nobody eats that crap if you're
going to buy Kentucky Fried Chicken or
some equivalent and you turns out that
they've now offer you a one box a two
box a three box a four bucks a five box
an eight box of any sized portion you
want the more different size portions
they offer the happier you are everyone
will be able to get exactly the number
of pieces they want and that's the only
respect in which these different options
differ is the size of the box so if that
you're talking about choices that are
like this more is better more options
are better than fewer again how often
are these the kinds of choices people
are making I would say close to never it
almost always involves multiple
dimensions it involves making trade-offs
and under those conditions you can
boggle the mind by giving people too
much choice second if you overcome
paralysis and choose the second effect
that too much choice has is it it
induces you to make worse decisions in
the dating case the speed-dating case
here's what happens you ask people in
advance what do you care about in a
romantic partner and they tell you all
of the right things I want somebody
who's smart interesting makes me laugh
kind understanding thoughtful sensitive
empathic and really hot okay now comes
the dating experience now evaluating how
smart how kind how empathic how funny
how all of those things twelve different
people are is hard so what do people do
they use a simplifying strategy and they
end up choosing entirely on the basis of
how hot then they wake up the next
morning and they go what was I thinking
so they they adopt a strategy that makes
the decision make a bowl but simplifying
strategy but the problem is that the
criteria that are simple aren't the ones
that really matter so they will
consistently make bad decisions just
because the world has forced them to
adopt a strategy that simple
that the information assessment tasks in
the case of the 401k people who knew
that it was stupid beyond words not to
participate I have to participate my
employer is giving me five thousand
bucks I have to do something what do
they do for every ten mutual funds you
offer the number of people who put their
money into a money market account goes
up seven percent so they make the worst
possible investment because they know
they have to do something but they don't
know which thing so they say oh I'll
just put it in the bank and tomorrow
I'll figure out what mutual fund to
invest in you know they get three
quarters of a percent half percent
interest you could take a dart and throw
it at the set of mutual fund
opportunities and any of them would be
better than what they choose it's a nice
simplifying strategy but it's clearly
not the right decision okay but mostly I
want to focus on the third effect that
too much choice has if you manage to
overcome paralysis and if you manage to
make a good decision what happens to the
satisfaction you get out of making good
decisions and I want to focus on this
because this is I think in some ways the
most surprising aspect of the problem
and perhaps the most significant people
may do better objectively when they have
a lot of options to choose from as
opposed to a few however they will feel
worse doing better and feeling worse is
the song I'm going to be singing to you
for the next a long time so
they don't quite say this but this is
what they're thinking you can't see the
captions they never should have allowed
us to be free-range okay now why does
this happen well I didn't know exactly
where to fit this in so I'll put it in
here it doesn't quite fit but it's ought
to be relevant to you study was recently
done what it shows us is that people
don't know their own minds very well
this will come as a shock to you I'm
sure this was a study where people got
to rate digital CD players so it was all
software and people got one CD player
had seven features one had fourteen and
one had twenty-one and people got to
first they they were asked which of them
they would prefer and the majority of
people said they would prefer the CD
player that had 21 features that is to
say they're interested in choosing
something that has enormous capability
now you let them construct their own CD
player by giving them a list of the 21
different features that are available
you see how many of them they pick they
pick only 19 of the 21 I want my CD
player to have these particular 19
customized features now in the third
experiment you actually let people use
the CD player with 21 features for a
while give them a manual let them play
with it and now you have them choose
between that and a seven and a CD player
that has seven features and now they
choose the simpler one so there's a
trade-off between capability and
usability this is as far as I know no
one has figured out how to achieve
maximum capability and maximum usability
in the same device there's a trade-off
in prospect capability seems way more
important than usability in practice the
reverse is true what's weird about this
though is that it's not like the people
in the study haven't already learned
this right they probably have closets
full of devices that they never use
because they couldn't figure out how to
get it to
the simple things because it was able to
do all these complicated things they
have taught themselves again and again
and again that usability is more
important than capability nonetheless
when the next device appears it seems
that they're driven by capability rather
than usability so people are not likely
to get this right on their own and I
mentioned this because it seems to me
that you are in perhaps a unique
position in knowing this to help to
protect people from themselves which is
what I'm going to recommend to you at
the end so why is it that all this
choice makes people miserable there are
four different things for different
reasons the first is regret you choose
something and it's good is it perfect
nothing's perfect
but it's good yeah
you think I could get to that position
no excuse ability
it's true you're absolutely right I mean
capability is both a prediction about
what the what you'll want the device to
do and a prediction about what your
you'll be able to get the device to do
but experience teaches most people not
all people that they will never either
for reasons of talent or temperament or
time they will never be able to get the
device to do all the wonderful things it
can do and it doesn't seem to stop them
from choosing exactly that the that kind
of device the next time around and it's
not like these choices are are free
because when you when you choose a
device that's got a lot of capability
invariably the easy things are hard to
do harder to do you know plug and play
right so the result is that you end up
getting even less out of the highly
capable device than you would out of a
less capable device where it was
transparent how to get it to do the
things you cared about so yes it may be
aspirational but the question is why
don't people learn from their failed
aspirational efforts in the past to
adopt a different set of standards about
what they should be looking for and you
know people are endlessly optimistic
tomorrow is in the first day of the rest
of my life could be that so regret any
choice that's not perfect it's easy to
imagine an alternative would have been
better and the more alternatives there
are the more the easier is to imagine
that an alternative would have been
better if there are only two different
kinds of serial to choose from how much
can you regret the one you chose if
there are 200 well now I mean only an
idiot could think that you've actually
stumbled onto the best serial so what
regrets gonna do is it's going to reduce
the satisfaction you get out of good
choices
what anticipated regret does is that
prevents you from making choices at all
you're so sure you're gonna regret the
decision that you don't make it this I'm
sure is a lot of why people don't put
money into their 401ks some other fund
will outperform the one they choose and
they'll spend the rest of their lives
kicking themselves the specter of regret
I think makes even unimportant decisions
loom large and lastly for all eternity
French blue cheese
or ranch you know for one salad it
really doesn't matter what dressing you
have but if I tell you you're gonna pick
the salad dress and you're gonna have
from now until the end of time you
really want to get that right and I
think that the specter that people will
regret their decisions is is really
what's driving the agony that people
have making even inconsequential choices
second related to regret what economists
call opportunity costs and that is once
again you make a choice but it's the
thing you choose is not the best in all
respects you you get great gas mileage
and real safety and reliability but the
ride isn't as smooth as you might like
or you get a really smooth ride and
everybody stops and looks at your car as
you drive by but the get the mileage
sucks and the things in the shop every
three days so life is trade-offs the
more options you look at the more
options there are the more options you
look at the more you will identify
attractive features in options that you
reject and so you might well choose the
thing that is the best for you but still
be unhappy about all these attractive
features of other options that you had
to pass up and all these opportunity
costs add and what they do cumulatively
is subtract from the satisfaction you
get out of the decision you made even if
you made the right decision so there's a
lot to say about opportunity costs
parents aren't told enough about this
when they are prospective parents we
family really miss going to the theater
and eating a nice restaurant so we gave
our kids away and there's this one eye
people don't need to have this explained
even though they don't come from New
York but the thing to think about here
is here are these people living in a
midtown apartment house and they have a
place in the Hamptons and there they are
sitting on the beach have the beach
themselves it's gorgeous it's August
what could be better life is perfect and
all this guy is thinking is that it's
August everyone in our neighborhoods
away on vacation I could be parking
right in front of my house
and every day he sits on the beach and
instead of you know being thankful for
the beautiful weather and the beautiful
setting all he is is pissed off about
the parking spaces he's blowing and
that's gonna make his vacation a lot
less enjoyable than it would have been
if he didn't hadn't had to pass up great
parking spaces one last example
there's no caption on this one I think a
captions quite unnecessary just to show
you that this is not just a fiction of
New Yorker cartoonists imagination
here's a study people participate in an
experiment and then when they're done
you offer them $2 as a token of
appreciation for their participating or
you say we have these nice pens with the
school logo that are available in the
bookstore for about two and a half
dollars and if you'd rather you can have
a pen and under these conditions 75% of
people choose the pen over the 2 bucks
in another condition you offer them the
2 bucks or that same good pen or two
less expensive pens now the question is
what percentage of people in this
condition will choose either of the pen
options and the answer as is should be
obvious to you has to be at least 75
percent right 75 percent of people
prefer the good pen to 2 bucks
how can fewer than 75 percent of people
prefer either pen to 2 bucks but then
you're saying to yourself why would he
be talking to you about this trivial
study and the answer is that 45 percent
shoes either pin and this really
captures in a nutshell what opportunity
costs do you're looking at the good pen
and it's a good pen it's nice to have a
good pen but you're giving up the
opportunity to have two pens and that
makes the good pen feel less good so you
look at the two pens and you know
that'll take care of all the writing you
have to do for the whole semester but
you know once in your life would be nice
to write with a good pen and that makes
the two pens less good so the thing
you're you're passing up with the
alternative subtracts from the
satisfaction you'd get from whichever
one you choose and suddenly neither of
the pens is as good as $2 so you take
the 2 bucks this in a nutshell is what
life is like when people are choosing
from among a large set of attractive
alternatives the thing you end up
choosing is never going to be as good
feel as good as it would have if this if
the choice set were smaller another way
of saying this is that everything
suffers from comparison
there's a nice little study I don't have
time to get there's a theoretical
rationale for this that derives from a
theory that Daniel Kahneman and Amos
Tversky developed known as prospect
theory some of you may have sort of
encountered it in one place or another
torski was a psychologist at Stanford
who sadly died about a decade ago of a
brain tumor and Kahneman just recently
won the Nobel Prize for this work anyway
there's a theoretical rationale for this
but the result is simply this you ask
one set of people in the in the san
francisco area how much would you pay
for a plane ticket for a weekend in Las
Vegas how much would you be willing to
pay for to fly for a long weekend in Las
Vegas and people give you a number other
group of people you say you know you're
thinking about going away to Seattle to
LA and to Las Vegas how much would you
pay for a plane ticket to Las Vegas so
you're asking them the same question but
in one case you are forcing them
explicitly to think about the value of
going to Las Vegas in comparison with
the alternatives and they people are
willing to pay significantly less money
in the latter case than in the former
and this is true whether it's Las Vegas
or LA or Seattle doesn't matter which
one you're asking about people will pay
less for a ticket anyplace when they're
evaluating it in a larger set than when
they're evaluating it by itself okay one
other thing about opportunity cost that
might surprise you is there anyone in
this room who's pressed for time
no oh you are treated really really well
so why do you think people feel so much
time pressure mostly people assume I
assume that it's the pressure to get the
things done that you have to get done we
all have a very long to-do list we never
get to the bottom of it and that's why
we feel rushed for time so people did a
study in which some people were asked to
list all the things they had to do and
other people were asked to list all the
things they'd like to do and then they
were asked a bunch of questions having
to do with time pressure and guess which
group felt more time pressure not the
group with a list of chores the group
with a list of desirable activities what
really seems to create a sense that
there's not enough time is all of the
things we want to do and like to do that
we don't have time to do and that we're
going to have to make choices among that
create this sense that there's not
enough time in life for me to be the
person I want to be and do the things I
want to do okay third I want to talk
about that the third reason why we do
well and feel crappy is that when there
are a lot of options it's inevitable
that our expectations about how good the
chosen option will be go up the story I
used to make this point is when I went
to replace my jeans at the gap and for
years and years I'd buy jeans and they
came in one style and I bought them and
they fit however they fit which was
usually not very well and you'd you know
sort of break them in and wear them
forever because it was so unpleasant to
break them in so I go to replace my
jeans and I give them the size and and I
get asked you want slim fit easy fit
relax fish fit buttons fly zipper flies
don't wash the acid-wash bootcut on and
on it goes so I tried on every damn kind
of jeans they had and I walked out with
the best fitting jeans I had ever had
honest and I felt worse I did better and
I felt worse and the question was why
and the answer was when they only came
in one style or two I had no
expectations about how well they would
fit when they came in 20 styles I
expected perfection and what I got was
good but it wasn't perfection we
evaluate our experiences in large part
by comparing them to what we expect them
to be and if our expectations are high
even good experiences we'll end up
feeling like we have failed and there's
no way I can imagine that adding options
in people's lives will do anything other
than raise people's expectations plus
the world does this to us right travel
agents contractors would it be possible
for you totally exaggerated how much
it'll cost and how long it'll take so
we'll be pleasantly surprised in the end
everything was better back when
everything was worse
the truth in this is that when
everything was worse people's
expectations were lower so that it was
possible occasionally to have an
experience that exceeded expectations in
modern American society at least among
the affluent I don't think it's possible
for anything to happen
that's better than we expect it to be
because we expect everything to be
perfect and that's a recipe for at least
disappointment if not abject misery and
all this choice is one reason why this
is an exaggeration but it's funny
we tend to romanticize poverty just to
let you know case you care if this is
false people are not happy and stinking
hell holes of abject poverty what is
true is that once you cross subsistence
whatever subsistence is in your society
additional increases in wealth have
virtually no effect on well-being
there's a huge steep curve going from
zero to subsistence but once you cross
that line the curve flattens out it's
worth knowing in case you have a choice
between X and making more money almost
certainly X is what you should choose
self-blame the last thing that does us
in is that you make a choice and it's a
good choice but it's not as good as you
think it will be or hope it will be or
expect it to be and the question is why
what went wrong whose fault is it and
when you're choosing genes from two
different styles the answer to the
question what went wrong is obvious it's
the world's fault they only make them in
a couple of varieties what could I do
did the best I could but if you're
choosing from 200 styles and the result
is unsatisfactory and you ask the
question whose fault is it
it seems to me now the answer is again
obvious it's just different now the
answer is it's my fault with 200 options
there's no excuse for anything less than
perfection so not only do people have
ridiculously high expectations which are
always which which are almost never met
but then when they aren't met they
attribute the responsibility for that
failure to themselves and self blame I
think is a critical component of why we
are experiencing an epidemic of clinical
depression in the United States at a
time when we've never been richer or had
more freedom of choice people seem to be
getting sadder and sadder one there's
one modifier I want to add because I
think it's important and that is that
the problem of having too much choice is
enormous ly exacerbated made worse if
you're the kind of person who thinks
that the aim in
decision is to get the best what we call
maximizing the best job the best cell
phone the best car the best vacation the
best restaurant the best dish in the
restaurant you're out to find the best
the alternative is to be out to find
something that's good enough and good
enough can be very good you have high
standards why does this make a
difference well in a world with
unlimited choice how do you know you've
got the best you have to examine all the
possibilities well you can't examine all
the possibilities there are too many of
them
so you examine a bunch and then you
choose and if it's in any way
disappointing relative to expectations
you'll just be convinced that a little
looking a little longer in a little
different place you'd have done better
if you're out to get a good enough
alternative satisfies then you don't
need to examine all the possibilities
you just examine them one at a time and
when you find one that meets your
standards you choose it and you don't
look back so the difference between
these two decision-making Styles is
probably significant in general but it
becomes especially significant in a
world where there are essentially
unlimited options this is an example of
a Maximizer and here is a satisficer and
I studied whether this matters with a
bunch of college seniors who were
looking for jobs a few years ago we
started tracking them in October of
their senior year and we stayed with
them until June and we were interested
in how hard they found the decision how
many options they wanted how well they
did and how they felt about how well
they did and what we found in a nutshell
is this if you are a Maximizer if you
are out to get the best you get a job
with a starting salary that is 25%
higher than if you are satisfied with
good enough maximizers get better jobs
$7,500 difference 25% difference that's
a lot for a starting salary right out of
college you know
so but they are also more pessimistic
anxious stressed worried tired
overwhelmed depressed regretful and
disappointed and they are less content
optimistic elated excited and happy in
other words they do better and they feel
worse now we don't know if they how they
feel in actually on the job because the
study stopped before they had actually
started working but I have no reason to
think it wouldn't be true of their
experience on the job as it is of their
experience of a starting salary so how
can it be the choice is good and bad
because remember I said choice is good
here's how these people Coombes and Arun
and wrote wrote an article 30 years ago
in which they argued not about choice
about something else that good feelings
good things satiate and bad feelings
escalate so you know you're eating a
meal and you're starving when you start
on the first few bites are spectacular
you keep eating it's still delicious but
with each succeeding bite it gets a
little bit less delicious and a little
bit less delicious until you're no
longer getting much of a hedonic kick
out of out of your meal meanwhile
something else is happening and that is
you're starting to get full first it's
just mild hardly noticeable by the time
you get to your third course you're
really kind of sagging but your
grandmother told you that people are
starving in Africa so you have to finish
everything on your plate so you just
keep eating and eating and eating the
pleasure is gone the discomfort is
getting worse and worse and worse so
this is exactly the way I envision
choice when you go from having no choice
like being really starving to having
some choice it's all good
and the curve at the going up is the way
I imagine what what the dynamic is of
the good characteristics of choices so
along the x-axis is number of choices
along the y-axis is subjective state the
line the middle is neutral so having no
choice you feel infinitely bad as I give
you choice there's a huge improvement in
your well-being but
eventually the curve levels off and
there are diminishing marginal returns
to additional options and eventually
there are no returns two additional
options it's flat meanwhile all the
stuff that I've been describing to you
opportunity costs regret raised
expectations self blame all of that gets
bigger and bigger and bigger as the
number of choices increases and all of
that is negative and that's what this
curve is that starts out at zero and
goes down and so how you feel about your
life with any given number of choices is
simply the algebraic sum of those two
processes with me and that's what it
looks like why does it look like this
because I drew it so I can make it look
any damn way I want but but this sort of
conceptually captures what I think is
going on a point is reached where there
are no longer benefits to additional
options and there are very significant
costs very significant subjective
psychological costs and the cost can
more than outweigh the benefits so you
end up feeling worse than neutral not
simply worse than you would if you had
fewer options but actually worse than
neutral and that's the state I think
most many many people in American
society or him there's a deep point in
that curve which almost all of social
science ignores and that is what we've
called the monotonicity assumption so
people who do research assume that the
function relating x and y goes in one
direction it doesn't have to be a
straight line but it doesn't change
direction so you have one group that has
no choice and one group has has a choice
between two options that group is
happier than the group that has no
choice you don't need to study three
options because we know what that's
going to look like just keep on
extrapolating the curve at now I say
this only because there were fifty years
worth of studies comparing no options to
two options and it never occurred to
anyone to look at five or ten options
because we knew what it would look like
and we just knew the wrong thing because
the relation between choice and
satisfaction is not monotonic it changes
in direction at some point
second principle that's worth paying
attention to is what I call the leakage
principle a very elegant name you'll
agree and that is the context in which
you make the decision will continue to
exert its influence after the decision
is made and you're actually experiencing
the thing you've chosen so the anguish
you go through and choosing a car or a
job or a spouse or a restaurant doesn't
stop when the choice is over it's not
like okay I've now got this car and I'm
just going to evaluate it on its own
terms
know the effects the comparisons that
you are making while making the decision
will continue to influence you as you
experience the car and the result is
that you will like it less than you
should you will under appreciate it if
you have tortured yourself in making the
selection this raises an interesting
point that I think is directly relevant
to the work you people do and this is
what economists refer to as the
principal agent distinction you know
principals are the people who are going
to experience the good agents are the
people who get it for them so we have
financial advisers to tell us what
stocks to buy insurance agents to tell
us what insurance to get real estate
agents to tell us what house to buy and
so on we are hiring their expertise and
that's what we think that's why we think
we're doing it we're also hiring
something else and that is if you have
an agent
choosing your house your car and your
insurance you don't have to make the
comparisons and what that means is that
you won't suffer all of the effects of
all of these choices because you only
get to see the result your agent says
buy a Honda Civic so you buy a Honda
Civic your agent says buy this six point
three million dollar house up on the
hill it's a steal for all I know in this
neighborhood that would be a steal so
the agent is the one who's suffering
making all of these comparisons except
it's not really suffering because the
agent isn't going to experience whatever
gets chosen you are separating the
choice from the experience and as a
result you're making the person who is
having the experi
more satisfied than he or she would
otherwise be and what the thing I want
to emphasize is that this is true even
if your agent doesn't know one bit more
about the thing than you do you're the
agent doesn't need to be an expert in
order for you to benefit from the advice
that the agent gives you all the agent
needs to do is not be a complete moron
and actually be interested in in making
you better off and you will be better
off because you don't torture yourself
over the decision all that's done by
somebody else and one view of what of
what search engines can do or might do
for people is that they act as agents
presenting results hiding all of the
tortured comparisons that must be made
in order to prioritize results so you
only get to see the winner and the
result is that you appreciate the winner
much more than you would if you had to
do all those comparisons yourself almost
done this is just to show you that there
are companies that know this they have
limited selection and they do very well
Costco do they have Costco's out here
yeah it started in Seattle right Costco
is the store that people leave with the
biggest smiles on their faces that's the
store people like to shop in most
limited selection good prices and these
are the little surprise things that they
have for sale in this little affordable
luxuries that they don't normally carry
Greek dinars in New York City so Greek
dinars it's not like they have Greek
food they just owned by Greek people and
they their menus are about a thousand
pages there is no dish that anyone has
ever eaten that isn't somewhere on those
menus and tucked in the front cover of
the menu is a little piece of paper
clipped to the front of the menu with
today's specials four or five items two
things to know about today's specials
one they're the highest margin items -
they're the same every day
inadvertently you create an insoluble
problem by giving people ten thousand
things to choose from and then you solve
it for them by giving them today's
specials and people are driven to choose
take your advice take your
recommendation and choose today's
specials so you know they make a lot
more money than they otherwise would and
they solve your choice problem which of
course they've created okay
last substantive slide and then I'll say
just a word or two about how this might
relate to you guys the more choices are
available for people the more likely it
is that people will choose nothing that
pert they will be paralyzed what do you
do in the face of that paralysis
paralysis can be extremely costly
sometimes you really should act Richard
Thaler an economist and Cass Sunstein a
professor of law at the University of
Chicago have actually offered a guide
for public policy which they call
libertarian paternalism and the title of
their paper is libertarian paternalism
is not an oxymoron although it would
seem to be and here's their argument
I'll give it to you with examples let's
choose this one in the United States
when you renew your driver's license you
get asked would you like to be an organ
donor 28% of American license drivers
are organ donors eighty-five percent of
Americans think organ donation is a good
thing
twenty-eight percent of licensed drivers
are organ donors several different
European countries they do the same
thing when you renew your driver's
license you get the opportunity to be an
organ donor and in these countries
ninety percent of licensed drivers are
organ donors twenty-eight percent in the
u.s. 90 percent in these European
countries what's the difference
Europeans are nicer than Americans I
don't think so opt-in versus opt-out in
Europe you're an organ donor unless you
say no in the United States you're not
an organ donor unless you say yes now
understand that either way all you have
to do is check a box and sign a form
this is not exactly rocket science
nonetheless with the high likelihood
that people will do nothing Thaler and
Sunstein argue organize options so
if people do nothing they get what is
almost certainly in their interests
that's the paternalistic part the
libertarian part is you do you do you do
give them the opportunity to say no with
respect to 401k participation same story
almost every workplace in the United
States you have to sign a form that says
withhold 5% of my pay and put it into
something and if you don't nothing is
withheld suppose you reverse that and
the form says don't deduct 5% of my pay
I want every bloody penny of it you
dramatically increase the rate of
participation in 401ks and we have good
reason to believe that this
paternalistic manipulation of what the
default is is actually doing what people
want because as I say 85% of Americans
support organ donation and virtually
everybody ends up participating in the
401k so all you're doing is inducing
them to do it a little bit sooner so in
a world in which people are more and
more likely because of the overwhelming
number of choices they face and the
complexity of life to do nothing the
most useful thing that policy can do is
organize the space so that when they do
nothing good things happen it will have
as big an effect on the character of a
variety of American social institutions
the bigger effect than anything else I
can think of and it's free essentially
free so it is worth thinking long and
hard about what the defaults should be
so that people are mostly satisfied with
the with what happens to them if they
don't do do anything ok google' I
already said this I think the capability
usability problem is relevant to you but
you know better than I had a how you
faced it and how you would solve it I
must say I like a lot that you give
people what do you call it packets pack
instead of letting people choose one
from column a and two from column B use
you say if I were you I'd say a lot
harder I'd say listen this is what we
think you should have
and you've got it instead of just saying
you can have it all if you want it
urge people to want it we know more than
you do this is what you should have
structure our options hierarchically a
way of reducing the choice paralysis is
to give people a choice among four or
five options and then once they've you
know create trees create trees
intelligently so that people never have
to go back up the tree realizing that
they've gone down the wrong branch I
know this isn't easy but this is going
to be a lot more satisfying and usable
for people than presenting one hundred
and twenty five options all at once and
it is worth paying a lot of attention to
how people use your products to know
just how these trees should be
structured so that you never feel like
you're choosing among a very large set
of options I get the feeling that
there's nothing I can say that you
haven't already thought about in this
connection but what the hell I'll say it
anyway I believe that for the most part
you people are part of the solution
rather than part of the problem - to a
pulla slogan from the 60s out of my back
pocket and that's something that you
should be very pleased about and I'm
certainly thrilled to death that you
exist because you certainly part of the
solution and not part of the problem in
my world although there is one thing I'd
like you to fix that we can talk about
later but I don't think there's anything
inevitable about this I think that you
remain part of the solution rather than
becoming part of the problem only if you
are deliberately and self-consciously
trying to be part of the solution
there's enormous pressure to move in
other directions where it will you will
you will confuse and muddle and and
frustrate people rather than rather than
serving them and with your I clearly on
the prize and and on how much people
need to be guided by the kind of
information you offer you can resist the
pressure that you may experience some
day in the future to be something
different than what you set out to be so
