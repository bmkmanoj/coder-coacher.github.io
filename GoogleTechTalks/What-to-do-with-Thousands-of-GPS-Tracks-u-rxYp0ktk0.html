talk is about GPS tracking and what do
you do with information collected from
GBS our speaker today is John chrome
from Microsoft Research John graduated
from CMU in 1993 was PhD in robotics and
he work it in the robotics enter in SNL
for four years in object detection and
icing individuals and sidecar defections
and then he joined Microsoft Research in
1997 and since then he was working in
location determination location-based
services he worked in many systems
actually smart move X which is our F
based in Asian determination look at you
which is based doing radio signal
strengths and sport which is based on FM
signal strength so without any further
introduction I introduce John thank you
come today thanks thanks it out so that
the reason I know Adele is he was a
summer intern of my head at Microsoft a
few years ago one of my one of my
favorite ones and and I was going to be
down here and I got in contact with him
and I said I just want to see if you
really have free lunches here and so he
said he said he's going to take me to a
free lunch after my talk so we'll see if
it's really true so I said that this is
not really part of my the main outline
of my talk but I said that Adele was a
summer intern with me I just want to
tell you what what he worked on what he
did Microsoft had this product we still
do called the the spot watch which gets
actual updates on weather and dining and
traffic and movies over his side bands
of commercial FM radio stations and the
spot team came to us and said you know
could you make that watch location-aware
it's got this FM tuner in it we can tune
to any FM station and measure how strong
the signal strengths are so what Adele
did he did a really nice job and I wrote
this paper on making that watch actually
location-aware so it kind of knows you
know where it is just based on measuring
signal strengths from commercial FM
radio stations so that was a cool thing
no it's not in the product I mean it
doesn't have a database of statements
are basically what it what it does is it
looks at fingerprints how as a function
of latitude longitude what are the set
of signal strengths that you're going to
see so that that's the database it's
based on buddy no it actually doesn't
you could you do I wardriving beforehand
and to get there to ground truth so what
I'm going to talk about the rest of my
talk is projects that we've been doing
on top of some GPS data that we've been
collecting so we went out and we bought
fifty five of these garmin gps receivers
and we're learning them out to volunteer
drivers to leave on the dashboard of
their car for two weeks or four weeks at
a time they record up to 10,000
timestamp latitudes longitudes and so
far we've had 227 people go through the
program 1.77 million points and 12,500
separate trips and down below there you
can see what some of the data looks like
so these are mostly all Microsoft
employees so they're all usually around
the Seattle area in fact this is that's
Microsoft right there so it's
particularly dense there and when we
when we started with the with these GPS
receivers we didn't really know exactly
what we're going to do with them but
since then we've thought of some
research projects on top of them so I'm
going to talk about those and the first
one is destination modeling what we have
here these are destinations of people in
our study so what we do is we segment
the the GPS into into discrete trips and
the last lat-long of each trip is the
destination of that trip and we looked
at well what what can we say about
people's destinations one thing is we
can look at the types of places they
seem to like to go so the map on the
right there is a US Geological Survey
map of the of the Seattle area where
each 30 meter by 30 meters square on the
ground is categorized into one of 21
different ground cover types and what we
did is we looked at the type
ground cover that people tend to like to
go to and it turned out that commercial
and low and his low intensity
residential are the most popular ones
and kind of as you'd expect emergent
herbaceous wetlands and woody wetlands
you know which i think is another word
for swamp basically are not really all
that popular as destinations and then a
little later on I'll show how we
actually use this to do something useful
let's see oh yeah this one here that
that's a good point yeah maybe that's
what happened because that's where the
urban canyons would be and things like
that yes happen is that much in the
forest areas considering how poorly GPS
usually does was a lot of trees around
right yeah yeah we also looked at how
people behave as a function of time so
this top plot here it's as a function of
a 24-hour clock and here the number of
trips per week that people make is a
versus the time of the day so they're
not too many trips in the middle of the
night you see quite a few here at in the
morning maybe people commuting to work
and down here in the evening maybe
people are going home or going out to
restaurants like that so this kind of
makes sense you can also look at how
many of these trips are trips to new
destinations at the that we haven't
observed the person to go to before and
that peaks right around the middle of
the day you can also look at how those
things vary as the day of the week so
that's what we have over here the days
of the week and here the number of trips
taken per week and so it turns out the
most trips are taken on Thursday and I
not really sure why that would be and
then you can look at a number of new
trips places to new destinations where
the person hasn't been before and that
peaks at kind of as you'd expect on
Saturday when people might be going off
to trying new things but it's also
pretty high here on Thursday and then
finally on this destination modeling
thing we looked at how fast if people
generally kind of fall into a rut of not
visiting new destinations at all so we
in in general when we first gave the
people a GPS they visited little over
three
and a half destinations and then we
looked at how many destinations they
visited on the second day they hadn't
visited on the first day and it's down
here a little over 11 and a half and it
goes down exponentially kind of like
that so people fall into a rut sort of
you know after about two weeks they've
come fairly close to hitting steady
state we also have demographics on all
these people so we're interested in does
this rate of decay very with the
demographic makeup of the people who are
in the study we found no difference
between single people and people with a
partner children versus no children
extended family nearby or not there was
no significant difference what we did
find a small but statistically
significant difference between men and
women and and women's rate of decay is
slightly higher than men's or they go
down hit the steady state a little bit
faster yeah this is all pretty much
driving because they just put in the
dashboard of the car yeah yeah um no it
was it's totally random we just sent him
out via via the mail so whatever day
they get get there no we didn't account
for that we just we knew that the
starting dates were all random so we
were kind of hoping the randomness would
it would average out to general paper
but but you're right you know if you
like Saturday was the second day here
then you that you probably wouldn't see
quite the same behavior yeah so I don't
know why that women decline a little bit
faster than men and I'm not I don't want
to speculate on it either so the next
project was one called predestination
and this is where we're trying to
predict where you're driving to as you
drive so you get in your car start in a
trip and can we predict when you're
going to stop and get out of your car
and the reason why you'd ever want to do
that is is one is anticipatory
information if you could warn someone of
an upcoming traffic jam before they get
there
would be useful and of course you know
you can you can you can get traffic
incident data but you can only get it in
in a radius of where you are right at a
certain point and if we could actually
tell you that you're coming up on
something but not tell you about the
things that you've left behind then
that's less distraction for the driver
location-based advertising is another
one no one wants to hear about a sale on
bananas as you drive 40 miles an hour by
a grocery store but if at least in the
Seattle area we've got these third-party
parking lots around the airport so if
ten minutes before I got to the airport
I could get an ad that said there's a
discount on parking at someplace then I
actually have time to act on that ad and
I might actually actually welcome it and
then finally this is kind of interesting
application for for hybrid vehicles the
way most hybrid vehicles work they have
a gas engine that can charge up a
battery and the vehicle has to decide
when to turn on the gas engine to do
some charging so if a car is coming up a
hill say it might find that the
batteries a little bit low and say well
I guess I need to turn on the gas engine
to charge the battery at this point but
if the car knew that it was going to
have a good charging opportunity by
going down a long hill then it wouldn't
necessarily have to turn on the gas
engine before it gets to the top and so
it could be made more efficient that way
so our basic approach to this to
predicting where you're driving is we
split up the region into one kilometer
cells and we compute a probability for
each one of those cells as to whether or
not that's your destination and then
that just regular old discrete
probability distribution where they all
have to sum to 1 and so now we get back
to that ground cover model that was
talking about so that's the same bar
graph over here and if you apply those
normalized probabilities to the ground
covers that are actually inside those
those one kilometer cells then this is
the prior probability distribution that
you get and you can see that you know
probability of ending in a lake is
pretty low which is good and also real
rural areas are pretty low this is a
rural area out here but you do see some
little pops here by these little towns
on these rural areas so this kind of
makes sense we also looked at a
prior on personal destinations so the
easiest way to predict where someone is
going is to look at the places that
they've been before and so here are the
destinations that some of the people are
one person in our study so those cells
would have a higher probability we also
looked at something to try to make this
work a little better out of the box so
what you eat image here is a 40 pixel x
40 pixel image are each pixel
corresponds to one of those cells and on
day one this person visited these cells
day to these and on down to day 14 so
you can see how the destinations for
this person 2 vols over time now if we
just if we're doing predictions for day
2 based on day one we're never going to
get that destination up there because
the person hasn't visited before so we
wanted to try to account for the fact
that out of the box isn't necessarily
going to work all that well so what we
did is we tried to anticipate what the
what the probability distribution would
be on this day based on just the days
that we've observed we noticed two
things that the new destinations
sometimes sparkle so they'll just pop up
where there wasn't anyone before and and
and not nearby any other ones and they
also tend to cluster so you can see some
clusters of destinations in through here
so what we do is we add a little bit of
background probability to account for
that that's sparkling and then we also
we blur the destinations a little bit
with a wedding cake model like this
which tends to model that that
clustering and as time goes on these
this is the effect of the the background
and that that wedding cake model they
drop down to zero because the steady
state is is being approached so after
about two weeks here again we're almost
at steady state so this red line means
that we're really paying attention to
just the places that the person is
actually gone and not trying to modify
the probability distributions anymore
the third thing we looked at for
predicting where you're going and then
these all get glommed together at the
end is efficient driving and what we're
trying to model here is the fact that if
you're driving along hearsay and you
head north chances are they're not going
anyplace south like this and so what we
did is we looked at the trips that
people are actually taking and and kind
of
learned what how efficient most drivers
are and they're not a hundred percent
efficient getting to their destination
but they're they're fairly efficient so
for a candidate destination you know one
of those squares we could say if the
person has passed up a lot of
opportunities for it efficient route to
that to that cell then the probability
of that cell has to be pretty low and so
here's how that looks here's a person
who started a trip and they've gone for
square south we've recomputed the
probabilities just based on the
efficient driving and you see this
basically upper triangle has been
eliminated here where darker outline
means a higher probability and they
continued their trip down here and now
the only probabilities that are really
nonzero are down here so that's doing a
reasonable job it seems like then
finally a very simple one we list look
at a trip times you know you get in your
car here and you're probably not going
to drive to Chicago you're probably
driving you know between zero or 40
minutes or something like that so that
just tends to pound how far away the
destinations are and i'll skip the math
here but this is just to say that we put
this all together in a Bayesian
probability framework so it's all
mathematically principled and we didn't
have to come up with with how much we're
going to wait the different components
and things like that it just all fell
out of the math nicely and the result is
looks like this and this is this is the
line to look at here this is the
fraction of the trip that's been
completed and this is the median error
in predicting the the cell that you're
going to stop in where we just take the
highest probability cell as as the as
the one we think you're going to stop in
so the error goes down as a function
time as you'd expect at the halfway
point our meeting error is about two
kilometers in predicting where you're
going so another project that we did was
oh yes
yeah that involved segmenting the GPS
data and that's something that we don't
know how to do all that well but what we
did is we looked for gaps of greater
than five minutes in the data and then
we some then we had to eliminate some
little short garbage trips when we did
that but yeah we just looking for five
minute caps that that's right yeah the
way the gps is are we had to modify them
a little bit but they just set them on
the dashboard of the car plug them into
the cigarette lighter and then just
forget about him for the whole two weeks
they don't touch him again look it's
plugged in the cigarette lighter than
you could tell from the voltage with the
engines running or not I guess you could
if the gps could measure that but it
doesn't some car cigarette lighters it
turns on stay on when the keys off and
some come on I know but it'll drop to
just the battery voltage whereas when
the engine is running it goes up because
it's the alternator oh I see okay yeah
all right for the the next project I
want to talk about it requires this as a
prerequisite and this is snapping to a
road which was deceptively hard problem
it turns out what we have we have all
this GPS data and we need to know which
road the person was actually driving on
and the most common way to solve this
problem is just to snap the GPS to the
nearest road with that that causes a
disaster sometime so for example here
we've got these three GPS points 1 2 and
3 and what we want the output of the the
program to be is the fact that you were
driving on this road here even though
this GPS point didn't fall on a road or
even that close to it and it fell fairly
close to some other roads as well if you
just do a nearest road snapping you get
a problem here are three GPS points
connected by this black line one two and
three and if you just do snap to nearest
road that one snaps correctly that one
snapped correctly this one here instead
of snapping to the east-west road
snapped in the north-south Road and what
happened is the algorithm then fills in
the roads that that didn't have a GPS
point so it reasons that well if you
were on this north-south Road and next
year over here you would have had a
drive north to the first you turn
opportunity
turn around come back down and get over
here ok so the snapped nearest road you
need to do the fill-in fails like that
and so what we did is instead of looking
at just the locations of the GPS points
we looked at the time stamps as well so
point number one here this is just a
pretend scenario snapped here point
number two snaps here and the question
is where does point number three snap
should it snap over here or over to
there instead and if you just do nearest
road then it ought to snap here but what
we can also do is we can just run a
little routing algorithm and and predict
how long it would take to drive from
here to here or how long it would take
to drive from here over to there we can
see which one of those times best
matches the timestamps that we actually
got from the GPS data that would be
another good clue our gps is actually
don't record that though so we just have
the timestamp lat long altitude yep well
this is this is pretty recent and what
makes it slightly different from like
the the nav system in your car then
answers from your car uses odometry and
a compass as well as the GPS data yeah
you have the speed as well as the
position in the data you're using um no
now of course do you know you could kind
of get that yeah these are really simple
so they don't record that yep yep so
what's the frequency with the GPS points
that I got it did it depend on the just
the time or even though Delta from the
last recorded point it wasn't we put him
in an adaptive recording mode so we
wouldn't fill up the memory so if you're
in a long straightaway going at a
constant speed it won't record that many
points but if you're weaving around a
lot then it records more that the
average time between points was six
seconds or 60 meters yeah
so too so we had to wait those two air
those two errors you know how much how
much how far can we snap in distance and
how far can we snap in time basically
how much can we ignore how how what the
what the time to the plant route was so
we actually computed some statistics
assume that the air the spatial error of
GPS was Gaussian came out to about seven
point six meters and we looked at the
error in our route planner so when
you're playing these little short routes
what's what's the what's the error
between the estimated time in the actual
time to dry between these points and
that was a Gaussian looks kind of like
this so now we can wait those those two
errors when we're trying to find the
optimal route this ends up just being a
hidden Markov model where this is the
same thing that's that's used in speech
processing because in speech when
someone's along it's pretty easy
to anticipate what they're going to say
next so it's kind of like this in this
case is we've got these noisy GPS
measurements and we have to anticipate
what road the person is driving on next
so the hidden Markov model just looks at
a whole bunch of different possible Road
snaps for every point in time like this
and then picks the optimal path through
these road snaps using the Viterbi
algorithm that minimizes both the error
in space and time I'm so an example it
kind of looks like this here point one
can match to here here or here and GPS
point number two can match to here here
or here so there are three possibilities
over here four possibilities over there
so there are twelve possible little
short routes between the between these
two so we actually give those to our
route planner and ask it well how long
would it take to drive those 12
different routes and then how how how do
how does the the timing of those routes
the duration compared to the actual time
it took and then then we do the optimal
snap so point three over here might have
three different snaps and then you've
got three times 4 times 3 and the
Viterbi algorithm in the in the hidden
Markov model is it's really good at
efficiently finding the best way through
that minimizes those errors there's a
traffic jam or something he started
saying they was really far away and came
back you could yeah because because
that's a great point because our router
doesn't know about
traffic jams so it's just assuming clear
traffic so yep well yeah so this
algorithm is right well this algorithm
is actually looking at all the points on
the trip from beginning to end so it's
it's kind of a non-causal model because
it's looking to the future as well yeah
so here's here's one of the results the
black again are the the measured GPS
points just connect the dots this point
here on the nearest road snapping for
some reason snap to the the road down
below this point snapped to the correct
road but so nearest road snapping said
well if you were here or if you're on
this this highway under here and then
ended up over here what you'd have to do
is turn around come back take the
nearest entrance with the highway get on
pick up that snapped point and now the
next snap point is over here so I have
to keep going get off the highway can
back around here over here over here and
now pick up that snapped point what our
album cuts through so it ignores that
big excursion and then we just looked at
a lot of different examples of where our
algorithm works and the nearest doesn't
work so here's a GPS problem this point
gets snapped here so nearest road gets
pulled over there Bert our algorithm
doesn't distractions with crossovers
like the bridge I was just talking about
parallel roads sometimes the the point
we get snapped over the center median
into the oncoming lane of traffic Oregon
doesn't doesn't fall for that trick
distractions are just a little Spurs off
the road like this cutting through
spaghetti intersections like this the
gray is the nearest road snapping
algorithm and the white is our algorithm
passing around spaghetti intersections
looping through spaghetti so you know in
here there's just a lot of different
choices for which road you can be on ok
so the reason we did that is we wanted
to do this next project on personalized
routes and this is something that i did
with another summer intern julie lechner
from the university of washington and
what she was looking at is
you know when you go to a website now
and ask for directions between two
points you can you can ask for the
shortest route or the fastest route but
you can't ask for a route that say
sticks to the roads that you tend to
like to drive on and what Julie found is
we looked at the routes that people
actually took in our data and sixty
percent of the people were taking
neither the fastest nor the shortest
routes between two points so because
these people live in the area we assume
that they were familiar with where they
were driving so they must have had some
other reason to pick the routes that
they were picking in fact here are four
different routes between this point and
this point there's the empirically
fastest that paid attention to traffic
there's the the plan we got from mat
point the shortest distance route and
the drivers are out and all for those
are different from each other so what we
did is we looked at two ways of making
the routes better hopefully to better
match what people actually did one was
to look at traffic so we could tell we
could use our all our GPS data just as
traffic probes to for each little
section of road to see how fast traffic
was moving on there and we split those
up as a function of 15-minute segments
over the time of the day so so given the
time of day that you wanted to make the
trip we could anticipate what traffic
would be at that time and so here's
here's an example of someone who this is
just a regular commuter who starts his
trip here and ends here at midnight he
sticks to the highway like this but
during rush hour is a trick and he goes
off the highway for as long as he can
and then gets on down here the other
thing we did which is the more
interesting part I think was we looked
at the roads that each person drove on
and we would deflate the cost of their
those roads a little bit so so when you
submit the the route planning problem to
your a star search or your or your
Dykstra search it looks at the cost of
the roads and we could say multiply the
cost of the roads that you'd already
driven on by point 9 or something so
they're a little bit cheaper and the
router would tend to prefer those
instead and so we tested this on 2500
trips from our GPS data and we found
that close to forty seven percent of the
personalized trips match the actual
routes that people took and that was
quite a bit better than what
we're getting from just using a standard
router so I think that was pretty
successful in making the router more
personalized the last thing I want to
talk about is location privacy and the
motivation here is there are a lot of
reasons to send your latitude longitude
to a third party one of those is
congestion pricing so toll roads but
like all roads can be a toll road and
you just get charged at the end of the
month for which road you happen to be
driving on and when you were driving on
them location-based services we all know
about pay as you drive insurance so you
have to your insurance rates vary
depending on when when you drive this is
an interesting device this this dash
which was just announced recently it's a
navigation system that you can put on
your dashboard and it can give you
real-time traffic updates but where it
gets the updates from is other drivers
who are driving around if they encounter
some slow traffic their GPS data is
continually getting sent into a central
server which is looking for these
traffic slowdowns based on this GPS data
and then it can instantly broadcast to
the other people who have these systems
and then finally research purposes so
but people ran around London with GPS is
and made this map just by walking around
but those are all reasons that you might
want to send your data off to a third
party and you people say that well you
know even if this data is anonymized
which is what like for instance that the
dash system uses everyone has a Serie
well you know if if someone knew where
you go they could easily figure out who
you are just by figuring out where your
home is and and then from that they
could figure out your identity and
everyone's got this theory but no one
has tested it up to now so we were able
to actually test it so we start off with
these sudana mais GPS tracks that's just
the proper term for for anonymizing
something but replacing the name with a
unique ID and we tried it we infer the
home location of the people and then we
do a reverse reverse whitepages look up
to see if we can get their identity back
and so we had four simple algorithms for
trying to infer where this person
based on the GPS data and the first of
these four was called the last
destination algorithm and we segmented
all our trips all our data into discrete
trips and we looked at for every day we
look at the last destination the person
went to before three in the morning and
we took the median of all those for
every day that we observe the person and
we assume that that is the location of
their home and that was accurate down to
about 61 meters median error it will
demonstrated a somewhat similar concept
a few minutes ago who did oh right
exactly nicer yeah yeah another
algorithm just we called the the
weighted median algorithm we didn't have
to segment the data for this we just
looked at all the GPS points and we
computed the median of all the GPS
points for a particular person but the
median was was weighted by the amount of
time that you spent at that particular
location that had an error of about 67
meters we looked at a clustering
algorithm where we just clustered all
the destinations that a person had we
clustered up to i think till the cluster
size got to about 100 meters in diameter
and we then just took the the cluster
that had the most points in it figuring
that your most frequent destination is
is home and the meeting error here was
about 67 meters so the same as the
previous one then finally we looked at
this one involving probabilities and
this is the most principled of the four
but it's the one that works by far the
worst we looked at since we know the
home addresses of all the people in our
study I mean that by the way that's how
we can figure out what the error in this
this home finding algorithm is so we've
got all their home addresses what we did
is we computed the relative probability
that you're at home as a function of
time a day so this is a 24-hour clock
along the bottom here and this is
relative probability that you'll be
found at home so you can see it starts
to drop here at 8am kind of like you'd
expect so this is sort of like the
number of trips use the compliment to
the number of trips you take as a
function of the time of day goes down
here it's lower during the middle of day
and then starts to rise here around 6pm
again
and so what the algorithm does is it
looks at it for every person it tries to
find if there's a GPS point and the
highest probability bin and if it is and
it says okay that must be where they
live if there's not one in that bin and
it looks at the next highest probability
and on down the line like that we just
how do we calculate the probabilities
it's we would just look at for any given
time of day look at all the GPS points
in that one hour bin and see if any of
those points were at the home location
of the person and so just kind of
relative frequency of being at home or
not yeah so but this worked terribly you
know over two metres meeting error and I
think the reason it didn't work very
well is that we actually don't have much
data from when people are from the
middle of the night like this because
our gps's are set up in this adaptive
recording mode so when the car is parked
the they don't record any data that's
just a safe memory so if you had a
different GPS receiver that was
recording all the time then this would
probably work better hope it did but if
you know that then couldn't you say look
I've got to point at this time I've got
a point at this time and so presumably
to receive we're just sitting there for
that entire time yeah you probably could
that would that would be a good thing to
do so why wasn't this more accurate well
so our GPS recording interval six
seconds and 63 meters so you could be
fairly far away from your home before
you get a GPS reading GPS satellite
acquisition takes a little bit of time
when you just start up the car and the
GPS turns on it can take about 45
seconds before you get the first reading
from a satellite and well most dps is
have a cold start time kind of like that
and so you can drive 300 meters in in if
you're going 50 miles an hour in that 45
seconds so you can be pretty far away
from your home a lot of people have
covered parking so you don't get a GPS
signal there and a lot of ppl park far
from their home they have to park far
from their home so the GPS in the car is
not necessarily a good proxy for the
person actually lives
so the next step was to now that we had
the home location down to about I think
61 meters was that was the best we could
do was to see could we do a reverse
whitepages look up to get the identity
of the person and so you know just like
you guys we have this API into into our
search and one component of it is a
white pages look up so this is just a
little program I wrote that let you
click somewhere on the map and it gives
you the name address and phone number of
the person who lives there just based on
either latitude longitude and it's not
just because of where I work i have
access for this but anyone can download
the api and could do this too so you
wouldn't have to be an evil genius
necessarily to do this anyway could do
it and so here's how well it worked
here's our attack so we started off with
GPS tracks of 172 people we got their
home location down to about 61 meters we
actually get the identity the actual
name the correct name of the person with
five percent of those so this is kind of
low I thought it would be higher and
part of the reason is we're not getting
the the home locations all that all that
accurately but part of the reason is
that reverse geocoding doesn't really
work all that well so given a lat long
to get the house number is not
necessarily all that accurate and also
the white pages are somewhat out of date
some of this data is kind of old so we
didn't try the attack as soon as we got
the fresh data from a person we let it
accumulate for like a year and a half so
some people moved away also some people
live in multi-unit buildings like a
condo or an apartment so you're really
not going to get what apartment number
or what condo number they live in and so
we also looked at well what if we were
dissatisfied in getting their home
address which kind of gets around the
problem of you know is the white pages
up to date and we could actually get the
home address of twelve percent of the
people in the study so the first lesson
from this is that everyone's theorized
about these attacks but the attacks
actually work so there is a problem even
if the data is anonymized someone can
actually get your identity we kind of
all thought that before but but now we
know it's true we were in a position to
look at some countermeasures now for
protecting your identity from someone
doing an attack like this and so
out of people have written papers on
this how to protect your identity and
they propose different ways of doing it
of course they haven't be able to test
them so now we're able to test them and
one of the ways that they talk about is
corrupting the data so for instance here
this is some of the original data in our
study that's where the person lives and
here is a Gaussian noise added the GPS
data with 50 meters standard deviation
so it looks like that and then so the
question is now if we run this noise
data through the same algorithms that we
ran before how does it affect the
algorithm and what we did is we looked
at as a function of the amount of noise
you added the data that's the standard
deviation in meters how many correct
home address inferences do you get and
and these are just using those four
different algorithms that I talked to
that talked about so that's why there
are four different bars for each breach
number and as you'd expect the number
goes down the more noise you add but out
here you're adding five kilometers of
noise standard deviation to the signal
before you've really reduced the threat
to almost zero if you're using Gaussian
noise right do that he was maybe run
some less ring algorithm oh right yeah
sure yeah i think you know in general if
the attacker knows how you were trying
to protect the data then the tacker can
figure out how to undo that so if they
if they know it's a simple thing like
adding Gaussian noise and you know
there's a lot of statistics out there to
help you with that so you're right yep
maybe yeah yep so another technique you
can try that similar is just
discretizing the data so it's just a
coarser and so there's original data
again and here is just each point is
snap to a point on a grid where the grid
points are 50 meters apart so the data
ends up looking like that at the end so
here's the same kind of plot as a
function of the coarseness of this grid
how far apart these points are and as
you'd expect the number does go down
more course you make the grid but you've
got to get out here to a grid where the
points are two kilometers apart before
you've really reduced to almost zero the
effect of the attack did this also in
the sense that you're the actual
algorithm for figuring out where you're
going do they drop as badly as this you
discretize or admins yeah so that's a
good question you know kind of the
general question is if you're trying to
use these techniques for location-based
services how much is this effect the
usefulness of the service for instance
predicting where you're going or things
like that and that's something that we
didn't look at it all and I think that
would be a very interesting thing to
look at next let's see you know so for
some things like if you just want a
weather report right yeah you don't
really care if you're a couple
kilometers off because the weather is
not going to change but if you want to
know next time you get to a cheap gas
station or something you know then it's
important to be fairly accurate and the
final algorithm that we looked at for
protecting you is just cloaking the data
so we delete the data in a circle that's
near the person's home and specifically
what we do is we draw a small circle
around the person's home that's this the
circle here and pick a random point
inside that circle and then around that
random point we draw a bigger circle and
delete all the data inside that big
circle and the reason that we've got the
randomness in there is if you centered
this this cloaking disk on the actual
home it'll be pretty easy for an
attacker to figure that out and say okay
well had to be had to be at the middle
of this place where all the data is
missing okay how void and so here's
here's how that worked here's how many
correct home addresses we got is a
function of the radius of that little
circle the radius is the big circle the
little circle radius didn't have that
much of effect on the algorithm but the
big circle had to be about a kilometer
in an radius before the effect of the
attack was was almost zero so the lesson
here on this privacy part is that s that
attack really does work even the data
data is
nized we all kind of knew that but we
verified it but the other thing is that
some of these proposed techniques for
protecting you from an attack like this
are not very good because you have to
corrupt the data so much that it's
really probably not going to be good for
a lot of location-based services they
might want be wanting to try unless you
do that processing globally where you're
not worried about it yeah if you're not
sending the data off your device to a to
a central server than than right yep
okay so that's the end of my talk I
talked about our gathering of GPS data
the the driver models including the part
that was based on places that you tend
to like to go as a function of the
ground cover our predestination
algorithm which get your location down
to about your destination down to about
two meters at their two kilometers of
the halfway point of the trip a new
algorithm for doing Matt matching
personalized routing that pays attention
to the roads you tend to like to drive
on and then location privacy so that's
the end of my talk and thanks for
