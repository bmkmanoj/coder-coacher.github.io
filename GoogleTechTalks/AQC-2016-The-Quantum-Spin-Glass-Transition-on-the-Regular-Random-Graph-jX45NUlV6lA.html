for the invitation and apologies because
probably this talk will be will look a
little bit removed from what we have
been listening to but you should see the
connection by the end so essentially
what I want to talk about is the quantum
phase transition to the spin glass phase
so this work appeared on the archive
just last week and it's done in
collaboration with my student my PhD
student Johnny Massey
another student from the University of
Milan Tommaso Pelini and postdoc at ICP
Sebastiano Pilate okay so let me tell
you what I'm going to tell you and in
particular what I want to insist on
which is a bit conjectural if you want
but I hope I will give you enough
information maybe not to convince you
but certainly to think about the problem
okay so I want to show you that there
are any indications of the fact that the
quantum transition 0 temperature is
inherently different from the transition
at any finite temperature which is
Indian dominated by the classical point
classical point will be the finite
temperature transition 0 transverse
field and it has a that the phase
transition is much better understood
thinking in terms of the deep
paramagnetic out the deep paramagnetic
phase dies rather than out this deep
spin glass phase gets dressed with the
transistor ok in order to do this we did
a lot of numerics in particular we
studied entanglement entropy with
quantum Monte Carlo which was a
challenge by itself as you can imagine
and then we studied the typical things
like or the
spin spin correlation functions and we
looked at the scaling and the main
motivation the main argument that I said
I want to make is given essentially by a
meaningful picture that ins about the
large K limit the same game that we
played here for this model can be played
with AD with other models which are more
interesting for from the point of view
of computational communitary
optimization okay like case ah okay so
the model is the following
it's spinless model with the plus minus
1 plus minus J let's say it will be 1 in
in the in the numerix but you have to
imagine plasmas J chosen with
probability 1 alpha and Transit's field
and the connectivity graph is regular
random graph which is usually pictured
like this locally looks like a tree
instance so forth but in reality is
something like this ok so if you look
close here you will see that every point
is connected to K plus 1 where k equal 2
so three other points and you know there
are some times there are some if there
are small loops most of the time there
are n small loops and and so on so forth
ok so in principle we want to consider
both temperature and transverse field
but we want to look really at the zero
temperature ok so this is the phase
diagram which somehow is to be expected
and actually there are many works very
similar models and even some work on
this same model so without transitions
we are talking about the plus or minus J
spin class on the regular random graph
which has a transition which can be
found analytically and I will actually
give you a short argument to find this
number here which is J divided by
arctangent
squirt okay the important thing to
remember for cake well chew is one point
one three five but important thing to
remember is that for K that goes to
infinity this grows like square root of
K okay so this already tells us that for
okay so for k equal true you do a bunch
of appointment Akari pneumatics you find
this gamma critical I will show you how
we find the democrática which is one
point eighty two plus or minus 0.02 okay
but the important thing is that if this
phase diagram is to scale to something
which is similar to this curve okay will
change with K but it does get something
similar to this curve in the K going to
infinity limit then gamma critical as to
scale like J square root of K so okay
and one of the arguments there one of
the things that that I will tell you is
essentially out to find this square root
of K from a quasi particle picture one
thing that you have to keep in mind is
that you know gamma critical when K
becomes large becomes much larger than J
okay so certainly in a large k limit
trying to find this phase transition by
doing perturbation Theory round here
this point is crazy what you want to do
is perturbation theory around infinity
okay so this is essentially my main
message is that this phase transition
here is much to do with these phase much
more to do with this phase then with
this phase so not almost most probably
this phase transition doesn't know
anything about the computational
difficulty of the problem down here okay
not to say that there isn't information
on this line about the computational
difficulty there is plenty rate because
the system has to go to the ground state
here when we move along along gamma but
just not in the phase transition okay so
by the usual arguments in statistical
mechanics when the temperature is
different from zero
the trotter dimension is finite so if
you
go to the phase transition the phase
transition is a place where you can do a
normalization group transformations and
look at larger larger line scales and
this means that certain point your
throttle dimension which is one over t
will essentially become irrelevant and
you go back to the classical part okay
so it's to be expected that all this
line except this point here has very
similar properties to this point this
transition point here and the transition
can be seen by looking at the spin
spring correlation function the
connected correlation function as usual
is the derivative of the average of the
spin with respect to a field at the
point I would respect to a field put on
point J and typically this correlation
function decreases exponentially with
the distance okay at the critical point
this correlation length usually diverges
and why does it diverge so this is a
little bit for experts on the on the
regular random graph which locally looks
like a tree this computation this this
derivative can be just expanded by
taking derivatives of what are called
cavity fields and all these things are
essentially almost independent random
numbers they are not really independent
but kind of and so this product
generates an exponential factor in
particular in the paramagnetic phase
this cavity so this derivative
explicitly is this this thing here which
has a parabolic tangent to 1 over cosh 1
minus a parabolic tangent squared and
the square and blah blah blah but when
you are in the paramagnetic region these
fields H are actually going to 0 when
you go when you send them to 0 this
thing goes to 1 this goes to 0 so this
thing just becomes a hyperbolic tangent
of beta J ok I'm talking about the phase
transition at finite temperature
but on a regular random graph so okay so
good so this looks like there is a next
there is a product of things which are
less than one so which should decay
exponential so how can you have a
transition well the transition is due to
the following thing on a regular random
graph you take two random vertices and
they typically are at the distance L
which is log n divided by log K okay all
the vertices all couples of vertices are
at this distance and at this distance
it's not true that there is only one
path that connects the the the vertices
but the number of vertices is actually
but number of paths is actually order K
to the L okay so you have to sum this
susceptibility over all the paths that
connect I and J and since for every path
this calculation is correct this is a
random number because J is plus minus j
ji a a minus 1 is plus minus J so the
typical value of this random number will
be you know take the square root you
take the square root of the number of
terms times the typical value of the
thing and you see here now that you can
have a transition and the transition is
when this thing actually goes I you know
if if this product decreases
exponentially with L which is also n the
system size then then you are still in
the paramagnetic phase then it's
something but this does not happen
anymore and this gives you a critical
temperature okay so on the regular
random graph is very important that
there are many many paths
ok so unfortunately at T equals 0 we are
not able to to do this any anything like
this ok we don't have analytical control
of what happens there so we deserve to
the what under song called the indignity
of the numerical computation
dignity and so we did the quantum Monte
Carlo up to a hundred sixty spins home
and then we bind to two sufficiently low
temperature that we were sure we were in
the length equals zero limit and we
looked at bottom quote classical
quantities quantities which have a
counterpart in the classical system and
in the quantum quantities which are like
entanglement and this quasi particle
picture that I want to tell you about
and this will lead to discussing the
localization of the localization of of
these quasi particles but let's begin
with a summary of the numerix which
already tells us something ok so first
of all the rainy entropy so everything
this is a gamma critical it is asserted
from finite size scaling of different
quantities which I will show you
separately so so you have a gamma
critical which changes with 1 over N for
different things
the rainy entropy the correlation length
from the mean correlation function the
correlation length from the maximal
correlation function and the order
parameter so you see they all converge
more or less at the same point which is
this estimate here and the scaling but
the coefficient is actually different
and the thing which is the least
sensitive to the two definite size
effect is the entanglement entropy the
thing which is most sensitive apart to
the to the final size effect is the
order parameter they are interesting the
disco this this rope is larger than this
okay so for example D I don't understand
of the parameter the raw data looks like
this you go from 40 to here there is
only 140 spins and they go like this and
then you do Felisa scaling changing
finding a gamma
in gamma CN here you don't need to
change the QA and you find the gamma CL
n such that they all go on the same line
and here this also here there is a
straight line which says that the
critical exponent is one which is by the
way the same critical span you find the
classical transition so this thing
doesn't change okay then you look at the
correlation length sorry at the
correlation function between a
dispensing correlation function and what
you find is now let me explain you what
this max me naturally it means premiere
right now so so you take a point I and a
point J and you take all the points J a
distance R from the point I ok of which
there are K - they are and then you take
the maximum okay and this is C maximum
of R and this thing is very well fit by
stretched exponential in fact here I'm
plotting this C maximum versus R of X I
work size a fitting parameter in a is
the other 15 parameter and a varies with
the disorder in this particular case is
about 1/3 okay
so this falls nicely on a straight line
which means that this law is and this
allows us to get the other fitting
parameter which is the D correlation
length the spin-spin correlation length
as a maximum at the transition okay and
decreases with increasing system size
okay which is quite bizarre and so what
if you take the maximum is if you take
the mean over all the points at a given
distance they seem like they're going to
the same value which is about one-fourth
at fitting for then out did we get there
any entropy there any entropy is gotten
by calculate by doing quantum Monte
Carlo on two replicas and taking the
difference of the free energies of the
chillip liquors coupled on the part of
the system that we are tracing away or
decoupled I'm not going into the details
of how this this thing is done we can
discuss later on if you want but it's
done and what you get is these curves
here so you increase the system size
from 10 to 100 in this figure and you
see that typically the entropy grows
linearly with them everywhere okay and
it has a peak which shifts to the right
but quickly asymptotes around 1.8 then
you do find a size scaling and you find
that it they fall on top of each other
quite nicely except the point here but
this is we know from other studies in
for example in province of many-body
localization that the entanglement
entropy at the transition typically a
very large variance sample by sample
variance okay so this was to be expected
okay so all right now let's go to
perturbation here do you think that I
told you before so we found that the
transition point is gamma is equal one
point 82 and let's assume that 1.82 is a
large number okay it's certainly larger
more a large number than a small number
but you know you need a little bit of
fantasy - okay so so we think of these
as a perturbation on this right and
therefore we look at the eigenstates of
H 0 which are very easily written down
it's say all the spins aligned along the
plus direction is the ground state as
energy minus n times gamma then there
are the end the generate states in which
I have of spin flip along I
chess degenerate and as energy is 0 plus
2 gamma and then to spin flips is 0 plus
4 gamma and so on and then we think of
the minus x pins as particles okay so
Sigma Z I Sigma Z J flips the X pin
right so it can do three things if it
acts on a site where there is nothing it
can create a couple okay and this costs
energy to gamma if it eats a site
whether there is a couple it can
annihilate it and this costs energy
minus 2 gamma if it's a site where there
is a particle and D on the other side
there is no particle it moves the
particle from here to there and discuss
no energy
ok so in in the lowest order in
perturbation theory I can forget about
this these two the first two things and
just consider the last one so you have
to do the generate perturbation theory
on these graphs and essentially this
means that I have to diagonalize the
matrix J minus J IJ okay which is a
sparse matrix with plus or minus 1 and
this is a well-known problem the result
is that there is a band which spreads
out okay with slope minus 2 square root
of K J and the single particle sector
would intersect the ground state well at
gamma critical when this thing becomes 0
okay so when this thing becomes 0 and
this is gamma critical square root of K
J now let me remind you that square root
of 2 is 144 which is quite close to 1
point a still again with a little bit of
imagination ok this is the way you solve
the problem if you are interested
instead of 10 minutes sorry I can
probably talk about it so the spectrum
of this of this matrix here is almost so
you can solve it like this yeah
you can write cavity equations for the
propagator and this gives this gives an
equation for the propagator for the zzs
the real the energy plus the small part
to a small imaginary part and so since j
IJ squared is equal to j square and then
this is a deterministic equation you can
solve you get this thing here and you
get semicircle low so the density of
state of this amazonian here is a
semicircle low which ends a to square
root of K times J now you would say well
but then this is the same as the
ferromagnet problem right because if I
have a ferromagnet if I have all the J
is equal to DJ j is equal to plus J then
this would be the same right this would
be the same equation and solid alpha but
there is one thing which is different if
all the J's have the same sign then this
is a parent for Magnus I'm Italian and
there is an extra isolated eigen value
at minus JK plus 1 and this dominates
the physics of the thermic net
ferromagnet and doesn't dominate the
physics of the spin class so if you go
to two particles and you assume that
they don't interact because you can
elected the terms that make them
interact then you know you start from 4k
but then this slope is twice as much
right so in the non interacting many
particle sectors all all the ground
states of all the sectors intersect the
ground state at the same point okay
which is as I said a square root of K
times J oh by the way this is an exact
diagonalization of a system with the 10
spins and you can you the color is the
average of s as XE max which is the
number of particles and so you can see
that
this looks like this except then they
start interacting here so let's try to
put back some of the things that we have
taken out and let's see at least what's
the feeling what's happening okay so we
said that this we had a couple react
with Sigma Z Sigma Z and this disappears
okay so there is the amplitude per unit
time is minus j j for this event to
occur and the energy changes - for gamma
i can mimic this thing if I only
consider two particle processes not the
particle processes if I can mimic this
thing by saying that these two particles
if they are on top of each other they
attract with the energy minus 2 gamma
the two here is because there are two
processes possible this can jump over
here in this can jump over if so that
must be a mismatch - in order to get the
same amplitude for the ratios so to
order raw density of particles I can
substitute I can I can consider these
particles is just having a point like
interaction which is attractive okay and
if I do this in mean field the energy of
the ground state gets corrected by minus
2 gamma times Rho now if I solve this
equation as a function of gamma again I
get the correction which is plus Rho
okay and then there is a correction
which is over the Rho square but this is
of the same order of the things which I
have neglected which has three particle
things so the shift is in the right
direction is towards large gun and the
biggest change occurs for states who
have more passive particles okay so my
point is that in order to understand the
transition we need to understand what
happens to discuss the particles when
there is interaction okay and so this
leads to a lot of questions which we
have not answered in the paper but which
we have put forward and we are working
on so the phase transition is governed
by the dynamics of the quasi particle in
particular for
large K and then you can ask what's the
nature of these particles for example
are they localized okay indy
non-interacting approximation no because
we know that the single that we know
that the eigenstates of the the sparse
matrix J AJ they are all delocalized
okay but we also know that the its if
you want to see the transition you have
to go at a dense finite density at
finite density the particles which
interact with each other and there have
been several works put forward in in the
last years in the context of many body
localization one is by bodies and
labruffey
and there is a also some people by
Michael Fisher think there is some
people by Marcus Muller about
localization of highly excited States
without disorder
okay so interaction and graph disorder
but even without graph disorder this
could lead to localization is it at some
kind of many body localization that's
the localization of passive particle
lead to exponentially small gaps because
we know that many body localization
tends to to give exponentially small
gaps because the eigenstates tend to be
very different from one from chopped so
what happens when the couplings J gets
increased for now in the opposite limit
Gunma much less than J the quasiparticle
picture gives room to the distant age
okay
now gamma is the perturbation does this
transition have to pass necessarily
through a localization transition so so
this is the paramagnetic phase for small
J this is the spinless phase for large J
and here it's non interacting particles
and particle interaction becomes
important then you have this transition
that I told you which is the spin glass
transition and then prop maybe there are
localized particles here because they
are
all crammed together there's a large
density and they interact strongly with
each other and so this should come with
a with a question mark and ok so this is
the conclusion so let me repeat what I
said we looked at the properties of the
quantum phase transition quantum Monte
Carlo to that correlation function
entanglement entropy etc and we looked
at the properties of the phase
transition from the quantum coming from
the quantum paramagnetic States and this
actually I think gives a better picture
of the transition things to do we could
play the same game in other models case
at source at and so on so forth
for example studying the the the one
particle approximation to party concerns
what and and then we need to understand
what's the physics of these quasi
particles and what is the relation with
the scaling of the gap at the transition
and within the spin glass phase
yeah and then let me flush this thing
and just to if you don't know we are
having the conference
I'm very similar topic actually on the
same topic and also we are going to talk
about one simulation at HTTP and the
22nd 26th of August 2016
ok
hi aunt Oh I'd like to ask about the
algorithmic implications of your
discoveries because the problem you're
looking at is computationally
interesting finding its ground state
yeah so you know you talk about other
problems but this problem is already
patiently interesting yeah so if you
decrease the field you first seem to be
going through a phase transition where
the gap might be polynomial yes and so
that looks like good news for the
adiabatic output so then do you expect
that as you go further down that you're
going to encounter let's say the kind of
perturbative crosses that borås are
focused on or other obstacles to the
success yeah so this is exactly this
thing that they put here right so you
come from from large gum sorry small J
large gamma okay and then you come down
you do your adiabatic algorithm coming
down like this and then you encounter
this transition where the gap is
polynomial small and it's due to the
fact that this the kinetic energy gain
of the band of these of these quasi
particles beats the ground state okay
but then these quasi particles also
determine the structure of the excited
States and so if they are localized
inside the glassy phase then you get
exponentially small gap okay so I still
don't have an answer to whether these
quasi particle picture leads necessarily
to an exponential smoke gap inside the
phase but we are going to explore this
so I I'm a little bit confused by the
fact that at finite temperature you were
looking so the trajectories that were
large of the size of log of the system
size were important for to determine the
transition so you had this exponential
number of paths and so on so they so the
loops are important but here at zero
temperature you are looking at a short
transistor trajectories where the the
system is well approximated by beta
lattice by a graph so why no I'm not
looking at small portions of the regular
random graph you really have to look at
the spectrum of the full regular random
graph even for this quasi particle
picture so is this what you mean by
trajectories no no no I mean this did no
this one is not for which one is for
what do you mean for beta lattice this
this one this one oh this happens to
work also for the regular random graph
okay so it's it's a it's something which
has to do with the fact that we're
looking at the density of state if you
want to look at other things which are
more complicated like correlations
correlators then there is a difference
between metal artisanal a random graph
but for this particular thing there
isn't if you do the numerix from the
regular random graph up to a million
sites for diagonalizing JJ you get this
thing
other questions let's thank</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
