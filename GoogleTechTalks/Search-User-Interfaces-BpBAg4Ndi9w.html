happiness and tech talk talk today it's
my extreme pleasure to introduce Marty
Hurst from UC Berkeley where she's in
the ice cool I've known Marty for more
years than I think we should mention
here which means I have some great
stories to tell but I won't tell right
now in the interest of time so uh but
Marty's been working in as you probably
know is insert user interfaces for a
long time now and has the distinction of
having invented a UI main namely
textiles which has probably been
reproduced and re-implemented more times
anything else I can think of so she's
going to talk today about her book
search user interfaces available here
and I want want to give a warm welcome
to Marty Hurst dan thanks for having me
and thanks thanks to all of you coming
out especially on this holiday weekend
and I've of course a friend of Google
visited many times I get involved with
the Google educational missions trying
to improve teaching high school kids
I've been involved with the Google's
efforts to help women engineers you know
exactly summits so on so obviously is a
very close relationship between Google
and UC Berkeley and of course a lot of
what you do here has influenced what I
talk about in the book so first of all
the books available the text of the book
is available free online because I
wanted to make it as accessible as
possible to people like graduate
students people in developing nations
you can't afford to buy the book but you
people have salaries so if you'd like to
buy a physical book please do we could
get it online for forty dollars so Dan
was very kind he's very excited about
this book and he really wanted me to
give an author talk about the book
usually when I give a talk it's on a
more focused topic and I found it very
challenging to try to come up with a
talk that wouldn't be dull and talk
about cover a whole book I've made a my
best effort to pull out some highlights
and try to focus on that
i will say i gave a talk here in 2006 i
think in this room on just one chapter
of the book although the whole book
wasn't written yet and that i spent a
full hour on so you can imagine that
it's difficult to boil things down and
this topic is that one that lends itself
to lots of jokes at least maybe other
people can do it but i'll do my best to
keep you interested i'm not going to go
through the entire book but i just
wanted to show you the chapter structure
it starts with the design of search
interfaces which in itself is a little
radical because most accounts of search
to talk about users tend to start with
models of information seeking that's
usually the first chapter and i decided
not to do that but rather give a summary
of best practices hints about what's
working best now in search interfaces
and i summarize that in that chapter
then there's a very long chapter on
evaluation of search interfaces and i
got some input from people here among
other places on that then models of the
search process query formulation
retrieval results in query reformulation
are kind of a trio of chapters about the
main loop of search and search
interfaces and lots of details about
that and then a capstone chapter for
that supporting the process of search
what interfaces are out there to try to
tie all the different pieces together
then chapter eight is integrating
navigation and search which is the talk
that I gave here in 2006 which is
actually in the video archives
internally for google then
personalization information
visualization and search information
visualization for text analysis and
future trends and search interfaces but
the what these are the ones that I'm
going to talk about some in this talk I
just want to give you the overview of
the structure and none of them in
terrible detail but just trying to
highlight what I feel are somewhat
interesting or compelling points and
feel free to ask questions or disagree
or whatever my timer up okay so the
design of search interfaces chapter i'm
not going to go through all of the
points there instead of what i want to
do is ask you the audience since a lot
of you are are very knowledgeable
without search interfaces as some of the
specialists of google search are here in
the audience and to answer this question
for me why is search difficult
why is search easy give me some if you
had to write this book what makes web
search in particular let's say difficult
from a usability perspective and what
makes it easy it's difficult to read the
user's mind okay that's great we're
matching text and that answers both
questions yes I agree that's the my
point as well and I'll elaborate in a
moment others I know it's a sorta on
what you think about all the time but if
you have to sort of summarize it people
know what people don't know what's
possible so their expectations are often
unrealistic yes okay some ideas there a
part of why I put stuff this is the
first figure in the book and this is a
image that Yan pettersen put together
comparing the info seek interface from
1997 with the Google interface on the
same query in 2007 and the point he
makes is you know these are very similar
and why is that why does it look almost
the same and I use this illustration in
in the first chapter to talk about the
importance of keeping the interface
simple and what's difficult about search
and why it leads to this simplicity of
design although of course we know that's
changing some degree but one of the
reasons is you have to support an
enormous range of use cases so if you're
making a word processor the use cases
people writing articles and there's our
people writing stuff and there are a lot
of variations on that but all the
different things people can search for
could think of it's basically everything
that people can think of is a use case
for search it's people's brains and it's
over an enormous collection of
information of a wide range of types so
you're not just searching over brochures
or articles journal articles it's more
broad used by an enormous range of
people of different ages cultures
cognitive abilities assumptions and
requires reading which is one of these
things you can't really multitask
so some interfaces if you can have more
of a scanning or visual cues it doesn't
really work for when someone actually
has to fo v8 on language and consume it
and of course ideas can be expressed
many different ways and so you need to
match these different modes of
expression but why is Sergey Z and this
gets to your point well on the web at
least the collection is so big that the
same information is often stated in many
different ways at least if you're
searching in English and any technical
difficulties again no okay and so you're
more likely to get a match given any the
variable ways people might state
something there's more likely to be a
match than not and also despite the wide
variation of what people look for lots
of times people look for the same things
and you can leverage off of that take
advantage of the fact that if many
people make the same query you can see
what they click on and then improve
results and also a very simple interface
along with very highly tuned algorithms
has proven highly effective for this
wide range of people for a wide range of
tests so one away you get a pretty good
result fair amount of the time for a
fair number of the use cases for a fair
number of people so it's sort of a
two-edged sword okay so I'm not going to
go through that rest of that chapter and
just trying to keep it interesting the
next chapter is the evaluation of search
interfaces I think this is probably the
most valuable one for researchers and
scholars so spend a lot of time on it
and I have a big focus actually on what
not to do wrong because there's so many
ways to go wrong when evaluating search
interfaces so I'll highlight a few of
the points here first just a summary of
the major evaluation techniques which
most of you I'm sure are familiar with
so when you're first designing a new
interface you do informal low fidelity
discount usability testing so you don't
do a big formal study you just see if
people can't understand it at all and
don't do anything that you thought they
would and if that's the case you start
over once you're past that point and you
have a more usable design you can do
formal laboratory studies or formal
studies where
compare things with a set of
participants balanced design and try to
determine what works and what doesn't
for somewhat narrow range of phenomenon
then there's field studies which Dan
Russell and his team does a lot of where
you actually go out and watch people in
the field so with whether or not the
field is indoors or not using their
designs seeing sort of what you call
economic ecological validity in the
social science literature what people
really do when they're in their ecology
and that can be a lot different than
what they do in a lab which is
artificial and then a longitudinal
studies which I want to focus on a bit
because that's become not super popular
but I think it's an important direction
to go in especially for more academic
studies that has it been focused on the
past so I'll give an example of that
then log file analysis where you study
what people click on based on what the
query and of course what's very popular
here and major search engines large
scale testing so it showing two
different interfaces to the very large
audience of thousands or tens or
hundreds of thousands of users and
determining automatically what the
difference is in responses to those
different designs this is also called a
be testing bucket testing parallel
flights it's proven very powerful way to
improve search interfaces but is only
available to those who have very large
interfaces to test so others need to
resort to other measures so I want to
talk a bit more about longitudinal
studies which just means doing a study
over time and letting the same users use
the interface and one study that I'm
quite fond of is the fin deck study done
by an ala and and cocky takaki and ends
your new audience and this this study
was done on a clustering interface but
the interface itself doesn't matter that
much what I really want to emphasize is
the way that things were done basically
users were asked to use the interface
over a period of several months and
their interactions with that interface
were logged and qualitative measures
were taken both at the beginning and the
end of the
so they were surveyed for their
responses towards the beginning and
towards the end and then they were able
to measure how those responses changed
or didn't change over time so one of the
things that happened was that the
subjective opinions improved over time
so the initial reaction off into a new
interface is unfamiliar people have to
learn something and so it's not as
favorable as it might be as they become
more familiar with the interface often
the opposite happens as well especially
with visualizations where the initial
responses this is really cool this is
really mind-blowing but I would never
want to use it over the long term so you
see both directions and by doing a
longitudinal study you can measure those
differences also a the participants
start to note notice changes in their
search habits that they were able to
articulate some of them articulated them
explicitly others were articulated in
the logs and again that wouldn't be
possible with just a quick lab study and
it's a little harder with sort of
anonymous very large log studies as well
so here's just a graph from their paper
where the details don't matter so much
but what I want to show is just how the
numbers changed after one week versus
after two months the big shifts in the
qualitative responses to agree or
disagree for different aspects of the
interface and when you just do a
snapshot after the initial use that's
not going to be necessarily realistic
for the long-term view so I've been
encouraging in my teaching and my
talking of encouraging people to
consider longitudinal studies as a good
interface paradigm
okay some other evaluation essentials
it's important to match participants to
tasks so I've got a number of usability
studies for search interfaces and had
some kind of amusing anecdotes so for
example we were developing faceted
navigation and we started with the
recipes collection so we recruited
people that like to cook and you know
that worked pretty well except for one
participant absolutely hate of the
interface you need all the interfaces
and it turns out he hated recipes hated
them and we were having browser of a
recipe collection and so you know that
was not a close enough match to the task
another example we were testing this
chacha interface which I would consider
to be the predecessor to deep links that
you guys show in search results now we
had students look at search results on
the Berkeley campus embedded in the
various departments and they really
weren't that thrilled by it but even we
deployed the system anyhow and it turned
out that the campus administrators
really loved this interface because it
puts search results in context of the
campus and so just turns out undergrads
don't really care about the context of
the campus and they make various
administrative posts so it's very
important when you are working with
small number of participants as opposed
to log studies to match the participants
to the task they has to be meaningful
for them in order to get a realistic
result also participants should be
highly motivated so if you ask somebody
to use a search interface that makes
some choose among camera lenses and they
find that topics Ulta fying you're not
going to get a very realistic result so
one technique is to offer users a toy
participants in a study a choice of
different tasks and they are their
requests to pick a subset of them for
the study so that they can pick ones
that interest them particularly
another technique that I like a lot is
advocated by Jared school who is testing
out ecommerce websites and he wanted to
be sure that the users the participants
were really motivated to complete the
task well and so what he would do is
bring them in tell them okay i'm going
to give you 75 dollars to buy something
on the site you can't have the money
you've got to buy something and so think
about what do you want to buy on the
site so they think about and he's like
okay go home come back in a week and
we'll talk so they come back a week
later they've been thinking a lot about
how they want to spend that $75 so he
claims he even offered them the cash and
they said no I want to do this search
and buy this product that i want to buy
I don't know if it's really true if they
keep the cash so he claims but the point
is getting people highly motivated is
going to more realistically mimic the
real search task and it's very often not
done in search evaluation there's a
bunch of statistics both yeah Camille
ssin talks about this and also in the
trek evaluations that there's often more
variation across one system in one
system across tasks then there is across
systems so if you're comparing two
systems on a few tasks you're not going
to get very reliable results you really
have to run and evaluation on lots and
lots of tasks and there's some
interesting ideas out there in some of
the more recent studies and notably as
its Woodruff at all paper and about ish
at all paper I'm sort of dividing the
tasks into different types and then
evaluating how the interface does on
those different types and that's
probably the way to go and just just
actually recognizing that your design
might only work on certain task types
and of course differences in cognitive
abilities of individual participants can
be a better predictor of performance and
different instances
so it's very important to get your
experimental design right so your
bearing who does what win and there was
a famous example at the Chi conference
that this always brings to mind which
was they were comparing just a regular
file browser to Xerox PARC have this
wizzy hyperbolic tree browser and then
there was a third one and the hyperbolic
tree browser one but you know I I
remember noticing at the time that
actually just seemed like you know round
around Pete prolly knew more of the
answers than the other people and they
knew where to go in the directories and
that's why they won and in fact they did
a study of Pete do the study after that
it confirmed that so you really have to
be careful with these comparisons
another one is don't evaluate your own
design impossible because you're biased
now in academia it's very hard to get
someone else to evaluate design I think
an industry that happens more so if if
you do evaluate your own sign you
shouldn't leak which one you think is
best and there's lots of ways of doing
that so people often say you know we're
testing our design what do you think so
you can state things neutrally without
misleading so you could say we are
assessing these designs as opposed to we
designed a center now assessing it you
can use generic names for the different
designs you know if you give a really
jazzy fun name to the new design and a
boring one to the baseline that that can
bias things so we recommend using names
of mountains or streams or colors and
you should have a strong state of the
art baseline to compare against I can't
tell you how many studies I've read
where someone has their wizzy design and
then they compare it to like showing
URLs with no titles or something you
know very unfair baseline and to try to
make their results look better you
should use the same collections for each
design because often people can't
implement an interface on top of a
standard collection but that's not a
fair comparison and you should make all
designs aesthetically pleasing there's
lot of evidence it shows people are
biased against ugly designs but
sometimes people do make the comparison
unfair that way okay now talk a bit
about jumping to chapter 6 core every
formulation but what I want to do here
is talk about some important principles
cognitive principles that that play into
this part so one of these is or I'll go
through these a bit so this recognition
over recall multiple means of expression
also called the vocabulary problem
anchoring three major ones and both
modern query and Cory formulation aids
address these as does modern site
navigation and search aids so let's talk
about each of these three a bit so
recognition of a recall it's easier to
recognize information than to generate
it yourself so we've all experienced
this when learning a foreign language
it's a lot easier to hear someone speak
the language or read it than it is to
generate new sentences yourself
similarly it can be easier to recognize
a face than reproduce it or draw or
something like that we're very good at
recognizing things it's harder to
generate them ourselves and related to
this is multiple means of expression so
people remember the gist of what you
said but not the actual words use so can
anyone say how I described recognition
of a recall on the previous slide what
words did I use exactly probably not but
you can probably remember what were the
examples that I use what were the
examples do you remember Peter about
recognition of orrico general license
sorry not trying I don't why I called
but that you could you could pretty much
over the gist that I used learning a
foreign language as an example and you
put that in other words okay and their
biz studies showing that people can
agree on the meaning of a label even if
they don't generate the same labels to
describe something so this is famous
study by furnace at all where they had
people try to nay
things what we use for card sorting for
as well so name that what would you put
the names for various editing commands
or if you had an object what would you
name it and you get very little
uniformity in what choices of words
people use here we have point 11.1 to
overlap across all the participants in
these studies but if you actually pick
the most common word that was chosen for
each category and then show it to people
the recognition is very high so these
things are not symmetric the generation
versus the recognition it's not a
symmetric phenomenon we can exploit that
and in search interfaces and vocabulary
problem is another way people talk about
this so there are many different ways to
say the same thing and so I've listed
just off the top of my head different
ways you might say how much does that
camera cost how much for that camera
that camera how much what's the prize to
that camera please price that camera for
me and on and on this is just using full
sentences so the interfaces need to help
people find alternatives if the way
they're expressing information doesn't
match the way it's out there or generate
these in the matching algorithms to
match the original way people state
things and then the last problem is
anchoring and a I don't know any of
you've read predictably irrational by
Dan Ariely I recommend it as a
fascinating book about how primarily
really about how many influences society
and changes behavior and there's a lot
of fascinating details about how people
react in this book but one of the
anecdotes is that if you tell people to
think of the last two digits of their
social security number and write them
down and then you give them some objects
to bid on somebody to bid on those who
have a higher couple of digits at the
end of their social security number bid
higher numbers than those who have
smaller digits in the last two digits
social security number that there's this
priming effect also referred to as
anchor in these cases that influence how
people think and there's all sorts of of
cases like this it's fascinating so we
could see similar phenomenon and search
so people start with a few words it's
very difficult to break out of that set
of words to come up with alternative
ways of expressing things if they don't
have any eight and Dan Russell has this
example that I took and put in the book
of someone who wants to know how many
copies of harry potter and Half Blood
Prince have sold and is not having any
luck with lots and lots of different
rewarding zuv this now I think that
Carly probably cry every formulation
isn't enough of this person they
probably need to be led to a collection
of statistics somewhere and then search
within that is my guess but the point is
this person's trying hard and the
rewarding isn't working for them so
Corey suggestion aids have become pretty
mature these days and they're often
machine-generated but in the old days
when people were experimenting with this
the systems often computed
machine-generated suggestions from text
collections and they showed a very large
number of terms to the user before
showing search results and said you know
maybe they'd show 40 turns with
checkboxes required to user to check a
whole bunch of them and then they would
rerun the query and that didn't work out
so well usability of that was pretty
poor the newer more modern view is to
just show a few suggestions with a
hyperlink so you click on one suggestion
and that brings back results so it's
really like doing a reformulation in one
step also the queries are often
generated from other users queries and
there was a recent study cigar last year
by a Diane Greene and her associate's
showing that be at least for their
algorithm the user generated queries
were better than the automat
generated once so we haven't necessarily
come up with algorithms that do better
maybe you guys have and it'd be
interesting to know about that and they
have pretty good uptake about six
percent usage on statistics that I could
find on search engines for the web and
so both dynamics Aquarius suggestions
and shown while the user is issuing
their query and static ones shown after
the requires an issued seem to have good
usability from literature at least as
much as I can find so here I have a
netflix related queries where it's a
specific domain movies and so this kind
of matching can be very helpful for
matching the first couple letters of the
word bei I have here I've also like this
variation I've seen at the next bio site
where a typed a few the three letters
EMB and what it does here is it puts the
suggestions puts the suggestions in
context so we have compounds that match
this genes guess just compounds and
jeans and tissues so kind of
categorizing the matching terms by
technical areas and I think that's a
very promising approach for more
technical interfaces and of course
there's post query suggestions where
after this is after a query on
Yellowstone we see both kind of
categories that have been pre defined as
well as user queries that match and
there's a lot of variations on this and
by the way I should say that in the book
i really emphasize that backing up the
assertions I make with quotes from the
literature so it was more than 600
references in the book and I really in
earlier days when I wrote a chapter
about search interfaces around 1999 I
was basically listing what people were
doing and I couldn't really say what
worked and what didn't the emphasis in
this book is taking the empirical
evidence and using that to back up
claims so although i don't have
citations all over these slides I'm
really making assertions that are
supported by the literature another kind
of recent piece of work which you folks
might not be that familiar with this is
suggesting destinations
idea that Ryan White it all did at
Microsoft Research where they recur
recorded search sessions for hundreds of
thousands of users in their toolbar and
they didn't just look at what they
clicked on right after the search but
they follow their clicks throughout for
that query and for the session and they
found for example that users generally
browse very far from the search results
page they went out five steps on average
and furthermore they visited two unique
domains during the course of a query
trail and just over four domains during
a session trail so they distinguish
between for a given query how far out
people went and for a given session so
about five minutes of usage how far out
they went and where they went so that
was pretty interesting because I think
to that point people really didn't have
evidence that people are going across
lots of different domains by which I
mean no to me web URL domains within a
session and so then what they did was
they picked the endpoint for these
sessions and they showed them right in
the search results so if someone
searched on space for example they would
show the Hubble telescope ads potential
hit and they actually found that that
was quite effective and these were used
more often than query term suggestions
standard criteria suggestions and they
had in a large number of the cases high
satisfaction scores so this is really
using user behavior to go beyond the
standard query term suggestion but to
you know what in a sense to try to read
people's minds and what people are in
the general case try to do it only works
for queries that are really common
however so if the queries vary a lot you
don't really know what the right trail
is to show and then showing related
documents this they're kind of more like
this functions been around for a long
time it's still not clear what to do for
web search but it has been shown useful
for more focused search such as on the
midline system for journal articles in
the biomedical field they use a
probabilistic algorithm to show related
documents which I assume I think may
use of the links the references as well
as the terms in the abstracts and they
found this is quite a popular feature
it's quite heavily used at pubmed so the
question is is it possible to generalize
this to more general surgery and then
there's relevance feedback which for
those of you who know the literature at
least it's it's a very popular topic in
the ranking community people talked
about relevance feedback for years the
main idea is someone does a query that
gets some results back they mark a whole
bunch of the results indicating which
ones are relevant and in some cases
which ones are not then that information
is used to re wait the query terms do a
new quarrying get new results list and
it's been shown in fully automated
search situations where you have a query
automatic relevance feedback automatic
or not and then another results list and
if you look at the precision and recall
that results you can improve the results
dramatically but it doesn't ever seem to
get used in practice and the question is
why is that well first of all it works
best for tasks that require high high
recall meaning you have to have lots and
lots of relevant queries because in the
task for which relevant melva's feedback
was used the assumption was you wanted a
thousand relevant documents as possible
as opposed to the high precision types
of queries we see on web search also the
results are unreliable and at throughout
the book I point out this case this fact
that this for search and probably for a
lot of other interface situations as
well unreliability in the quality of the
response is seen as a negative to users
it rather have it be simpler and
reliable than complex sometimes helpful
but unreliably so and sometimes very
poor so you often get punished when you
try to do something that has unreliable
results mmm but most importantly
relevance judgments are just difficult
to make it's cognitively task tasking
having to select lots of them is even
harder and a lot of the relevance
feedback requires that
and it turns out that the less you know
about a topic the less you can recognize
relevant documents and the kind of the
more you would need relevance feedback
so it backfires that way so it hasn't
really taken off okay I'm not going to
talk a lot about integrating navigation
and search except for that it is kind of
a favourite topic of mine since the
flamenco approached faster navigation is
what we've been promoting for the last
10 years but just a few key points is
showing users structure as a starting
point rather than require them to
generate queries takes a badge of the
recognition of a recall idea and now
this is a most appropriate for website
search or collection search not I think
it's very hard to achieve this in web
search as a whole you organize results
into a recognizable structure that aids
both in comprehension of the collection
and suggests where to go next with the
collection and eliminates empty result
sets which is really empty result sets
are very bad from a user's response for
search one of those principles that you
want to avoid and there's different
techniques flat list categories best
navigation and document clustering and
again I gave a talk on this about three
years ago if you want to look it up in
the archives okay now a little bit about
visualization and search and I again
want to put a question to the audience
which is a will visual search ever
succeed you know why isn't google search
fully graphical right now and so before
i say my thoughts and that I thought I'd
get some of your thoughts why isn't
google search graphical visual pictures
yes
so we have a rich conversation with
assertion we don't
so it's hard to guess what people want
that doesn't necessarily explain why
it's not graphical or why it's not
visual right that's that's more about an
interaction dialogue kind of thing then
back there
I'm sorry I can't hear you at all
it's more difficult to pack a lot of
information screen visually if it isn't
a picture worth a thousand words that's
the problem it's worth a thousand words
any picture that you show can be
interpreted in many many more ways
probably high than a simple texting a
picture has lots of different
interpretations it's sort of mysterious
maybe what is suggesting is behind it
you're saying yeah I think that stuff
definitely a case a lot of the times if
you show a picture of a cat you know
what does that mean what is that
representing yeah other reasons i have
my stab at it so one is i mentioned
before everything requires full
attention so if you do show text it's
hard to also make it graphical and if
you show images next to text there's a
cognitive switch that has to happen you
when you process text that's different
set of mental activities than processing
images reading is not pre-attentive and
I'll explain that in a second and you
can't graph nominal data on axes so
let's let's talk about these two so
pre-attentive properties which is what
visualizations take advantage of our
those properties where humans can
recognize without having to do serial
scan they can tell in parallel with
under typically under 100 milliseconds
whether or not a property holds so in
this case even if you have a very large
field of blue dots or of dots people can
determine under 100 million seconds
whether or not there's a red dot in that
field so color differentiation is a very
powerful visual indicator and that's why
I highlighting with color when you don't
have too many colors is a very effective
visual interface trope but and there's
lots of there's other sorts of things
that are pre-attentive like one angled
item may be angled in horizontally in a
field of vertically angled images
interestingly if you combine properties
often they're not pre-attentive so a
picture like this where you have circles
and squares that are red and or blue
it's it's hard you can't pre attentively
recognize if there is a something that
is both square and read in this field so
you still have to do the serial scan
but text is not pre-attentive so I'm
going to flash something up and you tell
me what's interesting about this text
you tell me I give you more than 100
milliseconds okay you couldn't now I'm
cheating a little by using all caps but
it turns out now if I leave it up longer
can people see the pattern yeah the
first half is mirrored is written kind
of forwards in the second half are the
same letters written reversed if texts
are pre-attentive that would just jump
out at you but it's not you really have
to fo get on it and read it and so
anytime something is text you're not
going to be able to have that at a
glance effect that you get with visual
search also I'm if we look at
quantitative data simple what
quantitative eight anyway is easy to
visualize so here i have this classic
set of data about autos from the 70s
where I plotted miles per gallon against
the year of the auto the make of the
auto and then against a nominal
attribute which is what country makes
those cars so we can see in the 70s that
a you know the miles per gallon for the
u.s. cars were way below those of Japan
and Europe and they were kind of
fighting with each other over this but
if you want to plot nominal data which
is what text is where there's no
inherent order to it except alphabetical
order which is an artificial ordering
it's not doesn't have a meaning just
because something starts with AIDS and
then something starts with B there's no
real meaning for the B to come after the
a so you get you could get nonsensical
plots if you try to plot nominal data so
here I put miles per gallon again and
the color still represents which country
and on this axis I put the name of the
model and so there's different cars here
so I have an AMC Concord d6 widths and I
know there's Cadillacs and so on and so
that you kind of see this graph moving
up and down but it doesn't mean anything
because there's no inherent order to
models of car by their name and what we
when people try to visualize text that's
pretty much what they want to do and
doesn't make sense to put words in some
order like it does number
and so we end up seeing lots of
visualizations where people put things
in tables but the axis tend to be the
year the article was published and maybe
the number of citations that it has and
that's not that useful for search that's
just useful for people stalking library
shelves or whatever so it's very
difficult now there's one area where
it's still a question is showing images
of pages least as a question in my mind
so most of the studies suggest that
showing images in search results where
it's sort of a shrunk down version of
the page doesn't help and in fact can
hurt results this was one study where
they did a comparison but it's not a
very fair comparison because they kind
of compared having the titles to having
the images and no titles to having both
but when they had both they found that
participants were more likely to assume
the document was relevant whether or not
it was so that kind of an odd result
like that and also it took longer would
to have both which other studies have
echoed which may or may not be a good
thing depending on your metrics but in
another study where this was more
remembering layout of pages they found
that blank squares were just as
effective as showing the thumbnails
although the subjective ratings for the
thumbnails were high so as I was working
on this part of the chapter I was pretty
much saying thumbnails don't work well
but there's these other points so first
of all people love visual nets they like
seeing images the technology is getting
better and I have a screenshot of search
me in a second then people have found
well if you make important text larger
that makes the thumbnail more useful but
the most important thing that i came
across recently that was changing my
mind was that earlier studies may be
using thumbnails that are too small and
so people were looking at the colors
they weren't really using all of the
relevant cues and so I think the jury's
still out on thumbnails and then showing
figures extracted from documents can be
useful which is a little different than
a thumbnail the image but if the
document has
figures that are meant to be seen in
isolation that can be useful and we've
done some studies on that so here I have
a picture from woodruff at all where
they did some clever techniques to make
the search the query terms sort of stand
out from the thumbnail and these are
four different types of tasks and this
is our biotech search engine where we
pulled out we have very rich search
results summary information which user
can control but we pulled out the
figures so that it's easy for a
scientist to differentiate an article
about zebrafish that shows pictures of
zebrafish cells versus one that shows
graphs versus one that shows skeletons
it can be useful in this context and
then of course there is in the old days
at xerox parc they had their the web
voyager tool where you could flip
through virtual pages which was mimic to
some degree with a color coverflow if
you have searched me where I guess they
cashed a lot of the pages but you it was
a very kind of appealing interface for
flipping through graphical views of
search results I just noticed that I
guess they closed this summer i hadn't i
was looking to see what they are
currently doing to prepare and so i
don't know what that means although
there was an interesting argument in the
vc when the VCS said that for people
browsing the web on their TV screens
this might be a better view because you
won't be able to see the text very well
so i thought that was an interesting
thought so i think the jury's out on
visual views of web pages but on the
other hand of course the page hasn't
been designed to be seen from afar it's
designed to be seen at reading distance
so it's never it's not really clear if
this is the right way to go except for
maybe browser history to record
recognized pages you've already visited
okay and finally a future trends and
search interfaces so this is the fun
part where we get to speculate and you
can argue with me so I talked about for
kind of changed a little bit in this but
four main things in my book in the final
chapter so I think one direction is
longer more natural queries and
elaborate on that another is better
mobile interfaces which everyone is
saying but I think audio or spoken
queries are going to become increasingly
important and perhaps spoken results
social and collaborative search shall
talk a bit more about and then
longer-term video and audio will be
dominating text and for the general
public
and then in the far future may be
conversational interactions but that's
far off so first longer more natural
queries something I emphasized in the
book because I believe it was true so I
looked hard to find evidence to support
my belief what is that that when people
are very new to search like children or
just people that have never done search
before so you have to go back to 97 or
whatever those papers they initially
approached search engines by typing in a
full question and also ask jeeves was
very popular in the early days to search
even though it never really answered
questions people liked that idea and
that I've always held on to that every
time you saw someone talk about Ask
Jeeves it was I really like the idea of
a i'm going to ask a question now we
moved away from that because you know we
could only really support keyword
queries well and that made sense
technology didn't support long queries
but pendulum is swinging back
sophisticated users of web search
engines type long queries now and Google
and other search engines support it well
that some do some don't and Google is
even going from the conjunction the full
conjunction every word in your query has
to be in the page or the anchor text and
they're relaxing that constraint some
now for longer queries and as far as i
can tell anyway and also the average
quarry length continues to improve i
think it's up to pretty close to three
now which it didn't used to be depending
on whose statistics you look at so even
for everyday Quarriers the query lengths
getting longer and another interesting
phenomenon is that information worded as
questions is appearing more and more on
the web from social question answering
sites and forums so for example if i
type how do i make a PB&amp;amp;J google is
pretty smart about expanding that out to
peanut butter and jelly somehow but you
also see matches various forms to this
question like question including a video
hits which is new which I liked so you
can ask how do I questions on the web
and also up and find answers and of
course for us technical folks who are
always looking for how to do something
with software you tend to write very
long queries to try to figure out how to
program something and you find the hits
in the forums that discuss how to
program very
systems and so I'm recommending to
people that they try to write their web
pages with more conversational language
and to make it more likely to get hits
like this and this is just the beginning
I think this is where people want to go
and of course it is more typing which is
a negative but then once it's a spoken
interface then it's really easy to say
things as questions and I see that as
really an important phenomenon important
trend that's going to be increasing if
the search engines will support it then
social search I talk about social
ranking here also in Chapter nine on
personalization talk about related
things so there's different ways that
people are expressing recommendations to
others in some cases it's explicit
recommendations like dig or StumbleUpon
where you vote on something you read and
you say you like it you want others to
see you like it bookmarking sites like
delicious Google's experimenting with
search wiki where people move the
ranking around on their pages I don't
know how you guys are using it i'd like
to see paper be nice to see but then
there's also implicit recommendations so
click through if you click on a search
result response to a query that gets
used to improve ranking algorithms
places like Amazon Khan of course have
made very popular the people who bought
this item also about that where you are
making a recommendation other people
whether you want to or not just by your
actions and then there was a yahoo is my
web which is defunct but now it seems to
be reproduced in Google social search
where you have a network of friends and
people that have marked certain webpages
being interesting kids show up in your
search results if those people are in
your social network that hasn't taken
off yet but i think it's intriguing it
kind of makes the web feel like a more
friendly place i think if you see that
people you know have looked at this page
whether or not they really recommended
it explicitly it's sort of interesting
to know that so those are directions I
think that moving that way may or may
not happen importantly the other another
aspect of social search that I just
mentioned is people expressing things in
everyday language and having better hits
when the queries are expressed that way
but another trend that's a little
different is that's happening just in
HCI generally is research on
collaborative X where there's really a
recognition that people work to get
there and they work together either
remotely or in person when using
computers but software does not support
that very well it's very collaboration
is very poorly supported we're really
explicit collaboration on information
objects so a collaborative search has
been a bit of work on I'll talk about
their just work on collaborative
visualization as well and I think this
will be a trend in HCI going forward so
this is a nice diagram from a paper by
Pickens at all comparing different
collaborative search approaches so in an
old one by the Yates 97 somebody used
search engine another person used search
engine they each got results these were
compiled and listed maybe they were
ranked somehow and then they were listed
so not really working together they're
working independently and the results
are being compiled in another case
there's two users using a GUI together
and the results are shown to both of
them in another case this is a Morris
more recently who's been looking at
shared collaboration and search there's
two users they're each using a GUI
they're talking to each other and they
can sort of see what each other's doing
but they get pooled results the results
aren't affected by what each other does
it just pulls the results but they are
aware of what the other person is doing
and then at work by pickings at all
which you think is really interesting
where there's two users they're using
two different types of interfaces and
what one user does affects the results
shown in the other users view and the
algorithm actually a very sophisticated
way at just what it's showing so here I
have some pictures from their papers so
these first of all this is sort of the
setup where there's two people here
they've got these big screens and they
see their they're actually doing videos
search and they see different views and
a doing on time here okay so then this
is one view one of the people sees this
for you where they're kind of looking
through a lot of stuff and weeding out
things and then the other views sees the
results of the weeding out and scans to
and looks more carefully and they have
kind of a diagram about how to make it
work together where the ranking really
is affected by the actions of each
person and I think it's really
interesting and I think that's a really
great direction to explore in the future
really really supporting real
collaboration and it's not done much yet
there's also work Jeff
here now at Stanford formerly Berkeley
on China people collaborate remotely on
visualizations and making sense of
numerical data and I just think this is
an upcoming trend have this whole thing
on the decline of text where I think the
cultural heavy lifting in America is
switching from text to video and audio
you see that everywhere for one thing
view shows the use of video sharing
sites doubled from 2006 to 2009 you guys
of course are aware of that here with
YouTube but something I find really
interesting is this notion of a video
response that seems to have just arisen
organically at YouTube I mean I never
would have thought of a response to a
video with a video which is a just shows
that video is becoming more of a way to
communicate you edit explored like the
way we use text and language when the
videos were used for the presidential
debates with CNN and Yuto youtube it
might have been the ones that were
chosen but rather than making using the
video medium in some really interesting
way most of the people just pointed the
video at their face in their living room
said their question I mean it wasn't
much more than emailing in a question
except you get the demographics and the
emotional kind of aspects but the fact
is that video is becoming a mundane way
to communicate like a text in some sense
and and of course videos can go viral
much more than text at it seems like you
when you see the very popular videos
have millions or tens of millions of
views whereas very popular articles
don't have anywhere that number of hits
typically pew also released a report
showing that marketing emails that
promise to podcasts were twenty percent
more likely to be open than those that
didn't people want to consume
information that way movies with
subtitles do poorly in the US the people
don't want to read and you know it pains
me to say this as a scholar and someone
had just wrote a book with a hundred
thousand words in it but that's the way
things are going if you could disagree
with me in any part but this is the most
controversial thing I say
the rise of look at things like Twitter
people love reading people love
so you brought up Twitter and I think
that's an interesting counter trend so
twitter and texting are getting more
popular than ever I think that's partly
because of the privacy of for the
texting especially with kids you don't
make noise so you can do it in class you
can do it here Twitter the same but if
there were some kind of a noise
cancelling microphone where you could
say things and people didn't hear and
you made no noise I bet people would do
it audio in audio rather than typing and
I bet the kids would too and if you
could consume it and again in a way that
wasn't noisy and I think it's really
about not disturbing others and that
people would prefer to say it orale but
of course that doesn't exist so I can't
prove it but yeah
it's not about
like from
interaction
beyond text right now
full
I
yes the question is is this more of this
larger trend of moving a more
naturalistic interaction because Texas
Sun senses artificial text is artificial
we have to spend years teaching children
how to read a lot of people are dyslexic
it's natural cognition cognitive
property to do symbol mapping for humans
but reading is very effortful thing and
I think that that is part of the larger
point is that you know it's more natural
to interact visually orally and in fact
i also think in the developing world
this could be a way of leapfrogging the
literacy problem if audio video devices
were very easy to edit search and
produce and and respond to via these
media then the literacy probably will
lag even more but people will be more
empowered so that's kind of a
controversial things I'm not saying if
it's a good thing or bad thing I'm
saying I think technology might support
that happening and so the role text in
search in those areas might be different
to planet
it also amazed
might be the decline of television the
video going up I think which what's
television and what's the internet is
going to blend I mean I don't know if
there's a real distinct difference but i
will say that one of the other
distinctions that I make elsewhere is
we'd talk about web 20 and the rise of
the participation society I think that's
reflected in reality TV and it's why
comedy scripted stuff is in the decline
in reality TV is in the increase its
that people it's a multi-way interaction
reality TV is kind of like a way for
everybody to interact not everybody but
more people american idol that sort of
thing I have a whole essay on this which
I like that's a different I would
different talk about the web 20 stuff
but you know and and the New York Times
somewhat oriole New York Times just made
a point that news websites are starting
to look more like TV that you first get
the video you have to work hard to find
the text because that is what people
seem to prefer it's not what I prefer
but it's what a lot of people prefer and
I think the only thing holding that back
more is we don't have really good ways
to search video or an audio audio is
easier than video video not really it's
still a little hard to edit and it's
hard to scan it's still hard to scan so
once those are fixed and then the
quietness thing is fixed I I think
except for lawyers and academics I don't
know I don't know I think it's going to
be greatly reduced but that's
controversial and it's meant to be and
then finally as far future trend is
dialogue and we're so far from that
although the Serie tool is promising
it's based on real state of the art a
huge research project supported by the
intelligence community in fence
community where they're pulling out the
best of that stuff and they're going to
try to do Barbra context-based kind of a
typical recommender thing well you know
where do you want to have breakfast but
it's a step in that direction and I
think that researchers in academia ought
to start thinking more about this how do
you really do a dialogue do that back
and forth it's not an easy to solve
problem but I think that that's the far
future and with the audio and so on even
more so so not so much I am pretty
skeptical about the personalization for
various reasons i don't know if i have
time to go into that we could talk about
it in the question alessi i'm at eleven
now and with visualization I think we
need breakthroughs people want it but I
don't know that it's going to happen
maybe it's just going to be some kind of
scanning
a video instead so thank you for
listening and feel free to go to the
site if you want to read the book or buy
it online Thanks I have time for
questions I know if people have to leave
feel free it's eleven so yeah question
from New York so questionnaire thank you
ya can't hear all right hi is that
better yes great um so I happen to
bitten I heard an article this past
weekend on the subject of enhanced
reality augmented reality and I started
thinking about search in the context of
augmented reality and I wonder if you've
thought about that yeah search in the
context of augmented reality I've always
been much more I'm gonna know if I can
look at you and talking to Mike at once
can you see me no yeah I've always been
much more I've always had a min reality
made a lot more sense than virtual
reality which I always thought was a bad
idea although actually I've rethought
that a bit with the notion of second
life and kind of having a way to do kind
of conferences across the world at once
so I'm rethinking that sum but in a
linear reality where you project
computation on the world around you
makes a lot of sense and in fact four
years in the chi community we've talked
about you know you hold up your device
you're you're in a foreign country or an
unfamiliar place you hold up your device
you pointed at a building and your your
phone tells you what the building is its
history and all that and we're very
close to that now it's amazing how
rapidly that's developed and you know
just that makes a lot of sense to me so
it's context-sensitive reacts to what's
around the person i also have always
thought small devices were not going to
be the final thing i always thought well
it's going to be a projected display
where you can see a bigger and a
projected keyboard so you can type on it
although i'm amazed by how really useful
such the i-screen the iphone screen is i
actually amazed what i can do on it but
i do think people are going to want it
to be a little bigger but not physically
bigger but yeah i'm at a reality makes a
lot of sense for sir
it's now the question is that's I guess
that's not search I guess that's its
kind of searching that I see a building
and the implicit searches tell me about
the building i'm pointing at search in
I've seen people do search where they
like have blocks and you project words
on the blocks and you rearrange them to
make like a conjunction or something
that makes no sense to me you know that
should just be virtual it doesn't make
it faster to put it on a physical thing
so I don't know do you have thoughts of
it well i was thinking in terms of i
mean the sort of canonical augmented
reality application is you're walking
down the street with your device and
your device knows where you are and what
you're looking at and what businesses in
the area you care about and what's it
you know what's on sale there when the
movie schedule is that so forth and it
implies essentially a collection of
agents that are actively going out and
getting information for you before you
ask for it so that they can either push
it to you or when you asked for it they
already have I just feel like we kind of
already have that at this point I mean
that when I use my iPhone and I use the
maps function and I type in you know
restaurant it short of shows me and yeah
I guess maybe it could just know that i
want to see restaurants right now that
part i don't know how would know but I I
feel like 10 years ago we talked about
this and it was this wild dream and we
kind of have it now in some sense mean
if the map you have the map tool it
knows where you are when you ask for
restaurants if you asked for haircuts it
just looks it up right now google maps
does it said it's you should even gonna
be able to take integer I mean I agree
with you that what we were talking about
as a lot of drinking
we are very close to having now and you
know mostly it's a matter of
commercializing introduction I think at
this point but it seems like we ought to
be able to take that platform a step
further and make it easier for people to
get information I think so and I think
it's people are getting more creative
ideas every day about how to take at the
next level to anticipate what you want
but it's not going to anticipate I'm
having a conversation with my friend and
they make some claim that I know is
wrong and I want to look it up and prove
it to them and then it has it could be
based on what we were saying maybe it
would save me the typing but you know
that's not a terrible burden to have to
type that stuff or say it so yeah but I
agree i think it's i didn't even mention
it because it's I guess it's less the
focus of what I've been talking about in
the book but it's amazing what's been
happening out with the sort of context
sensitive information retrieval that's
relevant yeah yes
surg Tech's so as an author who just
wrote
that's right why don't you have been so
traditional has
well you know I started I I wrote this
essay because i right once a year I'm
asked to answer a question for edged or
Die have the URL down there at the
bottom because it was sort of what's
something that's going to happen whether
you want it to happen or not it's sort
of an inevitable trend or something and
so that I have to answer that question
this is what I I saw so I don't
necessarily like it but I see it coming
I prefer to read and I like to sit
through videos myself but I'm you know
old right the other thing is of course
there are some things you can express
with text that you can't express in
video at least right now but I also
think the practices are going to change
of how we do an audio and video having
video responses that's a new thing when
were there video responses before in a
history of the world and and really just
the sharing of them and so on so i
actually think practices and technology
are going to evolve and change very
rapidly in the audio and visual audio
and video domains and like i said the
thing that I've imagined this noise
cancelling way of speaking it doesn't
exist i've never heard anyone talk about
it but it seems like something you
really need to move this way and so
probably somebody will invent it and so
yeah just because and i talked about the
cultural heavy lifting which is actually
a phrase i got from jeff numbered when
you read a version of this essay that
it's not going to be for everything but
for major in a standard communication
among people as opposed to more arrow
diet you know academic kinds of
communication and believe me in academia
we're being encouraged to use video as
you know to keep people's attention it's
more explanatory for some things we will
use but diagrams and cartoons in fact
this is a very text heavy talk and I'm
very self-conscious about it because I
try to give a lot of my talks in a more
visual manner but it takes a lot of time
to get all the images and and I am
trying to talk about things that are
more abstract in this particular talk
but of course the way to get powerpoint
now is have impressionist Akins and
speak over them and so on and that's
another reflection of this this
phenomenon I think visit you once you
start thinking about you seeing it
everywhere in in modern forms of
communication here
ah yes yes I know if I have internet
erest I can't show
why
that's a hard question well first of all
just say that Peter pointed out that the
online version of my book is not just
flat text I have the references pop up
when you mouse over them when you click
on it actually it takes you the
reference list which has a search button
on it when you click on that you takes
you to google scholar if you click on
that you get the search the page the
document which I found very useful
preparing for this talk i was using it
myself to get screenshots of images so
that stuff so yeah i try to make it more
interactive than a typical book call
then I didn't go overboard the second
question is trying to innovate in the
interface if you're an established
player you can't upset people by making
radical changes necessarily or putting a
little bit of words in your mouth so
what's the balance between someone that
has say seventy percent market share and
someone is maybe starting out with nine
percent and what how you can innovate in
the interface well I was hoping to show
search me as an example of something
that was thriving that way unfortunately
they're defunct I guess they were
working during a recession they were
also doing they were focusing on a
catalogue kind of thing which I didn't
think made sense I thought that the
visual thing was was smarter thing to
focus on but I don't have the answer to
that I mean one of the things they said
is they can't play the server game so
right now is barrier to entry and that
if you don't have all the server's do
the big crawls and serve the fast
queries you can't compete and I think
that's a very serious problem wasn't
true about search you know six or seven
years ago I thought anyone could hop in
the market now it's not true so it
doesn't necessarily matter what you've
got in your wizzy interface if you can't
serve up all the information and we have
this problem with bio text our search
for bio science journal articles in that
we're showing the figures so we can only
do this for articles that are fully open
access legally available for us to
download and serve out the images so
we'll never be a popular search engine
because you have to have every article
in MEDLINE to be a viable bioscience
search engine plus you need to have all
the other stuff you need to have the you
know document conversion the email you
need to be full service before anyone's
going to really adopt your stuff that's
true of a lot of things and you know
email and any places you want to
innovate so I think now what you have to
do is innovate in the interface and get
Bop and you know it's not ideal it's the
way a lot of industries
software industries are now and and it's
it's very hard to satisfy the wide range
of users right so maybe it has to be the
innovation happens in these more
specialized search engines like Nick's
bio where they're innovating in some
really nice ways maybe that's where
mostly innovation has to be maybe it
can't be in the major search engines
because you are serving so many people
and all is shown that search interfaces
as they are standard ones are too
complicated for some users they don't
elderly people don't necessarily
understand the URL the little cash thing
is confusing and his legacy stuff like
that in there so you know with you into
surging a serving a very wide audience
you don't have a lot of flexibility so I
don't blame search engine in fact that's
why I put that up and then I said why is
it hard because I'm not blaming anyone
for keeping it simple it's probably the
right thing to do for web search I know
if I I think you here kind of addressed
it yeah yeah I'm gonna stick around for
lunch thank you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
