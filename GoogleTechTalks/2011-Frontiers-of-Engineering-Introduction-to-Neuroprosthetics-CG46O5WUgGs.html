prosthetics the organizers are Tim
Dennison from medtronic's and Justin
Williams from University of Wisconsin in
Madison and so a gentleman I'll turn it
over to i'm justin williams university
wisconsin and tim Benison are co-chaired
he'll be moderating this session today
he's a little more intimidating than I
am so he'll keep this on on track it was
nice about three years ago at the
german-american f.o.e we had a
neuroengineering session at the end of
this we had a brief a couple slides on
your prosthetics and I'm really glad
that that that introduction is now
blossomed in do we have a whole session
on on neural prosthetics so for those of
you who may not be familiar with that
word it's it's me it's a fairly
intuitive that is where in general
talking about devices that we can
implant into the nervous system to
either diagnose treat or augment
physiological function and so the goal
here today is to try to bring you up to
speed on on where this field is and help
you draw a line what is science fiction
and what is reality and really where is
this field headed and how it's going to
impact your life so since we're I'm
pretty certain that most of you probably
have not had any kind of neurophysiology
and the recent future we'll do a quick
little fun run down to to try to
introduce some of the basic concepts
here so starting up here this is a
neuron so a single cell the the features
were interested in of course we have a
cell body and then this long spindly
axon off one end and dendrites on the
other and the reason this is important
are that we think about these are the
engineers as little transmission
elements that as information comes into
the dendrites and flows out the axon at
the end of the axon it impinges on the
dendrites of another cell and
communicates that information and that's
how electricity travels through your
body one axon to a dendrite on and on
and on so if you put a bunch of these
together we see that they form networks
and if we zoom out a little bit more we
see that the brain is funky is organized
tionally that for example in this fMRI
view we have this is the part of the
brain that lights up when you think
about moving your arm so we have
anatomical areas that are dedicated to
the functions of our body and that will
become important as we talked about how
do we tap into the brain and know where
we should put things so some fun things
of course to give you the scale and the
complexity of the types of problems that
we're interested in there's roughly a
hundred billion neurons in your brain
that's a hard number to really get a
feel for and and there's also many other
types of cells the neurons neurons are
actually the least abundant cell in your
brain we have glial cells i look at
danger sites that make up all the
structural elements to keep your brain
from being just a bowl of soup and the
neat part is that every neuron connects
to at least another thousand neuron so
we're talking about over a over a
trillion or so quadrillion connections
in all and that's obviously very
difficult to keep track of so we have to
rely on other means to try to to figure
out how what all this means neurons come
in all shapes and sizes and the reason
this is important is that there's
actually more types of neurons than
there are all the other types of cells
in your body so and two neurons that
look exactly the same may have
completely different functions so again
we always have to be able to understand
both what a neuron looks like also what
what it does so a couple of other things
to the kind of fun to think about
there's the old wives tale that you only
use ten percent of the brain that's not
true you use all of your brain maybe not
this early in the morning but eventually
throughout the day you'll you'll engage
all 100 billion of those cells that
comes from this fact that many people
didn't understand what these glial cells
were doing and didn't consider them
important and of course we lose neurons
anywhere from fifty thousand to a
hundred thousand a day fifty thousand if
you went to bed right after dinner last
night probably 100,000 if you stayed a
trader vic's a little later luckily
though they all grow back eventually
more when you're younger few of them
grow back as we age so
so neuroscience always seems immediately
attractive to is taking my engineering
students because if we start to think
about what a simple network of neurons
or even a kind of more complicated
network of cells in the hippocampus this
is the are all the networks that form
short-term memories in your brain
students almost immediately gravitate to
their intuition which is that all these
little cells and their connections look
like circuit elements that we would
imagine in a modern integrated circuit
and so the thought here is is that the
neural engineering in many ways people
start to gravitate towards one of two
applications that is can we take these
neurons and use the tools that we know
that we have to organize the structure
of circuits to produce artificial neural
networks in addition this is a slide
from bill Shane's work one of our
collaborators and can you put neurons
where you want to and pre describe their
connections and is this the future of
how we're going to make computer ship
someday or the the alternative that is
can we take a computer chip insert it
into the brain and and be able to tap
into these networks in and to get some
utility and that's the application we're
going to be interested in today so to
kind of bring you up to speed neural
prosthetics is a fairly mature field
there are a number of different clinical
applications from treatment of
Parkinson's disease to these treatments
of epilepsy but what you'll notice
immediately though are these devices are
relatively crude I apologize Tim this is
one of your your devices and most of
their history has evolved from the
development of the pacemaker so we often
consider these as not heart pacemakers
but brain pacemakers and I think Tim
would agree that there's quite a bit of
improvement that we can do but the
bottom line is that these devices work
we can treat epilepsy we can treat
Parkinson's disease very well with even
these these are relatively true devices
so we feel like there's a lot of room
for improvement with advances in modern
engineering technology just as a caveat
for those who of you who may be a little
bit squeamish you will see some pictures
of blood and brain and then just a so
you're not shocked when when one of
those comes up on the screen
so now even though that's our modern
view of clinical neural prosthetics I
think the view that most people
immediately gravitate is is the ones
that the our current pop culture feeds
us on a semi routine basis either in
books or movies so a quick scan of the
kinds of movies at least some recent
some of not so recent we see lots of
applications where in the view of Luke
Skywalker after he loses his arm he can
get an artificial arm that is directly
connected into his nervous system they
just so he doesn't have to now think
about the movement of his fingers things
like Star Trek in which we can take a
blind person and through the
augmentation of an implanted device
restore their site can we tap into
people's hippocampus and and read their
dreams and memories all the way to can
we in the case of avatar control a
completely external person or creature
through a brain interface and of course
the the dark side of all this things
like the Manchurian Candidate people
often start to think well if I put an
implant into my brain could someone else
control my thoughts and we won't get
into that but that's a very interesting
philosophical discussion so with that I
will turn things over to Jim</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
