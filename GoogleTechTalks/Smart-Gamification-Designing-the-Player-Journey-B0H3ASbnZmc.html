most of you she does not need an
introduction because you if you've paid
attention to gamification and engaging
players you have probably run the clock
across her slides on SlideShare
describing virtual goods and how to put
the fun in functional and how to create
reward systems for users you may have
read her book on community building on
the web or heard about her work in
digital chocolate they're working with
Electronic Arts and some of the biggest
companies out there on engaging their
users and making applications on the web
feel like their game I got to know any
Joe came through Irene I'll go introduce
me to her and I got a chance to attend
her full-day workshop on gamification at
the gamification conference this is
January it was absolutely amazing it was
some of the best most structured
thinking when user engagement that I
have ever encountered and I really
really enjoyed it and very highly
recommended we'll try to bring her to
Google because theythey need to be very
relevant forth and to be really fun to
attend so without much further ado I
give you Amy Jo Kim should be here to
present and that she'll take your
questions hi it's really great to be
here
I would love to after this learn more
about what you guys are working on and
I'm here today to share a pretty short
talk about what I now think of as going
beyond gamification so I've been both a
game designer and a web designer for
many years sitting at that intersection
and this is really what I've come to
learn from working with lots of really
really smart people and great teams
about merging game thinking into
everyday life so gamification is a silly
word and but it's become a touchstone
for people that are really interested in
taking games beyond gaming so what does
it actually mean means different things
to different people right to some people
it's a loyalty program on stage
maybe not so much to you but at the
recent gamification summit maybe half
the audience was coming out of
traditional loyalty programs which are
very game like they have points they
have levels but are they games now can
we make them games that's the question
there to some people it's using game
techniques particularly specific
mechanics turbocharged products and
services you can also use the visuals of
games you know the animation and fun of
games but a lot of people are
particularly interested in game
mechanics I'm here to tell you that
that's a great place to start but that's
not going to get you where you need to
go in terms of engagement and in 20
minutes you'll see exactly why some
people really look at the levels and
rewards and unlocks and say I can
manipulate behavior with that look games
do it I can do it - there's a lot of
ways to do that you can do it in karate
which I think it was a very positive
kind of gaming and there's even a
movement now I heard about this from one
of my young game designer friends called
the positive gaming movement where
people especially young idealistic
people want to create good in the world
and I know we do here obviously we want
to do it so there's ways to use game
mechanics to support a cause but you can
also use them to manipulate people and
you know just watch all the people in
Vegas lined up in front of the shop slot
machines and look at the looks on their
faces that's another game mechanic so
just like any tool it can be it's
powerful and it can be used for
different purposes but levels rewards
and unlocks are part of gaming but
they're really not the thing that makes
games really truly work and be
compelling another idea for gamification
is the idea of turning any real-world
activity into a game Nike+ is a great
example Fitbit is starting to get there
Jane McGonigal's doing a lot of work
there for certain kinds of causes and
that's another great thing to do and
it's very tempting now to look at mobile
devices and look at all the affordances
and say all the world's a game you know
why not why not make it a game well I
believe personally there's real good
reasons why every moment of your life
doesn't want to be
game but there is the desire
particularly of people to hold off a
moment looks like a large group of noisy
peoples going by maybe that won't stop
okay we plunge ahead we don't let us
deter us okay
is gamification also experiencing a hype
cycle raise your hand if you think it is
I think it is how many of you have ever
heard of the Gartner hype cycle so if
you've been around awhile like I have
you'll see that a couple of years ago
everybody needed a social graph you know
time warner needed a social graph and
now gamification is this thing it's this
hype thing and it's going to get too
much hype and then people get
disillusioned you mean it's not the
solution to everything you mean that's
not like the golden that the golden ring
on the merry-go-round and then my
prediction and what I think most of
these things do it'll just become part
of our toolkit it'll just be one as user
experience designers because we all are
we're creating experiences people have
this will be part of our toolkit and
it's part of my tool kit and I'm trying
to share that in as tools for you to
think about and use in your own work so
I think of it I think of gamification as
just using game design along with other
great forms of design to create really
compelling products so let's cut through
the hype here's a working definition I
find useful using game techniques not
mechanics but techniques to make
activities more engaging and fun that's
not the same thing as a core experience
all the game techniques in the world
won't prop up in any long-term sense a
crappy experience it doesn't provide
value so step one is some core
experience that is fun or rewarding or
provides value and the game builds
around that one how many of you have
read Daniel Pink's book drive okay a
smattering of you I have so he lays out
something that game designers know and
have worked with a lot but he lays it
out in the biz
context which is that intrinsic
motivation Trump's extrinsic extrinsic
motivation is all the game mechanics
that now platform vendors are selling
like points rewards levels at it and
your product will be successful no
actually it turns out you can get
short-term lift from that but that's
game mechanics are like the ingredients
in in a meal and the whole experience of
a meal the recipe the chef the way it's
served the way you experience the
atmosphere that's what a game is game
mechanics are a small part of it there
especially the extrinsic ones intrinsic
value is also part of game design but
you don't think if game mechanics is
providing that what's providing that is
being part of something bigger than
yourself having some autonomy gaining
power which is a byproduct of the game
mechanics feeling like you belong
learning something having fun
those are intrinsic motivations and the
core of doing good gamification smart
gamification is to really identify the
core intrinsic motivations at the heart
of your product and then build around it
to support that with your game mechanics
and aesthetics so what extrinsic
motivators are particularly good at and
Daniel pink lets us out in a beautiful
way if you go look at my slides on
SlideShare I assign some of his talks as
homework just like it's great if you
haven't seen it he's got a 15 minute TED
talk gives you the main ideas so
extrinsic motivators like money and
bonuses and work environment and like
progress bar is a great example of that
are very good for task completion if you
have a series of tasks it's clear what
to do you want to complete them
something like a progress bar or game
mechanics can actually work very well
but if what you're trying to do is
longer-term engagement if you want
people to love their jobs and stay
because they love their jobs if you want
people to exceed their own performance
in a work environment if you want people
to love your product and tweet about it
not because you scam them into it with
your mechanics but because they really
are excited about it what it provides
that's where the intrinsic motivation
comes in how many of you have ever heard
of or seen or use ModCloth
okay good a few so my class is an
interesting example it's not a game
company it's I think if it is Cosmo girl
for 2011 it's like a branded channel for
clothing and accessories and a whole
lifestyle around young hip yet retro
urban 20-somethings is their core market
and they've got this system inside of
their product called be the buyer where
they take the G I liked it but not
enough to order a big order of it from
the buyer from ModCloth
put all those samples in front of the
community and crowdsource custom
manufacturer of the community's favorite
clothing and that's inside of ModCloth
that's a game mechanic that's a system
that actually provides core value that's
fun to play it changes your life in some
way you get clothing that if you weren't
playing the system you wouldn't get
that's intrinsic motivation people feel
like hey we have real power here and in
fact they do so a player is the person
who's playing your game so one thing for
you to get from this talk just for fun
in your next conversation where you're
talking about you know your users talk
about them as players and see if that
changes how you think just it's a fun
exercise the thing about good games
that's missing from a lot of the throw a
few badges at it they balance skill and
challenge to keep players engaged I mean
it's a core of a good game it has to
change over time as the players still
gets better that's what makes people
engaged on a fundamental level this is
from a book called flow and that's a
great resource as well and that channel
in the middle is the flow channel it's
where you're not bored and you're not
anxious because the challenge is too
high you've got this good down balance
the thing about games is in order to
deliver that you have to first teach
someone the ropes and then deliver more
and more interesting challenges as they
get better so that's really much more
the core of what makes a game
interesting not throwing a few points at
something so the journey is the players
progression over time sometimes this is
called a lifestyle
I've done a lot of user experience work
and UX design and life suck player life
cycles are their experience over time
first there's onboarding then there's
you know you're just regular and then
there's the enthusiast or the elder game
we call it in gaming and I use the word
player journey because if you add
progression and learning and mastery to
a life cycle you essentially get a game
you get a journey you're taking your
player on a journey imagine you're
looking at Gmail and thinking okay what
journey are we taking the players on
maybe he would show them less things
upfront and unfold functionality over
time as unlocks or something like that
something simple like that
a journey where you deliver to people
special powers or privileges when
they're ready for it when they've earned
it so this is a simplified chart just to
think about the key stages and again
good games give people something to
master whether it's Wow or whether it's
filled or whether it's CityVille there's
some core underlying system you can
master web you know core you can look at
Quora like that there's a system to be
mastered how to ask and answer good
questions that get voted up and get
popular that's a system so um in this
lifecycle novice expert and master are
just stages they're not the whole thing
you don't move chunk chunk from one to
the other it's a continuum that those
are key design points to think about if
you're designing something that's
game-like so novices basically need good
onboarding and it could be a tutorial it
could be a series of quests it could be
a little game-like experience to raid
stuff like Netflix and get glue has
which by the way they're doing because
they want to get custom data about you
and then feed that back that's why
they're doing that game but they're also
teaching in the system whatever your
system is good onboarding just makes it
things everything go better and the key
about that is you need to introduce the
core features and systems during the
onboarding teach them how to use it give
them a sense of making progress in some
sense progress towards something and
then you've got a compelling onboarding
experience the expert who's beyond the
onboarding think they know the ropes
they learn the ropes
systems usually need either if you've
got a content-based environment
fresh content or fresh activities rush
people you know when you log into
Facebook you there's fresh content boom
right there all the time but some
systems aren't so much about content and
they're usually these people are wanting
customization power tools status access
the things they couldn't get access to
before
and then masters are further along that
that's the two to five percent of people
that are gonna go nuts for your product
they're gonna be emailing you with which
they what they wish you would ask and
what they wish you would add that are
answering other people's questions on
forums that use it all the time those
are the Masters and they are a great
resource if you can figure out a way to
harness their energy and feed it back
into the community that's the golden
ring on that one but even if you can't
you can give masters exclusivity in some
form it can be access activities unlocks
maybe it's special behind-the-scenes
forum where they can chat with the devs
whatever but that's what those people
need both to stay interested if you've
got a situation where they could jump to
a competitor but also to get value from
them so the overview of this is rather
than thinking about game mechanics think
like a game designer think about the
journey am I getting what's the journey
the backbone of my product and there's
three different things I want you to
think about dynamics mechanics and
aesthetics this is from one way of
looking at games there's a lot of lenses
to look at games through they're
sophisticated complicated things some of
them but a nice way to chunk it and
understand what mechanics is dynamics
are time-based patterns and systems in
some ways they're actually much more
important than mechanics because they're
what happens over time so if you have
progressive goals requests that get
metered out as someone gets better
that's a time-based system
pacing rewards schedules those are all
time based systems reward schedules are
something that a lot of people have
gotten excited about particularly from
the loyalty and marketing side
and basically there's a bunch of
research from psychology how many of you
have ever seen that chart before on the
left psych 101 or behavioral psych 101
the punchline this is the kind of thing
in the workshop I go into in much more
detail but the punchline of that of that
chart is that surprise and a certain
amount of randomness mixed in with
expectations gives you by far the most
compelling and addictive reward schedule
which is a pattern over time so you
don't if you have all surprise you know
pure surprise and randomness that's
actually not very interesting but it's a
mix of having something very expected
with something that feels surprising or
serendipitous that is the most rewarding
and addicting and almost every product
can add some of that in by the way the
the one-armed bandit that we all know
and love or you know and hate is
programmed with that read schedule which
is called the variable reinforcement
schedule we're both the pacing
in-between the rewards and the size of
the rewards are varied and that's why
all those people are sitting in Vegas
with the frowns on their face pumping
quarters in yeah so McCann actually the
system's a good way to think about game
mechanics not every single one but most
of them think about them as the systems
and features that make your progress
visible so points levels leaderboards
badges missions virtual goods in the
sense what they do is make your progress
visible and meaningful to you Foursquare
actually does with very simple mechanics
a good job for what it's trying to do of
making your progress meaningful for you
I'll talk about that a little bit more
but essentially the mechanics are
lighting your way it's like what does
progress mean what does it mean to play
this thing well the mechanics should
answer those questions aesthetics or the
overall experience that yells emotional
engagement things like the page loading
fast and responsiveness in the interface
and really good feedback and you know
the email from Amazon telling you your
packages on your way all of that is part
of the overall aesthetic experience so
when people say oh game I'll make this
like a game I'll put some points and
badges on it that's a little piece of it
all these other things work together to
make a compelling experience aesthetics
essentially are what yield emotions in
the end different products are going
after different emotions sometimes what
you want is trust insecurity sometimes
what you want is surprise in the light
sometimes what you want is satisfaction
but it's very useful to ask yourself
when you're developing a product what
emotion do I want this person to have
along the way are there moments of
delight I could deliver and would that
be you know what would that mean moments
of connection moments of any of those
emotions motion is fundamentally what
drives action and engagement this is why
people click on these stupid little
updates if they're they have a seed of
strong emotion and social actions are
how players engage with each other in
your game so I'm talking about social
actions because I'm a multiplayer game
designer I've never designed a
single-player game in my life I've
worked on multiple online rockband sims
actually on the Sims website which was a
multiplayer game and many websites like
family comm I worked on eBay with their
game systems but a lot of how I think
about gaming is social and I think that
more and more that's how people are
going to experience digital products and
socially because that's our landscape so
when you're looking at that again
there's many lenses to look at social
you guys probably know Jiri angstrom
he's got a notion of social objects and
a lot of analysis that's awesome I
totally absorbed that social actions are
how players engage with each other in
your game they're these moments where
there's an action that causes them to
engage they're the building blocks of
social engagement whether you're
engaging with updates in a social
network sense or in a multiplayer sense
inside of a product and
I'll talk a little bit more about that
in a moment so what you want to ask
yourself is whatever your product is who
are my players engaging with who is it
is it friends is it family is it people
I know is people I don't know and what's
their preferred social style so there's
three social styles that have emerged
out of Facebook gaming that are very
broadly applicable what is competition
it's one again it's not the only and a
lot of gamers especially guys who are
used to like a certain kind of game go
game means competition leaderboards
right well some games but not all games
in fact not the most popular games as it
turns out so cut if you start seeing
verbs like drag taunt challenge you're
in a competitive game great example of
that is brain buddies on Facebook one of
my favorite games and it just uses its
leaderboards and game mechanics
beautifully to create a very competitive
environment where you suck I am NOT
gonna let my you know high school
roommate or college roommate be smarter
than me on this test no I'm gonna go and
I'm gonna beat them I'll play this thing
till I beat them you know that's that's
really what it's going for and you
really can see that in the language
cooperation is on the rise because the
nature of who's gaming and the social
style who's gaming is changing
cooperation is has verbs like share help
gift greet visit if you look at city
bill Zynga's newest game you see that if
you go to the leaderboard which is a lot
more like a friendless than a
leaderboard the things you can do are
visit and gift you don't taunt challenge
you know your your co-op you're helping
that I'll help you you help me
and the only reason Zink is doing this
is because it works you know it's their
very metrics and success driven this
kind of game is working it's got the
most players of any game ever as far as
I can tell they may be lightweight
players but we're seeing a lot more of
this and that's a happy thing if you're
interested in positive gaming because
you can do a lot through cooperation
whether it's one-on-one or crowd sourced
and then the third style is
self-expression sometimes people don't
think of this as part of a social style
but it's huge I mean we first saw it in
myspace with all the blinging out of
pages and there's a tremendous amount of
self-expression going on in Facebook
games this is from farmville so it turns
out instead of just building a farm you
could take all the pieces and make video
games old-school video game characters
there's link there's Mario and Luigi so
that was cool because that enabled
self-expression in a way that maybe the
developers didn't even intend but you
see verbs like customize select design
create that's part along with
cooperation that mechanic is very much
part of all of the hit sim like Facebook
games and things like Star at all which
is huge on the web where it's just like
this paper dress-up where girls go girls
being 14 to 30 plus and dress up it's
aspirational with fashion so and you
know simple things like really having an
it's something interesting to customize
in your profile can be a big part of
self-expression but self-expression as
many forms for some people that's a
primary reason why they gain that's the
punchline so competition cooperation
self-expression there can be a mix ask
yourself of your any project you're
working on think about who's using it
doing do any of these describe what
their preferred social style is and if I
don't know how can I get that answer how
many of you have ever heard of Bartles
player types okay
well I'll give you a really quick
overview again I come to this in a lot
of detail in NOT this is a cool story in
1996 John Bardo who's one of the
co-inventors of muds which are the text
precursors to Wow and other MMOs notice
that in the first three months he built
and they were all different he's one of
the very first people the same styles of
play kept coming up muds are multiplayer
by definition they let you do a lot of
things you can kill you can build you
could create you can share he saw these
forest player types and keep coming up
achievers explorers socializers and
killers achievers are the people that
are competitive and that like things
like leaderboards they want to know who
they're better then they want to know
what they come into an environment they
say what can be achieved how can I gain
stat
how can I like shows how great I am and
we all know people like that at work and
in games explorers are the people that
want to know every nook and cranny
they're the people that are gonna like
pull down every menu and check out every
little feat every little feature and in
muds they check out every little room
and then they're proud of knowing that
that's their that's what they're after
they want the fullness of X they want
knowledge comprehension and exploration
that's what these people are driven by
socializers are the people that would
stand in the lobbies of the muds and
greet people and like share gossip and
they wanted that web of social
interaction was what socializers were
driven by that was more important than
they didn't care about a leaderboard
they didn't care about how many kills
they had but they did care about knowing
a lot of people and they cared about
being acknowledged for it these are the
kind of people that make awesome guild
leaders in some of the mmo's because
they really care about organizing people
and being at the center of that killers
are hackers harasser 'he's the people
that just want to mess with either
software or people they get off on
messing with software people and again
we all know people like that and
sometimes they're very nice in real life
and then online you know yes I sense a
laugh of recognition but anyway the
point is these are four player types and
if you have a rich multi I guarantee you
wow these these four player types and
what's useful for us is to understand
where our players fall within these
player types and then we can use social
actions to design around that
specifically so here's a here's some
social actions for achievers win
challenge create show off compare is a
little bit mellower but those are all
achiever types of actions things that
you could do in an environment for
socialized are helping comment and
giving liking expressing sharing that
merges over into Explorer bit some of
these are you know more mixes of the two
greeting is very much a socializer kind
of thing for explorers often they're
very involved with content
so voting and curating rating reviewing
and just exploring an environment even
viewing pages is partly something that
an explorer would do if you see somebody
who just views like every page on your
site you know you've got an explorer on
your hands killers you know teasing is
the medium version of that taunting
heckling hacking cheating sometimes you
can turn hackers into either policemen
or members of your dev team we used to
do that on MMOs is reach out to the
hackers who are messing with the beta
product and say wow cool want to come
work for us so you may have had some
experience with that at Google and
dealing with hackers and getting them to
help you fill the holes in your product
but anyway you know they may or may not
come there's various techniques to deal
with them but these are these are some
of the social actions so you can see how
that map and you can make your own chart
actually that's one of the exercises in
the workshop is you make your own chart
with this using this framework for your
product how it is today and how you want
it to be so let's take a look at
Foursquare the whipping-boy
of game mechanics because every marketer
in New York pulls out their phone and
says I want badges at least the ones
I've met so however I want to get
Foursquare some props I actually think
there's a lot they did right and there's
a lot to learn from them so why does it
work why I mean now it doesn't work for
everybody but for a percentage of the
population Foursquare really works are
any of you avid Foursquare users ok so
just briefly for you why does it work
for you oh wait let's do it
especially when I didn't know what the
badges are I kept wanting to get more
and then compete with my boyfriend he
was getting more badges and see where my
friends are at can you pass it back to
she I think she you're an avid
Foursquare user I just like the history
of all the places that visit and then be
able to look back at it so it's like a
notepad of where you've been anybody
else anybody removed have a Foursquare
why you like it yes no okay so let's go
through what Foursquare is the core
activity is the check and we all know
that now but Foursquare really
popularized it you can check in the
venues and you earn points and stats
which I believe they're backing off from
the leaderboard but it basically lets
you know it's reinforcement loop that
says checking in is the core game this
is how you know look you have points and
stats badges are essentially what
Foursquare does for onboarding they mark
your progress and they suggest goals
just by the nature of being there and by
the presentation of them as a collection
which is that look they're 16 you've got
this many collect them all that's a very
powerful mechanic not always appropriate
but very powerful when it is the other
thing about Foursquare's badges is they
have a lot of branding they have a lot
of personality and attitude and humor
it's not just a generic badge and it's
consistent so you start to get a feeling
that there's a brand identity that
you're dealing with which again seems
obvious but is very very powerful
mayorship is the other core mechanic and
that's a little bit more of an elder
game although by elder you mean been
playing it for two weeks and mayorships
reward both loyalty and recency which is
just what you want them to do and they
drive competition I've heard a lot of
stories about people getting really
pissed off that they were ousted of
their mayorship of their own company or
something that they felt was you know
prideful by somebody else and then boom
Foursquare wins the two people start
fighting it out so the way the simple
to sharing the check-ins and the badges
promote social engagement depending on
how they're used not everyone but people
use force for a lot to promote
themselves or promote what they're doing
and I see a lot of activity around that
so why does it work well remember we
talked about intrinsic motivation at the
beginning the core activity it's always
good to know what your core action loop
is core activity has an intrinsic
motivation people at least the people
that play Foursquare liked check-in they
like to have that history as you say it
gives them something back they like to
earn the mayorship not everybody wants
to be a mayor some people just like
checking in and there's an intrinsic fun
in doing that particularly when other
people can see it it isn't just about oh
come by I'm at this bar it's also about
oh it's a bleary morning I'm at LAX I
had this experience and Oh 14 other
people are there that's kind of cool I
feel less alone were you gonna make a
comment okay Fargo's the progress
mechanics light the way you go through
the simple onboarding of badges and then
you can keep going with badges but it
really uses that and then once you're
beyond that there's something else
there's mayorships and once you be on
their ships you can see oh if I've got
three mayorships I are in a special
badge so there's a sense of this is what
it means to make progress and the social
actions enabled inside of Foursquare are
aligned with the social needs of the
populace and then since some sense
that's a self-fulfilling prophecy
because there's a competition so people
that like competing with their husbands
on things for instance like Nadia will
be engaged by that I personally stopped
using Foursquare because I don't want
people to know where I am I'm having a
lot of NDA meetings I'm like okay this
isn't working for me but I mean that's
me I'm not the core target audience and
if I was mayor of anywhere it would be
like my son's karate studio and there's
no credit that so didn't work for me but
what's cool is it does work for some
people and it works really and it's
aligned with their need for bragging and
Titian and sharing okay so here's some
things to ask yourself this is like a
shorthand and I'm gonna use Korra as an
example for some of these just to bring
it down to earth and make it real so
don't start by saying what game
mechanics should we use start by saying
what's our vision for this product what
is the what's the key benefit that we're
building everything around is there a
game people are already playing even if
it's sort of a not a real game but just
is there some system people are
optimizing and most importantly where's
the fun where can we put the fun or
where is the fun already that we could
support so Korra again not perfect but I
think a really interesting system and an
interesting example is pretty clear
about what it is which is it's this set
of questions it's not like we're doing a
platformer blah blah blah it's content
we want this content to be really good
and I think the systems are designed to
make that happen that's the core game is
where do I go if I want good content now
in a year that may not be true as people
are asking about Korra but right now
especially for me when I want certain
kind of really good content that's where
I go it totally worked
second thing play style who's playing
who are they playing with what kind of
playstyle is are they competitive or
they cooperative are they into
self-expression
what are they what's going to motivate
them so how do these players want to
engage what the way that one I think
Korra has a lot of different play I
think they've got different verticals
and different play styles going on but I
know that for me personally and I see
this a lot in the answers when I've got
some some some knowledge that I've
worked hard to acquire whether it's
domain knowledge like I'm sharing with
you now or you know I just got back from
my first cruise I took I did all this
research it's like I kind of want to
share it you know I did all this
research I took really good notes but
now what and so here's a guy who did
that for a new
your Chi I have to go to New York and a
brawl and boom I go to Korra and here's
a guy saying well I just went with my
kids and I'm taking my kids
what with my kids and I did all this
research and I want to share it here we
go and here's his answer and so the urge
to share information where you feel
knowledgeable about and in and to have a
place to share what you've worked hard
for that's an intrinsic motivation and
that's certainly one way that players
want to engage and that's a very
positive loop way it's another one
mastery so what can be mastered in your
system is there something that can be
mastered what's the core activity what's
the progression built around that what
is it that people are going to be
optimizing those are the questions that
lead you to mastery what does it mean to
play well
so in Korra what it means to play well
is to ask and answer good questions as
far as I can tell so what I noticed is
the first time I asked a question I had
to go through this whole jump through
hoops and be taught there's an
onboarding for asking questions now but
then when I ask questions I can ask them
and then I can edit them and then it
tells me oh yeah other people can edit
them too if they want to make it better
oh really
other people can edit my question and
make it better well that might not work
some of the time but I bet like if
somebody could do that and actually make
it better
yay because they'll be better answers
and you know so there starts to be a
little bit of collaboration sneaking in
there so what can people learn and
master they can learn and master how to
ask how do I write an answer that gets
voted up that's something for me to
learn and master progress so how do we
light the way to mastery ask that of
every one of your projects you're
working on you know how what are the
signs that someone's playing well and in
fact making progress so another way to
say is what are the key metrics for
progress how are they represented so I
think Cora could do a much better job of
this in particular because here you go
here's you know you go to your page and
look I got some up votes and look I got
some follows and like that's a bunch of
metrics so this is like a best practice
put your numbers in the context
numbers without context are much less
powerful than numbers with context and
here's I think Cora will probably do
something really interesting here but
I'm using it as an example because it's
scattered it's spread out and it's not
that clear to me if I'm making progress
and it could probably be clear
engagement so I haven't gone I have a
whole section on engagement I didn't
have time to go into today but I'll just
touch on it so engagement is really
games are very good at engagement but
they're not the only the only thing
that's good at engagement but there's
all these techniques that I've been
talking about and I think the core one
is designing over time designing an
experience that unfolds and changes over
time that gets more interesting and in
fact more challenging the more you do it
so within that framework what can you do
to re-engage people throughout their
lifecycle the other core inside is a
newbie and a master are gonna be engaged
by really different things the same
thing isn't going to engage someone as
they use your product more and more if
your products interesting so here's a
chart just to help you remember that so
imagine
ask yourself okay what's the engagement
what's the reengagement what's the email
or the notification or whatever how is
someone going to come back to my product
is it driven by them is it driven by
something with us what does that loop
look like is it social
same thing once somebody's been playing
for two months they know the ropes it's
just this tool they use now what is it
the core thing that's going to engage
them and what can I build around that
same thing your avid users that 2% of
crazy people that just can't believe
this product didn't exist before what
about them what's going to engage them
what's gonna be the thing that pulls
them back and if you think about that
that can help you create a really strong
backbone for a game that may or may not
have points or badges but you'll know
why you're putting them in there so
there you go if you want more like this
I tweet a lot of links and I let people
know about what's happening via Twitter
and you can also feel free to send me an
email at the best email service
gmail.com
so I'd love to take any questions anyone
has gentleman in the back wait a moment
sir my question is regarding it's
related to Korra am i working kind of
customer service and support I'm just
wondering if you've seen any really
successful uses of gaming techniques to
drive kind of support and service to
drive kind of support and service you
know kind of Alessa glamorous party
industry I have I haven't worked on them
but the place I saw it was at the
gamification summit there were a bunch
of people that were talking about
experiments that were going on with that
I what I know is it's a hot area yeah
that's low-hanging fruit
the things I heard about were pretty
simplistic like oh let's give them
points for answering
you know calls and the more interesting
discussion was around how you motivate
and empower customer service people you
know to to do a great job not just to
like complete lots and lots of calls but
I know that there's a lot of development
happening in that area anybody else
anybody any on the remote side have
questions looks like that
okay great well thanks for coming I hope
it was useful to you
