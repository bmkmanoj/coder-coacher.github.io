bus from the Max Planck Institute for
informatik from the broken he will talk
about something that's similar to Google
suggests to the outer completion of
search terms and this talk will be
posted on google video in public so
please don't speak about confidential
information okay thanks so this is a
very end of a talk I gave that sick I
are the big I our conference which just
took place in Seattle maybe some of you
have been there in case you don't know
where Seattle is here's a sign so it's
just in the opposite direction of
paradise so do you have an idea where
this sign so this is at Mount Rainier so
there's this spot paradise the visitor
center where you go and so on the way
there there's this nice sign so I really
liked it okay so it's about a search
engine surprise surprise so let me start
here it is and so yeah there's a I'm
going to present you now a whole set of
features and I will just do this one by
one and I will start with the simple
ones so this is now searching in a small
collection of computer science papers we
will later see figures for bigger
collections this is just for the sake of
example it's a nice collection because
it's papers so on one understands the
contents and there's metadata so there's
information about the authors the title
and so on you will see in a second why
that's important so let's start with
something simple okay okay you see I'm
typing something and things happen while
I'm typing so there's no search but now
that's the first type of very simple
query so what do we see here here's the
standard list of search results and it's
just doing prefix search here right so
that's just document containing a word
starting with goop so it's like as if I
would have put a star here so there's
always an implicit star behind the words
and what I fear is also pretty
straightforward it's just words
in my collection let's start with GOOG
and they are somehow ranked by the
importance number of documents they
occur in and so on ok now let's do
something slightly more sophisticated
now if i type in something more now what
do i get now i get word starting with
mou and actually if I activate this I
will also get phrases so these are words
starting with mo you again this is still
doing a prefect search on goog so here I
get mountain view for example which
means if i would type mountain view now
i would get 10 hits for this query right
so i could click that and i would get
yeah if you would see i get 10 hits here
right so this is the point of students
context-sensitive right so if i would
type mo oh in the beginning I would get
other hits right so these are only
completions of this word which together
with this part of the query would lead
to a hit okay let me just do it let me
just type mo who here right now I get
other words in particular I don't get
mountain view right because that's not a
very common phrase except in documents
where there are two is Google okay so
yeah these are some basic features and
there more to come okay okay so first
about so that's already somehow useful
right so I call this basic
autocompletion okay it saves you typing
the only tap yeah you only type as much
as you need right maybe you think you
have to type a very complex query but
actually you find that after just one
word or even a few letters your thing is
already there then what's interesting by
this thing on the left you find out
what's actually in the collection right
so there were I don't know if you saw
them there were words like Google ISM
google Archie which you maybe didn't
know before and so it's just interesting
to see them right
and there's also some amount of error
correction at least four errors
occurring towards the end of the word
and we can also do something about
errors in the front okay but that just
now now you can do more sophisticated
things which with this feature which is
not so obvious so one thing you can just
complete two phrases to how do you do
that if you have identify a phrase
mountain view in your collection you
just add this word to the collection
right so then you also have phrases you
can also complete to sub words wherever
in your collection you have the word I
ghen problem you just also put the word
problem into your index so let me just
show this for example here right so here
I have algebra no I type problem yeah so
for example now it also finds algebraic
icon problem right because it yeah just
found oh this is composed of two words
and so I also put the word problem here
and so it finds it although this words
start with eigen ok still pretty
straightforward now little bit less
straightforward I have metadata here
metadata is very useful these are papers
paper has an author it has a conference
it appeared in a certain year for
example there's this odd is also
starting with mo oh right so that's one
information retrieval guy when I have
this author I just add this artificial
word to my index and also this
artificial word to my index what do I
gain from this now I can also complete
to this word so I just activate this
here yeah so now if I do again ok now
I'm again I mean this has 628 hits right
and now I type mo you ok and so now it
also completes to this metadata thing
right so here's something which starts
with m 0 0 and so it asks me maybe do
you mean this do you mean this guy at
Leno mowrer
the author and this would lead to two
hits together with the word crooked so
that's also quite useful yeah and if i
would type something at lino i would
also get something now even less
straightforward I can do something
that's known as faceted search all this
metadata when a paper is from sick ir
confluence I just add this word to the
index I just add this word to the
document as if it were there if a paper
is by attlee nomura I just add the word
CT colon author and so on if it appeared
in this year I just add what do I gain
from this you show you by an example
yeah again let's stick to the google
thing so here are my 628 documents what
do I get now if i type this CT colon
thing now we get all come all words
starting with CT colon that together
with this goog would lead to a hit right
and here i'm just these are just the
artificial words which you saw on my
yeah i just rewrite them there when i
showed them right I don't write CT year
I just write the year two thousand five
okay so this is just the same thing as
before but just a little bit of
rewriting done now that's of course not
so I mean which user will type CT colon
you don't want to do that right you
don't want to ask your users to do that
but you can always launch this query
automatically in the background right
whenever you type something you also
launched the query with CT colon
appended which is just yeah which is
when I have the full thing yeah let me
make the font a little bit smaller for a
second and the boxes okay yeah so this
is actually the full set which you would
get so I type something I will make it
larger again so here are my completions
and now these are the completions if I
would upend the C 2 colon thing in the
end so in this 622 hits to our by the
author Carrie
Odin 162 appeared at ww 85 @ sick ir and
so on 221 and the year two thousand five
so this is what's called faceted search
you maybe know this from sites like eBay
or things like this this is clear is
there any question perfectly clear good
okay so these are all nice features and
the point I want to make here is I mean
you get all this we are the same
mechanism right it's just this prefix
completion thing just by doing different
things with your index invoking the same
mechanism you get a whole variety of
useful features okay two related things
you might have seen that before okay so
people who see this sometimes they say
oh this is just google suggests so let
me just point out the differences let me
say in advance that i like both of them
but they are just very different and I
think it's important to understand yeah
so let me just type so what's the
difference Oh actually it's my homepage
yeah yeah for example okay i also get
these things okay first thing I mean it
doesn't search at the same time right
you just get these completions but then
for example if i type in the name of my
host time I don't get any completion so
why is that I mean this is not doing
some full text thing this is just
completing two queries which people ask
right which is a very natural thing for
google to do because you guys have all
these cleary locks right and so that's
just a totally different type of thing
in particular it's also not prefixed
search right if I do this it wouldn't
search for word starting with group but
just for the word group so this is just
completing two queries that people ask
so that's a different thing and then I
type return I commit to one query it
will search for
that query so it's just a different
thing both are nice but it's different
here's another thing have you seen this
before it's also very nice but it's
again do it's related to Google suggests
so let me just oh yeah Yahoo wow I've
never seen that before what does it say
okay now maybe we come back to it in a
minute so it's similar right and in life
search you type in something and then it
also displays you a list of queries it's
basically like Google suggests but in
the background it already starts
searching for one of the query it snaps
to the somehow the nearest creamy the
nearest popular query and it starts
searching for that and I have a nice
user interface okay oh yeah yeah maybe I
should not know but it snaps to this
immediately yeah okay never mind search
smarter enfa okay if it works okay yeah
just one slide for those of you who like
it abstract problem definition if you
don't understand it doesn't matter right
there will be examples so this is just
this general completion thing you have a
set of documents which is just the hits
for what you have already typed for
example goop then you have a range of
words which is just the last thing you
have typed and all its completions so
like this mouth so what are potential
completions and now you just want those
completions which would actually lead to
a hit and only those documents which
actually contain one of these words okay
and then in this sick I our paper they
are I mean when you do this in practice
you have to do ranking right I mean you
get thousands of hits
to show the best three you get thousands
of completions you have to show the best
so ranking is important but it's
actually straightforward and positional
information is also important phrase
queries proximity queries very important
in practice so it's easy to add but in
my talk I will just talk about the basic
thing okay so yeah how could we do that
right now we want to have that feature
how could we have it yeah well let's see
how would we get it by an inverted index
right that's what all the search engines
have at least all the big ones you have
an inverted index one list for each word
yeah how would we do that so let's take
that query again we have this prefix
query just one word so this D from the
previous definition is just the set of
all documents I'm still searching in all
documents these are the potential
completions now I just go over all words
in my index that start with group this
word no this is just inverted just a
snippet from an inverted index and now
i'm doing a prefix search so i have to
merge all of them i want to show
document any document containing a word
starting with this okay i can do that
but that's expensive that's a problem
right that's why big search engines
usually don't do prefix search it's
expensive you can do it but stick okay
and here's there there's nothing
context-sensitive for the first word
right every word that's in the index
will also lead to a hit that's why it's
in the index so I just output all these
words in my left column yeah so that's
this is easy for one word queries let's
look at the same thing for two word
query and same thing for three and
forward we leave yeah this one we try so
here I put the Stars right in the engine
you don't have to type so now my dears
this is the set of documents this is the
hits for this part of the query right
and as I'm typing more I'm zooming in
more now these are all words matching
this all words starting with mouth
but some of them will not occur in any
of this document so now what do I do
again I go over all the words there's
mold and I find no mold in this set of
documents which means mold will not lead
to a hit together with hoop intersection
is empty mount in my example also
doesn't leak to it mountain there's 3
and 18 leads to hit so mountain should
be displayed in the left column right
mounting again intersection is empty no
hit mowrer this guide family name of
this author again okay so what do i do I
just go through all of them I intersect
and when the intersection yeah I merge
the non-empty intersections 318 25 and I
output the words where the intersection
was non empty okay so the problem here
is i mean most of these intersections
will be empty and there will be hundreds
of words here right I mean index you
have all these strange words will have
to go through all of them and compute
the intersection for each of them just
to find out that it's empty empty and
just for a few of them and that's really
a problem so just a summary of the
problem so it's ten more minutes so what
does this mean when you write down the
complexity it's bad and I've given you
two reasons many intersections you have
to do many intersections and you have to
do some kind of sorting because it's a
prefix search you have to we have
individual lists you have to merge them
and merging is expensive but when you
work on this and we are working on this
for two years now when we started we did
a lot of things fancy things nice
theoretical bounds was very hard to beat
this simple thing in practice why
because the inverted index has a lot of
very nice properties let me just
summarize them inverted index is highly
compressible right you can compress
these things very well which is
important
because I mean you are fetching these
things from disk I don't know if you
were doing this but still if you are
fetching them from memory it's the same
thing so half the space on this means
half the time to read it half the space
in memory means half the time to read it
inverted index if you do it right as a
very good locality of excess you just
read your data from contiguous blocks of
memory right which is very important
because as you know there's this ratio I
mean doing 100 excesses in memory here
they are there or doing them
contiguously that's a factor of 100 I'm
so very important in practice and it's
just simple code which also played a
role also for efficiency okay so here
are two slides on on what I suggest what
we suggest the basic idea is I mean
you're doing prefix search just have
lists for all the ranges of words that's
the basic idea we will see that it's not
so easy to make it work so this is just
yeah somehow I just pre computed this
Union right yeah but now I mean now if I
find out okay document 16 is a hit I
don't know because of which word in this
range it was a hit that's bad so what do
I do yeah I could just write the words
so document 16 came into this range
because this word was there document 18
came into this range because of these
three words so I could do that yeah but
that doesn't look like it would work
right I mean I have this list and then I
write all these words there and there
are different lengths so that's why we
didn't come up with this in the first
place because it doesn't look like it
would be good work okay here's one slide
how you can make it work just some basic
ideas you have these blocks which you
have seen on the previous slide now a
little bit more abstract these are
document IDs right so this is one block
and now
all this list of documents Eddie's 1335
and here i just have the words and if a
document has met more than one word from
that range I just repeat it right so
document three has word a and word see
from that range he it's the range a to
see these are just some artificial world
now here here's something this is a very
long list and it has small gaps between
the numbers so let's just replace the
doc I teased by gaps and also hear some
terms are much more frequent than other
terms so let's just replace each term by
its rank so this is just a gap one from
the beginning it's plus one to the next
one it's plus 2 plus 0 plus two yeah
it's just the gaps and this just means D
is the third most frequent word here a
is the most frequent word here so I put
a 1 here what do I gain from this now I
have a lot of small numbers here right I
have a lot of small numbers and now
there's some encoding called Universal
encoding where I encode a small number
with few bits a large number with many
bits and actually what you can do in
theory you can encode number X with lock
to X bit it's not obvious how one can do
that right when you want to encode
numbers of any size with this property
so here's huh yeah yeah that's the
theoretical opti moment you can get
somehow arbitrarily close to it but then
there's a trade-off of how hard is it to
decompress and but you can get very
close to that oh yeah so here's just
some encoding scheme right the plus 0 I
will to Justin coat with a 0 plane 0 the
plus one with a 10 2 plus 2 with the 11
0 and this must be prefix-free code
right so that when I go from the left
when I see a 0
I immediately see oh this is a placebo
vent and so on and I also encode these
ranks so what the numbers are not
important yeah now this monster he has
just become this very compact sequence
of bits and now the question is I mean
is this good now I just did some random
things I've gap bring some compression I
mean could do so many things actually we
did it the other way around we ask
ourself there's something called entropy
you can ask yourself I mean how well is
this compressible in theory and then you
can write down the empirical entropy of
an inverted index you don't have to
understand this number it's just
interesting and comparison to the
previous number oh yeah and there's also
an issue there are these blocks how do I
choose these blocks of which size I mean
how should I divide my things into
blocks it's not clear right I could
experiment but I mean there are so many
choices and so here's a so ni that's
just for the I earthwork word in how
many document as it occur and n is the
number of documents and here it says if
I choose my blocks of this size it's not
important what it is it's just some size
with some parameter epsilon i get this
entropy which is essentially i mean this
is the part that is big and this is the
part it's small so i get a very small
epsilon here so this somehow in theory
one can show that this what i showed you
in the previous slide should work well
okay now we just tested it on some
collections they are not as big as what
you have but at least it's this biggest
I our benchmark included this dot-gov
collection with a half a terabyte of raw
data I mean it's harder to have bigger
collections because you have to get them
on your computer yeah and the nice thing
here is i mean when you actually do this
you implement this
then I mean you actually see this right
you can do this and just little bit more
you actually see this epsilon so I mean
theory and practice match our almost
perfectly here so this entropy thing
predicts exactly when you use a good
compression scheme what you can achieve
which means you can do this at no loss
in space okay now we have to look at is
it all so fast we wanted to do it fast
so i will just do this very fast yeah
there are some analysis which you can
look up in the paper if you are
interested yeah we just did some yeah
this thing now avoids merging and all
this stuff which i pointed out for the
inverted index so what would we do you
just take some ordinary cremas and you
just type them from left to right right
you just pick some and then you just
measure the running type so for example
you take the query google mount view and
now you just type it from left to right
and you just measure how much time does
it take after each keystroke yeah okay
in tears too yeah I mean okay yeah you
just see this improvement by a factor of
10 or something like this so it's very
yeah it's an order of magnitude and
what's actually important is the maximum
here right I also have the average here
but the maximum is more important and
somehow you don't want it to take long
sometimes right you always want it to be
fast if sometimes you wait for a second
or two that's not so nice and you have
this effect here sometimes waiting for
16 seconds it's not what you want so
here we remain in the sub second range
even for this terabyte thing or on an
ordinary single machine right which is
quite remarkable I think yeah please
we're
okay the question was i said i would say
something about the block size so it was
on the slide but maybe it's here so the
theorem says if you choose the blocks of
this size where the size of a block is
just yeah this blog has size 1 2 3 4 5 6
7 8 9 10 16 it's just a number of items
here the number of columns of this thing
so this is a block of size 16 and now
the theorem tells me which is something
you would have not guessed in advance if
you take the blocks of size epsilon
times n where n is the number of
documents or 25 million for this
terabyte thing then this is the number
of bits with your index uses you get
this epsilon here which means you should
choose the block a fraction of this 25
million so for this terabyte thing you
should choose blocks of size million a
few millions and you couldn't have yeah
you wouldn't have guessed that and the
theorem tells it to you yeah and this is
I mean these numbers are for this block
size 0 in which I what I haven't shown
you when you do the analysis here for
the queries to be fast the blocks have
to be of they have to be large enough
and so it just fits together so they
have to be of size epsilon times n and
then it will be fast okay oh yeah just
very briefly may be interesting so how I
mean this is a system running via the
web I mean what did we do okay so
there's the server thing right which is
just answering the queries you type
something Google Mao and now it should
give you the completions and the hits so
that's of course written in C++ and C
otherwise would never be so fast then in
the middle you just have a web server
doing PHP and on the client side you
have a lot of JavaScript you know just
very just very high level I mean you
type something this sends a request to
web server this sends a request to this
server it's important to have this
middle thing so that you don't get any
problems with firewalls or JavaScript I
mean the client can't talk directly to
some server you shouldn't do that and
then this goes back here and goes back
here and it's this is what happens after
every keystroke yeah and whoever has
done something like this it's only three
components but debugging something like
this it's just it's terrible right if
you have an error there it's a network
application so which means you always
have these effects which are not
reproducible and I mean this you have
these things JavaScript PHP they are not
I mean C++ is hardly standardized right
but for PHP and JavaScript it's you have
these subtle differences between
browsers and it's a network application
so that's yeah that's really a lot of
work okay i summarize yeah these were
the property so there's this block wise
index you can compress it as well as the
inverted index which is very important
you can do this completion queries which
I showed you and all these advanced kind
of queries very fast because you have
perfect locality of X you're just
scanning data you never do anything else
except scanning that's very fast
indexing is much faster I didn't talk
about this because this block thing you
don't have to fully invert your data you
just have read a half inversion which
which also means when indexing you don't
have to sort which is very significant
okay and then you can do all these
things which I showed you you can do
this faceted yeah that was a workshop
talk I'm sick I are I didn't talk about
this yeah this is new I just give you an
example you can also use this to ask
this kind of queries which you can this
means give me all authors which have
written a sick I art paper as well as a
cig mod
paper these are two different sigmod is
the big database conference seek arouse
the big I our conference you can't you
can't write a creepy word query out of
this if you write a keyword query seeker
out paper and sigmod paper this will be
the empty set no paper is sicarra and
Sigma paper at the same time if you do
an or you will get authors which have
written either but if you want authors
which have both if you have seen xpath
xquery thats related to this so you can
do that to this index ok and the bottom
line is I mean if you have the set of
features and you don't implement them
atop but you have one mechanism to
implement efficiently and you get all
this ok so that was my talk I would be
happy to answer some questions yeah
please
at work
how do I choose which size the block
size ok the question was how about
scalability and how ok I haven't shown
you this I mean it's yeah I mean how the
block size is to be chosen this theorem
tells you you just have to choose it
dependent on the number of documents
yeah of course it goes up I mean it goes
up it goes up linearly with the
collection size so you can't do anything
about this the only thing you can do
about this is parallelization so the
query time is just linear in the number
of documents in the collection which you
can sort of see here kind of and so yeah
if you want some yeah if you have much
larger collections you have to use
several computers of course but the
point is I mean yeah it's always you
don't have this merging stuff and like
the inverted index it's just an order of
magnitude faster so you need an order of
magnitude less resources oh no no yes
yes ok which one was right this is the
number of distinct words yes it's not
the number of tokens yeah I mean number
of distinct words is always larger than
number
because you have so many strange words
so this has really 25 million different
words but there are very strange words
we just don't throw them out you had
more questions I I add some new like
documents they're always
yes okay the question was how about
update dynamic updating that's the same
as for the inverted index and I mean
there are standard techniques for doing
it and that's also how we do it here you
that's not so bad actually you just have
a smaller index right in which you which
you rebuild all the time and if it
reaches a certain size you merge it with
the bigger one in the background and
actually you have a hierarchy of indices
so that's a standard trick which you use
for inverted indices which you can also
use here another standard trick is you
have your index and you just leave space
in the index so that whenever you have
new things you just you don't have to
it's an array right and if you don't
leave space and you have to insert one
thing you have to copy everything but if
you leave space just put it there so
these are two standard tricks which work
for both kind of indices village are
deleting that's also standard thing
deletion you can do just like insertion
you insert the document with the tag
deleted so that's the way I mean I want
to delete the document so what do I do i
insert it as a new document and there's
a tag deleted and when I find this one
it says here's a hit but it's actually
deleted I will also find the old one
there will be a time stamp this is newer
and then after some in this background
merging at some point they will actually
be purged right and thrown out so that's
how we do it here so that's just the
standard way it works
Oh
oh yeah I should repeat okay good
question so if it if the collection size
changes a lot then also the block size
should change right so we haven't worked
on this dynamic aspect so far we just
made it work somehow but that's an
interesting question you would have to
do it somehow that's true but you would
probably also do it in this rebuilding
in the background because it will take
some time until it grows bigger what's
interesting question yeah yes the first
is I understand how excuse for how do
you choose
yeah hope the question was there was
this epsilon parameter so what's a
reasonable value actually there's not
much magic about this it's just you
choose it 1 over 10 01 / 541 over 20 I
mean if you choose it's right it will
just blow up the index in significantly
and it will not yeah I haven't told you
the details of the theoretical analysis
but it just doesn't matter much which
which so it's not a tuning parameter
which plays a big role one-tenth 120th
something like this ok you are two
questions
the number of terms that you love
together into a single
yes yes okay the question was what
exactly is the block size so if this is
a block then the block size is 16 it's
the number of columns here the number of
pairs here I have 16 pairs so that would
be blocked it's not it could be the
number of different words right but
that's not what it is it's the number of
items here the number of peers in range
how many words oh I just do it via the
block size I say the block size is 1
million and then I just cut it and it
actually doesn't matter if it cuts right
so if the word is here and there and
just doesn't matter it's not important I
mean I didn't tell you details about
this but it's implemented and so there
we didn't yeah it doesn't matter
close
can you say it again acapella you
drops side yeah the question is when you
the vocabulary also grows right when you
add new documents you might encounter a
word which has not been there before how
do you do it we haven't paid too much
attention to this dynamic updating thing
so far but again you can I mean you can
do it with standard techniques I mean
you just give it a new word ID lie I
don't see the principal problem in doing
this
okay what you would do is it again you
would just leave space right you would
just leave some word IDs in in the index
this all ids right it's not words you
don't write the words they just write
IDs and so you just leave some IDs in
reserve and actually you don't have to
map such that the alphabetical order
gives the word at ease in increasing
order you can have a slightly different
mapping there and so like this you can
play tricks you just leave some word IDs
and then you but eventually when it
grows too large you will have to rebuild
thread that's always the same thing but
we haven't worked out all
these spaces think I just have to just
leave the same space again I mean that's
not that's one bit right which you would
waste it's no problem yeah it's always
this when you reboot it's always this
factor to think right when it grows
twice as large than you rebuild and then
yeah overall it's still linea yeah more
questions I mean this is the application
such as I'm writing a paragraph why do
you let you this the Montagues words
they might be so important words in the
pan as I will do hopefully they to be
enough to be under the relative America
so you want to pick a document thats
related to the sender's am typing and
you always seem to think that last two
worlds water so I want to complete based
on everything I've take negative x does
like a completion which is visible on
what I do not face and what you do I am
not sure whether I before I repeat it I
have to understand the question
so for the degree in 10 words are there
ah ok you're saying Here I am completing
only now and not hoop anymore but using
who has a important direction to put it
in an important word in between how do
you pick which words to pick no they're
all of them are clicked as ok it's still
hard for me to repeat the question
because i'm not sure that maybe i just
explained it somehow the question is
what's happening when i type in more
than two words rereading hundred ok but
for three words I mean just to make it
here this is now this is a prefix query
right it's goop star mau star and it is
133 hits now if i type further i'm
searching in this 133 hits and i'm
getting completions of words in this and
this one and third so in 89 of this 133
hits 4 goob star maust are there is a
word view and in 32 days viewing so it's
taking all the words which I previously
typed into account so then can you which
are like brick oven in the pulvinus I
can take ablated to be a lot to eat yeah
somewhat every gold yeah at the moment
they are not ignored but I could ignore
them do you think I should ignore them
the question was can I ignore and I
asked should I ignore
the important statistically improbable
yeah yeah one could do that the reason
is that I didn't throw anything out his
so because you can also have phrase
queries and things like this yeah but
it's true i mean when bringing this to a
larger scale one should probably think
about the NP and and these words but
right now they don't make problems
another question yeah most of the people
think we're happy bit like just a few is
not actually the wedding was such a big
bit of anything bigger my dictionary for
both people why would people be happy
with a big issue of completion of babies
I was advantage of living officially I
mean Google indexes every word right I
mean you know does the same thing every
five-letter word which you type as a
given you type T fch why for you your
hips because it's hard to tell whether
this work is meaningful for anyone so
you better don't put it out in any way I
mean you can just store it right if we
not use so much space but as soon I mean
you're typing three words v IE and I
mean this will rule out I mean we're
just yeah now you're only getting there
you don't see any strange words there
right although there are a lot of
strange words here so it just doesn't
matter why should I bother to throw out
the strange turns I just keep them there
in case somebody types why is that eq I
mean then he will get the completion
maybe was looking for it Google does the
same thing it's hard to say this term is
not useful
are you looking there but the thing is
that these all these strange terms are
very rare so they I actually don't cost
a lot you can just put them in your
index otherwise yeah that's a standard
thing when you first and it randomly
idiot the gospel immediately decide the
darkness and the number of talking is
not in the vocabulary then releasing do
you weigh together yeah took a lot of
day yeah but it was the number of
documents where it was win yet but
you're right but I mean it's a factor of
two I think you save a factor of two if
you throw out strange words but that's
just a factor of 2 and not 10 so if you
want to save or you just buy another
machine and then you can and as I said
so Google has also opted to yeah because
somehow it's hard to say this word is
not useful maybe it's useful for someone
how many people
yeah boo Boop a story and then I why I
apparently i mean do you try this right
type any five I mean just to just type
any okay yeah maybe this was p QV is in
yeah i mean that's just type any and I
mean five-letter words they're locked
right it's 26 x 26 and type any
five-letter words into google you will
have ok it's just 34 hits but it's adds
up so apparently yeah and maybe that's a
yeah I don't know it means something
something yeah okay
