introduce Todd with whom I had the
pleasure to dive in Costa Rica and I
could go silent got to learn way too
many things it's not too many ever all
the work that he's done as well his
colleagues ought to help the sea life
and I don't want to be giving a star for
him so I'll just let you talk that
alright thanks thanks for coming if you
should it alright well thank you all
thank you Mark for inviting me here to
Google so my name is Todd Steiner and
I'm the executive director of Turtle
Island restoration Network we're a
non-profit environmental group based
here in the bay area with offices around
the world we work on marine species that
are endangered and currently our major
areas of action are salmon we have a
project called the salmon protection and
watershed network which works locally
here to protect the critically
endangered coho salmon of the bay area
won't be talking much about that today
and then we have a program that
concentrates on protecting sharks and a
program that works on protecting sea
turtles the title of my talk today is
protecting sharks and turtles at Cocos
Island National Park with drones
satellite submarines and you the outline
of my talk today I'm going to try to
cover for issues in this brief time one
is give you a little introduction to
Turtle Island restoration Network our
history where we've been and where we're
going then I want to convince you that
cocos island is in fact the most
beautiful island in the world and one of
the most incredible places under water
on the planet then I'll talk about our
work at Cocos Island briefly and then I
will end by letting you know how you all
can get involved and and help us move
forward so Turtle Island restoration
Network started out actually called the
sea turtle restoration project and we
began working
on a re bada Beach a beach where one
species of sea turtles Olive Ridley sea
turtles masked in this net in this mass
nesting behavior were literally tens of
thousands of turtles come up
simultaneously to lay their eggs so one
of the amazing events in nature and one
that I recommend that you get yourself
to one of these beaches to see some time
there are only 12 beaches around the
world where this occurs and we're
working to protect these important
beaches around the world we use sea
turtles and in fact endangered species
to do our work one because they provide
us with a legal tool to get changes made
to because they're incredibly
fascinating animals that people want to
protect and three what we're doing to
the sea turtles is what we're doing to
the ocean so we really see them as a
vehicle to shifting the paradigm of how
we treat the oceans so back in 1987 I
went to one of these are ebody beaches
in Nicaragua this was during the
sandanista period there was a war going
on the Contra war and I found these
biologists living under a tarp trying to
work to protect these turtles this was
pretty much before the internet they
were totally isolated because they're
the US was supporting the Contras on
trying to overturn the Sandinista
government they were really isolated so
I went there found out what was going on
and decided that I needed to help this
is what I look like back then I'm a
herpetologist by training so I
interested in sea turtles and snakes
they're in my hand and people judge I'm
still wearing the same watch so we
started out very grassroots this was
really I was doing this on my own time
it back then I was working at another
environmental organization and actually
start
selling beer and sodas to the other
people to raise money to start this
project that's how grassroots it was so
literally the cost of a biologist at the
time in Nicaragua was about thirty
dollars a month so by basically just
selling soft drinks to the other
employees I could raise enough money to
hire several additional biologists to
work down on the beach we got them some
resources we bought them a tent so we
went from a tarp to a tent and we were
making progress before we were done
there and we're still not then there we
had actually built a biological field
station and now that biological field
station protects this vesting beach it's
now a National Wildlife Refuge and it's
one of the most important beaches in the
world for Oliver Lee sea turtles while
we were there so up in the left-hand
corner you can see the flipper of a sea
turtle and a little marker that we place
on them a permanent marker so we started
tagging these turtles that was the
technology of the time of how you
figured out where these turtles were
going you put a tag on their flipper if
someone caught them or saw them later
they would send the information to us
there's a little reward a number on the
flipper on the tag and then on the other
side it says a reward and there's an
address so these animals that we were
tagging started showing up in southern
Mexico in the state of Oaxaca and we
learned that there was a slaughterhouse
where they're killing 50 to 75,000
turtles a year so on my vacation time
with my wife and toe in my one-year-old
son in his backpack carrier we went to
Mexico and started looking for the
slaughterhouse and lo and behold we
found it we snuck into the
slaughterhouse with my son on the back
pretending we were tourists we
videotaped it we came back and we
started an international campaign to
close the slaughterhouse that was the
largest killing of an endangered species
that was occurring anywhere in the world
at the time and with these images that
we brought back
and with a relatively unsophisticated
campaign we embarrass Mexico into
closing the slaughterhouse in fact by
1990 Mexico had closed the
slaughterhouse they had made the
harvesting of sea turtles of Mexico
illegal and they had joined the
Convention on International trade in
endangered species the treaty that
protects endangered species and we did
that by running these full-page ads
there's picture of one in the New York
Times basically putting forth the facade
that we were a big group and we were
going to cause them trouble we're in
reality we were a handful of people who
scraped together enough money to run a
full-page ad we hung banners off of
buildings across the street from
consulates and embassies around the
country and it worked we also understood
that the people who are killing those
sea turtles were poor and we needed to
find an alternative because passing laws
is one thing getting lost and forced is
another so we worked with the government
of Mexico to create an alternative for
the people there and my idea was to turn
the slaughterhouse into a museum into a
sea turtle museum similar to the well
museums we have in this country so that
was part of our history we don't do it
anymore because we know better and
because the animals are endangered and
so the same idea was to create a museum
that would provide employment to the
local community as an alternative to
harvesting sea turtles so I can happily
report today there is a sea turtle
museum at the site of the slaughterhouse
we then turned our attention to Japan
which was still importing sea turtle
products from around the world and we
use the same techniques we ran a
full-page ad we hung banners off the
buildings we protested out in front of
consulates and embassies and lo and
behold Japan dropped their reservation
inside ease and stopped the import of
sea turtles now we're working on bluefin
tuna tuna which Japan is importing
in unsustainable ways so along the way
we created a conservation toolbox and we
use these tools to get better policies
to protect the ocean around the world we
base everything we do on the best
available science if the science doesn't
exist we go out and do the science
ourselves we do grassroots organizing
public media campaigns these full-page
ads will take legal action when
necessary and we will get people
involved people like you and we really
need people like you to succeed because
despite our 26-year history we're still
a handful of people working out of an
office or several offices trying to save
the oceans and so it's been fun and i
would say that we actually oh just broke
the microphone that we excuse me there
we go we were actually one of the first
groups to have a website so we were
actually able to get sea turtles org way
back when and at the time this was
dial-up modem time things were
incredibly slow and someone I was
talking to started telling me about
websites and I didn't know what they
were and he convinced me that it was
going to be the cutting edge and lo and
behold created a website for us which
was database driven which was way before
WordPress days so that we because we
couldn't afford to have a webmaster
created a website for us and and that's
how we operate we get people who are on
the cutting edge of technology people
who are incredibly creative to help us
save the oceans and we can't do it
without those people as you will see I'm
highly
not technological myself case there are
any questions here about the technology
i'm about to show you so we ended the
largest slaughter of an endangered
species anywhere in the world we then
turned our attention to the next biggest
impact on sea turtles and that was
fishing and the worst fishery for sea
turtles is shrimp trawling and possibly
the worst fishery in the world for the
oceans is shrimp trawling so a shrimp
trial is a giant net that's dragged
along the bottom scrapes up everything
in its path it's dumped on to the deck
of a boat they pick out the shrimp and
then they throw everything else
overboard usually dead and that includes
sea turtles but it includes 5 to 10
pounds of animals that are destroyed for
every pound of shrimp harvested so we
did what we always did we ran full page
ads we took legal action we put
political pressure on the US government
to get turtle excluder devices a trap
door that allows sea turtles to escape
in the nets and also reduces bycatch and
once we got some rules in place in the
United States we turned our attention to
the rest of the world and we actually
got a law passed that said nations who
want to import shrimp into the US have
to use comparable technology to protect
sea turtles and so we then went to other
countries around the world and try to
convince them provided them training on
how to use these turtle excluder devices
and some of them did and some of them
didn't so we went to court and we got
this law enforce that requires Ted's on
all vessels who catch shrimp and want to
sell it in the US we also worked on
getting marine protected areas which
again at the time was a new concept
luckily it is now taking off but we work
very hard to get a Kemp's ridley swim
way created in Texas
or the turtles nest these are Kemp's
ridley sea turtles as opposed to the
Oliver Lee i mentioned earlier and
probably the most endangered sea turtle
in the world so again using the same
techniques we'd used before we pressured
then then governor Bush running for
president to put in place or a marine
protected area because his environmental
record as he was running for president
was questioned by us the use of turtle
excluder devices around the world led to
a conflict at the World Trade
Organization where country said it was
unfair for us to make them use these
turtle excluder devices if they wanted
to sell their shrimp in the u.s.
ultimately we won that case there is an
environmental provision for for trade
restrictions based on the on the
environment we did that by helping to
organize thousands of people in the
street at the Battle of Seattle in 1999
so we had 200 people dressed to sea
turtles we ended up being the centerfold
of Newsweek magazine the New York Times
called us the symbol of peaceful protest
at the WTO meetings and a good time was
had by all we then after getting some
relatively good pieces in place to
protect sea turtles from shrimp fishing
we turned our attention to longline
fishing and this is a method that places
a 60 mile long line in the ocean and
then dangles thousands of baited hooks
off of that in worldwide more than two
billion hooks are being placed in the
ocean every year more than five million
hooks a day and unfortunately way more
than the target species swordfish and
tuna are caught on those hooks and so we
turned our attention to trying to reform
the longline fishery and again using the
techniques that I mentioned before that
we continue to
fine we made some major progress so in
California we closed the the high seas
longline fishery forever and in Hawaii
we got major restrictions in place we
closed the fishery for four years while
they worked on new technology to improve
the fishery today if they catch more
than a handful of sea turtles they must
close for the rest of the year and so we
continue to monitor that fishery we
continue to make progress on modifying
the behavior of the fishermen to catch
less endangered species we then again
focus our attention internationally
again first we need to get clean our own
house before we tell other countries
what they should be doing and that's
what we did we then turned around we
went to the United Nations we called for
a moratorium on longline fishing while
better methodology were put in place for
the rest of the fleet around the world
more than a thousand scientists from 97
nations signed on to our full page at
more than 281 NGOs and the result is
that there have been modifications to
longline fishing around the world as a
result of this campaign we also want to
get individuals involved and so to
reduce the demand for swordfish which by
the way is one of the highest fish and
mercury and the EPA and FDA warn women
and children not to eat it at all and
everybody else to minimize the amount
that they eat we used a law in
California called prop 65 the right to
know law and again filing litigation we
got all supermarkets in California to
post the warning that you see here on
the left so if you go into the
supermarket you should see these
warnings everywhere that was the result
of litigation that we did we set up a
website called got mercury org where you
can go there put in your weight pull
down a list of fish that you e
and based on the average amount of
mercury in that fish it will calculate
how close you are to being in danger of
poisoning yourself mercury once we got
this law passed in California we went to
safeway right here in the bay area of
the third largest supermarket in the
world and said well why are you warning
people in California but you drive right
across the border into Nevada and you're
not warning the people of Nevada so they
said they would work with us to get
these signs up around the country we
work with them we work with them nothing
happened so we ran a full-page ad in The
New York Times the next day they called
us said why did you do that we said
we're going to work with you and we said
well we've been working with you for a
year and a half and you're taking too
long the next day these signs were up
around the country and you can see the
results of that during that campaign we
are greatly able to reduce the amount of
imports of swordfish into this country
both in California and nationwide and
the amount of swordfish being eaten by
people was dropped drastically reduced
so internationally we work in treaty
meetings we work at the IUCN on the left
this is a few years ago for sure is my
colleague Randall arouse we've been
working together for 20 years he's now
the Goldman award winner for his work on
sharks and sea turtles but we go to
these meetings we present our data we
build coalitions we collaborate and we
get things done we've been to the UN
again I mentioned that with the our work
around sharks and also our work around
longline fishing ah the Gulf of Mexico
oil spill the BP oil spill we couldn't
ignore it again that's where the Kemp's
ridley sea turtles are we were working
there actually their populations were
going up prior to the BP oil spill in
2010 our methods were working then the
BP oil spill hit we knew that it was
going to be
dreadfully bad for sea turtles we
actually found out that they were using
shrimp nets picture over on the left to
skim the oil into pie into single areas
and then light it on fire unfortunately
they were keeping the sea turtle
rescuers we had sent our staff down
there to actually get out in boats
rescue the sea turtles from the oil
bring them in for rehabilitation they
stopped letting us do it so we filed a
lawsuit that was the easiest lawsuit we
ever won the impacts of BP being blamed
for lighting sea turtles on fire while
they were alive was not some sort of
publicity they wanted and they turned it
around in a few days actually we then
turned our attention and this is a
current campaign to the California drift
net campaign so many of you may know
drift nets were outlawed on the high
seas by the UN in the 80s but
unbelievably we still have a drift net
fishery here in California I call it the
secret massacre that's occurring off of
our coast so this is a mile long net
invisible net that's placed in the ocean
it's literally almost as long as the
Golden Gate Bridge and would stretch
from the floor of the Golden Gate Bridge
down to the water 200 feet to 250 feet
deep over a mile long catching
everything in its path I won't mention
it but we use the same techniques that
we always did I guess I will mention it
and we've had some success this campaign
continues today but we got 250,000
square miles of the closed closed to
longline fishing during the four months
of the year when leatherback sea turtles
actually swim from Indonesia where they
nest to San Francisco to feed on
jellyfish in the late summer and fall
you may have seen the article in the
paper a few weeks ago when a one of
these animals got caught tangled up in a
crab net and
I'd so we have made some significant
progress on reforming the California
drift net fishery but this fishery needs
to go away this is a bizarre way to
catch animals the California drift net
fishery catches more marine mammals and
kills them than all other fisheries
along the entire west coast it's been
outlawed in or again it's been outlawed
in Washington but California still has
this fishery that most people don't know
about I talked to biologists and
naturalist and they aren't even aware
that it still is occurring originally it
was a thresher shark fishery they wiped
out all the thresher sharks and they
switched over to swordfish so they're in
the process of wiping out the swordfish
now so to summarize kind of the history
of our organization at least what we've
been up to in the last few months we
just got hard caps for whales and
dolphins on the California drift net
fishery but we're calling for a complete
phase out we're actually going to be in
LA in front of the Pacific fisheries
management council meeting next week
protesting and we got a bill introduced
last year into the legislature
unfortunately it didn't make it out of
committee we're working to make sure
that next year it definitely makes it
out of committee recently we also got
American Airlines and UPS to agree to
ban the shipment of shark fins we've now
gotten the US government to threaten
Mexico under a comparability law on the
IMP on the killing of marine mammals on
all seafood that's imported into the
u.s. and we have the rules in place and
countries have been given two years to
basically get their act together but in
the event they don't then their seafood
will be restricted from coming into the
u.s. and being sold here we recently got
Louisiana which had its own law which
prevented their law enforcement their
state law enforcement for enforcing the
federal Ted
law we got that turned around and on and
on so we're busy we're looking for you
all for help and I'll be getting to that
shortly so that was part one part two is
to convince you the cocos island is one
of the most incredible places on the
planet and unfortunately the quote above
this photograph was by Jacques Cousteau
who called cocos island one of the most
beautiful islands in the world or the
most beautiful island in the world cocos
island is located in the middle of the
eastern Pacific Ocean it's 350 miles off
the coast of Costa Rica it's about
halfway between the Central American
coast and the Galapagos Islands that you
can see down in the left-hand bottom
corner of the slide cocos island has a
long history of being used by pirates
and whalers and in fact the the treasure
of Lima is bleeped is rumored to be
buried there by by pirate fishermen and
people have been looking for this
treasure on this island for many many
years but as I will show you the real
treasure of cocos island is not on the
island and it's not man-made it's under
the water Costa Rica claimed cocos
island in 1832 took them a hundred and
fifty years to turn it into a national
park it became a u.s. World Heritage
Site biosphere reserve in 1997 it was
only in the last 15 years that the ocean
around it was finally protected with a
no fishing zone and more recently that's
been expanded into what's being called
the seamount management area so why is
it so fantastic cocos island has some of
the highest biomass of underwater
species in the world that's because
three different oceanic
parents meet at cocos island bringing a
lot of upwelling a lot of biomass and
small animals attract the bigger animals
and that's what I'm about to show you
high percentage of species in dem ISM
both on land and in the water and it's
the only eye on the Eastern tropical
Pacific that has both rainforest and
cloud forests on it with the summit at
1,900 feet and more than 200 waterfalls
on the island falling right off into the
ocean because it gets about 21 feet of
year of rain so now I'm just going to
show you some beautiful pictures of
Cocos Island most famous for its
hammerhead sharks it's very large
populations of hammerhead sharks but
also the fact that you can get up close
and rather personal with these animals
because they come in to be cleaned by
these little yellow fish called
butterfly fish so the Sharks are coming
in for a massage and they're turning on
their side and they're all relaxed and
you can hide out right next to them and
literally touch them it's also famous
for its very large populations of
hammerhead sharks all these photographs
were taken on our Coco's expeditions
cocos island we're trying to make cocos
island famous for sea turtles as well
and when I first went to cocos island in
2007 there was a very large population
of sea turtles you'd see them on every
single scuba dive things have changed
and I'll talk about that briefly as well
but back to the photographs not unusual
to see more than one seizure a lot of
time
sea turtles also come in to be cleaned
so this sea turtle is in its relaxed
position allowing those fish to pick the
parasites off of them another very
common shark at cocos island are the
white tip reef sharks and cocos island
is famous for its famous night dives
where these reef sharks go into a
feeding frenzy they've actually learned
to use the lights of the divers to feed
and you'll get hundreds and hundreds of
fish feeding it once in more recent
years tiger sharks have come to cocos
island we have a long record of people
diving at Coco's tiger sharks weren't
known to be there in 2007 we saw no
tiger sharks by 2009 2010 tiger sharks
had shown up and a report I regista
s'more nning was that they saw tiger
sharks on virtually every dive on this
last trip we also have whale sharks at
cocos island lots of big fish Galapagos
sharks and silky sharks and this was
actually in a bait ball where dolphins
had rounded up smaller fish into a ball
and then both the Sharks and the
dolphins were shooting through the ball
having dinner an amazing experience I've
only experienced this twice my 300 dives
there but it's worth it to do it 300
times to get to see this raise a number
of species of rays at Cocos Island this
is called the marbled ray and the diver
in the background with the spear is on
our team and that's what we use to tag
the shark
underwater with so we have manta rays we
have Devil Rays or mobile as we have
eagle rays marine mammals is not unusual
to get to dive with dolphins coming over
to check you out it's always an exciting
thing we also see humpback whales there
and on one occasion I've seen in orca
there and lots and lots of fish small
fish that feed the large fish these are
called whippersnappers blue and gold
snappers surgeonfish and Jax are true
schools of Jack's larger than any
schools of fish I've ever seen to say i
don't know if it's hundreds of thousands
or millions but sometimes you see
schools that stretch 60 feet vertically
in the water column and as far as you
can see and you can swim into the middle
of these and all you see a silver some
unusual fish is well the cocoa spat fish
and endemic fish founded relatively deep
depths on the sandy bottoms that thing
that funny thing on its head is a lure
so it lowers in fish and then sucks them
in has these bright red ruby lips very
and it hops along the bottom it's a very
unusual fish there is coral there but
sometimes the fish get in the waves
being able to see it another unusual
fish the commerce ins frog fish this
fish also has a lure although it has it
folded in but it wedges itself between
rocks or on coral looks like a rock
itself Wiggles its little lower and then
sucks in its dinner eels did I mention
deals a lot of times you go scuba diving
you see a an eel under a rock you call
your friends over to see it
at cocos island you see eels under every
rock and so after a short period of time
it becomes rather common sight but there
are actually 30 different species of
yields there including the tiger eel
more common Yul's there are some
invertebrates they are to the boxfish
I'm sorry the Box crab really unusual
looking animal and then one of my
favorite the Imperial sea urchin which
this photograph doesn't really do it
justice but those little white dots are
actually iridescent blue and it has
these strange five triangles on the
missus looking obviously straight down
on it but if you get down to their level
it looks no matter which way you
approach these animals it looks like it
has two big eyes staring at you and the
entire ocean bottom when this photograph
was taken there were thousands of these
things just slowly marching along the
bottom so why are we at cocos island
besides enjoying ourselves at at what I
believe to be one of the most incredible
places under the water and when I first
went there I can tell you I felt like I
was seeing the oceans the way they must
have been two or three hundred years ago
in a lot of places but we've
unfortunately wiped out most of the fish
wiped out most of the Sharks wiped out
most of the sea turtles and so I really
felt like I was peering back into
history and committed myself to really
protecting this area so we go there
several times a year we're trying to
understand the importance of Cocos
Island to the biodiversity of the entire
region we're studying the movements of
these highly migratory animals the
Sharks and the sea turtles we're trying
to evaluate the effectiveness of the
rules inside the marine protected area
cocos
seek to improve those protections with
better data and better enforcement
throughout the region and we're using a
number of tools and I'm going to show
you some of those in a minute but we're
using acoustic telemetry to keep track
of where these animals are going and the
receivers for those sometimes have to be
placed using submarines which i'm going
to show you in a second we have we're
using satellite telemetry we just
started using a crowdsourcing satellite
technology that i'll show you in a
minute we're using UAVs and we're also
looking at the genetics of these animals
to better understand where they came
from and where they may be going so now
I'm going to show you a two-minute video
or three minute video of a trip in last
year in April and it's working
so what we're doing here actually is
deploying a acoustic receiver had a
hundred and eighty meters which is
deeper than you can do scuba diving and
this is part of the seamount management
area I mentioned and this is called SML
SC mound it's about 40 miles from Coco's
on its way to the Galapagos and as you
will see later on we're trying to show
the connection of the animals there that
are moving between these two marine
protected areas so that was it fun in a
submarine at 500 feet placing that
receiver we replace that in April and
we'll be going back in the next few
months to actually see what data that we
found we also on that trip started
testing a UAV a drone and this is to try
to better protect the area from illegal
fishing so there's a 12 nautical mile
protected area around Coco's but
fishermen sit on the edge and at night
they sneak in with their long line gear
and are harvesting sharks and turtles
and other fish and so we again and this
came out of one of our expeditions where
we bring people along who are interested
in our work and someone started talking
to me and said oh I design drones in an
earlier part of my life and we started
talking about them and before long we
had actually found a company that this
year 2016 is going to provide that drone
that you just saw $250,000 toy and three
technicians to monitor illegal fishing
inside the reserve and then we will go
to court and try to prosecute the people
who are illegal illegally fishing there
and again this just came out of
discussions on these trips and those are
the kind of discussions I'm hoping to
have with the
all over time to really help us protect
the oceans pretty amazing technology
here though and again we found a company
that's basically donating this for three
months next year we're going to do it in
3 1 month periods we're not going to let
the fishermen know when we're there and
when we're not there so hopefully it
will change their behavior when they
know they can get caught for the times
when we're not there but if not we will
prosecute so this was a fun trip
actually we were on a vessel called the
ilusha owned by Ray Dalio one of the
richest men in the world he donated the
vessel to us to allow us to place that
receiver down deep and interestingly
lasa MELAS which is now protected
seamount we couldn't find it so we had
we knew where it was supposed to be and
we got there and it wasn't there luckily
this vessel also had side beam sonar
they spent eight hours doing surveys
before we found the top of the seamount
where we could place this receiver so
it's always fun and luckily there were
people there a new technology who could
help us out one other project we just
did this year as an experiment a digital
globe as a program called Todd Tom nod
and they take satellite images of the
earth all the time they agreed to take
satellite images around cocos island and
then they have a crowdsourcing program
called Tom nod where they put these
photographs up and people went out and
looked for vessels for so we had
thousands and thousands of photographs
they actually got 11,000 people from 140
countries to be looking at these
photographs trying to identify illegal
fishing vessels again this was an
experiment and we're still analyzing the
results back to the technology we're
using a number of
other technologies one or acoustic tags
and receivers that was an acoustic
receiver we're replacing i'm using the
sub on the left hand side in the hand
there the red tag are placed either
internally in the animals or we placed
them externally on a tether and
basically all this technology does is
let you know whether the animals are
around the receiver or not around the
receiver so it's basically all it tells
us as presence or absence and which
individuals that we tagged so to make
this work and to understand the
movements of these animals around the
Eastern tropical Pacific we're working
with colleagues in all the countries
around the Pacific and we now have these
listening devices set up at cocos island
at galapagos island at m'appelle o
island which is off the coast of
Colombia coiba island off of Panama and
on and we have more and more of them
going in along the coastlines now to try
to understand where these animals are
and as you can see on the left hand side
we we've tagged hundreds of hammerhead
sharks a number of other species whale
sharks sea turtles with this technology
now we use this technology because it's
relatively inexpensive there the tags
cost a couple hundred dollars each as
opposed to satellite telemetry that
which cost a few thousand dollars for
each tag so we can have a much higher
sample size and we're now starting to
show that these animals are moving
between these different biodiversity
hotspots we've started using satellite
technology the price has gone down some
and we do this in a number of different
ways on sea turtles we either glue them
to their back with epoxy and the turtle
this turtle is a green sea turtle or
call the eastern tropical black turtle
and you can see why and it's got all of
our little technologies on it so we're
still using the flipper
tags on that right front flipper they're
the same technology that was being used
for the last 50 years to tag turtles but
we also have the satellite tag glued on
its back and then over in the back of
its shell you can see we place an
acoustic receiver as well so we're
testing the technologies to figure out
which one's work best we've tried
several different satellite technologies
we also have the one at the bottom on
the left it's tethered we drill a little
hole in the back of the shell we tether
this to the turtle it drags behind when
the turtle surfaces the antenna pops up
it's buoyant sends a signal to a
satellite satellite sends a tundra to my
computer and we can follow these animals
in real-time and then third satellite
transmitter that we've also tried
different companies trying to figure out
which one's work best in our conditions
to place the tags internally you have to
catch them so this was another
expedition to cocos island where we had
a special vessel this large tiger shark
actually several were caught we're
actually this that platform goes under
the water and lifts the animal out of
the water we were able to attach a
satellite transmitter to its dorsal fin
again satellite technology only works
when you're above water doesn't work
underwater as the acoustic tags do so it
only works for animals that surface and
the at least the antenna has to be above
the water to send the signal we also
placed the acoustic tags surgically
inside the animal and then those
acoustic tags will last for ten years
when we attach them externally they
usually fall off in a few months we've
had one last for about 150 days low-tech
so that's me over on the left so all
this high-tech stuff's going on I'm down
there with a pencil and a little piece
of plastic taking notes on populations
counting turtles and sharks we've also
tried to get as many people involved as
possible so as people are there they can
take photo grow
apps of our turtles and if you the the
scales on the head are unique and you
can identify individuals also with whale
sharks you can take a picture of the
spotting pattern and then there's a
technology kind of like fingerprint
technology you can run it through a
computer they can identify individuals
and allow thousands of people around the
world to provide data on where these
animals are moving back to the receivers
underwater again when people go on the
expedition's with us we need help so
there's usually my partner and I Randall
but there's a lot of things to do all
these receivers have to be taken aboard
taken down taken up above onto the
vessel download the information change
the batteries bring them back down at
the same time we're trying to count
Turtles and sharks catch Turtles tagged
sharks there's a lot of stuff going on
and we basically use folks like you to
help us get all this work done so here's
an example again there's me a plan on
this dive was to tag a shark but sea
turtle swam by so I needed help I needed
to get rid of the the spear to be able
to land the shark bring it up above and
put the technology on the animal and
this is tagging a whale shark this is
another one of our colleagues alex hern
tagging a whale shark with an acoustic
tag the other technology we're using is
we're taking tissue samples from these
animals and looking at their genetics
and this is given us information about
the importance of cocos we have animals
coming from around the world actually to
spend at least part of their lives part
of their life history at cocos island so
from the samples that we've collected we
gave them to a graduate student
and she's been running those samples and
we now know that about seventy percent
of the turtles at cocos island are
coming from Galapagos about ten percent
are coming from the major nesting beach
in Mexico and then about three percent
coming from the coast of Costa Rica but
interestingly ten percent of all the
animals are coming all the way from the
Central and West Pacific traveling
thousands of miles to literally spend
their juvenile years at Coco's so we
believe these animals somehow are
getting to Coco's where they spend more
than a decade before they reach sexual
maturity and then they will swim back to
their natal nesting beach to lay eggs
and so this part of the mystery we're
still not sure exactly which beaches
they're coming from in the indo-pacific
because there aren't good samples at all
these other sites the turtles have been
sampled there so we know they're there
specific genetics and just to give you a
look at the satellite telemetry most of
the animals again as I mentioned it's
it's an important nursery ground for
juvenile turtles it's a lot of the
animals we mark stayed place stayed in
place but a number of them took off this
one animal northern the the top of the
screen went all along the Costa Rican
Coast all the way to El Salvador started
heading back out to sea when we lost
transmission we've had animals go to
Panama Costa Rica Colombia and
excitingly one of them has made it to
galapagos to prove our genetic data so
the other thing that we're doing with
this information is looking at whether
the 12 nautical mile no fishing zone is
large enough for the animals so looking
at the home ranges of these animals when
they do stay put at
and to see if that 12 nautical mile
fishing area is large enough so this is
a gives you an idea of some of the data
this animal if you catch the turtle you
get to name it this animal was named
Emily and as you can see this animal
pretty much stayed within the 12
nautical mile area interestingly that 12
nautical miles was just made up the
number was picked I don't know how it
was picked but it wasn't based on
scientific data but for sea turtles at
least for Emily it seems to have worked
pretty well on the other hand some of
the other turtles spent significant
times outside the 12 nautical mile area
this one named noni spent seventy
percent of its time outside and just to
summarize that data approximately forty
percent of the points we're outside that
twelve nautical mile area suggesting
that it could be larger to better
protect the animals the message though
is no matter how big the marine
protected area if it isn't really
protected it's just a circle on a piece
of paper and so again using the drones
using radar we are starting to collect
the information necessary to better
protect and enforce the entire region
down on the left hand side of that
photograph on the bottom is a big pile
of illegal longline gear that was
confiscated inside the reserve and our
data helped to produce what's now called
the seamount management area so Coco's
there in the center there's a no fishing
zone in the green area so the illegal
fishermen were largely coming in so that
as I mentioned in the first slide Coco's
the coast of Costa Rica's to the north
there so the fishermen were hanging
right on the border and then sneaking in
at night so we've enlarged the
protection area around the northern edge
of cocos island
hang it out an additional three or four
miles there's a closed area is green
part around la semilla seamount and then
the yellow area we are still working
with the government to come up with the
rules of what fishing will be allowed
and what won't be allowed currently
they're outlawing tuna fishing they're
getting to the end here just another
piece of data that's incredibly
interesting at I mentioned that sea
turtles seem to have been going away and
that occurred at the same time as tiger
sharks showed up at Coco's and so we
know that tiger sharks eat sea turtles
we watched them eat sea turtles and and
as the population of tiger sharks has
gone up the population of sea turtles
have gone down so part of it they've
changed their behavior they're harder to
find part of it is they're just being
eaten as I mentioned before we finally
last year tagged a sea turtle that
swimmed to galapagos proving the
connection a migratory connection and
our data now shows that green sea
turtles and leatherback sea turtles move
back and forth between Coco's as well as
hammerhead sharks silky sharks and
Galapagos sharks so the reason why we're
collecting this data and what we're
trying to do now is create a marine
protected swim way that will connect
cocos island national park with
galapagos marine reserve owned by two
different countries luckily the economic
exclusive zone the 200 miles between
these so government's own 200 miles from
their coastline because coke costa rica
owns this little dot in the middle of
the ocean they own 200 miles from their
coast and then they own 200 miles around
cocos island creating the dotted line
significant swath of the entire Eastern
tropical Pacific owned by Costa Rica
and connecting to the Galapagos or the
Ecuadorian easy economic exclusive zone
so we're now working with with these two
countries to try to create a protected
area so these animals are not only
protected when they're in the marine
protected area but they'll be protected
as they leave the area and swim between
these two different reserves so that's
our goal that's what we're working on
now and the data that we have obviously
we're in the process now of getting it
published that's to get the scientific
data out to present the arguments for
creating this marine protected area but
again we also do it in many other ways
as well we've had a number of
documentaries done on our work in costa
rica and cocos island and galapagos we
publish articles in magazines and then
down at the bottom the Cocos Island sign
they're actually Sherman's Lagoon a
comic strip that's indicated in 150
newspapers I work with the artist the
comic strip writer gave him information
about the different dive sites at Coco's
and he actually followed one of our
satellite transmitter turtles in his
column for two weeks and gave people the
URL where they could watch the turtles
in real time moving around so oh one
minute so to end sharks and turtles the
recovery yes with your help so join us
so i really hope you all who are
watching this will join a coco sex
position we have three trips next year
we want to figure out how Google can
help with all their technology to better
protect the oceans we want you to
brainstorm with us on and implement new
technologies I invite you to contact me
directly there's my email information
the best time to talk about this stuff
whoops is right on the boat after dives
and that's where all the good ideas
happen I want to thank mark Merlin
for inviting me here today and Jennifer
Arturo crespo who all went on our last
trip in July and I hope to meet some of
you all on our next trip thank you again</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
