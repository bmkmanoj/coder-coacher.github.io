speaker dr. Thad Starner as you may
already know dr. Turner that was a
computer evita camera my keyboard seven
days a week 18 hours a day for the last
20 years and as the first cyborg an MIT
campus his PhD work a decade ago started
the area of wearable computing currently
he's a faculty from interactive College
of the School of Computer Science and
Georgia Tech his immense experience in
integrating wearable computer into
everyday life can be valuable and to
those who design mobile applications and
useful user interfaces without further
ado let's hear what that and his group
is working on these days thank you very
much for this is the new talk for me
I've been working on a lot of new
research and some of it well this will
be the first time you see it in fact the
stuff at the end is so new that we're
not quite sure it's going to work yet
our preliminary results show it will but
I am certainly open to some help and
suggestions on this on this work so
we're going to first talk about wasn't
one some of the revolutions that are
coming down the pike with mobile
computing and one main problems with
that which is interfaces from there we
actually talked about different
interfaces that sort of read your mind
and I mean this I we are from it just
seems to read your mind to it actually
reads your mind and we'll see we'll see
where that takes us the main idea the
main thing we're going for here is
looking at mobile phones replacing pcs
now there's two billion phones currently
in use I currently have subscribers
there's only 900 million pcs so mobile
phones are basically taking over in
developing world sometimes your mobile
phone is your only pc place like Liberia
for example only has five kilometers of
phone line of copper cable it has got
four thriving mobile phone service
providers so
for them a lot of things you can you
would normally do with a land-based PC a
desk based PC is actually done on on the
phone things like finance banking things
like citizen reporting or even simple
things like email and even in
technologically savvy countries like
Japan you can actually see that emails
are more often sent for mobile phone
than am from the home on PC there's kind
of shocking we think about so there's
something going on here the mobile phone
is slowly replacing all the functions we
see on the desktop when I was at MIT
that used to talk about digital
convergence which is now a reality the
fact that your pc is going to be your
fax machine your TV your radio your word
processor your notes system and that's
come to pass what's happening is now
digital convergence on the body however
there's a question of why none of you
are seeing here taking notes on a mobile
device some of you have laptops but
laptops will not exactly something you
could use while walking down the street
why don't you guys using blackberries or
for that matter why aren't you using
android yet but why can't we actually
have a decent pocketable interface that
acts like a pc now when looking at
technology it's always good to see
trends they've happened in the past this
is laptop technology from 1990 2003 as
we can see you got some nice exponential
trends here disk space went up by a
factor of four thousand x cpu speed went
up by a factor of 800 x and ram went up
by 256 that's moore's law why isn't up
by 30 batteries a lagger to 3x batteries
got some physical problems right and we
can't expect much from that anytime soon
we might get effective 2x with fuel
cells I'm hoping for better but I don't
believe anything else yet but this is
when laptops are getting their power
band so to speak 1990 we're starting to
starting to talk about the first seven
pound laptops about 93 we're starting to
talk about 92 93 was talking about
starting to talk about the first power
apple powerbook
by the time we got here our laptops have
gone pretty much full featured and if
you take these curves out now you see
them something to fly on out you know
now you don't get much more than 22 or
two gigs on a laptop system your
harddrive starting to flatten out
thought for a while these curves you
could Bank on interesting enough this
wireless transfer speed has actually
gone up quite a bit recently so we can
expect the same sort of thing in mobile
phones we're going to see this sort of
exponential increase in these
capabilities now that's great it means
that we'll have as much computer in your
pocket as you want it's giving a talk a
few days ago and somebody said you know
more about disk space you know I want
300 gigabytes I want my desktops to hear
gigabytes of non-volatile storage my
response was if you pay enough like
eight thousand dollars you can get a
terabyte in your pocket today a flash
alright that's pretty shocking a
terabyte is half the Library of Congress
circa nineteen ninety five or so so
we'll have no problem with the hardware
but we will have problem with the users
I can shrink down a computer to be the
size of a hearing aid to be size of a
speck of dust but I can't shake my
fingers down to that size now how hard I
work I'm not going to be able to hit a
key that's one millimeter by one
millimeter or kid I say that keyboard
that's one bill at middle be nearby one
millimeter so guys we got human
limitations here we have limited
dexterity the fat finger effect turns
out you also have limited vision you a
lot of vibration when you're walking
it's very hard to actually read your
smartphone while we're walking down the
street even worth you got split
attention you have to deal with things
in the real world and that might be
walking if you're really scary might be
driving for me often is having a
conversation or in this case giving a
talk my notes are actually on here so we
need to make a system where the computer
interface does not take your full
attention it doesn't suck your brain and
we have to make an interface whether you
user can switch their attention to the
real world quickly well I thinks I see
with today's mobile interfaces is that
they really are not designed to be well
mobile I mean fine you can take him from
chair to chair or from a doorway to
doorway but you can't really use them
while you're on the go and I think that
Woody Allen actually chose the bit shows
this best in his movie take the money
and run he talks about the marking
shuttle here he's joined a marching band
and he's playing his famous cello right
and well it's not going very well and a
lot of times smartphone your faces are
but like this you know try to do
something while you're walking so you do
something they have to keep walking
again you do something to keep walking
again and finally you just give up and
you just stand in the doorway and type I
don't know about you folks but everyday
I seem to run into somebody who stopped
in the middle of Halla cuz they just got
an email and they stopped and they
forgot just to keep walking and you
turned the corner go BAM right so
there's something wrong here I mean if
we can go from the marching cello as an
interface to something that's more
appropriate say a clarinet we might get
a whole lot might do a whole lot better
now we spent a lot of time looking at
mobile interfaces over the years and it
turns out seconds matter we used to have
this thing called the two-second rule
which said that if you can't get the
inner to the interface within two
seconds you won't do it and that was
just the rule of thumb we had over the
years we found more and more evidence
for it in fact there's some evidence
that if you can't do it in two seconds
you use will go exponentially down for
certain devices certain tasks and
there's a nice study by some folks in
Finland it's reported in KY 2005 well
they had people doing web browsing doing
a particular task on the phone and they
instrumented the phone with cameras
looking at the user a camera at the side
looking at the person you know they've
really instrumental person's eyes are
and you know when they're seeing on a
bus they'll look at the screen for eight
seconds and we're caught and then look
back up but when you're doing something
like walking down a crowded subway
platform what happens is I can't get my
phone out here here we go what happens
is people will sit here and look at the
display for on average four seconds then
look back up and make sure they're not
going to run into something then look
back down the back up mix you're not
going to well fall into the chair that
was fortuitous so this idea that if we
can do interactions in for second verse
if we can make an interface designed
that you can complete your task in four
seconds be really powerful there's
another thing that we found out in our
research which is that there's a big
social pressure when in conversation to
keep the conversation going even a short
delay
is really socially awkward so we study
people using calendaring equipment you
know having their smartphones or having
their Franklin day planners and you know
we interviewed folks to see what they
actually used or what they thought they
used and then we actually scheduled an
appointment and they didn't use the
device seventy two percent of the
Franklin day planners never got out even
though they had with them half of the
PDA user's smartphone users PDA users
with quite while ago never pull it out
even the hat on them and what we found
out is that it took them 20 seconds
didn't matter the device 20 seconds to
get the system out now give you an idea
of how bad it is I already told you
about the delay in conversation how
awkward that is what happens is people
do filler conversation right oh you said
Monday isn't that the third you know
they'll just put fill a conversation so
that you know they're actually busy
working on something but a lot of people
just not bother doing it what they'll do
is they try to remember in their brain
or write down on scrap paper right then
of course they lose the scrap paper or
forget the appointment I mean you guys
have all seen somebody like this right I
used to resemble such a remark but when
the other things we discovered is that
the people who actually use the device
with the ones who had faster devices so
we had this correlation between speed of
access and use one of the quick piece of
statistics here it turns out that when
you look at conversations like the
standard office conversation if you she
and Josh and I are talking together or I
just dropped by your office and I say
you know can we have lunch let me say
tomorrow may be right turns out that
fifty percent of conversations last 38
seconds or less it takes you 20 seconds
just to get to your your smartphone
right you're not going to do it so when
we start doing all these studies and
people kind of see become painfully
aware how bad their mobile devices they
start thinking about about other ways do
it and south will include you know what
can I just have my system listening to
my conversation
or why can't I just have my system read
my mind well sounds like good research
agenda to me so let's talk about it as
you shut up as you she said I've been
doing this for quite some time for my
first wearable computer on back in July
of 1993 I've been trying I've been
trying to it since 1989 started with
trying to make a sun sparc station that
failed pretty badly well I still at my
slow IPC case and anyways so we went to
pc 104 and eventually i convinced these
poor other suckers to actually join me
in trying this actually saw it on a
picture of josh here you don't know how
you avoided that with it but what we've
been doing is trying to live the
experiment we try to predict what the
technology can do and say 5-10 years put
it on figure out what the applications
might be and live with it now everybody
is always just about the hardware so i
will talk about how her for a few
minutes the wearable computer has
evolved quite a bit the original ones
were quite big is a pc 104 based
infrastructures this is a charm at here
same sort of infrastructure my current
machine that i have on me is an okiya
model one it's about four years old got
one the first thing first one of these
things that were made if you're
interested in appearing in the bag you
can do it later it's the first time we
actually have a wearable computer that's
actually not made by us in some sense
it's got some advantages and
disadvantages what some of my students
are currently working on is this this is
a gumstix but they make daughter boards
for it so you can actually derive the
display directly and I can also do you
know now you can get you know eight
gigabyte SD cards so you can actually do
store all your data on there and you're
not with something this is actually
somebody else's singer nets tix you know
but something that's relatively small
like a pack of gum the idea is Wow very
few people with actual Kyle colored
shirts the idea or use you the idea here
is you actually slipped the gumstix up
on your color and once
I sorta like a college stiffener and
then put the battery on the other side
have the computer monitor come out and
help hook up and have a wireless
keyboard at your side and eventually so
really soon now you can actually have
these things disappearance your clothing
now i'm an old fart i'm still using this
stuff because i like having you the Cray
in my pocket but and i also have you
won't believe a hardest to make the
right connectors in clothing to make
this works it's not about the technology
so about the connectors in clothing once
you get something that works your loath
to change it but you know my students
are kind of pushing down this path even
have one is making everything in a
wristwatch heads-up displays have
evolved over the years is my current one
this is an sv6 you can actually put the
display into a lens of prescription
eyeglasses these are actually my
prescription eyeglasses this is made by
micro optical now they're called in my
view the actual display is back here on
the earpiece hits a mirror because
through the lens hits a beam splitter
back into the eye today I don't know
what I mean it's kind of hard to get
these things because last time I checked
they cost five thousand dollars but the
new ones are much bigger field of view
much better resolution than this 320 x
240 one but it's kind of a chicken and
the egg on demand right now why is
nobody by these well this display cost
two thousand dollars why does it cost
two thousand dollars because no by buys
them gotta love that however Apple to
the rescue here's the video iPod and now
we have all these people starting to
sell these heads up displays for video
ipods now i'll tell you that in my
opinion this is a dumb display why it's
great when you're lying in bed is great
while you're sitting on an airplane but
try walking down the street with this
doesn't work my students watch the tick
for whether they're there saturday
morning cartoons one on the subway using
one of these and i still an immersive
enough experience you can see if
somebody's about ready to fall into you
on the subway turns out the company that
makes this understands this but when
your wall march when you see of walmart
and looking at buying these display as
you say as God but you I'd right is God
beat you I'd obviously and so they're
actually the consumers did not cut up
with the fact that you really don't want
this type of display yet so this could
use some sort of idea what it looks like
from my perspective it just seems to me
like I am have an overlay on the real
world now to give you some idea of how
that works I'm going to have you do an
experiment pull your right hand up to
your right eye and look at my face okay
block my face close your left eye block
my face with your right thumb now you
can't see me right and that's like
having display in front of your eye now
open your other eye and you can actually
see that you can almost like you can see
through it this is also the way I can
actually show your bosses that I do a
good talk get a quick picture there but
you can see that if you had optics in
front of your thumb you can actually
make it crisp and clear and have a
display my display currently 640 by 480
it's very crisp in fact I prefer using
it for doing things like writing papers
I have actually used both this not this
display its predecessor and the Twitter
to write my PhD thesis so here's the
toilets one had a keyboard and it's a
quite simple layup the keys so people
can see this the keys are just ABCD
there's sequential a b c d e f g just as
labeled when you get to I you actually
do a shift do the red shift and the next
sequential button so then keep on going
sequentially j k l m n o P Q then you
switch to the blue shift r s t u v w X Y
Z so what's really cool about the system
is since it's a three by for a late
button layout if you actually put it
onto a cell phone so here is a model of
a panasonic cell phone you can imagine
we flip it open just kind
act like a normal multi-tap or t9 text
entry but when you flip it back the
screen flips and not acts like a Twitter
you can type with it so I'll pass this
around people and check it out yes we
have been slowly painfully trying to
make our own cell phones at Georgia Tech
because nobody else was making an open
system right now we're actually using
open moco because somebody else is doing
the hardware thank goodness but we can
talk to you guys about Android
afterwards okay people always ask well
how fast can you type on these things I
max out at 130 words per minute and I'm
not the fastest this bugger who only
practiced for 25 hours is actually
faster than me after I've been doing for
12 years it's really kind of annoying
he's a guitar player that declared the
time to 30 counts chords so what happens
Jeff is just asking about chords what i
can do is push the G and H key together
it gets me ing the B and C gives me
though the B&amp;amp;D gives me too this gives
me Thad at CC detect led you this gives
me Georgia Tech this cuz in college
computing etc ctrl + alt on the back
plus a is alpha or backslash alpha back
slash beta Chi Delta for the thurs you
use latex in the in the audience you'll
recognize this I can actually attend a
lecture where some mathematicians
writing the blackboard have latex book
quality notes that i can write them
faster than you can write in the
blackboard it's really kind of cool I'm
not sure I can do that anymore because
now I'm lecturing as opposed to
receiving but interestingly enough you
can actually learn the Twitter three
times faster two or three times faster
then you can learn a desktop keyboard
that's kind of cool so if you did know
how to type already it's actually worth
your time to Twitter you'll get up to
speed faster so you know it takes about
six to eight hours of typing class to
get to 40 words per minute the Twitter
will get you to 50 words per minute in
25 hours experts maintain you know this
is that so that's the average experts
maintain about 70 words
okay oh by the way I should mention if
you're looking for more information you
can look for you can type the name of
the slide or the name of the project and
the conference of the paper appeared in
okay so now I start talking abut i start
i started talking about how we want to
have mobile phones we play species and i
said that could be very important to
developing countries well i have now
shown you a way to make a mobile device
that has replaced the pc for me i used i
can do all my email on this thing i can
do unlike lectures on this thing in fact
I used to give my talks from my wearable
computer so any problem is the vga cable
on the on the bag as I walk around the
room really gets in the way and the
first time I fell off the stage because
of this damn cable hooked up to me is
the firt is the last time i did my
lecture from the wearable so this is why
I carry this power is a I book with me
these days but so we now have an
existence proof we know we can do this
let's take a look what's currently out
there this is what wearable computing
looks like now one of the first things
we did with the doing wearable research
is make a hard disk based music player
of course nowadays ipod is everywhere we
also now have the heads-up displays with
the video iPod people are trying to make
more more functionality to risk based
computers I think this one's now is no
longer you sold we talked about why that
is symbol has this thing called i think
is the ws 4000 this is used for things
like inventory control so if you're say
UPS you've got all these packages coming
into memphis tennessee every night and
God scandal you're pulling out of the
crate and ship them somewhere this is
how they do it because it's one motion
as you're going to pick up the crate you
scan it and you have to it's all one
fluid motion and of course this is my
favorite one this is our rim blackberry
user I love these folks
especially in Atlanta Atlanta everybody
is wearing these bluetooth earpieces all
day every day I am no longer the only
wearable computer guy out there actually
I haven't been this like a handful of us
around the world we've been doing this
for quite a long time but now I gotta do
to see a web of computer users walk as
walk out on the street and watch all
these blackberry guys with with
earpieces on so what's wrong with this
why not use this well but my problem
with this is the crackberry effect let
me show you what that means blackberry
from rim systems text when email power
in the palm of your hand for the
professional on the go
and introducing the blackberry helmet
reinforced polymer to protect the skull
of the mobile professional on the go
with an antenna for better blackberry
reception so you can spend more time on
your blackberry
and the camera that broadcasts a picture
of what's in front of you to your
blackberry so you can always be looking
at your blackberry the blackberry helmet
with optional safety flag
protect your skull while you destroy
your thumb so this is from the
rickmercer.com orit ention and when i
was actually doing some contextual
inquiry at query where I followed a user
around for days and learned his job and
this guy early days the blackberry this
guy was trying to type all walking right
and the thing that scared me i was
literally falling him all the time right
it meant that when he was typing while
driving i was very scared and now
there's a new Nationwide Insurance
report out thirty-seven percent of 18 to
27 year olds admit to texting while
driving that's scary yet people feel the
need to be connected they have all those
downtime weather on the subway on the
bus or while driving that they feel that
they can actually get something done a
lot of times that's email it's one of
the reasons why email has become such as
prevalent form of communication nobody
calls anymore they'd rather you know
spend ten messages trying to micro
arrange stuff but there's a there's a
problem here and we're trying to solve
it so what we've been doing is to trying
to figure out what users currently do
what they think they're doing what they
want to do and then we try to figure out
what the problems are the interfere with
what they're trying to do and we're
trying to do something about either
through improving the current technology
or exploring new directions I've always
shows you the direction we started back
in nineteen ninety-three let me show you
what's let me show you the new stuff
first thing we do with the BlackBerry
users is we took a mini qwerty keyboard
that's what they use it's this way call
these little keyboards any queries and
we actually saw okay why are these so
compelling our people is fast on the mid
40s as they are on the Twitter that'd be
pretty amazing I mean most people think
they're pretty slow in these things
turns out they're wrong we took novice
users
never touched a blackberry style device
in their lives but they were expert
desktop typists they can tie between 55
and hundred twenty words per min on the
desktop and after just 20 minutes a
practice these guys are doing 30 words
per minute after about six or seven
hours oh my slide stuff moved they're
actually up at 60 words per minute to
give you a comparison the average temp
employer who said employee who says that
he or she can type will average about 38
words permanent the highest pay grade in
for the US government for typing used to
be 50 words permanent so these folks are
as fast as the professional secretaries
on their blackberries that's pretty
shocking my problem is notices error
thing that's a little troublesome so we
now know why the blackberry dominates
mobile email it's much much faster than
anything else out there except for the
Twitter that's not quite true but if you
were interested in the details I can
tell you for comparison t9 and Molly tap
you average around 20 words per min so
we're talking about some of those three
times faster here but we're getting this
crackberry effect where people are
typing while they're in meetings with
their with their hands in East the desk
but they're trying to type all walking
and when you're typing while walking you
can't really pay attention to the
keyboard what happens then but we
actually forced our users are expert
users to type while not looking at the
screen or the keyboard what happens is
there their speed goes down to 45 words
per minute wake up to fourteen percent
error race kind of explains why the such
attention needed can we do something
about it the answer is yes it turns out
a lot of those errors what we call off
by one errors when you're typing
something like cat CAT space what
happens often is you might get to see
okay might get the a ok when we go to
type the T you hit the T&amp;amp;Y at the same
time because they're adjacent to each
other turns out that's sixty percent
these off by one errors are sixty
percent of the air is made
buy blackberrys typist when you force
them not to look at the screen when we
forced to do something else while
they're typing it goes up to about 70 75
percent that's a lot of the errors it's
what we found out though is that we can
read your mind sort of we can realize
you didn't mean to do that because we
hit the T&amp;amp;Y at the same time it's not
actually at the same time you hit the
tee and then they hit the Y quickly
afterwards turns out that's so fast
there's no possible way you meant it you
just are not physically that fast with
your thumbs so we can do a little
machine learning algorithm use a lot of
features but basically comes down to
this for each key you look to see if
it's adjacent to the previous key if it
is is the time between the previous key
in this key less than 47 seconds
milliseconds if it is is it more
probable that the key that the the key
was done intentionally or
unintentionally it was unintentional
don't don't let it through so you can
actually grab this spurious keystroke
this erroneous keystroke before it even
hits the display can do this without
dictionaries right this is before you
get a dictionary you can embed this in
the American controller of your mobile
device and selling of a system that
actually increases your accuracy by
twenty-five percent that's pretty cool
and this is the first the first aspect
of the read your mind interfaces we're
going to talk about here we're using the
physical constraints of the human body
and of the device to figure out what you
actually intended turns out this also
has a very low false positive rate for
all those who are machine learning guys
in the audience so let's now talk about
some other mind-reading things we can do
I talked a lot about having about these
calendar systems and that's where want
to focus when they first talked about
listening in generally when I talk about
wearable computers somebody the audience
or somebody is always used to say why
not use speech recognition I'd say well
speech recognition is great except in
situations like this if all of you are
taking
notes by whispering into your bluetooth
headsets it'd be a cacophony in here
however there are some situations where
it makes sense can we actually broaden
the range of those applications can we
use speech recognition in new ways to
actually have it leverage what's
happening in the mobile context make it
even better than the desktop now what's
great about this right now is that these
Bluetooth headsets are cheap and popular
the surprisingly good sound quality most
of the time they get you quite well
problem is they oftentimes also get that
that truck horn going value but we also
have evidence that people are willing to
wear this already you know I don't have
to go hire models on runways get
convinced people these things are sexy
don't you don't a fashion plate here
this is this is the future you're only
wearing this now kidding so when we
started looking at the speech
recognition what inspired us was the
Boston voice users group now these are
people who have RSI so bad carpal tunnel
tendonitis or thing did he switch to
speech for everything on their computer
these are programmers data entry folks
people who are used computers a lot and
what they found out early on is that you
get RSI of your voice box right ouch you
think RSI of the hands is bad so there's
some medical issues here but there's
also some social issues we were very
interested in the social issues here's
an example so one of these guys who
can't type this thing they're talking to
his computer friend comes by knocks on
the door and says you got a second and
the person responds stop listening oh
I'm sorry I didn't mean to spy on you
I'll come back later right no no I'm so
no you don't understand my computer I
was telling to stop listing stop
listening stop listening thank you my
computer was a talking to my computer I
had to stop it and that's you know so he
does this every time he gets interrupted
whether it's on the phone right someone
on the phone is no idea what's happening
right you answer the phone you say stop
listening so while you dizzy change the
stop listening command to just a second
and now uniform is both the computer to
stop listening it also informs
person you're talking to that you'll be
with them in just a second talk to two
people at once so that's what we call it
dual purpose speech first version of
this is something called the counter
navigator agent remember I said about
people scheduling appointments and they
actually didn't bother using their PDAs
or smartphones or Franklin day planners
well we said love that was access time
can we reduce that can we make that go
away can we actually use the
conversation itself to schedule the
appointment that'd be really cool the
problem is speech recognition is
horrible still especially in these
unconstrained mobile environments here's
a trick I'm going to use specialized
vocabulary grammar and words and i'm
going to use push to talk you can
imagine that for me we're going
implement this on a twitter so i just
push a chord my calendar comes up and i
can say can we meet sometime next week
and my next week shows up or you can
imagine also doing it on your phone and
with a bluetooth headset and say can we
meet next week it's pretty clear what
you're doing then or if you even do it
on a wristwatch let me show you an early
prototype of this this is actually
working and you have to forgive me here
as i go back and forth between different
formats
look wassailing Nicator but to the
calendar now we replay Bob speech input
to the calendar navigator agent along
with the resulting navigation he sees in
the head-mounted display when Bob is
engaging the push to talk button we will
show this visual indicator though the
calendar navigator agent uses only Bob
speech the original conversation video
is overlaid in real time to give you a
feel for the interaction as a whole ioc
Bob hey can we meet next week next week
you said yes one day
Monday yeah let me check
I'm busy all day Monday how about
tuesday tuesday at one them
sounds good I'll pencil you in at one
great thanks okay now in doing that
prototype I learned many things the
first one is do not use grad students at
2am is actors they are very wooden the
second thing but you know in doing that
demonstration we said no is this regard
i will start talking like the Terminator
t1 not T to God be stylish here so i
really i started talking like the
terminator if we do this and it was a
very interesting question so we actually
took 16 users and had them try to use
the system we did a wizard of oz system
so we faked the this one was real but we
faked the speech recognition for this
two reasons for that number one so we we
saw the interface more than anything
else number two so we could collect the
vocabulary and grammar people naturally
used in talking with somebody else while
you controlling the computer and so we
actually trampa speech recognizer on
just those three hundred words makes it
much better speech recognizer and what
happened is we had some people who had
used speech recognition before and said
computer go to next day yeah Bob when
was that again computer Tuesday you know
and that was not very good but we got
other users who surprised us and they
did the following hey Bob can we meet
next week say tuesday at 1pm and what
happened is the system but what dude the
entire schedule right put the user at
tuesday at 1pm put bob in there and then
the Bob would say no I'm sorry I can't
meet then personal hit a button up to do
undo and restart and this proactive sort
of predictive scheduling is something
that turned out much faster than any
interface that we had come up with so
the users some of these users figure out
ways to use the unit interface that we
hadn't expected and really took to it
that was pretty cool and what we showed
is that people could actually use this
you use this technique and let me show
you let me talk about dual purpose
speech for a second here the reason this
works because we're constructing phrases
very carefully and tuning the recognizer
to it we
doing push to talk so the computer knows
when to listen we're leveraging the
display so you get some instant feedback
while you're in conversation but we're
also maintaining privacy because they're
only listening to your side of the
conversation it turns out that when
doing speech recognition try and do it
from a bio mad microphone just somebody
else in the audience is really hard you
get junk but when you do it for yourself
or the models trained for you you can
actually do it so this sort of inherent
privacy control which is really good
because in 12 states of the union you
actually go to jail for recording
somebody without their knowledge we did
something else and studying people who
are very busy people who are managers we
found that they used their secretaries
in very interesting ways for example
this one person controlled a
fifty-million-dollar research community
would say yes Admiral I'll have Cindy my
assistant send you the 1099 form by
Wednesday and Cindy who was in the room
with him but get up and go and do the
form right he'd have to say anything
else she was good enough to actually
know what he wanted she also had to be a
PhD so it's a very tight coupling there
now the my problem is Cindy was not with
them all the time so we realized instead
of making a wearable computer for this
guy what we really need to do was make a
better interface to his assistance so we
have a system called speech courier
which are things like systems where I
can say yes my student my graduate
student Patel will send you that 1099
form by Wednesday and upcoming might an
email to normal with the speech the text
which is probably I would not be so
great but they'll be good enough and the
audio waveform so we can play it so he
can look at the speech if you look at
the text and see if it's good enough or
he can actually play it back if he
thinks it's not good enough and let me
show you that what that looks like so
this is once you get the email this
little link it gives you
it gives you this interface it stores
all the messages but what's cool about
this is suppose that my student normal
who I sent this email to realize the
speech recognition is not doing a very
good job for example it's got normal
here instead of normal but also normal
notes that i do not have anybody who i'm
talking to named Ted really not anybody
that he would know so he says okay well
is that actually what is that actually
there so what he does is he just says
okay I won't play from there okay my
grez OED he meant ed okay so what's cool
about this is he can actually select an
area 51 to 10 and listen to the speech
that actually got missed that they get
corrected well it turns out that when
you have in your faces like this it
makes things like visual voicemail you
know Apple's new thing on the iphone
makes it a whole lot more powerful and
changes things like your voicemail
interesting its archival instead of
selling you threw away right away same
thing with this it changes your
conversations and do something that's
archival and searchable that's really
powerful matter of fact at Georgia Tech
we spun off a company that not only can
you do the speech to text stuff you can
also search phonetically through all
your voice notes at 50,000 times faster
than real time on one pc night to 150 of
these things and you can like you know
search the entire cell phone traffic of
the united states or something like that
i have to do the actual numbers on that
but you can you can imagine that those
sorts of speeds you've got a huge amount
of power here's a final version of this
and this is caught something called
dialogue tabs and dialogue tabs is a
system where it's designed for a small
notes now there's been a couple studies
akai recently three of them which looked
at how people remember small pieces of
information things like you know phone
numbers or URLs or names and it turns
out that our current technology is
really really bad at this in fact it's
so bad that we actually study how people
actually use it the most commonly used
way to take short notes is
post-it notes again is this access time
problem so what we decided to do is use
this dual purpose speech idea to see if
we can actually solve this problem
here's an example if I go up to we're
live here so don't use your real number
come to Josh here and say said Josh
what's your phone number six million
seven six one seven three one two three
one two 180 180 70 okay thank you very
much normally when you get somebody's
phone number you're writing it down
right and so they kind of give it to you
in blocks anyways and you repeat it back
to them to confirm that you actually got
correct well now I p it back not only to
so they know I got it correct but also
I'm talking to my computer and so I keep
this audio in these little tabs at the
side of my screen all day and at the end
of the day or when I have a few seconds
and go click on it see if it got the
message right and just sent to my
rolodex so there's a different way of
doing these post-it notes but to
yourself reminding yourself throughout
the day again these sorts of interfaces
are not reading your mind but kind of
acts like it let me check my time here
and see what I got talk to you about
just something quick here for all the
machine learning people in the audience
one of the ways to read your mind quotes
on clothes is actually to predict what
you're going to do next now in ubique
was computer how many people here have
know about ubiquitous computing have
done some work in it a few of you right
so there's the standard thing of you
know I want my computer in my car to
remind me to pick up milk as I'm driving
past the grocery store it's a really
stupid idea if I'm all right past the
grocery store the last thing I want to
do is turn around on one I want to go
back to the grocery store right well I
want to do is why I leave this building
I want my system to say oh if you're
going home remember stop at the grocery
store right as I get it in my car and
that way i can plan but for that I need
to predict what the user is going to do
so let's see if we can do that now
problem is that users really do not want
to tell you you know the GPS location
for everything that's important in their
lives can we actually infer that
automatically the answer is yes so
here's GPS traces of a user in Atlanta
and you see it's kind of cool you
actually get kind of a trace of the map
of the region but it's not particularly
useful for this task so what we do is we
look for every place the user stops for
more than 10 minutes this is not just
stopping in the car stopping when
they're walking but also when they go
into a building you lose the GPS which
is actually good in this case and we get
all these places just scattered
throughout the city I notice there's
nothing wrong here that's because that's
a super freeway going through Atlanta
right there's nothing there the but then
what we're going to do is we're going to
cluster these points in two locations
stuff that actually means something
people because GPS has air or two at
number one but also when you're entering
a building there are several entrances
they don't want to locate each entrance
when locate the building so how does
this work first of all we take our
places we said we find a radius R and we
just start dropping these circles and
down on the on the data we find a mean
and then we recalculate the circle one
everything in there we keep on moving
the circle going to its mean until it
settles down let me call that a location
we restart and we do it again people on
doing that until there's no more places
left we can then actually get rid of all
the places that happen will have at
least you know say five all the location
all at least five places in them now
once we get one one location can look
for sub locations in that location for
example in my neighborhood only go to my
my house but at Georgia Tech I could
have many different places on campus so
there's actually a very rich set of data
there so what you can do is you can
actually look to a different scale
to cluster things first of all you
cluster at the high level you might be
the country get state city eventually
campus level and buildings within the
campus how's that work well you guys see
if a sub location exists so what you do
is you take all your places in the sub
located in that location and then you
try to cluster it using the same
algorithm i just spoke of but you change
the radius of the circle and see what
how many clusters you get out and figure
out if there's an e in the curve turns
out you get a very distinct knee in the
curves as sub locations and that's and
that you can actually automatically
generate this hierarchy of location
space it's kind of cool about this is it
really works surprisingly well for think
four campuses you go from these clusters
of here is actually the parking lot and
for the crb building where we used to
work this is the main college building
this is a food shop another food shop
and it actually picks them out now we
have these locations and you've gone
from hundreds of thousands of points to
individual GPS coordinates now it's time
to actually bug the user you're not
asking them to just figure out
everything at a priority now ask them so
you know I see you go to this place
every day what's it called and they
might say oh it's work or it's you know
the tsr be building or it's my office
and then you do the whole social
filtering thing as more and more users
you get your gang lots of data for this
as more and more users start using the
system and they have to label their
places they say okay I see you go to
this place every day previous labels
include work office and tsr be I'll take
tsr be and so you get as little help
from the user as possible because they
won't do it otherwise once you have this
you can start looking at every location
at how how they move from one location
to another you simply count the number
of visits / total visits to other
locations they start getting a
probability network what's cool about
this is it's really starting to look
like Markov models so first order
predictions are pretty easy right I'm at
work crb building how many times I go
home and I'll 21% well after work like
you know tend to do store 10 just do
chores as well so I stopped at the
grocery store creak Jake sighs can
whatever these first or predictions will
help you with that whole you know pick
up milk at the grocery store problem
turns out second order predictions are a
whole lot more interesting here we've
gone from saying you know I go from the
crb to the grocery store thirteen
percent of the time now if I was at home
first then I went to work my probability
going to the grocery store is 21% went
up I probably if going to the hardware
store is zero so by looking at this
history I knew much better predictions
of what you're going to do next now this
is a this system this you can you can
find this on the on the on the web and
it turns out there's lots of variants
that you can do on this is there's a lot
of people working on this sort of
problem now we're going after a
different game now we're trying to use
the same sort of discovery algorithm but
on continuous real-time data so the idea
here is that I got some unlabeled data
and I actually one of the repeated
patterns in it I also want to look to
see if there's any sort grammar a sort
of language to it so I go from this raw
data I compare everything with
everything else which of course is very
nasty exponential very very nasty so all
of you who do speed shrek think of
dynamic is to talk about dynamic time
warp now to dynamic time work work off
every segment with every other segment
right repeatedly as you find each new
repeated pattern each new motif because
as you take out different parts of it of
the the input data stream you got
reconsider everything so the goal here
is go from this to something where you
actually see these patterns now that's
nice that really nasty but we've
actually gone to the stage where it
works pretty well we have a sub
quadratic algorithm where let's see if I
can show you here where this is an old
data set but we've taken little motion
sensors there's wireless versions of
this but we didn't have them
these are wired we had somebody do their
exercise routine you know six different
exercises on dumbbells lots of reps and
the system could automatically figure
out which dimensions were relevant which
mentions weren't relevant and could
actually figure out to about seven
percent accuracy not only that there
were six exercises but each rep and the
place of each rep so we're going doing
unsupervised activity discovery here and
we're and we're comparing it using
actually rates for recognition systems
or comparable that's kind of shocking
this work is by David minun you can see
it at is week 2006 or I c dm7 currently
we have a new thing where we actually
did this on sign language we actually
have video of some by signing and it can
actually figure out the signs it was a
forward vocabulary 500 sentences
actually figures out the signs and it
also figures out a bit about the grammar
of American Sign Language well we want
next is dolphin speech so if anybody has
access to dolphin speech or humpback
whale song like massive data sets we
really want it it'd be really cool so
I'm looking for help there I don't have
much time so I'll go to what some of you
are probably waiting for which is
natural language communication through a
brain-computer interface I love saying
that because everybody knows anything
about brain computer interfaces or
brains in general go you're smoking
something okay that I'll bite how you
going to do it well let's first of all
talk a little bit about brain computer
interfaces they're really slow current
ones you sit there and thank one two
three four five six seven eight nine ten
or lalalalala to do a yes or no decision
and get about a bit every two seconds
the world's record for brain computer
interfaces is about a bit every second
it's actually 64 bits in 60 seconds if I
remember right it's using something
called SS vep now fortunately I have
another professor melding war Jackson
who was on the team that did the first
long-term brain computer interface
implant
and she and I were talking one day we're
like you know if you're trying to pick
up a language from the head it spread to
all out the brain it's hard to get
anything from it if you talk about the
word you know you she you know it's
going to all sorts of things over here
and you can't actually get anything out
of it very well however if I actually
think about what's going on the motor
cortex I actually have to move my lips
and my mouth and my voice box in my
tongue to form those syllables so if I
could actually read it off the motor
cortex I might be able to get a word or
phrase even my problem is that the
rapper ass for this part of your body is
so small the current brain scanners
can't get to it however with sign
language there's many many muscles
involved in the movement of the hands
and the face and the tourists and all
that so actually spread out throughout
so the motor cortex so what we're
currently doing this is this is using a
visualization system called mir cro MRI
car on is just looking at the motor
cortex what we're doing is trying to see
if we can do paired choices first of all
something like bed versus chair well
it's really nice about this is that it's
one hand versus two hands and there's
already been evidence we have some data
right now which shows that you can
distinguish this from this actually some
some colleagues I've shown that you can
distinguish this from this but that's
really hard so this is so we're going to
try just with fMRI you know big magnets
so anybody has a big magnet at home we'd
be really interested I am the test
subject I will show up anywhere anytime
we're trying right now just buy some
time with a good technician we need
somebody's passionate about this willing
to work with us on trying to actually
get some good imaging but so here's bed
versus chair the idea here the idea
behind this set you know hot versus cold
I want I have pain I'm okay some people
who are locked in people who have ALS
Lou Gehrig's disease
they have no muscle control anymore they
don't way they communicate through brain
computer interfaces so that's what
melody more Jackson works on I of course
want to think it my wearable and we'll
get to that in a second you notice
however while this is a paired choice
all right they're also distinct from
each other there's six different signs
here if you look at them they all
distinct if we can get decent resolution
so we can go from one bit every second
to maybe you know multiple bits every
second here's the extreme version of it
this is phrases so f MRIs are relatively
slow they take scans every you know a
few seconds if we can actually watch the
evolution of a phrase in the brain we
might actually be able to recognize it
now here's the problem what's happening
with fMRI is measuring the blood going
into the blank rain after you think
about something blood rushes in to the
brain to reoxygenate it so used up the
energy in that section of the brain and
you're measuring that that blood flow it
also takes about two seconds to drain so
we're looking at sign language on the
brain it's gonna be like watching
somebody painting a picture with
disappearing ink if I can scatter the
right time if we can scatter repeatedly
we're hoping that we can actually see
this evolution of this watercolor before
it disappears and actually recognize
entire phrase at a time this is like
having your your phrase book when you go
to Mexico you know give your high school
Spanish but you're not very comfortable
with it and you have to always you know
try to read you know a phrase that says
how do I get to the bathroom or where do
I go for good hotel and that way you can
actually use a phrase by phrase to
translate to actually do translation
here we want to do say the top 500
phrases if we're all if we're that lucky
so that somebody who is who has no motor
control can actually communicate entire
phrases at a time the most common things
they need of course I want this on my
wearable computer and it turns out that
it's not quite as science fiction just
might first think if we works if it
works with fMRI which is a best spatial
resolution then we'll try it with EEG
and
near will jump a mobile interface and
then we're going to try to investigate
I'm you some tricks I'm hoping that
might work for long term semi invasive
interfaces so we're coming full circle
well I said the that the blackberry
helmet is probably a bad idea now I'm
coming back to it hey next time you see
me I'll be thinking at my wearable
computer okay thank you very much I
should say thanks to my sponsors as a
lot of them love industrial partners as
well who sometimes don't want to be
mentioned quick conclusion for you
mobile interface is no one problem is
going to happen it's going to change
everything we're going to create new
lifestyles much like the ipod did but
also i truly believe that there's gonna
be more money from the developing world
than there is in the first world because
of these developing because of these
mobile interfaces it's going to take
these economies in developing world from
you know Revolutionary War standards to
2000 and whoever can actually make
mobile interfaces that are part of that
economy who support that economy is
going to make Microsoft Intel and sunny
look small ok any questions
come on i just did something
inflammatory sure i got a cognitive
science this in here yeah mobile device
costs right now you're already five
hundred dollars batteries are about a
thousand for decent set the display
alone is 2,000 the computer is about
2,000 they have the twitter and fewer
things yeah i've had problems with our
side at pass back and sun my computer my
help is recognition that go to along 25
years ago i learned in atlanta a time
from Georgia Tech okay hungry strick
yeah so my name sign is this
yeah you don't you don't have much
choice the tradition no no think about
speech recognition about 20 years ago
and you got the right model we can do
tricks we've learned a lot from speech
recognition technology so we can do a
lot of tricks that use interface to
cover up the recognizers problems but
right now the real silence recognition
system we're working on something to
help deaf children learn sign it turns
out ninety-five percent of deaf children
born to hearing parents a lot of those
hearing parents will never learn learn
sign it's not well enough and so we're
trying to work on two problems one is
deaf children learning sign by playing
these video games in sign language using
the recognizer and then parents gang
sign lessons delivered to their mobile
phone this whole mobile learning things
going to really take off as robot yes
but who cares now let me tell you why I
say that so the kids we work with
oftentimes do not have any language by
time they hit kindergarten you have this
three years of critical language
development right and it turns out with
as a stylers at least last year that
shows that sign language or language is
why you get your short-term memory if I
say a phone number like 2 445 156 most
of you can repeat that back to me has
seven digits and most of you have a
short-term memory of seven plus or minus
two the kids I work with a short term
memory of two because they land was
never exercised in the brain to develop
the short-term memory and so we're
desperate desperate to get these kids as
much access to sign as possible so they
actually create those structures by the
time we get them people would argue was
too late but what we've seen is these
phenomenal improvements when they
actually use our game and we're hoping
it's 30 we're going to do some real some
serious studies this year but yeah the
silence recognition is good enough to do
things like games simple phrase level
you know foreign language travel books
that sort of thing
and also watching hands that stuff I'm
talking about using a computer vision
plus accelerometers on the wrist and I
can show you demos okay if you like we
get some pretty good recognition matter
of fact if you want to know about Josh
actually here did the sign language
recognition work he had a full word
vocabulary system working at nine eight
percent accuracy using just a camera and
a half hat I can't embarrass him by
showing the video of him doing it hey
any other questions how are we still
going to YouTube excellent we just
decided to go a cyborg cuz that's what
the press started calling us it's a
matter of what you um you know just
embrace it writes like embracing nerd
I'm afraid the sound I think the sound
on this is broken this is 1998 so I was
about ready to give up on the sign
language project what's doing is
actually saying I'll pretend the vision
computer I know why I lost the voice
track there we go so what you would be
hearing in the soundtrack refers working
as the computer saying this so that's
the hand over later yeah
so that's what the camera sees notice
this this is getting up and close and
personal with Josh's nose it actually
turns out that's pretty useful white
balance because you can a white bounced
you can actually search for the color
you need for finding the hands right he
know it's not moving in the frame right
she got this nice color calibration
right here why you in computer vision
you know that you know what value that
is that's what the computer is actually
seeing so you can see it's second second
order moment analysis and that's about
it from both hands we're getting ninety
percent accuracy on a on a Floyd work
with Cavallari I had a postdoc actually
beat here rates by the way a little bit
so we've got a little bit more
sophisticated we have a method called
segmental II boosted hidden Markov
models actually does the whole boosting
thing in each state and actually
improves results considerably okay sorry
I always tell my students I always tell
my students that to be my grad student
you actually have to be willing to be
made a full level national TV okay it's
like words fans how you count there's
some could do it a daily some who had
used to do it like him and and dig dig
dig dig and some who actually do is par
there how they maintain their job
there's actually a guy who uses his
wearable computer to overcome dyslexia
so I can maintain his job as system
administrator I have another guy who I
know of in Atlanta he just is wearable
computer to overcome his a DD it turns
out that when you're taking notes on
conversations and you have this this
constant reminder of what you're
supposed to do it really focuses your
attention so this guy said this is the
way I maintain my job this thing keeps
me on track it works beautifully he's
highly effective the other question yeah
non graphical nodes
information displayed for mobile users
yes a matter of fact there's a whole
section of research that I didn't talk
about where we're looking at you know
comparing different displays just put
the screen see around here meal come up
we're comparing a electronic paper to
LCD to a voice system and it turns out
for certain things voice works a whole
lot better it's less distracting but
there's a another professor bunny a
Bruce Walker who is a who actually
specializes in making your cons and
voice menus and Bruce and used by
conducting microphones and that's his
whole research is actually doing good
sonification good good sound based
interfaces for mobile devices highly
recommend checking out his work anything
else ok do you get thrown out of big
chain stores that have their own staff
for gargoyles no last time I was in
Vegas I got into a hitting conversation
with the pit bosses they actually want
them but I didn't you know their mind me
cuz it was obviously I wasn't counting
oh forgot count cars and I do in my head
I'm not gonna do this thing I'd be way
too obvious do you guys know that the
actual the first wearable computer we
know of was made by claude shannon and
Ed Thorpe ed Thorpe was the guy who
wrote how to beat the dealer counting
cards blackjack Claude Chan's the guy
who gave you a baud rate right so
they're both statistical base guys back
in the 50s they decided to take on Vegas
using a wearable computer to predict
roulette everybody hears about you know
the UW demands these guys now 20 years
before them Claude Shannon Thorpe I had
a working system where they were winning
at Roulette in Vegas and they actually
if you actually look at the paper on
this published in nineteen sixty-nine it
has ed Thorpe and anonymous because
they're worried the mob was coming after
them all right ed Thorpe was used to
dealing with dealing with the people who
threw me out casinos Claude Shannon by
that time was a little bit more elderly
and did not want to be you know she
fighting off people with baseball bats
but yeah well it turns out that a lot of
people when they see it it's more as in
the bahnhofstrasse on Zurich not too
long ago I sing about park bench wearing
a paper when the bankers came by and
said where did you get that not what is
it what are you doing it was where did
you get that I said well I made it can i
buy it it's like do you know what this
is it's a yes computer display you're
writing a paper doing email or something
and like who are you so I'm a banker I
do in private banking it be love it be
lovely to have this thing and have all
my you know financial Council on my
client want talking to them said cool so
it's gone from you know this thing
people thought I'd had low vision to
somebody something where people just
assume that I'm doing the whole
blackberry thing so now it's don't have
problem with security at airports not a
problem security casino it's not a
problem in walmart haven't had a problem
in years any other questions
this technology business which
technology talking about well people
there's the company that makes these
displays is called micro optical in my
view and they're already doing it for
the mobile i par for the video ipods are
there in the 2i display right and i
think you can still buy what I displays
from them if you can't this IQ ax t +
light eye and quite a few other ones
Lewis I actually had an offer somebody
came up to me in 1995 and said I'll give
you two million dollars gonna be a
werewolf eating company I said no I
wanna finish my PhD I am NOT a
businessman I don't like being a
businessman I will tell you I work with
you on that point page business plan
I've done many times but I have not
found a partner yet who really wants to
do the business side and really make it
work the obvious thing to do back then
was the music players now that some
other obvious things to do it may not be
what I'm wearing actually if I was going
to it right now I do the bluetooth
headset and the watch it turns out the
watch would be the next big peripheral
for mobile phones just like a bluetooth
headset was there's a heck of a lot of
stuff you can do with a watch matter of
fact they'll probably come up here at
some point we're doing we're making our
own computer watches now we'll try and
put everything we do on the wearable
into a watch and that has a lot of
issues but it's kind of fun so he
interested talk to me effort
yeah you do any work with overlaying
information relevant to what you're
seeing you know for example I'll good
reality stuff yeah yeah here let me show
you oh this one's fun to let me show you
some old stuff on that so this is circa
night I just like I'll share this stuff
because this is this is old this is
circa nineteen ninety-six it was done
for Scientific American frontiers there
are tags in an environment nowadays
these things are common QR codes in
Japan and when you're far enough away
you can't read the bits so you just so
this is a hypertext link there to click
on you just step towards it well yeah it
was 95 of the first one I think this was
actually shot in 96 because that what
that's when Alan Otto is there
what did you come in nice i'll say okay
yeah this is this is going wirelessly
back to an SGI so this is a big head
side and and TV transmitters sticking
out your ears and you know we did every
trick in the book to make this work but
this is early very early computer vision
based augmented reality he do the whole
3d 3d alignment thing with it the early
sign language recognition work so the
idea here is that when we had people
visiting the lab we actually give them a
headset and just say go give yourself a
tour and that's why we designed this
thing and hopefully in a second see if
anybody gets the joke coming up here
come on so we showed you could do video
the idea was to make the world wide web
but in physical reality right so go from
world wide web being in a beige box to
world wide web being everywhere and this
way to the egress that was the PT Barnum
used that in his freak shows and
everybody thought the ground go see some
bird and what was was the exit the door
locked behind you and he had to pay your
admission fee again to get back in let
me show you something else just have
just have fun
so not all we do is have these lofty
goals sometimes we just do things just
for the heck of it this is a dance dance
revolution without a pad and on a mobile
phone we're lacing accelerometers into
your shoes these wireless accelerometers
we have and what's kind of cool if you
guys don't have on these 3d printers yet
I highly recommend getting one they're
really cool here's a you'll see in a
second we have these bluetooth
accelerometers William about five years
ago the current revision is like number
four number five currently you can get
down to about a centimeter by two
centimeters 3x accelerometers also have
to pass this on this case comes out of
the 3d printer like this it is so cool
you guys could give a CAD files they
print so I used that from making our
cell phone cases and that's so now
instead of stepping on spots on the pad
yes you kiss
normal haste is demo because every time
he doesn't he's exhausted try doing this
for four hours of helping house I was
doing this in Korea right of course I
suck at this but um you know although
the Korean teenagers came up it's a cool
and started playing it of course a
better than I was of course what's
happening here is as the arrows go to
the top you have to do the kick that's
corresponds to those arrows so we do a
lot of stuff on mobile phones to
experiment go beyond but we are hacking
as far as the stuff I wear okay I'm
sorry hey yeah
yeah I think
nope I gotta live though my life is that
I do if I here's another way to augment
reality this is a big wall it's a it's a
room one walls the screen the camera is
a top of the screen so it looks like
you're looking in a mirror but then it
renders these 3d animals in the room
with you you can actually play with them
doing gesture recognition is also you'll
notice doing the 3d clipping correctly
so the dog can walk behind you or in
front of you the dog actually is a sub
sumption architecture this of a paid
masses work the thing automatically
justice to the height and size of the
person playing here is playing with a
four-year-old I think she's actually
just threw the ball for the dog to fetch
this is 1995 I think and this was shown
to about 5,000 people at triple-a I and
Sid graph that sort of thing the dog has
its own brain subsumption architecture
actually sees out its own eyes it sees
the Greta 3d graphics as well as the
computer vision at the same level but
has its own brain it's as you figure
that once what's to do next and if it's
got to take a leak it's gotta take a
leak as it just showed
anything else folks
I have more augmented reality stuff I've
got how to hop the pool table I don't
have the pool table I do have a
perceptive workbench let's do that sorry
buddy talking about this multi touch
stuff right this kind of fun so this is
a multi Ted touch desktop but also
senses people's hands above it how this
works is there's an infrared spotlight
above the desk and it's projecting a
shadow of the hand down onto the desk
surface and that we can actually get 3d
pointing gestures around now please give
the video it's actually quite all this
is 1999 but this thing does something
that that no other system does I know of
besides getting the 3d hand tracking and
doing multi touch surface using
reflected infrared it can also do things
like reconstruct objects in 3d so you
put down the object on top of the desk
you it recognizes is there you push a
button and strobes a series of seven
infrared spotlights above you they cast
shadows some in different directions
they can use these casts shadows to
reconstruct the 3d shape of the object
the first one there again sorry this is
this is an older and calibrated system i
need to remix this tape but you can see
that even with this older system it can
actually reconstruct things like this
watering can just find the ideas you can
go between the virtual and the real
quickly one of the things it recognizes
different objects you can recognize
touch you can recognize the shape of the
object that's on the table so this is
the cursor object just a found block so
it's a fun block for the certain ratio
and you can use it to move things around
let's get forward a little bit
this is again just showing you how can
use it to resume of that sort of stuff
here's a fun one this is recognizing the
shape of these monsters in a game the
actual that's actually a mobile player
up here and these guys are fleeing
monsters Adam and what this guy sees
coming up here we're gonna say that my
students have to be able to be willing
to make fools of themselves in national
TV this guy is got a camera looking down
on his hands like a sign language thing
chemical Kings forward so can actually
do registration marks on the walls he's
seeing monsters flying at him as God do
bad kung fu moves to ward them off so
it's like yeah hi it's like hi-yah
hi-yah hi-yah and think bad kung fu
ghost movie and these things are coming
out at how many's guys do these things
and knowledge get got you the gestures
he's got to the hi-yah well it doesn't
work hey this is the first project into
down Georgia Tech it was fun so um the
people are interested afterwards I can
talk about how you reconstruct cities
and 3d using gps's on mobile phones
automatically using crowdsourcing I
talked about the Georgia Tech gesture
toolkit or talk to mobile dance
revolution how you do wrist watch stuff
just about everything in the mobile
interface space we've played with things
I'm most interested in right now is GPS
tomography it turns out that GPS is can
actually see through buildings a little
bit I can use that to reconstruct ya
hear this hold this so as your GPS as
you move around your GPS it knows where
the satellites are as the satellites get
obstructed you know where different
planes are you actually connect those
planes together to actually do a 3d
skinning of the of the building if you
have lots of people doing this like
anybody has a GPS cell phone or GPS on
the car suddenly you get you know a
constant Google Earth update this update
every day instead of every 27 years and
it's kind of fun oh this guy call too
yeah I should end now if you want to
talk to me we got lots more stuff to
back and show okay thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
