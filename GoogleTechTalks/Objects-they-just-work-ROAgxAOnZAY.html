well good morning everybody pets out is
industry actually so I love s'mores talk
face hi comment but steep job Steve Jobs
made a number of years ago his first
introducing next good nextstep operating
system and the sort of demo I did a lot
of work with an expert community and the
one of the tag lines of this temple was
well they're objects it just works this
actually happen a kind of a sort of in
jump next because with a lot of work
objects didn't work it wasn't quite as
easy as what I want to talk to you about
his kind of strategy I've been working
on for my last four or five years of
protesting mobile applications so that's
really just talks about and I do want to
thank them and Harry Robinson for the
invitation come here to do this I kind
of put this together just sort of at the
last minute
I hope this this talk works
so I want to talk a little bit about
motivation why we engaged in the
production of the mts regular it's
designed boil generally I'm talk about
the two test frameworks that you may or
may not be familiar with one of the TTC
n testing specification language that
has had a lot of influence on how to put
our test automation framework together
and then the extra testing frameworks
talk a little bit about mts object and
then a brief demo awesome so we're here
to solve what is sometimes called the
mobile testing nightmare actually loan
testing nightmare is a term coined by
the gartner group and the description is
basically in combinatorics ancestor
links and platforms software patents so
it means that there's lots and lots of
stuff that you have to test marketing a
guy after thinking about things for a
long time came up with this is kind of a
graphic to represent what that means
basically this is a situation with
mobile technology as you're probably
mostly where they were the high stakes
race to market the number of
configurations the test increases it
seems exponentially daily and it's our
contention that there are relatively
more testing it's necessarily more
competitive levels of quality of life
hawkman contestant is costing part way I
have five posters this is scary robot
first five ppl podium get a lot of run
another one i'll send you one to fridge
just background on this we started about
three years ago on a research project
funded by the US Department of Commerce
to produce an advance on a base level
testing assistance I think better than
sus automation business for a while
we're building it's basically the
dominant they've been 21st century
information technology and I think it's
time for a change when we do test
automation I think the level fertility
we accomplished with test automation
technologies today who's been adequate
for something but really there's room
for vast improvement and that human will
come I thank you Bob disgusting which is
mobile-centric and focused on a
maximization in London well then we
found out during this project when we
focus on kind of decisions of your
mobility how do we address the
particular issues and mobile
applications was that now the advanced
strategies were really not very useful
unless we had a platform the support so
we need something with cheap cheese and
an observation and control as well as
about a few trails so it's not just the
endpoints are interesting and lots of
phasic a pit in between this whole new
transaction propagates through our
network in vacuum and using
it's the be scalable robust distributed
and broadly using the spread works that
are not usable and that's sorta
mediately accessible to their users are
not going to get used this is the
architecture that we eventually all this
is a work product quite a bit of bacchus
information I want to just put this up
here to kind of show you them to serve
evolution following activities so the
idea is that you have a single point of
control and for many different test
agents the test agent in turn can
control many points of observation the
cloud lightning bolt of course of that
this weekend's weather forecasts
indicate that we're interested in
testing both the wired and wireless
communication channels the orange boxes
are basically interfaces on your test
blue box in the pointlessness and note
that the idea here is H one of these
platforms is an independent basically
might be addressing a the ends
of their tests in a mobile application
system the kind of broadly still kind of
system to wear a dress than and testing
and the anything including cell phones
PDAs desktops servers embedded
processors base stations network
equipment access points so there's quite
a wide range of things that you would
like to basically interact with to do
Indian testing mobile systems
so design goals for our or says water to
be able to generate test operates four
models we wanted to generate the bottles
from the implementation under test as
well as behavioral descriptions of the
usage of the system that's a longer
story in and of itself the epics I knew
why would want to do things that way
it's a summer different perspective on
how to be tested there's a necessity for
separation logical physical concerns to
achieve just one people kind of pockets
value is your family not another two
things have to be separated from these
left for physical concerns but do we
have to be platform-agnostic at the same
time platform will cost what that means
is that we need to separate the
interaction with a logical point of
control from its actual binding to that
the binding has to be able to be
variations and error exception
conditions same thing can be said for
channels wireworld are testing the
internet channels naturally its faculty
so reliable you can almost prevent them
disappear but in the mobile world of
course maybe use some I think appreciate
the data communication channels it's
quite a bit of variability one thing is
critical testing mobile apps of handheld
devices mobile devices are still very
resource constrained resource
utilization on these devices matters
need to achieve distributed patrol you
need to have the ability to knowledge is
drive one particular user interface
workstation you
dr motionless at the same time
throughout and usability is really
critical any system there are lots and
lots of systems both large and small
commercial research that ended up being
shop where because they're basically
somebody's a grand scheme that they
thought was really great but nobody else
me so we really are a lot of attention
what we're doing and trying to find
things work out a boxing great
experience the commuters and actually
we're trying to think of ways to present
testing systems to end users in a way
that basically changes the whole
experience through perspective on tustin
some very ambitious goals in terms of
how testing is going to be proceeding
looking for eventually a kind of
intuitive interaction the big Bugaboo of
course testing it sometimes it's not
maybe not to this audience it's dirty
little secret but is groans right the
fact that you can spend a lot of time
writing tests liberating tests but their
temper intend to break rather rapidly we
have to serve very short half-life maybe
k and then there's a probably do once
they're how good are you kicking off
it's not a discussion yesterday's talk
accompanies a very interesting addition
these are the things we wanted to
address is your kind of major problems
we saw in creating a test automation
framework to achieve
Oh
we'll talk a little bit about TTC entry
the stands for testing test control
notation is international organizations
in North America it doesn't get much
traction because manufacturers in the
telcos didn't have to pay attention to
it and found other ways of doing things
it is an abstract specification it is a
kind of structural structure and
procedural paradigm for the expression
of test cases it has proven support for
very complex because application history
and has had and has proven support for
concurrency so you can do very complex
test cases you can deal with situations
for our multiple things are going on at
the same time and how to express
stimulus and response expected receivers
as a better movie s1 data standard which
match the XML is useless extra and it is
routine use in very high reliability
locations for the most part in a telecom
but increasingly vintage like in a Wi-Fi
of goodies so it's not really an
application rated test for it but it's
one which is used a lot of
infrastructure stuff it's used to do
rigorous performance testing the
interesting about kinda bottom is that
basically the test suites are designed
so send through a collaborative process
within standards bodies or in New
sociation so you get one test week for
example which is defined for Bluetooth
that protocol and then the same test
suite is then parse about to the
participants and they all generate their
own implementation hub so you know one
common test which is protocol which is
main- lots of different things other
things are very interesting properties
it was basically achieved through a
separation of the sea
this is there an idea notionally call
the point of observation and control
basically abstract interface of
specification so it provides each user
of the test specification means to buy
their particular implementation there
are physical interface to an abstract so
there's both in the TTC on this idea of
a logical interface what that means is
that the st. estimates can be used on
many implementations I think about that
that's really very useful property we've
had a lot of discussions and customers
said you know it would be great if I can
take the same testing functional test
suite that runs on the Soviet falls upon
those on that woman's local dealers a
lot of people what to do that so this is
the power to step in that direction also
it's model-based testing it's one of the
first and I said probably most widely
used in a successful model disgusting to
grow their equal Regina generate TT CNN
test specifications from message
sequence charts and state machine plots
of understand the TTC however is not
execute so we have to go through a
compilation step which basically takes a
specification translates it into
something which is executed and then
usually the target output of that is the
source code C++ Java when have you wish
that needs to be compiled run
so we study this model pretty carefully
we thought there's a lot of things that
attracted by we also popular with some
things are missing I'll coming back just
here's the incremental testing framework
sure all you are familiar with this
interesting sunjai for one of the other
close to 100 implementations of this
patient pattern so your google diagram
basically the observation in this system
we have we have composable test objects
that's the key element this strategy so
that because we have a common interface
for test Proctor test object is
inherited bite estimated test case all
my test objects my texts tweets all
respondents a message this provides us
with composability so we can truly
create and we use test weeks turn around
you kind of compare these things side by
side the two things that really we say
complimentary so in terms of our design
goals and things we wanted to do
automate estaba generation cheap logical
physical separation have something which
is platform channel robust diagnostic as
well as achieving distributed control
ttc i model is actually quite good for
that I mean from a testing framework
basically those are things either didn't
do it was really not part of a problem a
part of their efficiency not something
that really addressed neither the really
simply concerned about minimization a
footprint on interface under tennis if
you look at the incremental testing
framework generally speaking works i'll
of oxygen yes TDC I'm no intuitive
interaction would say yes composable yes
literally max would do much I would send
in sort of dealing with the problem
Brewers discouraged Ikki CN would i
would say generically speaking more
because of the fact that can be
regenerated regeneration process usually
is it's not the sort of seamless you can
generate first pass then you have to
massage it so we saw the terms of our
design goals there was a lot of
complimentary kind of stuff so one
basically the idea is obvious all of us
that's kind of borrow from these two
emotional strategies book them together
again soon there are also some
limitations ttc n is not executable or
state compile so this introduces yet
another language and get another step
logical the physical implementations are
on the scope of this framework so in
other words of you as a user have a
particular binding to say some out of
all registered it turns out to be
it bit shifting serial interface that
provides me a message in industry you
have to providing that s in the library
gets built into your limitation it is
modular but it's not composed this is
basically because TT cm is kind of a
structured procedural current so it's
not composable sense of objects are
composing new criminal testing framework
is interesting test suite if I started
working with us for a while you know
Tina stood test suites are great I'd
like to do some more exotic things like
to sometimes run Testaments and/or an
upfront it turns out that most
implementations I'm sure there may be
exceptions to most implementations of
the incremental testing framework
ancestry is basically a static list of
other test objects you can easily
instructor most people around testing
frameworks say I want to run this one
this time but not always I want to do
this one x number of times and by the
way I want to determine which never
testily and runtime dynamic combined and
figure out which tests optical or grow
so the execution strategy of mostly
parental testing framework
implementations that I've seen is not
controlled proposal so we have objects
that's great there composable but we
serve ignore all the stuff we learned a
long time ago about the iteration
sequence and selection sort of the
fundamental principles of programming or
left out of the picture here is very
tight coupling with the interfaces
protect am assessing right these these
frameworks are designed for curry for
basically developer unit testing where
there's substance you know the
interfaces and that's it that's what you
care about right classroom they're gonna
directly so necessarily the coupling is
very tight
class interface changes your test after
change its brief in terms of resources
there really is no general and
incremental testing frameworks resource
utilization how much the processor and
memory and she used to run the tests
well to derive the application in fact
sir it just isn't that's really a
function the kinds of computing arteries
your language centric and developer
center so every one of these to assess
the frameworks is very much a tool which
is a creature of the language in which
in sports and the developers who are
thinking in terms of that well these
things don't really spend our particular
career on so some of these issues as we
had to do so here is a UML diagram that
kind of suggests broad brush the
strategy that we evolved to deal with
these issues the I guess I'm in summary
way in which we integrated some of the
logical to physical notions of ttc em
through the idea of adapters so that for
every interface under task we have an
adaptive which provides a generic set of
interfaces for particular kinds of
systems here or two just to indicate a
basically Microsoft Windows molding
platforms and web services on the other
side we have tough topic there is in our
strategy no test suite
multiples Trevor really I one patent uh
stop and I want to go through a
basically detailed discussion one is not
expect the ID a tourism yeah it's fairly
simple just automation strategy behind
the scenes however if there's a lot
going try to suggesting what's in those
things are the adapter is basically
provides the ability for built in
worldpost proxy connection management
logging exception this is where we
achieve a bust we don't want testing
we're running a test that touches
touches the battle different points of
operation control and one of them goes
down on us it's flaky we don't want the
entire test test objects are control
proposal so instead of 98 we have it
into the differentiation to us objects
in it just cases in test Suites we have
one idea called test object you're
composing the test obvious can run
themselves in some soldering
specification can't be bound runtime it
can be an instructor or can be produced
by function we've added into this into
the sort of standard three methods for
setup task and clean up we have added in
two additional for pre and post
conditions so precondition test often
require most conditions of object and
sure what these achieve for us the
ability to for example check to see some
necessary condition has occurred before
we run a test object it is not occurred
then we can either stick the execution
and test object or do other things so
this means that we can again forsake the
robustness avoid attempting to run a
test
otherwise cause any hair overfill same
thing with ensure its supposed to
mission so for example of the results in
particular test is expect to achieve a
certain result say something as
connection is established with databases
online something's been computed that
has occurred film in the system under
test or a chest the chest hair then we
can either skip or complete the test run
without water failure so it's useful to
know there are oftentimes distinctions
between conditions not be obtained in
the system of your chest especially
which is good when it's more than just a
couple of classes on your desktop and
it's lots and lots of other things out
the mobile space you like to be able to
have a higher you create control we put
into this also a so called the
data-driven testing the idea here is we
have so called data providers and the
data provider argument can be overloaded
to be literally the variable or function
but we can basically then stream down to
a interfaces on your test a logical man
without a bit worried about the action
that our face binding the particular
stream our framework uses TCL also known
as blue control language or tickle
object or any form of that called a
vertical for test object so this means
we can take any tickle expression or any
tickle package if you take a litter face
and integrate it into a test object so
I'm necessity we have then the ability
to talk to you very wide range of things
in software universe tickles kind of
badly de facto standard
ready large organizations where they're
literally millions upon millions of
wives a tickler used daily for test
automation process we outputted XML test
run log instead of logging are
generating a test block optic long as
personal using laughs in fact and this
framework of course can support lots of
different kinds of conceptualization so
we can be used for class development
testing works just fine for that we can
wrap the classes anytime one we can do
suggested yesterday talked about stories
the test objects are basically one size
fits all we will eventually be putting a
wrapper around this to help people
construct basically tell stories of that
generate test objects didn t want to do
a short demo now if I give me
that's what I'm going to do is to start
court system
test agent
it's not the way things working
so here is what is the addition of hue
pain silly things about this user
interface is another perhaps in some
ways way that typical sphs for a migrant
look so in fact here loaded up the test
object you hit the Run button sure
enough I get the green bar on the test
object Iran was too terribly complex
basically designed to pass something
it's a little bit different however our
Tuesday somewhat different one this is a
demonstrating a feature would call a
smartphone respond to the test object
does a couple first ball passes and so
check functions then those are some
things which are erroneous it basically
makes an ad call the framework and then
it finds a condition which is a test hey
so we get to shred on one single color
here we get basically colors and
indicate roughly roughly they indicate
the point in which need context a test
execution stream this particular
condition occurred because we can do
things because ur objects are composable
actually introduced the whole lot of
complexity I started to have an
appreciation for life the static
limitation test suites actually is
probably a good thing and simplified
main creation the incremental testing
frameworks considerably because once you
sort of about them to say well justice
we can now be anything I can have any
any kind of a sequential control event
that I want ah well so now I have to
provide a arbitrarily that be basically
and it's almost like creating a small
interpreter so you have to have the
ability to support runtime stack of
arbitrary death if you have something
that happens in the call trade you have
to be why that handle exceptions
see a lot of complexity is actually
caused by having composed patrol
composable societies was not true and it
turned out to create major headaches and
doing it as progress Lawrence and the
progress bar simple alright well it's
simple when you have a deterministic
number of things to do static list the
test objects to run that's deterministic
you can count them and say well if I've
done five out of 15 I'm percent done
it's easy but suppose you don't know how
many you're going to do you can do is
full of control composability man you
introduce necessarily non-deterministic
so turned out we couldn't compute the
simple thing of the premise mark these
so we have kind of a little bit of look
at that at the top of the execution kind
of later on progress relative to that
you have a feature here called the
one-click repeat spin up to a small
number give you some indication what
this is actually kind of adding a few
things like this so now if I run run
this the same test object you kind of
get this kind of scene that I have a
rough approximation of where within this
this test run this composite test amount
of work my failures there's and passes
have occurred so you get kind of a rough
indication of progress when you're
running a large complex testily we
thought that to be virgins
the other thing that's worth pointing
out is that the remote host this is an
interface the adapters the adapters are
going to the full discussion of this
book basically we can select a
particular longhouse and then the
adapter for is automatically found in
that test object and it does not become
you nominating adapted or some
limitations on that is flexibility of
being able to fly test objects to
different interfaces oh that's about
these kind of this particular home
Dunkin Donuts never seen the Steve Jobs
next step step dental finding outline it
runs for about 35 minutes and grainy
lousy video 15 years ago but it's
actually kind of a classic might find it
because it turns out that sometimes
recently discussed this blog and says
some kind of alternatively complimentary
and asking things about to get jobs
anyhow in this this devil is where we
make space the famous assertion through
their objects that just works anybody
heard develop the next step okay all
right there's a few of us green
interesting platform by the way most of
you are using Mac Mac os10 look inside
of that will find something called ms
object that's the next step flash one
it's still this the mobile testing
either poster move on and be happy to
give it to if you want i'll have enough
to send a email and you can send any
questions about this and pop in your
hand that's basically my story this
morning we have it
so I have a question
so so what platform do you currently
supporting right now windows holden web
services in terms of handsets and we've
also just recently started doing barcode
readers and lab districts so absolutely
specialized request is particularly
interesting about this particular system
is now we have a platform say R objects
they just work for us the adapters
basically instantiating new derived
object of need a free class working at
it's not trivial it's it's a fair amount
of work to get that minded right very
platform specific but once we have those
and now they plug in the rest of the
framework in the hell they just work who
food from missourah what kind of test in
space to you sensitive Oklahoma padfone
robot windows I saw what kinda it tested
to face what kind of expense to use into
the system that's it well it depends on
a particular system and elves were
testing now we send in basically
replicate all the key input events in
our prototype system we also have
basically control the entire ORF stack
we blew that a production system we also
basically provide a frame grab video
and you then mentioned that you would
think you could reuse the test cases on
across from windows mobile to kemah
symbian platform and what those have to
be rewritten obviously you can implement
the database that grabs the screen on
both but we think that it's possible to
do with limits with our current
implementation we have some plans to
further push the boundaries of the
logical physical abstraction layer to
achieve that goal and artisans
particular with graphic user interfaces
as you probably know this is a big
challenge well we know we've taken first
good step in solving
alright thanks very much Bob we have a
break
