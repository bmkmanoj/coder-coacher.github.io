that sleep was such a hot topic at
Google
I'm Peter Allen director of Google
University and delighted to welcome the
world's leading authority on sleep sleep
disorders and the dangers of sleep
deprivation William DeMint MD ph.d chief
of the newly created division of sleep
at Stanford University's School of
Medicine dr. Dement holds a BA from the
University of Washington an MD and PhD
in neuropsychology neural physiology
from the University of Chicago was
essentially the person who discovered
rapid eye movement or REM sleep so he
has been an authority in this field for
a long time
founder of the American Academy of Sleep
Medicine and 12 years for 12 years it's
president was chairman of the US
Congress's National Commission on Sleep
Disorders research 2001 received the
largest NIH research grant and sleep
medicine history for work on sleep apnea
is the author or co-author of over 500
scientific publications including
textbooks the sleep Watchers and the
promise of sleep he's also the professor
of what I understand is the most popular
course at Stanford a course on sleep
I've noted that Stanford focuses on
sleep Harvard its most popular courses
of course on happiness Wharton's most
popular courses of course on negotiation
and I don't know what that tells us but
certainly this is one of the most
popular lectures we've sponsored
recently dr. Dement will be talking
about essentially healthy sleep and
something that we care a lot about
optimal performance
knowing that healthy sleep is by far the
most powerful determinant of high-level
performance and productivity three major
characteristics are a sufficient amount
and continuity of sleep and I can hear
you all thinking all right so I get
enough sleep probably not is it
continuous maybe not absence or near
absence of pathological sleep related
events and reasonable synchronizing of
desired time in bed with circadian
rhythm so if you're a Napper
you need to be paying attention to that
so without further ado thank you dr.
Dement we're excited to have you thank
you I'm going to start off with a video
clip show the clip magically Oh
I thought it just this is what shouldn't
happen when you drive
this is alive
well this man survived fortunately but
as mere fact when an accident occurs now
we can go on magically with the rest if
an accident occurs while you're driving
the chances that someone will die are
about 80 percent so if you feel your
eyelids getting heavy pull off the road
drowsiness is red alert is there anybody
in the audience who has heard me say
that before anybody here from from
Stanford anybody takes sleeping dreams
one person okay everybody else stayed
away anyway I think you're happy enough
actually Google is you know has a
reputation of being the happiest
workplace on the planet I am not at my
best today did I already say that I am
coming off a fairly severe cold but I
don't think I'm contagious so the
triumvirate of Health for you know if
you don't have cancer or something that
is is and you do it here
nutrition physical fitness now hopefully
you'll add normal healthy sleep and I'm
sure that for the most part your sleep
is healthy but you need to know a little
bit more about it now I I think that for
many people sleep is like a drive you
know a hunger drive a thirst drive and
here we see sleep and hunger competing
and we'll see we'll see which drive wins
out finally
not sleep sleep one finally he was
carried off to beds my grand said my
middle grandson who's who's this tall
now so we were saying though for for
productivity you know you four healthy
young adults I would say certainly
getting enough sleep is the most
important thing on a daily day-to-day
basis obviously if you're totally unfit
or your nutrition is extremely poor that
would affect productivity but in the
sort of day-to-day scheme of things
normal adequate sleep fosters high
productivity
now that means and we'll go through this
you have a low sleep debt I don't know
how many nope
know about sleep debt no pathological
events that would be like your breathing
stops when you fall asleep and that your
biological clock which alerts the brain
for long periods of time during certain
parts of the day that that that alerting
pretty much coincides with your waking
hours so we're going to go over the
nature of sleep I don't think I'll talk
very much about dreaming but dreaming
occurs during rapid eye movement sleep
and all during rapid I'm moon sleep and
the concept of sleep debt why you can't
fall asleep sometimes it when you want
to go to bed early why some people feel
tired all the time you don't know why I
mean I've heard that I like to say
thousands of times
tired all the time and I don't know why
well for healthy young adults there's
only one cause and and that is sleep
debt and then I've already said
drowsiness is red alert so my path
through my career I started by chance
went to the University of Chicago where
the only man on the planet who was
studying sleep was in the department of
physiology
and I was recruited to actually went to
New York for a few years but I was
recruited to Stanford and in in a
dormitory in the Wilbur Hall complex set
up set up a sleep laboratory I gave my
first lectures on sleep at Stanford from
them in the Memorial Church and I felt
blasphemous I remember I I anyway this
is my mentor at the University of
Chicago this is from Life magazine in
1959 when the public first public
article on the sleep all night sleep
cycle was published it has a Freudian
vent but remember that's back in the 50s
this is a sad row house in Wilbur Hall
we actually had a wedding in the
dormitory it turns out it was a fake
wedding but the the Provos happened to
be a guest that night and he was really
really worried that I hadn't gotten
consent of the parents for these two
kids to get married the young woman on
the your left is now just retiring from
the board of trustees at Stanford Joyce
Simmons and there they are eating their
wedding cake and so and then we had this
is our sleep laboratory in Wilbur Hall
in the basement those basement rooms are
gone I know what the hell they did it
filled them in with concrete or
something
and here are some students back then
it's just don't exactly dress that way
anymore and this is of course you reckon
those of you went to Stanford or that
that one person will recognize this that
as a Memorial Church this is me giving
my lecture from the pulpit as I said I
felt so uncomfortable there that I only
did it once
then I went down steps in and we finally
knew enough about sleepers orders to
offer a continuing medical education
course so I say in a way that was the
birth day of sleep medicine with
narcolepsy sleep apnea insomnia
disorders etc so what is sleep now I
mean
with people who think they know exactly
what sleep is raise their hand so what
what does that mean she went like this
ah no it's a it could be very precisely
defined and at the moment sleep is a
period of sensory isolation in other
words at the moment of sleep the sensory
input from the environment is blocked
from your consciousness and you can sort
of you can be awakened but you know if
some of them were whispering your name
you wouldn't you wouldn't hear it unless
you woke up and so here's the moment of
sleep on the left is alpha rhythm of
wakefulness and at that at the arrow
that would be the point at which you
suddenly wouldn't hear anything wouldn't
see anything if your eyelids were taped
open you wouldn't see anything now this
is a wonderful experiment I was
conceived by Christian Gillman Oh whose
long name appears there but that's a
50,000 Lux strobe light that flashes
about every 10 seconds at random the
brainwaves are being recorded in the
subject is when the light flashes which
is like the gurney Wiggles it's so
bright he's supposed to press a micro
switch and this this is how we learned
this shutdown of sensory input is there
he'd be pushing and then the light would
flash and nothing happened he said why
don't you remember his eyelids are taped
open so we said why don't you push the
micro switch well the light didn't flash
single everybody in the room saw it
flash so that that is in fact the moment
of sleep and here's an example where you
see the stimulus and at this point
there's a little micro sleep and the
subject doesn't see the light flash so
that that's what sleep is now it's in
experimental animals been shown that the
transmission of sensory input all your
sensory input goes to a structure called
the thalamus in the brain and it's it
apparently is blocked at that level
because you can see what's called the
postsynaptic
shall in this example disappears when
sleep actually occurs so every one of us
has two entirely different kinds of
sleep you probably know this REM sleep
or dreaming sleep and non-rem sleep REM
sleep is interesting in that you're
completely paralyzed now to show this
was a this was a test we have not
penetrated the educational system you
know it's sort of like sleep came along
after we had reached a limit of
curriculum time and everything else in
fact I went through a big battle at
Stanford Medical School trying to get a
little bit of education about sleep as
we finally got one hour out of whatever
it is 400 anyway in 2005 I sent some
teaching assistants in to San Francisco
to just stop people and say do you know
what REM stands for and not a single
person answered rapid eye movement sleep
and and no they were all familiar with
REM the band which by the way played a
concert last summer which we attended
and I couldn't I wanted to go backstage
and have them sign my book but they
wouldn't let me go backstage I almost
got arrested so here they are the young
REM and the more more mature REM and
then of course this has been applied to
other things toys liquor now these are
the rapid eye movements and I show this
this was a monkey who slept with his
eyelids half open it's just a human's
human rapid eye ones are exactly the
same binocularly synchronous and you do
this two hours every single night
looking at we assume I mean a simple way
to say it as you're looking at the dream
so you say what is this monkey dreaming
about bananas everywhere
and I said during REM sleep the body is
completely paralyzed and there's an
illness called narcolepsy in which the
victims have attacks of REM sleep and
the manifestation is to become paralyzed
and this is a narcoleptic patient and
the excitement actually brings these two
attack precipitates the attacks so he
was playing baseball and he got a little
excited and then became completely
paralyzed we have discovered this in
dogs and in fact we were able to develop
a heritable colony this was the very
first narcoleptic dog that she couldn't
we thought she'd starved to death
because every time she'd approach the
the joy of eating would precipitate
these attacks in the dogs
I'd like to tell a story that I've been
very politically active
you know advocating more education about
sleeping sore and so on but this first
dog that we couldn't eat in the bowl was
we had shown a movie of a human being
having a cataplectic attack and someone
said well I know a person who has a dog
that does that and it was in Saskatoon
Saskatchewan and I the owners were
willing to let me have the dog and have
it shipped to Stanford but it would have
had to been back then Western Airlines
in the the whoever I was dealing with
said no sick dogs on airplanes I said
well no no the dog has narcolepsy it's
not contagious it says no sick dogs on
airplanes and I just couldn't get by
this idiot so I'm thinking I'm we won't
be able to and then this light bulb went
off call your Congressman and I did his
name was Pete McCloskey back then by the
way he ran against Richard Nixon in the
Republican primary in New Hampshire
that's how far back I go and by George
fifty minutes later my phone rang this
is the president of Western Airlines I'd
like to help you in any way I can so I
said congressional people have a little
bit of clout so the dog was shipped to
Stanford and we finally were able to get
it ate a full colony and then develop
hereditary a trade of narcolepsy another
this just shows the reason your
paralyzes these are inhibitory neurons
in the spinal cord get activated all at
the same time in this illness and then
it just paralyzed alpha motor neurons
are inhibited met that means you are in
fact paralyzed and this is just to make
the point that we have actually cloned
the narcolepsy gene in dogs that was
done by my colleague
yo it coded for a receptor in the brain
that was defective that has to do with
alerting and then lo and behold the same
compound is absent in the spinal fluid
of human narcoleptic so fairly quickly
we learned what the causes in the cells
that utilizes compound as a
neurotransmitter are absent in the brain
of these patients and that's we don't
actually it's brain Bank material that
you're looking at although some
narcoleptics have volunteered their
brains you know say the first time that
ever happened one of my I guess officers
is well where are we gonna put the brain
oh I should just put it in the file
cabinet but we they're actually brain
Bank materials and liquid nitrogen
etcetera this is what all night's sleep
looks like this is your sleep the blue
horizontal bars are the periods of REM
sleep REM sleep never occurs usually
doesn't occur first and the grandparents
get longer the later in the night they
appear so in the first six hours of your
sleep you have about a hundred minutes
in the dreamworld now I'd like to say
the dreamworld is as real as the real
world that is a sensory apparatus is
fully functioning though the only
difference is you're looking at the
dreamworld through the frosted glass of
memory your memory of the dream is not
like well actually memory of of your
waking activities isn't all that great
but it's better than memory of the dream
activity certainly now what you must
understand and as Googlers the right
term I wasn't I wasn't too sure about
that sleep dad is maybe the most
important and I'll go into that first
and it's all lost sleep accumulates as a
debt and we measure or infer the size of
the sleep debt by the speed with which
you can fall asleep so if someone just
to come up here lie down on the floor
and fall asleep at me
we'd know that they had a pretty big
sleep death if it took 20 minutes or and
didn't occur it I mean I suppose being
in front of an audience would have a
make you a little inhibited about
falling asleep but but the speed of
falling asleep is a very good indicator
of the size of the sleep debt and there
is a standard protocol that we use to
measure this and you you have four tests
of the speed of falling asleep in a
quiet dark place and this would be then
you can plot this what we call the
multiple sleep latency test profile now
these are not naps and the test is over
when you fall asleep so almost at the
moment of sleep the test is terminated
you get out of bed do it again two hours
later and this is this is a very alert
person believe it or not even though
they can fall asleep every time during
the day because if you really have a big
sleep that your sleep latencies will be
down here falling asleep in a minute and
and it's related to total sleep time
this is a study done some years ago that
the obviously the less you sleep at
night the fact the more sleepy you are
in the daytime and this this was a study
for the one person who went to Stanford
in the lambda knew the lambda nu
fraternity house was converted into a
summer sleep laboratory it is now the
Jerry Garcia house and it went through
several name changes I understand as
well as rock stars came and went but we
we restricted sleep to five hours of
night and then measured the speed of
falling asleep in the day and showed
showed for the first time that sleep
loss was cumulative so they're losing
essentially three hours of sleep at
night and getting progressively more
sleepy in the daytime and if you go long
enough this is only seven nights you
sort of would bottom out and be
completely unable to stay awake in the
daytime almost no matter what although
you can keep people awake for very long
periods of time by pushing them around
or poking them or whatever
mmm the world record for staying awake
in a monitored situation is 11 days that
record is held by a now 50 almost 60
let's see 64 he's 60 years old a high
school student stayed awake for 11 days
in 1964 we were monitoring him no one
has done it longer since that time not
there's any reason anyone would and he
had visited a few years ago and was
asked this was for a television program
called Inside Edition which you'll see
some examples of later would you do this
again no way would I ever do this again
so he was miserable but he had a goal
and at the end there was a press
conference that was before TV or cable
so about 300 media people were standing
in front of his house he came out on the
porch and gave his final interview
before going to bed and they said Hajin
is name is Randy Gardner how'd you do it
Randy how'd you do it Randy oh it's just
mind over matter and then he went to bed
there's wisdom in there somewhere so
sleep dad is defined here the cumulative
daily hours of sleep less than the mean
daily amount and most people don't know
how much sleep they need exactly I mean
you know I I need if I don't get at
least five hours I can't function but it
could accumulate like 15 minutes a day
until you get you're tired and you don't
sort of know why and it can only be
reduced by getting extra sleep so this
is a diet a woman actually drew this on
a napkin for me and just did it and I
thought that's just so wonderful but
this is what happens it gets bigger and
bigger until you crash
here is we did this for Inside Edition
which was a television program the star
the show came out to Stanford and was
going to stay awake for three days
please read it
episode a crying it's like overwhelming
I'm just really tired of this she cried
for about ten minutes
for no reason and couldn't stop but I
won't I think interesting as it is it
gets a little boring after five or ten
minutes so I'm gonna go on to the next
one is a laughing jag I think I just
feel like this is just too weird but it
there's like this natural high or
something those are true it doesn't it
doesn't it feel like I don't know I just
I feels like I've taken some kind of I
don't know pill or something this made
me and I'm I'm very I'm unbalanced on my
feet yeah I know it's like you need
alcohol you just stay up for three
nights and you're four
and I kits that so bad I can't untyped
it's not right I haven't tried about two
hours and I can't get it done done so I
understand so you work you work for the
sleep doctor why it isn't why does this
happen and understand why am I getting
where I am why I don't understand that
or is this just part there's like being
punching or something from not enough
sleep do you know like this silverware
gets a lot cleaner too anyway and
interesting as that is it probably will
get a little boring
if I let it go on the young man was
undergoing this also was a an assistant
man he's now a veterinarian in Los
Angeles so you can go in the opposite
direction and sherry Maas with me today
my my assistants pass out the
questionnaire has been extending sleep
and what that means is most people care
are carrying a sleep debt so you can get
extra sleep if you have no sleep debt
you can only sleep your daily
requirement so what we have here is this
sleep latency measure that I Ellis
trated whoops and this is kind of normal
alertness but with the ten hours in bed
for a few nights
the the multiple sleep latency test goes
up so that either you can't fall asleep
the test is only allowed to go on for 20
minutes otherwise you'd be
lying in bed all day long and if you
don't fall asleep in 20 minutes you get
out of bed but that means you're very
very alert and so after sleep extension
we approach the 20 20 minute limit with
many people and this was a study done by
the Army actually and he took what they
thought were completely normal young
adults and had baseline sleep eight
hours in bed and then they put them to
bed for 14 hours every single night for
five weeks you ought to stay in bed in
the dark and I don't think anybody in
this room who's ever done anything like
that but it's it's incredibly boring and
there's nothing to do but sleep so what
they found was the sleep time went up
very to a very high level almost to the
entire 14 hours but then as the sleep
debt was paid back this this came down
to a an equilibrium and it turned out to
be 8 hours and 15 minutes which you
might say that's the normal sleep quota
for this group but it but I always I was
always asking the experimenter because
it wasn't me what how did they tolerate
lying awake in bed in the dark with
nothing to do for 5 hours and 45 minutes
every night for the last three weeks
well they were paid and they were in the
military so they were ordered to stay in
bed and this is just one of the subjects
the other thing though that was very
important was that after this sleep you
can think of the area under this curve
here as the sleep debt when it was paid
back even though it's boring they you
felt great you felt full of energy you
fell at the peak of your mental powers
and that that has been confirmed several
times since so that in the studies that
is being done now by sherry ma this is
studying athletic performance and the
major goal is to reduce the sleep debt
to zero by sleep extension and as
spending more time in bed and then
measurements our reaction time energy
fatigue athletic performance
so here's basketball and you can see
that the Sprint time is reduced
significantly by obtaining extra sleep
and I think the players are kind of
amazed by this because they they assume
this is my personal best I couldn't
possibly do better and then they do
better here are three-point shots that
improves and this in this case
free-throw percentage improves and then
fatigue ratings go practically there's
way down you know whatever when someone
says I'm fatigued sometimes you can
wonder what do they really mean you know
I feel tired I don't have motivation I'd
rather just sit that's kind of way I
feel right now but it is it's a virus in
my case here's the group changes in
these energy and fatigue ratings so
energy feeling of being energetic goes
way up and the feeling of fatigue goes
way down performance improved weight
training and conditioning increased
focus and concentration on court faster
recovery from fatigue potential decrease
in injuries decrease as I've already
said in fatigue ratings and increase in
energy ratings and improved performance
I mean that's it's really worth getting
a little extra sleep and I think we
expect Stanford to win a lot of
championships by getting a sleeping more
the the thing is that they also say well
the professors have to stop making us
write papers
so I said I don't have that much control
over the faculty whoops so the the
lesson is you sleep that is the culprit
for healthy young adults not being at
their peak and just remember you can pay
it back until you're wide awake alert
and energetic all day long and I see
some people who don't look that
energetic I'm like I haven't seen anyone
fall asleep though but I see someone
yawning young yes it was a fine yarn and
you have a gold filling in your left
molar there so these are the kinds of
things that people say for the first
time I stand for career I don't need a
line to wake me up I'm never drowsy in
my biology section I'm less cranky sleep
deprived people tend to be cranky and
irritable studying is better so just
remember if you're held if you don't
have a virus or an illness it's it's
sleep debt so can sleepy students learn
anything and I I think learning is very
impaired
here's
army troops listen to a speech by
President Bush it's like now he's not
very that exciting as a speaker frankly
I now another thing you need to know
about is what's called clock dependent
alerting there's a biological clock
which is a cluster of neurons at the
base of the brain and alerts the brain
for a long periods of time usually at
the same time every day and you need to
know what that period is and it is the
main kind of contributor for young
adults being unable to fall asleep at an
early bedtime so if you if you could
measure alertness you'll see usually for
young adults it's hard to get up in the
morning and you kind of struggle through
the morning and then sometime in the
afternoon you start to feel more alert
and most and certainly it's a
undergraduates at Stanford by far close
to 90% say my best time is in the
evening and then I have a little trouble
you know falling asleep at 2:00 a.m. the
actual mean bedtime for Stanford
undergraduates is 2:30 and some can't
fall asleep until 4:00 but that's
because this clock dependent alerting
keeps them awake and it's far the most
common cause of insomnia so so a student
says well I went to bed at 11:00 I
couldn't fall asleep until 2:00 that's
normal the only way you can fall asleep
is em you have to take your whole
biological rhythm and set it earlier and
it can be reset by bright light but when
it's when someone is say goes from being
a student where it doesn't matter so
much when you get up although I was
shocked and horrified
my grandson just told me he had an 8
o'clock class and I thought I had
succeeded in eliminating all eight
o'clock classes at Stanford and I really
did I mean I made made the effort at any
rate when it's persistent and you can't
deal with it by imposing a schedule for
a long period of time
it's called delayed sleep phase syndrome
and
it's normal in students but if it's if
you're now supposed to be at work at 8
o'clock in the morning and and be wide
awake and alert it's a problem so we
sort of discovered this and it was in
the lambda nu fraternity houses these
studies were done but we put students on
a 90 minute day where they had to go to
bed every 90 minutes for 30 minutes and
these the idea would be well if you've
mediately fell asleep and you slept for
the whole 30 minutes in a 24 hour day
you'd accumulate 8 hours of sleep but
nobody could do that this is actually
what happened and these are five
consecutive days there are periods of
time and this is inside you you know you
didn't know what time it was there are
periods of time when even though they
were getting tremendously sleep-deprived
they couldn't sleep at all like so sleep
whoops
the sleep latency is a full thirty
minutes then you have to get out of bed
and and so this is the the reason and
there's a but now I always like to say
and I'm gonna see what happens at the
biological clock in your head doesn't
look like that
see they chuckled anyway I was talking
to a group is be kind of like this group
and I said that and the previous time I
used it there's a huge belly laugh and
then in this time there was just silence
I said oh that's funny and when I when I
said the clock doesn't look like that I
got a big laugh and then finally a voice
shouts out where digital well now this
is a brain slice preparation from a
ground squirrel but this is about two
little tiny bilateral nuclei in the
brain at the base of the brain are where
the biological clock is housed it's
called the suprachiasmatic nuclei and
that has this incredible control over
every function in the body now if the
clock is destroyed this happens to be
squirrel monkeys this is
the daily temperature of rhythm so you
have one two three four five six seven
days here these are the sleep stages the
monkey is in complete constant
conditions just in a white box with food
and water ad-lib and goes to sleep once
every 24 hours and sleeps 4 in the case
of the monkey about 9 hours and then
wakes up and stays awake for 15 hours
when the biological clock is eliminated
then there's no longer this prolonged
period prolonged period of wakefulness
it just falls asleep wakes up falls
asleep wakes up falls and the
temperature rythm is also gone so it's
easy even if you don't have a clock you
can prod the monkey or the rat or
whatever it is in they can certainly be
kept awake now do we have are we the
same and the best evidence goes back to
this multiple sleep latency tests that I
already mentioned and what you see if
you do this continuously is the typical
subject usually an undergraduate will be
very sleepy falling asleep here in less
than 5 minutes in a strange situation
then suddenly with no sleep remember the
test is terminated the instant the
subject falls asleep with no sleep we
saw this amazing alertness recovery and
the first time this happened I just
couldn't believe it because I didn't
know about Clark dependent learning but
this has then been studied over and over
and over and in general there's this
alertness recovers in the evening
without sleep and that's that's from the
biological clock then it turns off later
and you can you're left alone with your
sleep dad you go to sleep almost
immediately so this is the definition of
Clark dependent alerting and here are
students at 4:00 in the afternoon and if
you don't do something they fall asleep
but in the evening or wide-awake party
time so the alert break so these are
commonplace mythology's a big lunch
makes me drowsy if you don't have a
sleep debt you don't get drowsy it's
possible to get too much sleep not true
there's no such thing as too much sleep
tiredness sleepiness goes away that's
the effect of clock dependent of
learning it doesn't go away when I go to
bed might someone talk to me before the
lecture their mind races at bedtime is
hard to fall asleep
that's because clock dependent learning
is is keeping your brain very active and
then the weird the one that I the
weirdest of all is students when I'm too
tired to sleep
you know they know if what happens at
3:00 a.m. oh well then I fall right to
sleep
I'm really why 20 minutes I'm gonna skip
this although we did do a study years
ago when we didn't understand things -
we had 40 volunteers from Sade row house
and they went to bed at 10 a.m. and
everybody had insomnia to bed at
midnight to bed at 2 p.m. now we started
later at night they go to bed the more
likely you are to fall asleep or am
nobody had insomnia this is my class at
Stanford and I asked students if they
felt drowsy in class you know the
eyelids get heavy to shout drowsiness is
red alert they were too shy so I said if
you feel drowsy hold up a red card gave
everybody a red card I was kind of
horrified we're all drowsy so now this
when you pay off your sleep debt as I've
already shown performance increases
alertness increases and here's the class
with when they've if I exhort them to
get all that extra sleep I'm going to
kind of skip ahead because I'm running
out of time the common sleep disorders
are obstructive sleep apnea
restless leg syndrome and various kinds
of insomnia and if you take a large
population about 95 percent will have
one of one of those three disorders or
all three and then other things like
narcolepsy are comparatively rare this
is the throat of someone who's who snore
snoring is the first sign of obstructive
sleep apnea this is what your throat
looks like with the fiber-optic scope
looking down well said it's you know I'd
like to say that timbered the frequency
is almost like a fingerprint well that's
the low rumble that was a nap apnea
means no no airflow a small airway is
the risk factor for snoring and then for
complete closure of the airway and the
serious illness known as sleep apnea
this is the treatment of sleep apnea
it's called continuous positive airway
pressure delivered through a mass that
fits over the nose and it just maintains
an air pressure that holds the airway
open and notice by the way that it's two
for the price of one let's just now
sleep very well now this this the next
this is a couple both of whom had sleep
apnea and typically victims of this
problem are often overweight and this
couple when we saw them in the clinic
they were overweight and and they
complained of snoring and because you
wake up to breathe hundreds of times
you're very very tired so they were
treated they actually sent me this
Christmas card but when they came for
their follow-up visit oh and yes I
forgot that
they they had become they'd lost their
libido because of the fatigue of this
illness so although we recommended
weight loss they didn't lose any weight
during their about three months of being
of having this treatment but they had a
tremendous increase in alertness and so
they when they came for their follow-up
business they said you know with these
hoses on our noses and we haven't lost
any weight we may look like elephants
but we're screwing like rabbits
they actually said this I'm not I'm not
making this up
I was shocked I tell you I immediately
ordered them out of my office
so tiredness and fatigue that that is
always in young healthy young adults
that sleep debt and this is what people
say frequently I find it almost every
law enforcement personnel have I'm tired
all the time and I don't know why well
because they're sleep-deprived they they
have weird hours now this was just a
demonstration of the lack of education
that that we do a questionnaire with the
Stanford students and essentially no
exposure in high school whatsoever and
this is you know about 6% have any
exposure so we had this reservoir but we
have encyclopedia of knowledge about
sleep but it isn't flowing to the public
that's what this this is intended to
depict I think that's a probably good
place to stop you now hopefully I would
be coming back a time or two and I think
that we would hope to have Google as a
place we have great nutrition great
physical fitness and wonderful healthy
sleep so if you want to ask questions I
certainly can do that
I used to be a fan of Mary Tyler Moore
most of you are too young to even
remember but she was very sick and she
she had this old dress that had a tear
in there or something supposed to go but
she just said I usually look so much
better than this and I I say I usually
perform a little better than I have
performed today I feel a to say that yes
I have a question about the sleep
paralysis sleep paralysis you pointed
out that in REM sleep the body is
paralyzed and also when you were talking
for working and okay and in and also in
narcolepsy the body is paralyzed is it
the same mechanism in the brain in
experimental animals the same cells of
the brain are firing and there's no
other X possible explanation it's it but
it's a non-reciprocal see when I you
know tense my biceps my triceps are
inhibited but that inhibition goes to
every single muscle it happens all at
once in cataplexy and in REM sleep and
so in that permits you to dream and your
brain does all the things that you're
doing in the dream but your body doesn't
move or you know there is an illness
where that inhibition actually fails and
when these people go into REM sleep they
jump out of bed they can run into the
wall it's a very serious illness and you
know but it can be treated in terms of
the actual hours that we sleep so we at
the mercy of the biological clock if if
I if we can't sleep until 4:00 then we
well snow you need to learn when your ma
you know that when usually people can
tell when clock dependent learning is at
its peak and you know there's no point
in trying to sleep
you just lie in bed or wide-awake and
the typical stories that I've heard
hundreds of times my mind is racing and
I can't fall asleep well what happens at
4:00 p.m. you fall asleep but you can
reset your clock bright light late in
the day will delay the clock bright
light early in the morning will advance
it Thanks so I know a person who wakes
up repeatedly at night to go to the
restroom and then drinks water and then
wakes up again to go to the restroom
again now I keep maintaining that this
is a bad idea because you know you
should get continuous sleep do you think
REM sleep is affected by this or what
are your thoughts on this drinking water
well and then waking up to go to the
restroom well and then yeah but REM
sleep both non REM sleep and REM sleep
or homeostatic processes and as they're
as they reduce the pressure or you might
say the tendency to occur increases gets
more powerful so it's harder and harder
to totally eliminate either state I
think if someone does something a bit
early night it probably you just haven't
established an equilibrium and it's okay
but you know you'd have to do it wake up
god I know a hundred times to really
eliminate REM sleep significantly okay
and the second question is really small
is how bad our alarm clocks should be
just throw them out if they don't go off
and you're supposed to be at work
they're bad but lots of people use the
alarm clock and in fact because we all
are dissent have some sleep deprivation
most people can't wake up when they want
to hop you'll say yeah I set my mental
mental alarm clock but but if there's
any danger of oversleeping it's better
to use an alarm clock now when students
lower their sleep debt to getting closer
to zero then they waken spontaneously in
the morning and more or less proper time
but alarm clocks are not bad
now people have their own favorite alarm
you know some of the people like music
some people like a loud noise the
typical ring etc and I think now the
technology would allow you to do almost
anything there's a one person who say
this woman would come into his room and
caress him awake well that's a little
expensive isn't it so when I was younger
I could handle many cups of coffee a day
and it didn't seem to have any problem
now pretty much I can't handle a full
cup of regular coffee at all without it
messing up getting to sleep that night
talk to us about caffeine well caffeine
it first of all it's the number it is
the number two most traded commodity on
the planet and widely widely used and
most people get tolerant that that if
you I'll never forget I as a sleep
researcher I drank a lot of coffee
because I had to stay up at night and
went on a vacation and didn't drink any
coffee for about six weeks and M I came
back I didn't think about I started to
drink the amount I was accustomed to
about went through the roof I was so
that you what happens is with age you
you become less tolerant and with use
you become tolerant and that there's no
question that changes with age you know
caffeine is in a lot of things and I
think I don't think you're compelled you
know like the coca-cola doesn't say so
much caffeine I don't think there are
books that will tell you but they don't
have to put it on the bottle what are
your thoughts knowledge and advice about
the drowsiness that can happen after you
eat a large meal after a large meal yeah
jaws enos after a large meal has nothing
to do with the food it is the
stimulation of hunger is eliminated and
it allows your sleep debt to
function more fully now there's a lot of
Mythology about what kinds of food make
you sleepy but when you test that we
have tested that the food doesn't make
you sleepy so so we did one study where
we had 40 different lunches and the
people would eat this there's no lunch
lettuce only mashed potatoes and gravy
spaghetti you name it and then we'd look
at sleepiness after during the afternoon
and there was no relation to the meal so
it's mainly time of day thank you no and
when we lower the sleep that people stop
getting sleepy after lunch right can you
say anything about polyphasic sleep or
either as the uberman sleep schedule
popular a couple years back among the
tech media or another community I don't
people I think it's terrible frankly I
don't I don't think anyone has ever
successfully done it anyone's ever
improved something with polyphasic sleep
on it and it's in highly inefficient you
know because let's say you guys sleep
every four hours it takes a certain
amount of time to fall asleep it's
better to have that waste that time only
once a day and six times a day or
something but I don't know of a single
monitored instance which where it's made
someone better in anyway time to go to
sleep I consider myself in the other
side of this damn if I don't have time
to take your course at Stanford where
can I learn more about actually a lot of
books on sleep now
they aren't widely circulated the
Stanford bookstore you can order you can
order my book and it's a pretty good
book I would say the promise of sleep it
was kind of funny how my to call it the
promise and the peril of sleep because
sleep disorders can kill you and I had
about a six month argument with the
Oh that'll give it a negative anyway
we're guys we're thinking about a second
edition but don't wait for it do you
have an opinion about young children and
making them get out of bed early or
should they just be allowed to making
them yeah well you know 6 a.m. 7 a.m. to
4:00 kind of program is that really good
if sort of left to their own devices the
main thing is in enforcing a bedtime you
because they don't want to go to bed
even if there's you know there's micah
member most recently my youngest
grandson sitting on a very good because
you'd better go to bed
no no i'm not i don't want to go down
that's maybe right so if you don't get
them to bed then you know they will lose
sleep so sleep need decrease with age
and then what i use as an anchor is at
the age of 10 you need 10 hours of sleep
you know that there are individual
differences and you know it kind of goes
down slowly to eight hours or even less
as you get older and it's a little more
like a six-year-old would need 12 hours
probably but they you can tell when a
child isn't getting enough sleep they
get irritable and cranky and they start
failing in school and now that i used to
think i don't have data anymore but it
was a lot of one of the big reasons
people got on two men amphetamine and
amphetamine because high school students
are very sleep-deprived that's a rule
yeah thank you
so did you do this oh I had to tell
story this is a very raunchy story I'm
sorry but I was giving a talk to to
Congress and Congress is like 90% male
and so my my Washington representative
says be sure when you talk about sleep
apnea to mention that it causes
impotence in addition to sleepiness and
heart disease and all the other bad
things maybe I better know
they're shaking their head no I'm just
kidding anyway so my assistant is in the
back of the audience that I completely
forgot to mention impotence and you know
that so use this signal there's this
signal there's this signal etc well he
was in the back doing this and you know
it's kind of what is what I'm trying to
talk what I finally got caught on well
that's not a very good note to end on
sleep is good</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
