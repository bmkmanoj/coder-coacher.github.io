Scott Smith
Scott grew up in boulder colorado an
intended medical school at the
University of Colorado he went to public
health school at Harvard University
University where an interest in tropical
public health was further developed
leading to a year-long adventure on a
Fulbright scholarship in cali colombia
seeking improved diagnostic technologies
to understand the epidemiology of
leishmaniasis and river blindness he
completed residency then a fellowship at
Stanford University in medicine then
infectious disease and geographic
medicine scott practices at Kaiser in
Redwood City California where he
oversees the travel medicine services
locally but also is developing
regionalisation of vaccine use and the
travel medical edison service for kaiser
northern california he co-chairs the
biennial national conference on
preparing international travelers he
teaches at Stanford Medical School in
the microbiology and immunology division
and directs a course for undergraduates
in human biology entitled parasites and
pestilence public health challenges he
was reached recently presented the
Bloomfield award for recognition of
excellence in the teaching of clinical
medicine at Stanford School of Medicine
and now I'd like to introduce dr. Scott
Smith thank you so this is great there's
a few people here feel like I'm talking
on c-span to an audience so I hope I can
make this relevant to you guys who have
sat down and answered questions I'm
going to just share what the travel
medicine clinic does I as matt said come
from redwood city and it's an
international Worldport we see a lot of
people immigrants and people in this
area of course it's one of the more
diverse areas in the petri dish we know
is the world people coming from all over
oh sorry lose the clicker so the
objective is really to define travel
medicine it's a specialty within
practice of medicine and also i just
want to show you illustrate some
diseases common diseases the travelers
get and so if you brought Ole Miss
diarrhea and skin infections and then
lastly I want to discuss the limitations
of mapping and show you a little bit
about maps and how we get the
information that we get and why we
believe in it and maybe we shouldn't so
Oh use a clicker so anyway the objective
here is to stay alive and you live only
once if you live right once is enough
and what this this discipline does is
try and apply the things that we know
the technologies we have the vaccines
the medicines to risks that you will
come into contact with when you're
traveling internationally so in fact
there's a travel medicine society and it
basically brings together these these
disciplines including preventive
medicine epidemiology public health and
and this this new relatively newer field
then addresses the issues that I'm going
to walk you through and illustrate with
some real cases that I've seen in
redwood city but just to give a sense if
you were traveling a hundred thousand
travelers go abroad for one month this
is what might happen in terms of their
medical issues and half of them it's
estimated will develop some sort of
health problem during the course their
trip many fewer eight thousand eight
percent will actually seek a physician's
help and five thousand will be confined
to bed so a bit more serious without
1100 will be incapacitated in their work
three hundred will have to be
hospitalized fifty will have been air
evacuated and one will die so how you
know preparing for this is important and
then what what are the things that cause
those outcomes well travelers diarrhea
by far and away is the the biggest one
and people are concerned respiratory
infections we vaccinate against flu
malaria 2% if you stay a month in
malaria Sarah's in Africa 2% will
potentially get or it's observed in West
Africa will get malaria and then some
other things as well so what we do in
the pre travel consultation is see where
you go what your risk is and what the
tools are that we have and using
constraint sort of analysis we decide
what would be best to immunize you again
scheme of prophylaxis and advise in
terms of your behavior so these are some
of the sources to prepare a traveler if
you just google travel you know medicine
try and figure out what you might need
in preparation for your trip to Zimbabwe
and I'm going to walk through that
example you will most likely come in
contact with the CDC website and i'm
going to show you the screenshots here
and then there are other proprietary
software is that you can actually buy
and many travel clinics use that are a
little bit more specific and then if
you're really an expert you can google
and use google earth to get very defined
risks for specific diseases and i'll
show you example of that so first one is
just the cdc you go to the cdc website
and you see this big map the world and
basically you can click on where you
might go so i just clicked on zimbabwe
and i'm going to sort of illustrate a
trip and what how to prepare to go to
zimbabwe first of all it gives general
information for travelers and you can
you can also then look up about the
political situation then what i want to
focus on is the medical interventions
are things that you might do in order to
get get vaccinated properly and so
there's a list and basically it's just a
list of things that you might vaccinate
against in the second other big
categories malaria
there are a number of options for for
malaria drugs it doesn't say which ones
to take or how or any of the details so
these proprietary software is that the
actual travel medicine people use
actually they do take information from
the CDC collates from wh 0 and other
sources but it puts it in an order that
helps a little bit better so you would
choose a destination here we are
Zimbabwe at the end of the list and then
it would give you a little bit more
specifically requirements and so always
the yellow fever because that's an
international law and a requirement will
come up and tell you if you need it and
a little bit about the the area this is
a map that it shows and this is the the
malaria area and it's not entirely
covered but the yellow represents where
the risk is for malaria and you can see
harare the capital where we were going
and this area is actually higher
elevation so there's no malaria risk and
that has to do with mosquito
distribution another this is a malaria
Atlas Project which is between oxford
and some people at Google is is a little
bit more detailed and has to do with the
species of malaria and a number of
environmental factors and how diseases
might move and this shows with dots by
years where cases have been reported in
this particular area so these these
sources are kind of used in order to
make recommendations pretty general and
so you see these political zones sort of
colored in based on pretty scanty data
and another source actually is just the
spectrum of disease reported in
travelers so if there this article last
january 2006 looked at 17,000 travelers
your
for a long period of time and mapped
where they went and which diseases or
syndromes they actually came back with
and that that kind of reporting through
geo Sentinel has been really helpful to
understand where we might focus
resources to assist people and what the
risks really are so they looked at these
17,000 ill return travelers and it turns
out that that is represents eight
percent remember I said eight thousand
of a hundred thousand so eight percent
of travelers to the developing world
require medical care during or after
travel so what I'm going to do just for
fun is show you some common things that
happen we observe in our travel clinic
and I took the top three on this list so
it's fever diarrhea and dermatological
orders and I see you're finished with
lunch so we can almost we can see some
gross picture oh maybe not so we'll
start off with systemic fever and again
this is the top of the list and there's
a short list of febrile illnesses that
could potentially be prevented with our
vaccines or what have you so here's
yellow fever in Africa look at this map
I mean it's yellow that means yellow
fever so if you look a little more
closely here's South America also yellow
fever if you look closely well and you
look at reported cases there were only
there's about one case to the unit in
return travel to the United States per
year for the last few years and those
actually most of them for diff I've died
and it's a very serious disease but
these maps are used not because of
necessarily risk to an individual that's
by the way a very small risk but it's a
big one because you die and the other
reason to look at these maps is because
there's political there's law and
political reason because if you travel
from Rio de Janeiro even though you're
not in an endemic area to in any other
country on the same trip they'll in
they'll require that you have yellow
fever in fact you know you carry around
a vaccine card and it's yellow you
anybody traveled abroad it's yellow and
that's because of yellow fever the wh 0
rules about it and this says all maps
are wrong but some are useful so there
are different ways you would use a map
and this is a sort of big picture
representation of how you would decide
about giving somebody vaccine so anyway
these are some of the systemic illnesses
that you could come up with in fact the
top list that i showed you to the people
traveling in developing countries and
this is why it's happening if man had
been meant to fly he would have been
created much narrower and with shorter
legs you know we're moving all over the
place and potentially carrying disease
from one endemic area to another zone
and if there are competent vectors then
that's that's a big issue this is a the
endemic countries and you can see it's
just at risk everything is red obviously
it doesn't take into account all of the
nuances and different kinds of malaria
it's just says malaria risk well there
are different kinds of malaria the kind
that kills you up top here falciparum is
very different than Plasmodium which is
the vast majority of malaria and if you
look at a more recent map I think three
years later it actually details looking
not so much at the geopolitical
boundaries all of Mexico is no longer
colored in but rather just the more at
risk because of distribution of vectors
and it sort of classifies by endemicity
so you can see right here is the the
most dangerous and it's actually got
falciparum this is a parasite malaria is
a parasite and here it is after a red
blood cell has been exploded and the
it's being released into the bloodstream
and malaria kills in that way by
destroying red cells and causing other
tissue damages as it replicates this is
a sick child in Zambia there was a big
spread about malaria National Geographic
very recently one of the interesting
things that they did is they represented
all of the people that died you
one day in Africa and here they are and
take a guess how many people are
standing here for this picture it's
supposed to be 3,000 so that's how many
people died a day in Africa from malaria
so it's a big deal it affects
disproportionately more kids young young
people but you know it's it's gotten a
lot of tension also because of global
warming and issues of changing
boundaries with it where were these
insect where the vectors can reside okay
so what do we do to prevent it and how
do you stop it well here we are trying
to figure that out and cloud of
mosquitoes surrounding us Smith wait a
minute you fool this isn't what I said
to bring so there are a number of things
that you can do steps on a personal
level to prevent it and that's what we
would advise in a travel clinic and here
we are my wife and i sitting in Ivory
Coast scared as heck what are we doing
so oh no bed net is one and DEET to the
skin is another and permethrin clothing
so you basically spray clothing so the
mosquitoes don't bother you with with
both in the bed net but also in the
clothing that you wear and then lastly
chemoprophylaxis which simply means you
take a drug every day if the mosquito
bites it will actually stop a parasite
from developing in your lung I mean in
your liver this mosquito is already
taken a blood meal too late and is
flying away to female Anopheles mosquito
and here's the provost is staring us
down about to potentially transmit
malaria so a lot of things there's a lot
of folklore also about how to how to
prevent that a lot of people recall in
their childhood I don't know using these
these citronella candles and such to to
avoid it this
another way don't use that doesn't sorry
this is the permethrin you actually
spray and treat your clothes and that
that works very effectively and it's
actually the same chemical marketed for
a whole bunch of different insect
prevention around here the
advertisements are with respect to Lyme
disease and ticks and so it says same
chemical but it does a very good job of
repelling the dangers so anyway to
summarize there's a bunch of personal
things I mentioned that you can do and
then chemical prophylaxis and there's a
list of medicines and you would have to
sort out which ones would be appropriate
based on both where you're going because
of sensitivities but what you can
tolerate as an individual based on your
medical history this is just
demonstrating bed nets and dipping and
how you have to do that it's kind of a
big deal because it takes an
intervention it's it's not a public
health level but rather an individual
level thing to make a difference supah
net this is a really great super super
net there are lots of public health
level strategies about controlling
malaria for example not taxing the Nets
that people have access to and
encouraging people to use them properly
and during the right time and
particularly those who are most
vulnerable like pregnant women and kids
under five years old so again treatment
of people is another strategy that
actually takes a lot more infrastructure
and is difficult mosquito abatement in
fact our CDC was established in the
1950s specifically with a program to
eradicate malaria and so they were
involved with draining marshes
controlled doing mosquito control using
DDT and so on and then other other
things tire campaigns to get rid of
breeding that's been an issue for
example with dengue in Cuba and then
vaccines are a big topic I don't know if
you saw the news last week the HIV
vaccine is big failure they're having
eating with Tony foul chiots vaccines
are very difficult also in malaria and
it has to do with the complexity of the
protein surfaces it's not a virus but
there it has a lot of different phases
as it migrates through your body and so
vaccines aren't always an easy thing to
to make work so anyway this is a list of
drugs and you can see with this map the
areas that are sensitive or not so for
example chloroquine sensitivity cleric
when the oldest drug for malaria works
very well in these zones and then it's
clerk and resistant in most of the rest
of the world so you have to use the
other three that I listed and then
there's an area here that there's a
great deal of resistance in the the Thai
borders and so doxycycline or other
things by views so mefloquine or lariam
and then atovaquone / guano which is
malarone and primaquine are some of the
choices in terms of chemoprophylaxis
this says are there any side effects to
these pills apart from bankruptcy
malarone is super expensive and
chloroquine is dirt cheap so that's
another issue to be considered when
you're preparing somebody so again if
you can give the cheap good one
chloroquine works that's fine but then
you have to think about those particular
areas so again constraint mapping
alright so now we're to the next topic
here diarrhea sorry I hope you finish
your lunch almost so remember on our
list of all of the return deal travelers
this is a big deal and there are things
that you can do to prevent diarrhea one
of them is a vaccine and that's a
vaccine against the bacterial caused a
pathogen called typhoid and salmonella
typhi so diagnosing it i'm not going to
go into i'm an infectious disease doctor
i saw the sign come check out our stool
samples i have a totally different
viewpoint than most other people so my
perception of the world is a bit
different but
diarrhea can be diagnosed with stool
samples and blood cultures as well if
it's severe in fact the typhoid that
kills is in the same areas that malaria
is and it's those are the two top two
things you would think of in a return
travel with a fever so that you won't
let them die and you treat them promptly
so there's a list of personal things
prevention and hygiene things that that
we traditionally tell people before they
go it's been quite clearly shown and
written about recently in the literature
that it's worthless in a lot of ways but
we still do it just because even though
there's not good evidence it's a
personal thing so I read the the medical
literature this is Cosmo actually the
editor of Cosmo called me up one summer
not too long ago and said dr. Smith
would you like to interview with Cosmo
and I said whoa Wow and I thought they
were gonna ask me about this number one
thing he craves in bed or something you
know cool but it turns out actually they
asked me can I catch anything from a
public toilet seat and can you talk to
us about diarrhea so you have to be
careful what you're known for and I hope
the so this is this is about so diarrhea
and issues of you know it happens
it's a it's an important thing to know
about this is this is a map of the world
with the fecal veneer meaning where the
most densely observed cases of typhoid
are and you can see by the coloration
here greater than 100 per hundred
thousand cases of typhoid mostly in
Southeast Asia India Pakistan and
Vietnam if you look at close up of one
of these countries in that you have
further definition the map you can see
that you know these areas are they're
very different even within the country
so again just to illustrate mapping is a
difficult thing and he who tends to
generalize generally lies and maps are
not
perfect so a list of things that you
could do to prevent diarrhea these are
strategies using antibiotics and you
could you could take these daily this is
not a usual way any moral that we used
to do this people got a little bit
careless at all oh i'm taking my
antibiotic i'm not going to get diarrhea
and they proceeded to take too much and
get diarrhea other strategies are if you
are ill or develop a fever and can't
seek therapy soon then you can take
antibiotic on the spot and then there's
a sort of list of things to look out for
and then take the medicine if it's
needed commonly we use ciprofloxacin and
people people actually can have shown
very clearly that there's a benefit in
their functional abilities while
traveling if they carry that with them
okay the last thing skin infection
that's the big category after diarrhea
of things that people return with after
they travel so travel clinic worries
this is about a woman who was traveling
here she is where did she go do you
think she's got a t-shirt here che
guevara she just got back from South
America she was checking out where Jays
fingers were buried in Bolivia anyway
she was more concerned at this moment
with her chin and what's on her chin and
here's a close-up and she was very
concerned about this thing that I
actually spent a year of my life
studying called leishmaniasis and it's a
skin disorder here sorry about your
lunches a skin disorder that can involve
the mucocutaneous membranes and it turns
out she didn't have that but rather it's
a common bacterial infection strep and
so we were able to deal with that no
problem but anyway skin is I'm scaly
skin infections are a big issue
especially in
sorry this this is leash mania which is
a non-healing skin lesion and often it
just persists on normal glabrous
surfaces skin but can involve mucous
membranes like I showed that terrible
picture but the more common things are
staph and strep and so she had strep so
this is another interesting case about a
guy he's a Googler who came to my clinic
and he had wiggling lumps under his skin
and what could this be he had just
returned from the forests of beliefs and
here he is smiling and he consented to
share his image and picture his arm here
has one of the lesions you can see a big
bump here and in fact his girlfriend as
well here we are looking at this it's a
little bit hard to appreciate but
there's a nodule under her scalp here
and a big lesion and she was also having
these funny sensations so I told her
that this was was possibly a me Isis or
a fly to put vaseline on it and then it
would suffocate and actually migrate
into the Vaseline she put a big old
stack of Vaseline on top of it indeed it
migrated in into the Vaseline came out
and then she mailed this to me in my
office and so I took a picture and I was
all proud of myself you know the
infectious disease doctor made a
diagnosis and a medical student came the
next day and I showed it to him and he
was like wow this is another patient
with the same disease and his migrated
out looked like that and I put it under
my microscope and I took a picture of it
and I said you know me Isis times 10 on
the microscope aren't I great and he
said dr. Smith that really sucks let me
just take that specimen down to Stanford
and so he took it down and took these
great electron scanning microscope
pictures of this terrible thing but this
is actually just a inch long larvae of a
fly that has a parasitic
interrelationship with mosquitoes and
number of different mammals and Central
America so you can see it's hard to get
out of the skin because until it's ready
to migrate out it's got all these spines
holding it in place but this is another
skin type infection with d dermot obeah
hominis and that's that's a botfly so
it's a parasite of many different
mammals endemic in Central and South
America and it feeds under the skin
comes out if you let it maybe 10 weeks
later so this is the sequence we
actually isolated what I just showed you
this third-stage larvae and that was the
story of his me Isis so let's see after
seeing all these things I don't want you
to be dissuaded anyway from traveling
traveling is a great thing don't let
worries kill you let the church help or
if you want you know come to the redwood
city travel clinic get some good advice
make sure that you're prepared you know
what to expect there are many things
actually you can do to prevent that for
example not letting a mosquito bite
could potentially prevent that the me
Isis so this is the summary best
prevention strategy don't get bit don't
get hit in fact I didn't go into this
but one of the major causes of fatality
in international travelers is not
wearing seatbelts and motor vehicle
accidents of course my focus is
infection so don't do it meaning
sexually transmitted diseases don't eat
 and I told you all about typhoid
which is a fecal transmitted so the quiz
is a best prevention strategy which do
you pick would you like to buy a vowel
anyway the answer is all of this stuff
and there are the messages a few things
that you can do so that you can have fun
on your travels so that's the end of the
travel section here and and what I hope
to
is actually well so you can see there
are a number of different syndromes I
just went over a couple of this the
common ones fever diarrhea and skin maps
are wrong there sometimes useful we use
a whole bunch of different ones to help
us give advice and I'm hoping if there's
interest that people would be helpful
and we can google eyes information
that's out there in sort of unbounded
ways to make better assessments and more
efficiently we talked about Kaiser
rising things information about medical
interventions and so on so that it makes
sense and is cost-effective and so on
well the same thing with mapping and
getting strategies together and
understanding constraints now that we
have an electronic medical record at
Kaiser can be done and so it would be
great I've been worrying about these
sorts of problems for a long time to to
make this possible with with computers
so if anybody wants to talk about this
more I be delighted to work on this i'm
at this email address and can be phoned
any time if you have a travel medicine
related concern don't hesitate to call
me and these are just a bunch of
references i wanted to show you one
movie i am german duchy all right we'll
skip the movie don't worry it's so
important to communicate but hey if
anybody has any questions or specific
things you're traveling off somewhere
far in your worried or you want to know
what vaccines and happy to try and
answer I'd love to hear about what you
guys are doing or what you worry about
too so anyway so currently there's no
single place you could go to find
information there is it's my travel did
there is a single place you could go and
that would be a travel clinic that has
somebody that's knowledgeable and you
know can look at these proprietary
software things and and study the maps
and kind of look at them and hobble
together the recommendations and that's
what we do so and actually in a travel
clinic and there are several they're
mapped out if you go to is TN org which
is the international travel society you
can find out where the nearest travel
clinic is and then go and they'll be
making those recommendations next to a
refrigerator full of vaccines and then
offer you what might be indicated so but
it's it's a personal study for your only
personal reasons I wish there were and
that would be the Google izing of this
knowledge the knowledge is there it's
unfortunately I think in three or four
probably more proprietary software
systems but remember they get that
information from public sources and this
group at Oxford that I mentioned is you
know putting that together I think with
maps that wh 0 has to make publicly
available and and then you know expert
opinion in that sort of thing so there's
lots of influences as well of course
from the manufacturers of the medicines
and vaccines and you know making good
judgments based on real risk is is the
challenge and that's what I would hope
to be able to do to overlay maps of the
risks of all the preventable diseases
and then put your personal electronic
medical record apply that to the
information in front of you based on
your destinations and then decide what
is it that we can do to minimize your
risk and optimize your happiness beyond
Disneyland so anyway any other
where are you going next let's take just
a few bucks he wouldn't give you one
that's mean what you know I scribe got
scratched on bush or something and if
you did no I'm sorry oh I went out for a
weekend and you know just got scratched
on bush or something in a few days later
my leg was long affected yeah of course
I was home to the doctor was the problem
yeah other times I go for a week what
happens if I got scratched on the first
day of that week then three or four days
later I'd have a problem and I'd be a
long way from a doctor treat ya well I
mean that's we do this all the time
expedition medicine often we make kits
and for people that are going in groups
like that and those issues always come
up there are antibiotics that would be
carried I mean I prepared some people
for a canoe trip in the middle of
nowhere in Canada and we put lots of
morphine and other things just in case
you know bones are broken and what have
you but yeah you can never really
prepare but there are some very basic
things and that's one of them that you
would include in a kit prescription
medicines we control drugs and those
things differently than most every other
country and that's a problem and that's
actually a benefit to and an example of
the problem would be in a third world
where country where you can get access
to any antibiotic because there's huge
resistance to tuberculosis because of
willy nilly use of the few drugs that we
have and that's beginning to be an issue
in some cases here with resistance but
yeah you can buy the right antibiotic in
every country south of here just over
the counter without a doctor anyway sir
system for better or worse so where are
you going next no Passport okay I'll be
there in June gonna go see the Olympics
for China apart from a hepatitis A that
would be the main vaccine preventable
thing that you would want if you're
traveling to China and most people
either if you're born there or you're a
certain age you may already have
immunity you might check a serology and
prevent going through the series of
hepatitis A vaccines and that's easier
to do than to vaccines so if you know
you're immune then you're done or if
you've had the two and that's it but
there's not malaria unless you go to the
south part of china yunnan and at
certain times of year and so on so yeah
china is always a big question a lot of
people go there for touristic reasons
and the whole country is colored in as
malaria but it's only because this one
little area down in the south part you
none has a little bit of vibe acts so
you have to look carefully where and
what you're doing when you prescribe so
