design engineer and former head of
procurement at Inmarsat responsible for
buying over a billion dollars worth of
satellites and launches he currently
specializes in the commercial space
business especially markets and
regulatory aspects of space tourism
Derrick directed the ascent study for
NASA forecasting requirements for the
next generation of space vehicles after
the shuffle and also the future on Zog
fees that market survey of millionaires
space travel intentions he's provided
testimony to the President's Commission
on the future of yearís aerospace
industry and it's an adjunct faculty
member for the International Space
University I'm delighted that he's here
today to share what he knows and what he
doesn't know about space tourism markets
well thank you all for coming I think
there's a lot more I don't know than I
do know so it's one the reasons for
coming to Google because you get a lot
more brains involved in solving some of
these problems and we'll move along a
lot faster because I think we've seen it
was stall a little bit on space tourism
I'm gonna start by talking about that
then I'm gonna move on to this last line
about point-to-point which is the latest
development in terms of space tourism
and I'll explain how little we know
about that so what's happening again I'm
gonna make the assumption that in Google
you all know what space tourism is
you've got spaceship one hanging up in
the lobby
I will ask was anybody here in Mohave in
2004 to see spaceship one go into space
nobody okay well I'm gonna talk that
first of all suborbital which is what
spaceship one was designed to do
suborbital a lot of the market research
was based on the assumption of $100,000
price naturally the first people to
provide this service are going to cream
the market and Virgin Galactic are
talking about two hundred thousand
dollars to just to get the ball rolling
and they have a big line of people
wanting to do it at that price this
particular slide just shows for
alternative ways of doing suborbital the
one on the top left is the Virgin
Galactic proposal spaceship two if you
like it's a it's an extended version of
the spaceship one you have in the lobby
again it is launched by being suspended
under a mother plane called white knight
two takes it up to 50,000 feet it's
released rocket kicks in and it goes
straight up into suborbital space the
one on the top right is the XCore
vehicle and that is a totally different
approach that starts off horizontally on
the ground with rocket motors the whole
way up it just goes straight up it can't
quite reach the hundred kilometer mark
but you'll still be able to see black
sky and it only carries one passenger so
you sit next to the pilot so it's the
nearest thing to being an astronaut you
can get and they're gonna charge a
hundred thousand dollars for that this
thing is being built in the hangar next
door to two spaceship two in Mojave and
bottom left is the rocket plane approach
again takes off horizontally but it
takes off using normal air aircraft
engines turbo turbo jet engines and only
when it gets high enough it switches to
a rocket motor and then shoots up into
suborbital space and the one bottom
right even a week ago I would have just
said this is armadillos approach but in
the last week another company Marston
has produced an almost identical vehicle
and the
this is just literally go straight up
and straight down
hopefully all under control so this is
the suborbital picture orbital we used
to think of this as a twenty million
dollar flight the Russians have learnt a
lot about capitalism and they keep
putting the price up that the last
tourist who did this paid thirty five
million and now the US government is
going to need a lot of these saw use and
the price the US government is 51
million per per tourist or government
astronaut who will fly in these so
that's the Soyuz top left that's the
workhorse for getting into orbit it's
been going for 40 years now we have some
alternatives coming along on the top
right is the SpaceX Elon Musk's company
are developing something called the
dragon and he intends to get that into
orbit and take maybe six tourists in
there that might be the first u.s.
orbital space tourism vehicle orbital is
developing something bottom left at the
moment it's purely for cargo but it will
get into orbit so it can deliver cargo
cargo to the space station
if they succeed in doing that there's
the thought is they may also convert to
taking passengers and the one on the
bottom right is a bit of a mystery it's
it's called Blue Origin and I'm never
quite sure included under suborbital or
orbital or something else because there
is that they have a very secretive
approach to what they're doing this is
the Beezus operation in Texas but that
thing you see there has flown and
hovered and translated and land and so
it's it it's it's gonna I'm not quite
sure where it's going to end up but
that's the that's roughly the
little picture and point a point is
addressing the the thing which about
getting to Australia essentially it
takes 90 minutes to orbit the Earth so
theoretically you could get to Australia
and 45 minutes so if you could get
something that just went into orbit or
almost into orbit and came down again
they would you could do it the kind of
vehicle they do this is called a
hypersonic vehicle and they don't exist
a lot of people are talking about them
company called Planet space has this
thing on the Left called silver dart and
there's a guy in in England developing
something called Skylon his company's
called reaction engines and also NASA is
doing some developmental work they have
a thing called the x51 but this is all
very long way into the future and from a
commercial and a market point of view I
said what is the price well it's unknown
so but I think point a point is much
nearer to orbital than suborbital so
it's going to be much nearer to you know
20 million dollars a flight than 200
thousand dollars of flight another thing
is part of this space tourism
development is the spaceports the
original space ports were Kennedy Space
Flight Center Vandenberg these leave a
military places and they were not
suitable for the developing industry of
space tourism where you need the public
to be able to come and go you know watch
an IMAX movie you know bring the family
have a hotel restaurant buy hamburgers
the whole deal and so the new kinds of
space ports are being developed to do
this top left is Mojave where spaceship
one and the XPrize took place top right
is the Oklahoma spaceport which in fact
is an old Strategic Air Command bomber
base has enormous blob runways superb
for this kind of test
first phase of space tourism as we're
rocket plane is based bottom right is
the proposed new spaceport America in
New Mexico it looks really beautiful
blends in so well to the surroundings
the only snag is what it really looks
like now is bottom left so that's that's
what it's at at the moment but they are
hoping and the Virgin Galactic intends
to start flying at Mojave top left and
when when the custom-built spaceport
spaceport america and New Mexico is
operational they will move to there so a
little thing about the trends we've got
some kind of a stall in happening in
space tourism right now
there was Burt Rutan was the the
magnificent designer of spaceship one
and many different kinds of aircraft
over the years and he had a he had some
a big medical the heart problem and that
kind of slowed things and they were they
had a big accident out in Mojave and and
it was an accident with in an area of
Technology where nobody thought there
was any risk it was the standard rocket
that they were planning to use and I
think that gave them cause to slow down
and think it through a little little so
that's part of the reason
meanwhile the at the FAA in DC the
regulatory people are coming along and
producing new rules and regulations
trying to not over regulate it because
after all this is like the Wright
brothers if the FAA was around when the
Wright brothers were trying to get going
you know we wouldn't be I couldn't have
flown over here yesterday on suborbital
what's happening is Virgin Galactic they
have built the new mother plane for
lifting spaceship to it is started
flying inside about five or six test
flights needs a lot more they are
building spaceship two
in the hangar at Mojave the XCore people
in the hangar next door or close to
having their links ready the my guess is
the first white knight to spaceship to
combo for commercial use will be about
2011 that will be what I think you'd
first start and exco links might fly
even a year before that as they say it's
only one passenger and it doesn't quite
get into guests about 60 kilometers
rather than 100 kilometers hundred
thousand dollars rocket plane again they
they stalled because of lack of
financing and it's hard to know really
what's happening there I think they're
just in a holding pattern and as I say
just last week Marston came up with the
new armadillo type approach on orbital
of course Soyuz continues to be
available the Russians will sell them
here at 51 million or 60 million or
whatever people will pay but of course
it's needed actually for the
international space station and it's
needed by the US there's going to be
five years when the shuttle stops flying
when we cannot get our astronauts into
space without paying the Russians to do
it for us that's the situation and so
it's only when there's a spare seat that
the tourists get the opportunity to
spend their money there's a thing called
the cots program that NASA's Johnson
Space Flight Center has put in place
which is the the basis for the Ellen
Musk's operations he's been funded by
this this program and it's a very good
program and I think it's gonna lead to
the first us-based orbital tourism
operation he's building something called
Falcon 9 we should keep looking in the
press for that this year he'll be
launching it if successful it's gonna be
a massive step forward for
the non-governmental space flight
business and Beezus all we know about
his thing is that he calls it the new
Shepherd so he he understands that in a
sense he's repeating what Alan Shepard
did at the very beginning of the space
for him that's what all suborbital space
tourists are doing they're repeating
what Alan Shepard did Alan Shepard did
it and he had the whole Pacific Fleet of
the US Navy there to find him afterwards
this new space tourism approach you just
take off and the land at your same
airport now point the point is the
latest area there's a couple of things
happening that there's as a guy in
Virginia invented something called the V
Prize which is the Virginia prize and
he's trying to put together the rules a
bit like you know the Google Lunar or
the XPrize and he his idea is he wants a
prize for the first point upon vehicle
leaving from Virginia spaceport which is
critical to it and landing somewhere in
Europe again don't hold your breath but
that's that's but if you hear the V
Prize that what that's what that is
about there's a group called the fast
forward group which I'll tell you about
in a minute I'm a member of it and we're
just doing some of the very basic
thinking about point-to-point NASA is
doing some work on the x51
and ISA has a last funded the Skylon
approach to the tune of 1 million
dollars or Euros ok now let's talk in
generic terms about all markets what do
we need to know this is a market which
doesn't exist so how do we know how big
it is how big it could be well basically
all markets you approach the same way
you have to figure out what is the
maximum size that could be if say price
was no objective so you can you can go
out and ask people you know price wasn't
an object that would you do this and
then you need to know about price
elasticity of demand and
and price starts coming in and you
really hacks away into what what people
are really capable of doing then you
have to figure out the shape of the
s-curve which starts from zero has to
reach this eventual point where the
market is and the shape depends upon how
many suppliers are out there at what
price they're offering the service and
of course how many providers also
affects your own market share I'm going
to talk about two slides about the
future on zombie survey this this is
partly because I I was responsible for
doing it it's also because it's the only
survey out there even though it's now 7
years old that really looked into the
markets for space tourism in a in a way
that is statistically valid so I want to
spend just a few minutes explaining why
that that is first of all it's us only
we didn't have the money to to look at
the rest of the world but it was widely
sampled across the u.s. it was done
through telephone calls in days when
when fix call phones were the way of
doing things and it took 62,000 attempts
to get the 450 millionaires that we were
trying to contact so this was a survey
of millionaires we it cost about
$150,000 which is why it hasn't been
repeated yet but I wish someone would
repeat it because everybody's using this
for their business plan and I kind of
feel responsible I'd like someone else
to verify it because this if you think
about in 2002 the XPrize hadn't happened
there was no spaceship 1 nobody knew
what we were talking about it and we had
to we tried very hard to explain what
space tourism would be but I'd rather
like someone to do this exercise again
today when people are much more familiar
with what it is
we gave realistic mission descriptions
in fact we had a guy at future on who
was an ex NASA astronaut he was he was a
commander of
commander and I got him to read all our
language we were using in the
questionnaires and the surveys to make
sure it was realistic and in fact we
asked the same questions many times we
we asked that with just all a positive
description of how beautiful and
wonderful it's going to be and then we
said or by the way do you realize you
might end up with backache and you'll be
sick and all these kind of things and we
got a different set of answers then and
it's that it's the second set we use in
our forecasting and then we also asked
lots of background questions to validity
validate and relate the answers to past
behaviors there's no good people saying
sure I'll do that and then you say well
you know okay you're a millionaire
what's the most money you've spent in
the last 20 years on anything and they
say you know I don't what'd you find
about millionaires is they don't they
don't go out lashing out money that's
why they millionaires now this gracious
told me these slides will be available
for you all after so not to worry about
all the detail in here but I just pick a
few points so this was the main findings
from the future and Zogby survey the we
assumed $100,000 ticket price and twelve
percent of the respondents at that price
when fully informed that means when
they've been told about the back egg and
all that sort of thing said they are
likely to try and do this at the prices
we the calculation comes out at fifteen
thousand a year people willing to do
suborbital space tourism with with the
assumptions were used in this survey and
just to make the point clear although we
were interviewing millionaires we we
didn't have a very good cross-section of
millionaires that we did in developing
the forecasts we assumed that only
people in the pool with more than seven
million were part of the pool that could
be used in other words that
they were to spend $100,000 it will be
less than one and a half percent of the
net worth that was an important sort of
conservative assumption we used on the
orbital thing because future on Zogby
looked at suborbital and orbital we
assumed the twenty million price and we
got a seven percent response there again
we asked them what what would you do if
you had a spare twenty million and they
said you know well we'd invest it you
know serve them right say I I don't know
what they would do now but that's what
that's what they said then and we came
up with 50 a year market size with with
these these kind of prices and for that
one for orbital we assumed that only
people were in the pool who had more
than 200 million dollars of net worth we
did this because we there was one
tourist at the time and it was Tito and
he had spent ten percent of his net
worth so like any good
market researcher you know one data
point is good enough for me so so we use
the 10 percent figure for that there's
also other stuff in there and again on
my website
the spaceport associates.com there's all
these full documents are available for
download if you want I also did another
survey later when it didn't have the
funding to do a full statistically valid
one and I I call this one the
adventurers survey because it is not
statistically representative this was
deliberately I got these people from the
website of incredible adventures so this
is a company that offers people you know
go diving with the sharks of Bermuda and
all this kind of thing so these people
are risk is not a problem for them but
since they're likely to want to fly I
was interested in that their views
anyway and I also asked them more
sophisticated questions about the
architecture of the vehicle would you
rather land horizontally with all the
land on
parachute into water or whatever
whatever we've got some useful answers
on that as well I also asked them about
spaceports you know does it matter to
you which spaceport you'll be using and
the answer was I haven't thought about
it and I think that will change with AZ
because basically from the heights we're
talking about on suborbital you can see
700 miles in any direction now I'd
rather if I if I went up above Oklahoma
Oklahoma spaceport and I could see 700
miles in every direction it would still
look like Oklahoma but but if I was in
the Caribbean or somewhere then that'd
be pretty and Mojave they'd get a nice
view the California coast and so on so I
think as time moves on there'll be a lot
more competitive activity between the
spaceport and more we got more data
about risk what what they felt about
risk we also asked about corporate space
tourism one of the things that seemed
like a possibility was is this something
could be offered as a reward for you
know what you know higher-performing
Google executives you know get to go
into space that's a great idea
well what happens is when you look at
the the results they all say well I
would go but I wouldn't risk one of my
best employees or I wouldn't risk Mike
my best clients or I wouldn't risk you
know so it's a very different perception
between your personal risk profile and
that of your company so the corporate
space tourism needs a bit bit of work
doing some we're interested in a VA
that's getting out and floating around
we got some useful data about orbital
duration for which is kind of
interesting you think you're all good
economists you know if you if you pay
let's say 30 million to go in into orbit
you know all the hard work is getting up
and landing you know staying up there so
you ask the question would you like to
stay six months
you know one week three days you're you
know you know it you think that the
rational economic man would say oh
you're but no they say two weeks so so
that's that is you know people have
lives and that's basically reflected in
the survey and we also found that the
that the people who were doing this were
all big and heavy so it was useful
information for the the designers you
know and in fact the end that they're
big and heavy and old I mean that's the
other thing you know millionaires in
general I'm not you know present company
excepted so what do we know we have a
pretty good idea there is a market for
space tourism and there are service
providers you know Virgin Galactic is
definitely going to be out there the Sir
Richard Branson has risked the the
biggest thing he has which is his brand
name virgin
Virgin Galactic what a wonderful name to
call that comes with Virgin Galactic
but he's risked that and he's you know
he's going to take care and he's gonna
do it so that's going to happen
he already has waiting lists and we know
roughly what the price points are we
know there's about one to two billion
dollar business here that's what we know
what we don't know we have very little
idea I'll show you shortly about point a
point what is the point of point to
point this is what I'll be talking about
we don't know what will happen with the
first fatal accident a lot of people a
lot of in in the financing community are
worried about this it's important the
industry is thinking about this a lot
and they're thinking ahead of the game
you know there will be a first fatal
accident but the important thing is that
it's not treated in the way that say
like the Challenger or accident was
treated it's more like bungee jumping
and the elastic snaps it's it's a it's
an extreme sport and people die climbing
Everest and so on all the time and so
they this is the this is the mindset
that's being
developed for handling this this
eventuality but it depends what the
press does at the time what the impact
so so your your millionaires and the six
of you pay two hundred thousand dollars
to have five minutes in zero-g
and one of your colleagues is sick what
what what do we do do we give the other
five their money back you know can you
imagine you know but what that's gonna
be like in zero-g and or he bangs his
head and and and it bleeds and blood you
know that there there are issues we
don't know what's going to happen but
the FAA is concerned and looking at what
sort of tests should be done beforehand
you know what what kind of what's the
minimum requirements for to be accepted
for to be a space tourists we don't know
the impact of the location we don't know
if there's going to be us-based orbital
vehicle and I put this one down here a
lottery potential this is my buzz buzz
aldrin keeps pestering me about this he
says Derrick future on drug B's great
but it doesn't help me with my company
share space he has a company and he
wants to have people he wants to make
sure everybody gets to go into space for
the price of a share a dollar lottery
effectively now apart from this he has
some legal issues to sort out but he
wants to know how many people would pay
a dollar to for the chance of going into
space and I told him I haven't the
faintest idea why anybody spends
anything on lotteries I don't you know
it's not to do with with economics it's
not to do with it's a totally new area
that I'm not competent in so I keep
telling him to find someone who who
knows about betting &amp;amp; lotteries it's a
it's a betting idea but it's Buzz
Aldrin's idea and you key worries a lot
about it I mentioned so now we're moving
to point-to-point there's a group just
be
informed it's a very informal group it's
called fast forward you find my name's
spaceport associates near the bottom
it's people who are just generally
concerned and interested in what might
or might not happen in this field of
point-to-point
and hypersonics although there's a lot
of names there is like about four of us
who are regularly on the telephone once
a month developing their thinking here
and the last name on here is probably
the most important name that's the non
attributable cargo company because you
know I'm very much into understanding
markets and customers and we're starting
off by looking at potential cargo
markets so I want to know real people
who do this now and what they think
about the possibility of doing it faster
so but for some reason they don't want
their name on the thing so that's who
they are but there's there's only three
of them okay another little idea is some
people think that point-to-point is just
you take that spaceship one you have
hanging in the lobby you put a little
bit extra motor in there and so and when
it gets to the top you give it a kick
sideways and it comes down instead of
back at Mojave comes down somewhere else
well you can do the calculations you can
find the best you can hope with this
kind of approach is about 200 miles if
you can get the enough power in there to
do it because basically you you have
about six minutes of a parabolic Glide
in order to get somewhere and it works
out at about tournament you could go
from say Las Vegas to Mojave or
something like that that might work but
it's you can't use it for
intercontinental what you need is a
hypersonic vehicle and this is a totally
different thing and it don't exist
it needs a totally new kind of engine
which doesn't exist a lot of people are
developing them and been researching
them
and also you need thermal systems which
are reusable you fly this thing you know
from San Francisco to Japan and it comes
in very fast and burns up whatever kind
of a system you've got you're gonna have
to replace it before sending it back
again so a lot of work needs to be done
on on reusable thermal systems a lot of
work on trajectories and this is where
the market comes in what size of vehicle
are we talking about is this something
that's more like like a business
aircraft is it is it something like a
Concorde and every conference I go to I
listen to engineers and they design the
coolest thing they can find and they
don't worry about what the market is is
it you wouldn't this look great and so
yeah look great but what's it for you
know they say well it tests technology
and it stretches everything and he said
yeah but what's it for
so I think the size of the vehicle is
rather important you know the the actual
conditions on a flight like this you get
a lot of G and of course the cut one of
the problems with the Concorde was the
sonic boom you know certainly stopped it
flying over the USA this thing will have
a sonic boom how they gonna solve that
problem is it gonna land with engines or
as a glider air traffic control is going
to be interested in that and then what
sort of turnaround time would you need
so I'm gonna address three questions
about what it's for is it for cargo and
a couple of ones about for human so
we've done a little bit of work on the
cargo side we have not done any prime
market research we have not gone out and
asked anybody we except for the the non
attribute all non attributable cargo
people so we've got some basic data here
and what you find we built a model and
the model assumed
400 dollars a kilogram would be a price
which is 50% premium on today's highest
rate when you do that you find that
there's only about 500 kilograms payload
per trip based on what people do today
with somewhere like Federal Express or
UPS Express package delivery is only 15%
of air freight and within that only 5%
go for the highest rate which is the
quickest so you keep getting smaller and
smaller part of the market and you work
that calculation through and you find
that so the revenue per trip is only
$200,000 I mean if you're building this
incredible vehicle which is gonna cost
the earth to build and you can't you
can't make it work at this so you know
we ended we did this little piece of
work it's it's all on the website that
the paper has some long fancy name is
the world ready for high speed cargo yet
or something is the title but it's on my
website so the answer was no in this
piece of analysis okay so if maybe it's
not for cargo is it for business travel
you know is this is this the thing I
mean I hear it even Sir Richard Branson
who's you know promoting Virgin Galactic
he keeps talking about this he's saying
you know once we've got this going we're
going to be doing London to Sydney in an
hour and a half and and I think I'm not
sure about that because it's very hard
when you google Concorde the price
history and so on you get also it's a
range of prices but it seems like
$10,000 one-way was about that about the
highest end and anyone would pay but
suborbital flights are $200,000 is a
business person gonna pay you know 100
grand or something to get you know a few
hours faster to Sydney from London I
doubt it
that's an enormous it's like a 10 time
premium over concorde price and concorde
couldn't make make money so basically
it's another area that needs market
research it's easy to do you just go and
talk to people you know flying
first-class at Heathrow and ask them a
few questions and get statistical valid
but but nobody has done the work yet at
least no one is put it in the public
domain I I put everything I can in the
public domain and I I'm an an avid
reader of everybody else's who's put
things in the public domain so I'm I
like to find it out there but I can't
find anything about whether people would
pay for this kind of a trip any
reasonable amount of money so I'm left
with kind of a third version which I
think it might work for and that is it's
really just it is space tourism but it's
it's it's a premium version of space
tourism it's someone you know after a
few years going up and down or Mojave
gets a bit boring they'll pay more to go
somewhere different to the Caribbean or
whatever how much more would they pay it
would it be enough to pay for the
development of this no the work has not
been done as - and then you've got also
some amusing return logistics you know
how do you get your vehicle back how do
you get your passengers back or do you
you know this is a two-way flight or
whatever but so I think it might they
might just be a market for this but I
don't doubt that the numbers it would
turn out enough to justify the
developments of a system like this I
suspect the real user of this kind of
thing is going to be the military and if
the military need it you know to get
eight guys in a hurry to some other part
of the world then you know the the space
tourism guys will be coming along behind
and want to use the technology but I
can't see it being developed as a
market-based commercial operation at the
moment but as I say that work has not
been done there are some very
interesting logistics about
point-to-point which
you're going in circles trying to solve
these basically how many space ports do
you need if you're gonna initiate let's
talk about cargo just saw what FedEx you
know at the moment they have they could
fly from LAX San Francisco whatever to
anywhere in the world but these are
special facilities for these hypersonic
space planes you're gonna have to build
them specially how many would you need
to have a sensible and complete cargo
service
what maintenance facilities would you
need there which spaceport pairs would
be the ones that would would we would
get the most traffic and and of course
what you're trying to save what you know
five or six hours of delivery time
there's not much point if when you get
there you you have to wait to get it
through customs and you through the
normal procedures they need a whole
everything needs to be quickened up
accordingly if you're going to do this
it's not it's not impossible but it's it
it has to be part of the thinking from
the beginning another interesting
question on one of the papers on my site
I explore whether whether you could do
this at all as a scheduled service and
as soon as you start thinking about a
scheduled service you start think well
how many times a day would it have to
fly and you have to have an awful lot of
them otherwise you might as well just
get the earlier slow plane and so I came
to the view that maybe you might need
quite a small business jet kind of a
thing which only went on demand it was
just sitting there and you just turn up
and get on it and it goes but that's
that it's cool but again that what what
is the market there we don't know going
east or west fascinating question when
we first started looking at this of
course all the FedEx and so
we'll talk about first day delivery
second day delivery third day delivery
and the model started coming up with
some funny answers and you realize well
actually if you're going from London to
San Francisco you can just go in a 747
and you still you've got first day
delivery if you're going either way you
know with the rotation of the earth
you're losing a day all the time so it
does matter which way you're going then
air traffic control for this kind of a
vehicle is obviously a lot of lot of
difficulties and the rather amusing one
is the military considerations this
thing would be indistinguishable from an
incoming ICBM it was sort of it's coming
across the Atlantic to talk to approach
so there's a lot of a lot of work needs
to be done on that now grace asked me to
talk about how soon are we going to go
hypersonic to Australia this man's name
is bond
Alan bond he has developed something
called Skylon and you see a bottle of
Skylon hanging up behind him on the left
picture
you also see Alan bond with a model
called ho tall and my daughter Grace
standing next to him 20 years ago so in
20 years we move from this model to this
model
so again don't hold your breath on this
although he has recently received 1
million euros from ISA the European
Space Agency to to continue thinking
about this so it's not something that is
imminent
it's exciting all all all engineers
would love to make this thing because I
think I've made clear no one knows what
it's for and that's the I believe that
is a start point I wish someone would
just spend a few hundred thousand
dollars explore the market decide what
it's for and then start building the
thing this is kind of my last slide I
wanted to just on a philosophical note
and with you know what is just space
tourism
mana is it just a fun thing for rich
people to do well of course it's a very
American thing you know it's an you can
make two billion dollars doing it it's
all about the pursuit of happiness which
I read somewhere was an American idea
and it's about pushing the frontiers and
and all that kind of thing so but also
it's I think it's an enabling technology
which is why I'm very keen in promoting
its I'd the use of it it's it's enabling
because we as payloads if we think of
human beings as payloads it's the only
payload that's enough of to make a
reusable space vehicle make sense all
the other kind of payloads communication
satellites earth observation satellites
whatever you add them all up you end up
with 60 to 80 launches per year globally
military civil Russian American
everything all adds up 60 to 80 a year
nothing else but space tourism opens up
enormous numbers and therefore enables
the this whole new reusable technology
has to be reusable because you've got to
get your people back again and up again
so it will bring about a more airline
like operation which will produce more
reliability and lower cost to orbit
reusability lower cost orbit and then
all users will benefit from from that so
that's that's that's the story that's my
thank you and I'm ready for questions if
grace will help me take the questions
and on the bottom of the slide that it
tells you where you can find this
presentation
so if anyone has any questions I'm going
to try and repeat them into microphones
the benefit of the video
so the question is how is the industry
weathering the current downturn given
its and I think that the real answer
that the simple way to answer is Sir
Richard Branson I mean this industry is
all being done by millionaires on their
own dime basically and Sir Richard
Branson is very serious and he's gonna
make this happen I don't know whether
the slowing up is something that's you
know he's held back a little I don't
know I don't think so I think it's
possibly safety-related he's just making
absolutely certain the thing is it's
going to be safe when it starts flying
but that's the difference and the market
although you know we are talking about
millionaires and millionaires have their
money in stocks and so on so there may
be less millionaires now than there were
when we when we did this survey the last
time I did the calculation there were
eight million millionaires out there
there were a thousand billionaires but
actually one of the hardest things to
find when you're doing market research
is exactly the the distribution of rich
people you know when you try and slice
it up it's very hard to find and you
know the some of the best sources are
things like Forbes magazine and so on
even the tax authorities don't have what
they were particularly the tax
authorities don't know where these
people are so that's that is a hard part
yes
so for point-to-point cargo have you
examined their maximum g-forces the
cargo can tolerate the answer's no but
you're right I mean it would be if it's
going to be used for cargo there'd be
less stringent requirements and then for
human written a reason for trying to
decide what this thing is for right
right up front but no the number of
conferences I go to where where they
have beautiful models and simulations
and you're almost you almost really
believe it's there but they haven't
thought about what it's for and but
you're right cargo in some ways will be
much simpler
so you familiar with any products
currently being funded potentially first
by the military and then being picked up
commercially the the only thing I know
about is is that thing at x51 which I
only discovered about a month ago or a
few weeks ago
it's a NASA or maybe it's NASA DoD or
something like that but it's a very
preliminary look at hypersonics it's a
long way from you know something is
deployable but that's you know there's
there's the the military has a good
record of developing some some of these
technologies and often you don't know
till they till they happen
so experience it's a good question and
we don't know but I could even extend
the question and say there's a lot of
things you can do that there's space
tourism related that's on the ground and
simulations and it's something that I'm
concerned about is if a simulation gets
to be so good you know what people
actually want to go anymore we don't
know but we in some of the market
research we do we actually extend it to
include some of these like zero-g
flights and so on I believe that that
since Peter Diamandis is running zero-g
he's he's obviously it's in his interest
to keep promoting the idea eventually of
going into space and so my hope is that
it is it is it's a an entryway into
suborbital space tourism
so do we have any comparisons for
point-to-point vehicles of this type
versus the net Jack type of sharing it's
a good question and and you know this I
mentioned this fast forward group we're
just beginning to look at some of these
things and that's that's an ideal thing
to do a little bit of analysis on we
don't we don't have the the work done
yet
well first we got to fly it
Ellen musk has done amazing things I
mean it's just been an extraordinary
development the SpaceX you know gang of
20 people it's it's it's Google and
rocket fuel basically and they they they
have achieved a great deal of Falcon
what five-in-one has actually now
orbited a satellite he they have
assembled Falcon nine it's sitting down
at the Cape they've tested the nine
motors in parallel on the ground and
they seemed seems to be okay but I
started my my professional life in the
in the european space program a long
long time ago and we had 12 launches of
the europa vehicle and not one of them
was able to get the satellite in orbit
so I'm used to taking you know a few a
few goes before you get it right but
when it's your own money
it's rather than government money it's
you know the ticks you have to be a
little bit more careful but I think we
should see Falcon 9 flying this year
he's been on target with everything that
he has set to achieve in the cots
program from the beginning on schedule
and and the deliverables so I'm crossing
my fingers that he be successful Falcon
9 now your next question is how do you
man rate it and how long was that going
to take then you move away from from you
know entrepreneurial exciting things
like space tourism and you get into the
government because the government gets
involved in various forms with with man
reading NASA has about a you know nine
hundred page document about how to do it
and so we don't know how long that would
take
but it's part of cuts there's a thing
called cuts D which if NASA would
authorize it
then the then Ellen mask will be funded
to attempt to fly people to the space
station I think he said you could do it
within two years you know I'd one make
it three</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
