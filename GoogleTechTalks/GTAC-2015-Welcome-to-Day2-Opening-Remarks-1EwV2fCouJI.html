you ready for day two oh I like it good
caffeination this morning people so a
few reminders developers.google.com /
gtech is your one-stop shop for all
things gee tac we had some comments
about getting 404 is going to this page
I've never seen one make sure you're
doing developers plural not singular the
other thing is you can type out google
dash test automation in the URL and that
would be fine too we're using the same
exact page for asking questions today as
we did yesterday so things will be
running mostly the same there and of
course recordings and slides as I said
yesterday will be available on the
website as well pretty much everything
today goes the same as yesterday so I
don't hasn't have as much administrivia
but there is one thing a little
different today well not so much we're
right now in the heart of Diwali which
is the Hindu festival of lights it's
really a celebration of the triumph over
good and evil and it's one of actually
the largest holidays celebrated in India
where the crickets coming please silence
your cell phones one of the things
Google likes to do is celebrate anything
it can and when it comes to the largest
holiday in India that's a really good
reason to celebrate so yesterday we had
some sweets brought in my son all for
Diwali today I believe that Indian food
will be available I'm recognizing this
there you know you'll see a little bit
of decor around for it and all the
offices actually I know Seattle Kirkland
New York Cambridge all have their own
celebrations going on right now because
this entire week is the the long-running
festival but yesterday and today we're
actually the main holidays and actually
a lot of celebrations actually consists
of supremely dressing up fireworks
candles everywhere exchanging gifts with
your family is a really big part of this
holiday it's and and lots of sweets and
more sweets and more sweets as i've been
told i'm told that this is the holiday
where sweets don't count tonight we're
actually going to have a happy hour to
wrap up a GTECH for you and what i like
to say that this is our own way of
giving you a taste of google's tgif we
have a weekly tradition of having the
company get together and sort of break
down the week and see how things are
gone have gone generally there's like a
lot of QA there but we won't have that
you guys get to do that all day today
instead we'll just do the social part of
it where we get to hang out have some
snacks and drinks outside after the
conference is done so let's make our own
thank goodness it's Wednesday happen so
y'all heard my mom was watching
yesterday what you didn't hear what she
was texting me all day long I had my own
mom live stream going on and I I talked
to her last night on the phone because
it was just ridiculously hysterical for
me yesterday reading her texts and I
said mom would you really think and so
she gave me a lot more in addition to
her texts and then I said you know what
I'm using you tomorrow this is payback
for all those times you embarrassed me
so let's take a look at what my mom
thought of day one I was learning a lot
I was learning so much and I had a lot
of things to look up like what uber is
she told me Google was her best friend
yesterday when she didn't understand a
word we were saying in here because this
is not what she you know knows she just
hears me talk about it a lot and she
loves to ask me questions and apparently
we are better than daytime TV so I'm
proud of us here's another text the ones
in quotes are actual Texas I received
during the presentations this robot is
cool I can't believe it can test all
those different phones and it can do
gestures that I don't even know is
difficult and now this nice guy from
twitter is using it too so it must be
real he makes it look so easy and yes i
do have a tool that we use is very
comparable to jiffy so she's like what
is this different than conversation with
me she really wanted us to listen
closely to that accessibility gentleman
as she called him because she thought he
was saying things that were very
important and very relevant to people
she knows and that we shouldn't make in
some assumptions about the world around
us and how other people perceive the
world around us so make software
Universal this was like you know the the
standard mom speak of do good Yvette do
good this one was probably my favorite I
like this flaky guy and its idea of
putting testability into the development
pace
my mom's smart i got it from somewhere
um as I recall conversations with you a
number of years ago you mentioned
something similar but now I actually
understand it so apparently i can't
explain flaky tests but thank you
Alistair you made my mom understand by
the way the first time I read this text
I was you know doing a ton of other
things and it started with I like this
flaky guy that's all I rat and I was
like that's not a nice thing to say but
no she has her reasons she thought we
did a really good job of explaining
things yesterday and yes she did agree
to be on Team emulator because it pays
my bills but she wants team devised to
know that there are no hard feelings so
keep doing a good job if my mom's
listening today keep teaching her as we
keep teaching each other our challenges
and our successes and that's all I have
for today so I will end a little early
so maybe we'll have a little time for
extra Q&amp;amp;A</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
