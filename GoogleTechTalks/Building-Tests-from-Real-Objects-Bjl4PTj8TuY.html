we will give first of all I want to
explain with a bit of background where
do we come from
then explain a little bit of motivation
why are we interested in building
automatically generating automatically
paste from real objects explain the idea
and a few details of the implementation
anything
although explain a little bit all the
failures that we experienced before
reaching not the final solution but at
least something that is working and is
used positive and then just a few idea
that for developing this this framework
okay let's start with the background I
started working in 1993 for life
insurance which was called Venice with
life and with all the two friends of
mine the huge opportunity to implement
system from scratch from zero
the reason was easy because this company
was just created a few minutes before so
we could really develop a new system
from scratch and not only we could also
decide which technology to use which was
not so usual at this time so we decided
to use small torque as a programming
language and gemstone as an database
system which was not so useful
it took us two ears and enough to be
able to to deliver the first production
system which again was not so bad at
this time when we finished Oh CEO asked
Esther how do we want to celebrate this
moment because it was not so clear that
we really would be able to finish the
project and we asked him oh it would be
really nice to have something smooth or
move come in and the review what we did
because we were convinced we were very
good at programming and so he said ok I
knew a little bit came back and I told
him if you would join us in Switzerland
and review the system so he came and the
first question that he told us that he
asked us was how many tests we have at
the moment to say we tried a few fools
but it was a little bit a disaster
we implemented tons of tests but they
never faith that we had huge maintenance
perhaps it was also too early to do this
kind of stuff but so the result was
really we didn't have text we weren't
able to write this book to test of
system then he said oh yes interesting
and when I'm going to deliver the next
minute of your system we say no we just
started production so they're updating
three months you know it's extremely
difficult the next milestone that we
want to reach doing this week can show
the
us a little bit the idea of extreme
programming that was developing and he
convinced us completely that it was a
complete
and way of developing application so for
us it was really a little bit an
Enlightenment we started adding a school
system so it was a little bit xfinity
even if it was not designed this way and
and so oh we had although a huge
opportunity it was after this week we
were able to convince him to work with
us for one year long which is not
underestimate two years later Credit
Suisse's liquor bank bought one of the
biggest because the insurance company
you would be any insurance company which
is called Interpol and so from one day
to the other we were just moved from a
small company of 50 people into a huge
company of thousand people which was
really the best example of classical and
software development I think we survived
the sweet ones I don't think more than
three months and but it was really a
good move for us because we started at
this point we we need a spinoff from OCS
and we started our own company which is
called life where the idea of life where
was the reaction of what we we saw in
this big companies they the development
time of five years for example we were
at the for example with over two years
and an alpha timeframe food delivery
system but we tried to be able to
deliver a system in three months not two
years and a half and I did was not that
we were becoming better but we were just
sleeping everything possible from what
we were delivering so it was not
we were better programmers but who was
master delivering less then not only we
will try to ever weekly release of all
software so to be able to adapt the
system to new requirements and again
this was against the usual one year
lifecycle that was usually life
insurance it was clear we had to find
some way to deliver this software this
update in a in a without cost so we
decided to move the complete
functionality of this distance on the
web which today is normally but in 1998
it was not so clear it was feasible we
also in the group after climate risk was
not only a bunch of people that were
developers we are also an actual be a
mathematician design involved and a few
people managing the production daily the
back office work and we wanted to try to
move the idea of extreme programming
also to the production environment and
perhaps at the end of the talk I will
give you a few example of what is a last
last problem that we ate was yes now we
have the company but we have to charge
something for what we are developing and
the usual software packages in
in the life insurance field cost between
two and four millions do and then and
you receive everything everything
possible even even more perhaps and then
you pay a maintenance cost of between
ten and twenty percent of the cost of
initial cost this kind of approach
didn't work because we were honest with
our customer and we said we will start
with not at the after three months you
will be able to print that policy
collect the first payment nothing else
and then you have to trust us we will be
able to implement the completed
functionality as it comes at this pops
up from you from your customer and so
this kind of approach asking three
millions you for something that you
don't deliver that you don't there was a
little bigger problem so we decided oh
another not a problem that we had was
that Oh company was very technology
oriented we had only mathematician we
had only physic physicists and we didn't
like very much to Cooper getting to
discuss about by second time that
someone wanted was an infrared narrative
reverse it was a disaster we didn't like
so in order to avoid exists discussion
we said let's try to use a pay-per-views
model where we pay only based on the
service that is using and we produce a
very simple formula which was you will
pay for example 16 you will every yield
for every policy that we are managing so
there is no more dispersion about do we
have to demand Z's
which doesn't go Spencer so these were a
little bit all principal today life
whereas is small companions only 17
people working we are managing a quarter
of a million of contracts in ten
different countries in Europe from the
technical point of view we are still
releasing every week for all eight
different customers and we are covering
the functionality for system with 15,000
tests that takes the moment 15 minutes
to earn motivation of this of this talk
if I can summarize the background we
were early adopters of extreme
programming with office first I I
started really better using tests first
the problem that we experienced was that
it was under an order to test first we
were I think world champion in in
designing tests for the fact that for
many statements of a contract it was
easy to define others tests look like
for the first two weeks of the content
easy it was a little bit harder to
specify tests when a contract was
getting older and older and formally
after a few years and life insurance
contracts are at the duration of 50 60
years inaudible being able to
reconstruct make test first for
contractors and who three years was
simply impossible so it was sad but yet
problems in in in in tests
or obviously not only we convinced the
customer that the texting is extremely
important and automated testing is even
more important and customer were
radiated for example the actual
Department designing life in front world
love the idea that they don't give us
300 tests and we could automatically
transform in test case and every 15
minutes we're learning and we're
controlled this was really nice
for example we received in order to
implement the surrender forces which is
when a customer doesn't want to don't
want to receive that is insurance
received we under a test case that we
have testing over possible products or
more possible duration anything
wonderful it took us two weeks to
implement this test case we're ordering
wonderful we moved into production this
new process the third lien surrender
didn't work we say how is it possible we
make the 300 ecstasy it's a shame the
problem is that is usually when you buy
breakfast normally this is a disaster
contact you know he didn't pay he had a
few mutation and so on and it was so
strange configuration that the actually
which again is an abstract thing even
think about so we had points of
wonderful as that were not really
testing what was happening in the
reality so again a little bit frustrated
about this
but at weird works even if we do test
first we look but we try to say don't
touch the code and you are able to
introduce the bargain and only at this
time it is allowed to write code that
change the behavior it's a wonderful
idea we want to applies it but again
little bit the disaster because it was
so hard from time to time do we create
the mug it was impossible when an orange
or red born in over-testing training it
was indeed a pity the last one I could
see the copy and pastes in the home it
is so it's normal if you want even test
first someone is asking your new courses
so you start writing the text what do
you do at the beginning it's easier you
say what did i do last week Oh
interesting you copy and paste and star
who's this from perhaps changing a few
parameters you know it's not it's human
what happens it happens actually
completely you know
a set of test case that are really
different you know you have you don't
have biodiversity over by the table and
you had all the way the same kind of
tastes exactly the same if it even
bother not not in the sense of it will
destroy completely new field here so
since what the motivation of trying to
find a new solution to be able to test
again first the idea was extremely
simple
unfortunately well it was so simple
because we had in front of us a quarter
of a millionth of test case waiting to
be wake up and to become test it was not
so difficult we just need the ability
and this is the idea we just need their
ability to move into production into the
whole system and with a finger just
touch a contract and receiving that as a
test case this was holy if we would be
able to do something like this we put
again restart and developing its
developing test firms all system yeah
now we will try to give you an example
of this dream what we have implemented
so far
yes
I will show you what what we mean by
getting a test case from production here
we have a contract for our wonderful
customers and we want to replicate this
in you know testing testing framework so
we we had built his nest builder I
trying now to build this this contract
it was named his number
okay this is our contract and I will
show you only how it looks like we have
an extension in here you know testing
framework to open the browser
just a sip
and here it is that is the test case you
can see if I switch to that that these
are completely the same I can show you
at the account level is more complicated
peace
okay this is only to the spirit what
what we mean by taking the contract into
the test environment I'll be back soon
so this was the idea and other than
without it is implemented at the user
interface level the board of extracting
automatically test from real data this
generation should be automatic we didn't
want to a manual solution first of all
second one that works this text this
test that we wear that when we were
generating that this tests were readable
and comprehensible and this is not so
clear because normally I remember when I
was working with fourth generation
language and all this kind of stuff they
were generating code possible they were
generating so much stuff that a human
could not understand so really a goal
was what we are generating should be
really simple to understand not only to
understand what order to change because
the idea was also perhaps to to extract
the text from the database and perhaps
change a few details because we don't
have exactly in production the test that
we want to develop and the last
requirement a requirement was that the
system should should extremely minimal
you know the easiest solution for
building tests from real production is
make a copy of your database of a part
of millions of tests and then start
working on this but it's not finding in
you need a big sensor so it's not
feasible the idea was I want to recreate
my
it looks exactly the same of the
original one but loading so few
information as possible and although we
will see what does it okay now a few
words about the implementation and we
copied idea form from the simulation
theory the idea is the following one you
might have contacting production and you
ask in your data and you want to ask in
please
because that yourself as a set of
earrings that are able to exactly
specify your life it's a little bit like
your volume you ask please tell me all
the steps that I have to replace so that
I can replay exactly your mind this is
the first step in this happens no money
in the production environment
so you abstract this you receive a list
of events the next step is that from
this event you want to create a script a
script that when replayed will sleep
live an exact copy of the column again
this is not so difficult and this is
exactly the order line between the
production environment
development and life the third step then
once you have see situation you can
replay the fact that as much time as you
like every time that you want to run
this test case is completely separated
from the production environment and so
you can use it really as a test case
completely separated from your database
system the goal is that at the end the
original contract and the newly created
contract would be another business
object exactly the thing what does it
mean exactly the same is it depends on
the granularity that you are interested
again this there is no you should not be
exactly the same in the technical point
of view it means the same object but
should behave exactly how you desire
building this set of events is not so
easy I can show you a little bit this is
a golf example of our complex is a life
insurance company you have a contact and
then you have different people policy
all the injured person beneficiaries you
have Boca that sold the life insurance
contract to the policyholder which is
attached to a distribution channel you
have all loops that are selling France
and so on and you need normally tons of
information to be able to recreate
completely Europe object but the idea is
simple to ask the contract please write
the events on the stream the stream is
nothing else chronologically organized
list of events and then you just
delegate this method to all your friends
and the newest green please actually
mentions is
implementing this idea we we found that
there are two kinds of effects
we call them square and round events a
little bit it's not a wonderful metaphor
but the idea came from from a book
flatland of Albert Square events are
rather stupid events
you know they event constantly
well-defined
number of parameters the best example
that I found was a payment event the
customer is paying you a premium and you
just need three parameters in order to
specify this event how much did he pay
when and when did you receive this
information and it is always the same so
you can use a really stupid square enix
never change
okay this is the first example then we
have a little bit more difficult event
we call this round events because they
don't have really a shape these events
are normally described by a huge number
of sparse partners the best example that
we have in a system into application
object where you define others you
confirm not like us for this context of
events we have normally more than two
other possible parameters but at the end
normally you're just using 10% or 20%
roses because not all the possible
combinations makes sense and
important so we we differentiate really
between these two kinds of events one
when we are trying to model or framework
now what is the contribution of every
event to the general script it's rather
simple for 20 things every events as the
ability to fly inside the script that we
are building just the method that we as
coal and substitute with real values
okay from technical point of view now I
speak about script but what we are doing
is extremely simple we are creating a
new class a new subclass of this case
creating a method which is called the
replay or events this is all script and
any event as the ability to write a
simple method call inside this method
but exactly at the right let's see what
happens for around four round events if
we have two options the first option was
to create a method with 200 kilometers
but this was a little bit important
because we would fail against the idea
of building readable code the easy
solution was to create a method with no
it's
it's really but you haven't finished you
have to create a game another method
that specifies what happens but here you
have the full power of building you home
script and just specifying what is
needed normally suspend parameter that
is used one that you encounter so
they're getting even for extremely
complex event you are able to create to
create code that is more or less
readable often the code that we are
generating we will see later in the demo
it is more readable than the page that I
will write from scratch so it's not me
okay now max will try to show you the
code
see
hey let's start from where we ended give
us the test case that we generated and
we can show you that it's a class that
is a subclass of this is grass and we we
we generate a stop where you can start
making yourself assertion and so on this
is the the method we play on events
method that construct the contract in
here we have all the events organized
split it up in importers for you that
reason
readability reasons and if you look we
see that we to build this this contract
we need to create a project then we need
to set up a program we have to load the
prices for a couple of funds finally we
have to set up the contract and then we
can begin collecting the premiums ok
let's look at what in
it's very that looks like here we have
this Bank event if each of these
experiments have a template method it's
very easy this this method is evaluated
during both code generation and this
expression are substituted with real
values so these expressions are
evaluated in the context of the event
and once the the parameter cells are set
up the code is appended to the replace
method now you can show it sounds
complicated but it is mean these are
this is the method to set up
application of insurance
official-looking the application event
we have here we have like like in the
simple event a template method but this
method is very complicated here always
for readability reason we have splitted
in soft methods and now we will see
mainly what we do programmatically to to
get the final method to make this we we
get the help from our our environment we
need the we need functions from the
refractory browser against that the
first step you can see here we inline
the messages
in this one and then for all methods
like we reach the end and here is the
fully expected to get the wool each
other this is the full expanded method
to set up an application okay the first
step is to take all the his conditionals
is warranty of conditional accuracy is
to take these conditioners evaluate the
the condition in the context of the of
the event and then switch to this branch
or desired range in function of the of
the result so if we look here I have as
ensured a female so this evaluates to
false
and now I have this simple method and I
do that for all of the conditions until
I reach this this metal is getting
simpler we we don't have conditions
anymore we have a special case but span
yet and this is the loop graph to unfold
because we each contract may have a
different number of fans so we we have
to generate this list up for every fund
this contract had to two funds
okay generated is the last type is to
evaluate these expressions to get the
real data from the from the productive
application and the system here and we
are getting pretty close to the end
music with the protists becoming minimal
and now just for beautifying the cordon
for readability reason we cascade all
the methods to build
you know we can see that
the final whistle once this is made the
the Methodist is compiled into the test
class it has this generation process
this little bit the implementation of
this idea what we find is extremely
interesting is to to tell you a little
bit the story of this idea also because
it is too full of failures the purse the
purple this idea was in a completely
different context one of our biggest
customer asked us to migrate the
existing portfolio they add a few
thousands of contracts that they wanted
to move into all new system so we
entered we have we didn't like very much
to migrate all portfolio because it's
really an extremely difficult task
perhaps I can explain later the reason
but we have to and normally the
competition competition is just taking a
snapshot of taking a photo of the
portfolio of the contacts at the time
when they asked to migrate the system
and move the new system and then start
living again and we didn't like at all
this idea because from our point of view
it was didn't make sense from our
experience we know that it is extremely
important to have the complete history
of your contacts because it is it
happens that you have retroactive
changes to make us perhaps to regenerate
some tax statement for two years before
and so on so we we know it was not
working second form an XP point of view
migrating a portfolio is the worst thing
that you can do it the biggest risk that
you can take because the idea is
deliver at one day the complete
functionality for all your contacts and
so you are not minimizing your list but
you are maximizing them but we were
premised that we want to do this curve
Soviet rule and the idea in order to
have a good feeling about this migration
was to try to extract from the old
system or what ever - dir contracts
replace the whole system compare the
reasons there are comments and the
values of the contracts and if they were
equal then we would neither it is
contact into our system if not go back
then describe again in exactly this idea
is similar to extracting test case from
all real production and the reason is if
I am able to repeat the story of a
system that is not mine
why I'm not able to reconstruct the
story of my own data so this was the
idea of
extracting tested from production but
now it is easy more or less to do to the
final solution the reality is that I
think we we had three years of failures
it's not so that we were three year long
ancestors and we have every day
available because we do this a little
bit in all three tiny we know we had
when you where the problems but we had
no idea to solve it and we tried the few
times that they gave you with take
failures the first one was yet nice
objects as I told you at the beginning
we had good objects to specify a condom
in the first five milliseconds of their
life so we tried we pull this lifecycle
builders so we try to extend this object
in order to be able to specify all the
behavior after contracting section what
happened was that we were never able to
recreate exactly the two same conference
so we were testing but a little bit not
a little I fainted or related something
similar which was not good then after a
few months I said oh I want at least one
once in my life I want to recreate an
object a contract exactly in the same
way as I am in the production so I
stopped working
and I try to repeat manually a contact
it took me one week and at the end of
the week and we had exactly what we
showed in the demo in the first thing
identical copies of the same contact and
it exactly the same
this was a huge success from one side
and a huge table from the other side
because we were able it took us any time
one week to create the biases tools are
crazy okay let me say it doesn't make
sense to make this job manually let's
try to do it automatically automatically
by generate import which was a first
step and we started generating code by
writing code as a stream the code that
you saw we were generating a stream
containing the strings that were then
compiled into a method again we were
able to do this but was a disaster
because the system was living people
were doing we Alex people well in any
method removal method that we medals and
a wonderful test generator was not
working because states where no
notification that so on one just remove
a method or change the name of a method
then the last attempt was was really
beautiful power of this and actually
awesome which is the
one of the basic rules of small toy
generate two parts existing template in
line in code and so on really working on
the real object so o developers would
change the code that would also change
the test generation frame so was
wonderful so we get it but again we had
a failure because we implemented only a
limited number of events and limited at
the beginning we implemented just
application event because it was the
easy simple loop and we noticed it only
with one event it was not really
interesting so again a failure based on
the critical mass what is interesting
about the current state is the following
one we had the relation based on this
last statement that made me planet of
possible events for portfolio of horrors
and we were a little bit sad because we
say think about we have a quarter of
millions of contracts the middle you
that live from I don't know six seven
years and we have to reclaim it for
eight productions in 100 all of time so
we have to implement all the possible
events it's impossible when we are
finished and sure the developer will add
two new products then you invent a new
forces and so on so we will never reach
a state where we can use it but it was
improved what is nice is that even if we
have just implemented 20% of the event
types that happen in the hope system and
we were smart and implemented only the
square one which are simpler one we are
able to use every day this way and the
reason is that once I detect a event
that is not completely implemented I
just create a stub a stupid placeholder
so that it was no secret but what
happens is that when you ever recreate a
new test case you can take a look at all
the methods that were created with a new
implementation and you see perhaps oh it
wasn't able to replace zips in this
event but Owen stupid is an annual
statement there isn't more than me
for what I'm tasting so you can first of
all just avoid don't use the test is as
it is oh if you want this type of
functionality where you have your ends
and you can execute what you would like
in this event and once you have twice
this events it makes sense complement it
ok so the nice effect that we didn't
know we would reach what an even with a
partial implementation we can use this
sister this idea okay a few byproduct of
what we have implemented the first one
is clear the idea came for migrating
portfolio but and nothing to do with
this
we are they told you we were a little
bit skeptical in migrating portfolio now
we are extremely greedy I would like to
find a customer that asked me o YF
170,000 contracts and I would like my
grave and in here world would say no no
no F to do something else and this year
I think interesting to try it see if it
works
also because based on o pay-per-views
model is it's not very mean for
financial reason another no nothing
really to do with testing but is from a
point of view one of the most
interesting bipod if the ability to
implement and do it and we'll explain
there is a simple example let's see
thank you ever an application you put it
for your concert you are a first payment
you will see the price of your firm and
then you invest your first payment then
it happens that fund manager phone you
and say oh the fact that I gave you and
was one disasters
what we can do these are retroactive
changes this is the most difficult thing
to implement in administration system
what you have to do is you have to undo
the clicking investment you have to
enter the correct price of the fund and
they have to redo to quicken investment
what happens in reality is the fraction
of two hundred demons in in between not
only one and minutes this way the
specific what is not that or events that
were created in order to extract tests
from database can be used also for this
application viable functionality we just
have to add a new functionality to add
within 10 so we are able to go back and
what is even nicer if the we do is
hopefully because it's exactly what is
new user testing this is so long term
dream we wanted that all customer will
automatically sign test kids create the
case manage this case and stand test
case and the idea is rather simple
for example if a customer want we
produce a new product they can give us
the specification implemented we give
them a prototype they can test the
scenario open the policy try to make a
simulation of twenty years all this kind
of stuff and when they are happy they
push a button and pay for example the
policy is OK for me at this time we
would recreate it stuck
the test from the system not only but we
will be also extracting the expected
value from the system and generate a
test case but this is only at the moment
what we also noticed was that extracting
test case for production enters in
predicting extremely difficult values
when it I mean I was going to make an
example here in the reality you ever an
application contact that went in force
the construction didn't pay so it was
pretty maximum thank you finish that you
say no you don't have to pay any more
but I will reduce your new benefits and
then two months later the consumer says
no no no no I have money I want my
insurance they can please PLEASE
reactivate now you have to prevent this
process it's not so easy but it's
extremely easy to have this contract
remove the event the premium exemption
and just I said that exactly the same so
often in order to create expected value
we have just slightly modifying the test
case that we are creating
summary of this story first of all we
are really happy because it is possible
to develop tests first
really now we can really start
implementing the cold test first we have
a fucking leap in the quality of the
test we don't have this stupid test that
looks all equal we are really completely
random in this case and what is
extremely interesting s is that this
approach is supporting this the ream of
extreme production and now I will try to
explain the dream of extreme production
normally in XP you try to plan when a
given functionality has to be present in
your system ax has to be implemented and
you say Oh in two weeks I have to create
an animal statement so I have at least
start implementing this two weeks before
you know this is the best thing that we
were able to achieve if we are extremely
good at extracting test case we move a
little bit we switch the idea and we say
we don't implement anything until the
requirements the legal case is coming
when the real case is coming what are we
doing we are extracting the test case
implementing the functionality
normally we implement this functionality
manually
first two or three cases and then we
move this functionality into production
but this would be wonderful because we
could really lazy wait for the
requirements coming you have to trust
that you are able to arrange
functionality but and as a last
statement is where at the moment we are
addicted to this way of developing
really is incredible nobody is writing a
line of code without extracting a test
so I think it was really nice okay thank
you and we've got time for a couple of
questions
thanks then if you're using real data in
that way you see color alone it's legal
data protection issues how did you just
those sure became at the moment we are
not encrypting the data for example for
legal reason it would be enough that we
are at including the name of the policy
window
I hope that no footworks say little
these it's like a command panic a bunch
of events that take place
do you find yourself in a situation
where the events might have side effects
and then when you're trying to river the
war undo them it's then gets a bit more
complex
until now we could manage to walk to
avoid this the the events could have
side effects but we didn't a few few
months in which we will be abusing his
experiment for doing it and doing events
didn't really have a situation I rip
migratory may research how do you feel
about the kind of coverage of the gist
that you have I mean I'm thinking in
terms of tips that were kind of dealing
around the ages when things go wrong do
you have do you have customers kind of
constructing these sorts of examples for
you as well
I could imagine the examples you are
using to build your tests are positive
examples that where things work
correctly do you have some tests which
also deal with where things are going
wrong so thank you from a testing
perspective bad paths dealing around
boundary conditions in such like in
terms of thinking about what is the
coverage of the tests over the codebase
this is exactly the idea of extracting a
little space and then changing for
example test parameters to help this
this special conditions for example it's
not extracting a real test is solving
all your problems you know but help you
so much in solving the real production
problems you know and what we are
experiencing is that we deliver
functionality normally only for the
tests that we have implemented let's
assume we're the first process at least
we have to implement implement and we
open this pod this this process only for
the kind of a shape and so on that we
implement
you know and then we incremental open
you know the functionality every time we
have a new example that doesn't fit in
our structure but you are IT that you
have two peoples it's not it's not a
mechanical or you're implementing but
you're not yeah
