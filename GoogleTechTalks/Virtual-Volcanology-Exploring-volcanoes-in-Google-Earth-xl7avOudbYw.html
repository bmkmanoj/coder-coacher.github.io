Malik it's my pleasure to introduce our
speaker today john bailey is with the
University of Alaska Fairbanks and he's
done a ton of work to do outreach using
KML and Google Earth and the geosciences
and he's here to show us some of his
work so please welcome John Bailey
as Michael said I'm from the University
of Alaska Fairbanks I actually have sort
of multiple affiliations there are get
into exactly what I do and for whom in a
second but basically I'm a volcanologist
and amongst things I do is I use Google
Earth as a tool for looking at volcanoes
put quite simply the things I'm going to
show here today
I really can't claim to be all my own
work there's a whole bunch of people
involved in this and we all sort of have
our various roles ken Dean John Dean are
sort of the the faculty in charge of our
group that oversee things lavrov ray
main technicians Peter Webley is a
fellow postdoc that's done some great
work with ash plumes that we'll see
today and then Walter and William are a
little undergraduate helpers that I'm
just have skills that blow us all the
way my general role is sort of for kml
visualization understood pretending to
understand kml and if they want a pretty
picture made they usually come to me so
my background is I grew up in England
place kordell's being Buckinghamshire I
went and did my undergraduate at the
University of cancer Canterbury studying
physics and space science I basically
wanted to be an astronaut but soon came
to the realization that probably wasn't
going to happen so I decided to go for a
safer and more normal course of career
and became a volcanologist so in 1998 I
moved to a way where I did a master's in
a PhD in
well in geology geophysics but
specializing him physical Volcanology
and then as a consequence of meeting a
man at the top of volcano in Italy a few
years later I found myself in Alaska
where I am officially a postdoc with the
Alaska Volcano Observatory are very
employed by the Arctic region
supercomputing center and I also
moonlight teaching for the Geography
Department so what I'm going to do now
is just introduce the Alaska Volcano
Observatory to you introduce
specifically my group within that which
is the remote sensing group and give you
an overview of our activities as a way
of setting the context for what we're
doing well specifically with Google
Earth so the US Alaska Volcano
Observatory is a three-part
collaboration between these
organizations the geophysical Institute
at the University of Alaska in Fairbanks
the Alaska state survey which is also
based in Fairbanks and the US Geological
Survey which is based in Anchorage it
was formed in 1988 as a consequence of
the 86 eruption of Augustin but it's
real growth happened in 1989 as a
consequence of something happened during
the 1982 during the eruption of redoubt
volcano
now some some people will say well why
do you even need a volcano observatory
in Alaska you know no one lives there
okay a volcano erupts it upsets the few
bears who's worried well in 1989 a KLM
flight flying from Amsterdam into
Anchorage a 747 came 231 passengers was
was about 20 minutes outside of
Anchorage when he encountered the
fringes of an ash plume that had come
out from redoubt volcano now what the
pilot did can't be blamed but what
they're taught when they come into bad
weather or used to be taught was you
know they will throttle up and try and
get over the the
the bad weather but in this case going
through those actions meant that she
ended up ingesting large amounts of ash
into the engines ashes effectively just
silicates you combine out with the heat
of the engines you freeze them you form
a glass casing and this is what happened
to this this plane all four engines
froze in the space of about four minutes
they fell from nearly 28,000 feet to
about 13,000 feet they finally managed
to get their engines restarted they all
landed safely Anchorage everyone got
their baggage doesn't even usually
happen on most flights but but the moral
of the story there was that you know
this plane encountered an ash cloud and
a tragic event could have happened and
this whole region that we're dealing
with has about two hundred thousand
passengers and a billion dollars afraid
flying over it each year also each each
day and so you know we need to know
what's going on with the volcanoes of
which there are many now approximately
about seventy volcanoes across Alaska
and the Aleutians if you include the
hole in a North Pacific by which I mean
the Cascade Range and Conchata as well
you're looking at about a hundred
potentially active volcanoes and of
these many are monitored by ground
instruments AVL has sort of four main
areas which they they work in seismology
geodesy geology and remote sensing and
we our mission involves monitoring these
volcanoes for activity doing assessments
of potential hazards and they enjoin
states of eruption to provide
information and warnings both the public
and local state and federal authorities
and we have a very wonderful website
that's listed at the bottom there which
is a database driven dynamic website and
has brought the people responsible lots
of praise the
of how it can be used to disseminate
information during times of crisis I
sort of started to mention not all
volcanoes that are potentially active in
Alaska are monitored by instruments in
fact less than half have gone and
instrumentation on them and there's a
bunch of reasons behind this one is the
sheer logistics of it I don't know if
anyone here has been to the Aleutians
but if you look out the window today and
the the windy rainy weather that you see
this would be considered a nice day in
the Aleutians it's not a fun place to
work logistically you're it's not easy
to work the Aleutian Islands cover about
2,500 miles and so the limitations
brought by that the limitations brought
by our budget mean that we can
instrument every volcano we'd like to
also you know even with ground
instruments they don't tell us
everything at the top there you can see
a video playing on Augustine Islands
showing some of the eruptive events that
happened last year
and I'm showing this because it
highlights a couple of features which is
one that namely webcams are great and
it's good confirmation that something
starts but pretty soon after it starts
you don't get to see too much as the ash
comes down so how do we go about you
know solving this problem well we use
remote sensing and remote sensing has a
couple of advantages one it can provide
this this SIG notic view of the area
satellite images can cover everywhere we
want to look up and so we can use this
for providing confirmation of eruptions
and also for tracking certain features
and we'll be looking at those aspects in
a second we also within the remote
sensing group are not entirely limited
to satellite data if you look back here
the image at the bottom here
this thing here are the flow camera
which is a thermal infrared camera that
we own a couple of the volcano
observatory and have used on many
volcanoes but the core of what we do is
the satellite remote sensing and we have
our own receiving stations up in
Fairbanks what you're looking at here is
actually two of our buildings and their
geophysical Institute is the is the sort
of the brownish one with the big sour
dish there and this is the Arctic
research building I work in a building
behind this but at the top here we can
we can see the various antennas that we
have up there and there are three main
satellite data sources that we deal with
one is av HRR which is on the NOAA
weather satellites were effectively
misusing weather data is what it comes
down to
but these satellites collect data in
wavelengths that are very useful to us
for looking at volcanic features we also
have a modis antenna which is the big
white golf ball there that is very
similar to HR although is not as useful
because the we basically because we
don't get as many passes per day so the
similar resolution to HR both have about
a kilometer pixel resolution what makes
a V HR it so useful to us is it's a
polar orbit orbiting satellite and there
are several of them up there less in
recent months since they've started
crashing them intentionally but still we
get somewhere between 20 and 30 passes a
day we have a supplemental come feed
that comes in from a NOAA station that
sort of backs up the images we receive
and in in tradition to this we we get a
data stream of ghost data from the Naval
Research Laboratory in Monterey Bay now
this isn't quite as good the resolution
is about four kilometers per pixel in at
our latitudes but that's offset by the
fact that we get an image every half
hour so better temporal resolution and
that's good for tracking some features
down in the left here you can see our
sort of makeshift monitoring that we
have it's a well we mostly all just sort
of monitor at our own desks this is
there for show and for visiting people
but it it does does give you an idea of
some of the things that we use and in
fact we're going to zoom in and look at
some of those tools so we get these data
streams coming in and basically the
first thing we do in processing is we
divide them up into different sectors
this makes the data more manageable for
us and we have ten defined sectors six
across Alaska two across from chat car
one in the Cascades and not shown here
is Yellowstone which is right at the
edge of our station mask and the way we
look at this data is we actually use a
proprietary Linux based system which
processes the data and then provides a
visualization tool and quite frankly I
hate it it's horrible never works for me
and it's frustrated people enough that
in the last couple of years we've
started to create what we've called web
tools which are web-based applications
built and designed by us they'll allow
us to do our monitoring in a friendlier
more more user friendly environment
advantages this are pretty obvious you
know if something happens say it's two
o'clock in the morning we get a phone
call we can just roll out of bed open
our laptop and and see what's going on
and so we have these tools and I guess
the the the best place to start these
tours are what we call our data center
and what we're showing here is a list of
the images we have available within our
our data streams over HR modis and goes
actually you're not seeing any modis
right now because the antennas broke but
that's okay we've got plenty of good
data coming in with a V jar
goes there's also some other features
that we're going to discuss in a second
here but this this database one here is
telling me that someone is logged into
the database monitoring system and what
this is is a MySQL database PHP
front-end into which we enter our
observations we do this twice a day
under normal conditions more frequently
sometimes or at least we look at the
data more frequently during times of
eruption and this provides a way of
succinctly making observations and then
out putting them into a automatic
reporting system emails and such like
that can sort of rapidly disseminate
that information to the people that need
to know so what is this information I'm
talking in generalities what is this
information that we put into this
database well there are two main
features that we were seeking to find
when we're looking at our satellite data
and the first one is what we call
thermal anomalies who can spot the
thermal anomaly it's right here and so
actually if we zoom in it's it's kind of
obvious that if we look at this image
here there is a an area of white that
sort of stands out from the backgrounds
now we don't just look at the images
like this I mean that would be silly
there are tools here where we can over
like coastline and and do an adjustment
of the contrast and actually make these
things stand out a lot better I just
spend a lot of time looking at these
types of images so I can spot them
immediately but what I mean by a thermal
anomaly is some pixels of elevated
brightness temperature relative to the
surrounding area of what relevance are
these well it could be of a lot of
relevance could be of no relevance there
are many reasons behind
or that can cause a thermal anomaly one
of the most frustrating reasons is they
could be noise pixels that happens
relatively frequency although usually
with a cursory glance you can dismiss
these where they get more interesting is
when they are located near or close to
the summit of a volcano that either we
know is maybe having someone arrest from
the seismic instruments or has a history
of unrest or is even in eruption this
port here is actually the temperatures
the the summit of Augustine volcano
plotted for I think this is yeah for the
start of 2006 when it was actually
heading into a period of eruption and so
if you can look back here in early
January we've got low temperatures and
then suddenly it goes up and it stays up
and is there's some up-and-down it may
just look like a bunch of points and on
lines but this is actually very
meaningful to us in terms of activity
going on at the volcano but a context
that maybe makes more sense to you is to
look at it in this way getting back to
the pictures or actually technically
getting back to a table graphic form
this is one of our web tools that we've
developed and sort of the brainchild of
John Dean and has been put into action
by Ray and Lavrov and referred to this
as the 40 by 40 viewer reason for this
is this area here represents a 40 by 40
cut out of our imagery for the
forty-fifth pixels by 40 pixels and we
choose that because the geospatial
location of features in AVH our data
isn't that good in fact we only have a
certainty that it's it's correct within
plus or minus 20 kilometers hence we
have to use about 40 by 40 cut out
and through this online system here we
we take that image and actually turn it
into a tabular table where each of these
pixels represents effectively a color 0
to 255 and it sort of regenerates the
image but allows more than just showing
us the image me it's obvious here that
there's something anomalous here but
down here we have these interactive
buttons that compress that that
highlight features on the image and it
does this through an algorithm that's
running in the background called the
akamalik algorithm which takes these
data in and assesses a whole bunch of
parameters and tries to identify what it
thinks are genuine thermal anomalies and
in this case oak mark comes up and says
it's a genuine thermal anomaly and you
know I can tell you that is that is
correct we can see or I can look at the
metadata on the side here and see that
okay the Sun Zenith angle is over 100
which means it's a nighttime image and
the it's a nice small satellite Zenith
angle so this is a nice image we're
looking at Mount st. Helens
I know there's an active dome growing
there so it's no surprise to see a hot
spot
you'll also notice down here at the
bottom there is an option to output to
KML and I'll give an example of that
later and but at this point I should
mention that and that is the sort of the
next stage that we're going with our web
tools right now is to automatically be
able to dump them to KML and display
these things in the context of Earth
which adds a whole nother element of
what we can see
the algorithm that runs also generates
automatic alarms according to certain
protocols we have email alarms and under
certain circumstances SMS messages that
come in so there is no escape we do get
woken up in the middle of the night
quite often by noise pixels we're
working on that
so that's hotspots now the other thing
we're looking for in our imagery is ash
ash clouds I sort of went into the
reasons earlier why we worry about this
it's a huge aircraft hazard and we can
spot these things in our data sets the
method we most commonly use is something
called the split window technique and
what this is this is a brightness
differencing technique between two bands
in the 10 to 12 micron range and because
these silicates that these different
wavelengths have different emissivities
we end up with with this difference that
can be highlighted through subtracting
the the data sets and we also have a
tool similar to the 40 by 40 viewer that
can be used to look at these this is
there's nothing going on in this image
other than to show you that this isn't
an infallible technique there are a
number of limitations on it not least of
which is whether if either the the ash
cloud is covered by higher cloud or
there's generally just bad weather in
the region the weather moisture in and
weather clouds will have a similar
effect to the silicates and so we can
you know we can end up with these strong
4 minus 5 which is the what we refer to
the split-window technique for HR
because it's been 4 + - BAM 5 we end up
with strong 4 - 5
signals just due to weather also this
technique doesn't work close to the
volcano because it requires 8
listen plume obviously if the plume is
too dispersed it doesn't work either
this particular web tool we're looking
at here we refer to as the image flipper
it's a here we are actually using the
real images it's basically a fancy FTP
server where we have the ability to go
back and forth between images and pause
and animates in various ways and even
combine different data sets and again we
work off the sector system and down here
is the output to came out one of the
useful extensions of this technique that
William Ross has been doing lately is to
actually combine a series of split
window images into what we call a Nash
composite the image we're looking at
here is a whole bunch of images I think
for about two months worth of HR data
combined together to show you where the
ash was concentrated from the Augustine
2006 eruption and we could see there was
a pretty healthy dispersion this is the
Cook Inlet area here encourages up here
so it just about got up there but mainly
the the real ash concentrations were
concentrated in this area sort of across
the kodiak island and on a peninsula
here will actually show more about
Augustine in a later on in the talk and
the ash composites to have a output to
KML option in them now given these
limitations were feed the ash detection
techniques we need to have a back-up
plan and the backup plan is if you can't
directly see it modeling and so several
years ago at the University of Alaska
they developed an ash dispersion
modeling program called path path is
basically a model that takes a set
number of particles and a wind fit
vectorized wind field data
places the particles at a given and
volcano and releases them and then based
on the wind field data tracks where
these particles will go both lat/long
and altitude and as the work on pop has
developed over the year it's obvious
that it's very important to have tools
like this in combination with other
techniques the eruption of Cleveland in
2001 was a great example of this we're
down in the left here we have one of
these these composite ash images
actually in this case one goes which
showed that yeah we had we had a nice
4-5 split-window signal coming across
the Alaskan mainland here but we weren't
seeing anything down across the ocean
that's because we didn't meet that
criteria of having the right contrast of
backgrounds to to the ash cloud and so
we never actually saw a cloud that
according to path should and as far as
we know from pilot reports did exist and
so you know this emphasizes the poem
importance of having something like this
to to double up on our citations of
exactly what's going on with the
eruption Peter Webley is the person
that's been doing all the work on puff
recently and this is one of the things
he put together where it's a puff
composite where he has taken the data
for every eruption in the North Pacific
over the last 30 years and I should
qualify that slightly every eruption
that has put ash - over 20,000 feet in
the last 30 years the reason 20,000 feet
is important is because that's when we
start to get into aircraft flight routes
so that's when we really start to worry
about the effects of this and you can
see some patterns of activity here this
big cluster is from chapter where that's
where all the fun happens for okay Nizar
just going off there all the time but
there's also a healthy amount
of activity across Alaska and from Santa
Helens and you can see these these
wonderful looped around patterns that
some of the ash clouds have taken I
think it was the spur eruption you can
see actually put ash all the way across
to the eastern seaboard of the Canada so
we make all these observations and we
put them into our wonderful database and
from that database we can automatically
generate reports as you'll see this this
sort of plane looking because it hasn't
undergone the same pixelization process
that some of our ever tools have but if
at this point we go into a live version
of this we can see that this is actually
a interactive table of sorts in the the
week's observations are automatic are
generated by the database into this
table format there volcanoes that are
color coded are all listed here what I
mean by color coded is there's raised
level activity and so they there's a
well there's two systems now by which
they define the level of alert at a
volcano and so right now there is mostly
stuff going on in Russia and if we
access one if we access one of these
things we can actually draw up
information from the database now the
one I'm choosing is oak mark volcano now
this is interesting because as you saw
that oak mark is technically at green
there's in fearing nothing going on
there but I do know oak MOC volcano has
erupted in the relatively recent past in
fact this whole tool was developed in
1996 and ended up being called the oak
mob algorithm the algorithm runs behind
it but
it was first it was first used to
identify precursory activity a tock mark
in 1997 so we have this tool and we can
adjust the contrasts and it seems like
yeah maybe there is a genuine hotspot
here at least it's very faint so we can
turn on these assessments doesn't seem
to be any solo that makes sense we're a
night time image not really any cloud
around and oak mark isn't picking it up
it appears to be too sensitive but I'm
still suspicious so let's try outputting
it's a KML and hopefully this will work
there we go
so if we give that second to figure out
where it is and where it's going there
we go
and we'll fly us in and this is where we
we find the real strength of Google
Earth oh where we find it it's useful to
us we can take this we can generate our
KML we can overlay it and at this point
we can start to see where this potential
anomaly is relative to the surrounding
area
now I've never been to up mark I don't
know it too well I know it's a cold air
system has a number of vents I'm not
sure if where we're seeing the anomaly
right now is where the last activity
occurred but from Google Earth I am
learning a couple of things I'm seeing
that there's a there's a dark water body
there and okay
it doesn't exactly locate over there but
if you remember the geospatial location
errors in AVH are maybe that could be
the cause of it or maybe the cause of it
is the is something happening at one of
the vents so my approach this point is
to go into the wonderful Smithsonian
volcano layer and use that to track down
some information about oak mark about
where the last activity occurred and we
can bring that up I apologize for the
slowness it's my laptop not the system
and if we go to eruptive history
let's see what it says it says area of
activity was down cone a which is in the
southwest part of the cold air so that
maybe at this point makes me less
suspicious that something's going on but
maybe not we'll definitely be keeping an
eye on this but what this shows us is is
by combining the the visualization that
Google Earth gives us with our tools we
can sort of learn a lot more that one
would have had just staring at our plain
old image and so this is the approach we
have taken using earth and and so we've
tried to develop tools that can
integrate with it in a useful manner if
we fly to an example that should be
familiar to most Mount st. Helens Mount
st. Helens is always a a good one to
show because it's it's got the wonderful
DM there that really allows you to get
in and see different aspects about the
volcano
what we can see here is the big
horseshoe amphitheater that was created
by the eruption and here is the the new
dome that is growing and this is
something that regularly shows up in our
data as our thermal anomaly and in fact
one of the things we've done is
visualized a whole years worth of
anomalies and plotted them in their
locations and tried to define the causes
behind these different anomalies now at
st. Helens I pretty much know they're
all genuine the scatter that you see
here is a consequence of that that poor
geospatial location that goes on with a
V hor and I can say that with pretty
much full certainty because I know that
there is this hot llama lava dome on
there and if I actually go in excuse me
and look at the
look at the the effects and figures on
my different hot spots I can see that we
have a pretty bright anomaly though
about 17 degrees relative to about minus
2 backgrounds it's a nighttime image so
it's not like this is a solar effect or
some other folks anomaly that's
occurring and if we zoom out we can see
how this these anomalies look for a
year's worth of data across the Pacific
region this right now is just a static
data set I put together one of the
things we're working on is is
automatically generating these and to
have a way of through our through our
database system tagging what we think
are the various causes of knee anomalies
some other uses we put the interface -
well I was going to show this I was
hoping to show you a great comparison
between what Mount Saint Henry looks
look looks like in their brand new
high-definition webcam and the imagery
unfortunately that is the view through
the high-definition webcam there's a lot
of snow up there right now so instead
let's go to Augustine volcano as I
mentioned this volcano erupted last year
and was really a a great impetus to us
in terms of pushing the development of
these various tools on
one of the things that we almost
immediately used Google Earth or during
the Augustine crisis was the creation of
overlays that showed the the ash signal
and here I can just show sort of three
in the row which if we flick through
quickly kind of shows you what's going
on there now obviously we could do that
bit slicker by using the the time
function and that is something that we
have done right now we can output from
our various image flippers and have the
overlays
we can't output a series of them but
we're working to develop that but we
have used the time function for some
data sets at a different volcano which
is Mount Cleveland now Cleveland is a
volcano that seems to have a habit of
eruption wrapped in five or six times a
year right now they're relatively
smaller options an image that some of
you may have seen is this right here
this is a picture that was taken from
the International Space Station by one
of the astronauts up there and they
actually spotted this before we did and
they cooled down to the Operations
Center in Anchorage and said hey have
you guys got a volcano erupting and
between describing the landscape and
sort of I believe looking at maps and
maybe in Google Earth they figured out
exactly which volcano they were talking
about so this was an eruption in I think
May of last year and visualization that
we previously created was for a similar
style eruption which we do have modeled
try and get a good angle
so what we have right here is one of
these plumes modeled but we actually
created this about 18 months ago so this
isn't a Claddagh model this is in fact a
bunch of translucent polygons stuck
together and in fact right now we're
using the time primitive to animator but
when we created this the time primitive
had been released but we were still
animating it and the way we did that is
we actually had a back-end server that
allowed us to refresh the content and so
we were using that was one of our
previous claims to fame that doesn't
sound so good now now time is native to
Google Earth but we could use time in
Google Earth about six months before it
came out and the data that provided the
information for these polygons we got
out of the puff model and so at this
point we go back there a couple of puff
visualizations sort of there are the
next stages on that was our first
attempt at using puff for visualization
in Google Earth and we rapidly came to
the conclusion that that just wasn't
going to work making tens of thousands
of polygons was gonna get messy so
instead we switched to place markers and
as I say this this is Peter webley's
work this was sort of originally what we
were used for the visualization you
asked what we call Bubble path it's
effective it shows you how the plume
came out of Augustine how we got this
great kink on it the the differences at
the different elevations but this is
what we do now and this is now starting
to look more like a real volcanic plume
through using some tricks in terms of
the type of icons were using it we've
made it a lot prettier and what Peter
does is he generates automatically
three hours of puff data in kml form for
volcanoes of interests you'll see on the
list here were not just actually
including alaska volcanoes he has
contacts around the world of people that
have asked him to create these files for
their volcanoes so before we end here i
want to show you something that combines
all of these sort of techniques that
i've briefly demonstrated together into
a useful format this was a video i put
together for a conference this summer
and the idea here was to try and show
how google earth can be used to tell any
instructive story in a format that is
sort of user friendly to you know be
other scientists or the general public
and i apologize that the the DVI version
of this doesn't seem to output to the
screen so also the avi version so and so
it comes up we're going to play this for
youtube
we'll get there
so just as a brief background Augustine
volcano is a volcano about 350 miles
from Anchorage in the Cook Inlet it's
actually a small island unto itself the
I believe the lease of the islands is
actually held by the University it has a
fairly rich history of erupting over the
last century alright so here we go
myself as the beginning really of an
exploration that's a reason we're
exploring you don't know what to run
into an expiration what this guy looks
like what the stars look like this belt
winkler are they a steady light when you
get outside the atmosphere
so we basically summarized one year of
activity in about a minute and a half
there but hopefully it gave you a brief
overview of sort of things that we can
do using this tool and so that's pretty
much what I had to say today many of
these datasets we do have online on this
site up here but rather than giving you
the URL of that what I'm going to do is
just announce that I'll be combining my
various data projects and things that I
work on in regards to KML and Google
Earth into one easy to remember URL and
just the show and prove that I do live
pretty much at the end of the world
thank you
to make your work easier for me
so the question was if I could add one
thing to Google Earth to make my life
easier what would it be well that's an
interesting question I guess my answer
has actually changed in recent months
one or one of the things that was high
on my wish list until recently was the
ability to add videos and sort of rich
contents into balloons and that of
course has now been done we have we have
a lot of great images and videos and
things internal to the volcano
observatory which which could really
benefit from being displayed in that
format or being at least being made
accessible in that format so I think
right now if I'm specifically talking
about Google Earth as opposed to KML my
my main wish would to be able to do more
in terms of how you combine different
files together and what I mean by that
is for that video we had to effectively
record little snippets and stitch them
all together what I'd like to be able to
do is everything you saw there in some
sort of scriptable form along a related
format
I guess the ability to structure your
files on the the left-hand sidebar would
be nicer you know those two things may
sound apart but not necessarily I mean a
few if you think about how the tour
function works right now it goes through
a list of files so so for me personally
though those would be two things that
would really advance what I could do
with the with the tools that we have
right now and the tools that we are
developing
how they played with the 3d mouse yes I
have and that she forgot to bring mine
today but we actually you may be
familiar we just ran a session last week
at a GU where we highlighted the use of
virtual Globes and in in the sciences
obviously Google Earth and use thereof
was highly featured and uh and one of
our speakers who came was was from fede
connection and she sort of showed people
that maybe Hannity being introduced to
the mouths you know what it could do she
also passed around an example mouse that
someone made off with at the end of the
talk which I just thought was wrong but
I don't know I guess some people exactly
that what the daresay the question was
what cooperation do we have with the
Russian government in regards to
Conchata I guess the short answer to
that is it depends how they're feeling
that day the truth is that there is a
great bunch of people that work at
covert which is the come check and
Volcanology I forget what it stands for
but basically their volcano observatory
who are chronically underfunded and you
know they do a great job given the
resources they have
we have people that offici liaise with
them and therefore through them with the
Russian authorities our primary interest
in in the Russian in Russian volcanoes
from track of volcanoes is not so much
what goes on on the ground we do have
various research projects with various
members of the Observatory involved in
but from our perspective it's what comes
out there volcanoes because the general
tendency of the winds in that region is
to blow to the east so pretty much
anything that comes out there volcanoes
ends up over Alaska and it's our problem
so there's a lot of communication that
goes on between us between caver
between the the Weather Service who is
chow in you know it's there's sort of
the rough definition of between who's in
charge in terms of monitoring and
tracking is that when the volcano is in
states of unrest and the plume is still
attached to it that's our turf as soon
as it's a separate cloud that's when the
Weather Service likes to take over but
we don't all act individually there's a
lot of talking and cooperation that goes
on there there could be more and we're
working on that but you know I guess you
could argue to date we've done a good
job because no accidents have happened
is our life easier in winter in regards
to seeing hotspots well I I thought you
were just asking the first half of that
question I believe is about 20 minus 20
at home right now so yes is the short
answer much easier because of the
thermal contrasts because there's more
darkness you know the inverse of that in
the summer is we have very little
darkness and it's a nightmare so the
reflection everywhere there are a few
caveats to that in winter one of which
is that geothermal lakes or even just
you know naturally heated lakes can
start showing up as fake well as
anomalous of events and so we have to be
aware of those features and as I said
there's you know over 100 volcanoes in
the area we're looking up hence the
utility of overlaying these things in
Google Earth and flying in and actually
looking at the landscape because it
might be that we see a potential thermal
anomaly volcano we've never viewed but
if we view in and in Google Earth we can
see our there's a big like there that
explains the thermal anomaly not 100%
but most likely that is the cause
yes
for the thermal anomalies we're looking
at the basically what what is channel
aside the question was we're using two
thermal bands to look at ash clouds and
anomalies maybe and if we use more bands
would it help us weed out the false
alerts for the ash clouds we use bands
in the 10 to 12 micron range and the the
key thing there is that the the of those
different wavelengths the emissivities
of the silicates show up definitely
so when under the right circumstances
that technique is very good where that
technique falls down is where the plume
is not translucent and all its too
dispersed or there's bad weather
covering it you know that's just at that
point we need to maybe move to the
visible bands and things to try and
identify plumes we also don't just rely
on you know colored pixels we also look
at morphologies because as pollutants
have a more distinctive morphology than
the most weather clouds in terms of the
thermal anomalies are areas of interest
arrow into the the 3 to 5 micron range
or what is in the AVH are channel 3 now
one of the reasons that and the reason
for that is that's where hot stuff hot
lava shows up now for the AVH are data
that can be frustrating because they on
a couple of the NOAA satellites they
actually built a 3a and a 3b sensors and
what that means for us is for some of
the passes we don't actually get any
channel 3 data because they they said I
believe they set different gains and
they were targeted towards daytime
observations so we we effectively miss
out on a whole suite of data that could
be useful in terms of weeding out the
the faked events that is hard to do with
the algorithm that I am
that runs things behind the scenes
through looking at a year's worth of
data it's about 70% accurate you're
never going to be able to eliminate all
noise from the signal from the signal
and so a noise really accounts for about
20% of the inaccuracy so though there
are very few other events that are sort
of fake anomalies that we can kick out
we could raise our thresholds but we we
have to trade that off we have to trade
off raising the threshold to being
certain that we catch all the genuine
volcanic events and and there are some
things that there are genuine anomalies
that the we but we're not interested in
for example forest fires we see them and
in some circumstances of the forest
fires and a volcanic slope it may look
like a genuine thermal anomaly</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
